              <p>I support to your switch to TD but start off as a relief would be better choice, as least you do not have a burden of looking for a relief being a hirer. OMO is no joke.</p>
              <p>Since you are also on the road everyday, street wise shouldn't be a problem. You may treat the income from cashless payment as your saving/CPF, you'll be surprise how much pax uses cashless payment monthly. </p>
              <p>If things really dun workout as TD, you can still revert to your skilled job on delivery.</p>

              In working, employers contribute 16% of your monthly paid into CPF, you contribute 20%, altogether 36% into yr CPF account, meaning if you are earning 1000, $360 will go into yr CPF which is then distributed into SA and MS. 
              
              In Taxi Driving, you contribute 100% of the rental to the Taxi companies for them to distribute and paid their staffs, technician, mechanics, security guards, DRO and pple like me seating here TCSS with coffee anytime... our CPF.
              
              So, simply speaking, working, boss paid for yr CPF + you yourself
              In Taxi driving, you paid CPF for others

              If you like playing game type, go PSA and train as crane driver, monthly chao chao 6k net intake, you operate at height with two joystick to control the lifting, loading and unloading of containers. 
              
              Usually for Singapore PSA, which is the best in the world beside Port Rotterham at holland who use to be nos 1 or nos 2 for europe containers, ship berthing only can last 24hrs, we are the best clearance port in the world, so all these crane operators will challenge each to other the faster to finish, like playing game...but must be serious, no joke, dead serious work.
              
              If u want to drive taxis and hope for the best, then maybe you hv to work long hours, eat and sleep and even PCC inside taxi, how to do it, you go ask keepthechange, formerly, his taxis was his second home.
