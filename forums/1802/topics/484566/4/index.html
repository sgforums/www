              TS is asking solely on income of delivery job vs TD... Strictly on
              income ... no comparison. sick ... own self pay for medical fees
              How many times per month one can get sick ? In the end, the extra
              income from TD can accommodate all the extra financial benefits of
              a delivery man ... as in overtime, annual salary increment, medical
              fees. No cpf ... used the additional income from TD to pay to
              cpf... If one is getting 2K plus as delivery man ... then perhaps
              you can think twice about becoming a TD. Another option is to work
              as delivery man and drive taxi in weekends to complement your
              income. who says TD no benefits ... can get free entry to zoo, bird
              park etc...;p</p>

              Same like taxi driving, the incentives, the days off, the benefit given form a addition intangible income that a taxi driver can see it before deciding to join the company.
              
              If TS current job have a potential to get promoted or able to curve out a progression in his career future, he should rethink and reposition himself before deciding to be a TD, it is no harm of course to work and at the same time, drive as weekend partimer, if time allow him to do so.
              
              Of course in life, people will say, do what you feel happy about it, that is true, as long as you are happy in what you want to do or are doing it, that is uptmost important of all, but you got to truly ask yourself, are you happy as a Taxi driving in comparing to working life?
              
              There is a worry trend today that many youngs in their 30s are taking up Taxi driving out of sheer temporary happiness, and by 40s, they lost that morale and happiness altogether. And at that age, to crawl back into the working society again, is quite an uphill task. 
              
              So, the contend here is to tell young newbies that going into taxi driving is ok, but if you can find or have a good current job, better to stick with it, can alway be partime drivers

              Stress level will even out as time goes by, whatever is new, there will be stress, new cabby, new security officer, new recruit and so on, but as times goes by, it will eventually even out the stress, like when u first start driving taxis...ask this and that, worry this and that, scare this and that..like many stress going on at one time, now...knn, simi stress? here no pax, go there Q lor..smlj roads also familar liao.

              And then there are good and bad stress, so it is up to individual to take the stress level, as some highly paid are also enjoying their stress, it is all a matter of managing it.
                  
              It is all up to individual mentality, our brain alway think before action, so it is more of a matter on how you think...to be or not to be, to drive or not to drive, to throw or not to throw key, and then u hv to look at your own situation, do I need to drive taxis to survive or be better, or that why the pasture on the other side alway look greener

              How much saving..you talking about a million or one hundred thousands or a few hundreds in bank?.. there are millionaire driving mercs cab as their car, better than buying an expensive merc and still need high cost to maintain it.
              
              If cabs today got BMW 5 to 7 series or audi A5 to A8, I think alot will be taking taxi licence courses..

              <p>What I mean is a healthy level of saving in the bank, even just 2-3k, also good enough.....</p>
              <p>I don't deny there's TD who have 6 figure in their bank (I personally seen before), 7 figure haven't met before, maybe bowah can introduce me, but to me, is rubbish, the rental we are paying is definitely higher than the depreciation of a private car.....</p>

              <p>Taxi is an easy entry to have a transport</p>
              <p>Just 1k to 2k deposit, you get a car at your disposal</p>
              <p>Can make some money to cover the renting cost somemore.........</p>

              <p>All these are old school liao lar, </p>
              <p>Today, you want a car at your disposal and yet don't want the commitment of a car owner, there are many option like car renting or car sharing</p>
              <p>renting a Taxi is no longer a economic sources</p>
              <p>and with the Taxi Sign on top, there are loads of responsibilities to the public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me, the most common character found in a TD is ego and self esteem.</p>
              <p>They knows they are at a low level job, but they convince themselves they are making an honest living.</p>
              <p>They show people their little saving, tell people they drive for fun lar, hoping to bring in a little glamorous to their life.</p>
              <p>They wants others to Listen to them, to worship them..... but yet they got nothing to give, instead they want to take from you</p>
              <p>why eat full still buy pau, because they knows they going to get hungry very fast. and with that little saving they have, they got to drive and make money</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i never f care to those trying to outshine by telling me he is "rich", it is not how much you have, it is how you you have to GIVE</p>

              Ego and self esteem is good in way, because that is human nature and given, it can enact as a motivation factor too, but of course overly egostic and self esteem until steam n dry, then no so good lah.
              
              Typically speaking, yes, there are high egos and self esteem TDs' trade, but there are also many others in all other trades, and for that matter, no one beat Indian expatriates' egos and self esteem in Singapore.
              
              Typically speaking, everyone have the right to their egos and self esteem, but if we can manipulate their high ego and self esteem into our advantage, that will be perfect, and frankly, I am very good at that...inorder to make a decent living.

              <p>ego and self esteem is still healthy when combine with some good personality like generous, confident or even self concious</p>
