              dun have to think too much.
              
              salary now $1600.
              after employer contribution, you get $1856.
              take home pay = $1280
              cpf contribution = $576
              
              if you drive taxi , lets say for example $3000 
              just be discipline enough to put aside $576 into cpf
              your take hom pay is $2424...
              pay higher than your delivery job
              but to earn 3k you have to drive 7 days a week.

              another kuku reply from you.
              of course 2 shifts easier to reach target but you need to pay double the rental.
              and also drives longer...
              
              For beginners, test water using 1 shift first and be a relief.

              <p>otherwise unless u really drive to past time, make $50-$100 close shop.</p>
              <p>i know of such people. They can't partner with relief, like OTOT. Car always drive on busy mode. Morning peak drive for cost. Night for profit. 1000hrs - 1700hrs, lobo time</p>

              Earning in TD fluctuate differently, today u may earn net $100, tomorrow can be $120 and so on..other day, you might throw rental or not feeling well, then lost some income.
              
              To work or to drive taxis is up to individual to decide, working got their own benefit beside lower income than taxi driving, the likes of medical, leaves, bonuses, overtime, promotion, training, employer's CPF contribution and so on. It also allow one to have more time with family and other social life.
              
              Taxi driving, most of us know the main feeling is freedom, own time own target, no boss, no strict timing and discipline protocol to follow, so if one likes to be on his own, freedom to roam and with no pressure from the top, then Taxi driving is good.
              
              In life, all these are opportunities given to us, it is therefore, your decision in life to make the decision and take the opportunites you think suit your way of living and behavorial, and that no matter which one you choose, you have to work and stress it out.

              TS is asking solely on income of delivery job vs TD...
              Strictly on income ... no comparison.
              sick ... own self pay for medical fees
              How many times per month one can get sick ?
              In the end, the extra income from TD can accommodate all the extra financial benefits of a delivery man ... as in overtime, annual salary increment, medical fees.
              No cpf ... used the additional income from TD to pay to cpf...
              If one is getting 2K plus as delivery man ... then perhaps you can think twice about becoming a TD. 
              Another option is to work as delivery man and drive taxi in weekends to complement your income. 
              
              who says TD no benefits ... can get free entry to zoo, bird park etc...;p
