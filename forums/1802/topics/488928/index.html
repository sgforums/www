              <p>They loiter around tourist spots and arrival halls, striking up 
              conversations with small groups of tourists before offering to help them
               beat the long queues at taxi stands.</p>
              <p>After agreeing on a fee, they usher the tourists to minibuses waiting
               nearby, but away from public view. Charges range between $40 and $70 to
               transport groups as large as 13 people.</p>
              <p>For more than a decade, bus touts have been operating discreetly at 
              the entrances to attractions, such as the Singapore Flyer, Jurong Bird 
              Park, Singapore Zoo and Sentosa, as well as the arrival halls of Changi 
              Airport and ferry terminals like the Singapore Cruise Centre at 
              HarbourFront.</p>

              </div>
              <p>But in recent years, there has been a proliferation of such illegal 
              bus services, as drivers have found this to be a more flexible and 
              lucrative alternative to driving a taxi.</p>
              <p>They have even organised themselves into small groups, relying on 
              walkie-talkies and WhatsApp group chats to tip one another off when the 
              authorities are near.</p>
              <p>"These bus touts are getting bolder," said Mr V. Anilan, managing 
              director of local operator Bus Hub, which provides scheduled bus 
              services to and from attractions such as the zoo and Sentosa. "They are 
              stealing our business and have made it a free-for-all situation."</p>
              <p>However, bus drivers will soon be governed by anti-touting laws. 
              Starting on Thursday, bus drivers caught touting their transport 
              services can face a fine of up to $1,000 or a jail term of up to three 
              months. This new Land Transport Authority regulation applies to holders 
              of the Bus Driver's Vocational Licence, a requirement for those who 
              drive private buses.</p>
              <p>"Even before this, bus drivers were told it was illegal to tout when 
              they got their vocational licences," said Woodlands Transport general 
              manager Roger Wong. He believes only a small group of bus drivers is 
              breaking the rules, adding: "The touts tend to be drivers of smaller 
              buses as they are easier to fill. It is more difficult to tout for 
              passengers to fill a larger bus."</p>
              <p>When The Sunday Times visited HarbourFront Centre, a shopping mall 
              next to the Singapore Cruise Centre, last Tuesday evening, six 
              middle-aged men, several decked out in neatly pressed shirts and 
              trousers, were seen touting near a taxi stand, where a long queue of 
              about 80 people had formed.</p>
              <p>They took turns to keep a lookout for the authorities. One of the men
               was overheard asking two British tourists: "Do you need transport? You 
              don't have to wait at the taxi stand. You can follow me."</p>
              <p>After agreeing on a fee, the two tourists were told to wait at a spot
               50m to the left of the taxi stand, out of view of the security guards.</p>
              <p>"The queue is just too long," said Mr Dan Smith, one of the tourists, adding that he did not know touting is illegal here.</p>
              <p>Five minutes later, a 10-seater minibus pulled up by the kerb and picked up the tourists with their luggage.</p>
              <p>Over at the zoo, there were no signs of touting when The Sunday Times
               visited last Wednesday, given ongoing efforts to clamp down on the 
              activity.</p>
              <p>Since Dec 20, three of Bus Hub's staff, together with security 
              personnel from Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS), have been taking turns
               to conduct regular checks around the bus parks there. Signs have also 
              been put up by WRS to discourage tourists from using services provided 
              by bus touts.</p>
              <p>"If there are any private minibuses loitering in the area, we will be
               informed," said Bus Hub's Mr Anilan, adding that the area used to see 
              three to five bus touts daily. "The touts haven't shown up since."</p>
              <p>One tout, who would not reveal his name, said that with rising rental
               and petrol costs, they have no choice but to solicit for customers.</p>
              <p>According to him, many bus touts are former MaxiCab drivers who have 
              switched to driving private excursion buses. The cost of driving a 
              seven-seater MaxiCab is on the rise, with drivers paying $163 per day 
              for rental, up from $110 five years ago. The rental cost of a regular 
              taxi ranges from $110 to $130, from about $80 to $100 five years back.</p>
              <p>A minibus, on the other hand, costs between $60 and $70 daily.</p>
              <p>The 50-year-old, who has been in the business for the past three 
              years, said bus touts can earn between $50 and $65 per trip, and they 
              can make up to seven trips on a good day. "Most tourists don't really 
              care whether the transport they are taking is illegal or not, so long as
               they can get to their destinations," he said. "When there is a demand 
              for such services, there will be a supply. It will not be easy to stop 
              bus drivers from touting."</p>
