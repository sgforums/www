Her credit card company, ABN AMRO, has just tied up with taxi company, ComfortDelGro, to scrap the 10 percent administrative fee that customers have to shell out when they use their credit cards to pay the taxi fees.<br><br>Ms Lee says it is an ideal option unless she is rushing for time as that would mean she has to spend extra minutes waiting for the transaction to be processed and to sign on the charge slip.<br><br>ABN AMRO wants to increase its credit card business by grabbing a slice of a market estimated to have grown 30 percent a year for ComfortDelGro for the past 10 years.<br><br>The business is said to be worth S$35 million last year.<br><br>Pamela Tan, Head, Consumer Finance, Consumer Client Segment, ABN AMRO, says: "With the partnership with ComfortDelGro, we will be able to bring in another 20,000 new customers. I believe we are projecting a minimum of 20 percent incremental in terms of revenue this year."<br><br>But the market potential is bigger. Credit card Mastercard says payment for transportation currently represents a small proportion of money spent on its card. The company adds that this means cards have a huge opportunity to expand because two years ago, Singaporean consumers spent S$14 billion on transport.<br><br>And banks are not just working with taxi companies.<br><br>Train operator SMRT wants to get more people onboard its trains and taxis by working with Citibank.<br><br>They have introduced a Citibank EZ-Link card which offers cashless payment for SMRT train and bus rides.<br><br>In turn, the bank gets access to strategic location of train stations where it plans to build 10 branches in places like Ang Mo Kio, Tampines and Jurong.<br><br>Chan Sow Han, Marketing Director, Citibank Singapore, says: "SMRT has the largest network of train stations and these stations are spread throughout all the 51 stations. This gives us natural access to the commuters out there."<br><br>Teo Chew Hoon, Vice-President, Commercial Business, SMRT Investments predicts the venture will help generate at least 20 percent of revenue for SMRT.<br><br>The train operator hopes the partnership will also help to boost the falling number of public transport users.<br><br>Ms Teo says: "The convenience, as well as the added value, would encourage the public to use public transport."<br><br>Predictions show this market is going to expand, with benefits for both businesses and savvy credit and debit card users.
