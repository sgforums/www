That will be much better," said one cab driver.<br><br>Another cab driver said: "We need more passengers. Making the price go up is of no use."<br><br>"It's going to be a little extra burden for a lot of commuters," said a passenger.<br><br>Speaking to reporters at an international conference, Transport Minister Raymond Lim says any taxi fare revisions must correspond with an improvement in service standards.<br><br>"The taxi industry is deregulated, the market sets the fare. They think it commensurate with their competitive position. So it's basically something which taxi operators in Singapore will determine. It's not something which the Transport Ministry mandates or directs," said Transport Minister Raymond Lim.<br><br>"But from our point of view, whatever fare adjustments they make, we think there should be a commensurate improvement of maintenance of service standards," he added.<br><br>But commuters and taxi drivers generally feel service standards should be improved, regardless of a fare revision.<br><br>"Whether the taxi fare is going to be increased or not, the service has to improve. So cannot just because of money, you improve your service. That's bad," said one commuter.<br><br>"Even if they don't increase the fare, we have to supply and provide good service," agreed a cab driver.<br><br>Taxi fares have been deregulated since 1998, so no approval is needed from the PTC for any taxi fare revisions.<br><br>Aside from ComfortDelGro, no other operators have informed the PTC about plans to revise their fares.<br><br>In a written reply to Channel NewsAsia, the second largest taxi operator SMRT Taxis says it will "monitor and study the changes to the fare structure by any operator and make adjustments where applicable."<br><br>- CNA /ls</div>

Where they may differ, and they may try to differentiate themselves, is on some of the other details, the timing of peak periods, especially when it comes to booking, because then people can make an active decision about which company they will choose."<br><br>Dr Barter added that in a competitive taxi industry, most of the cab companies are expected to be operating efficiently and they do not have many options when it comes to cost cutting.<br><br>So they turn to fare adjustments to defray operating cost.<br><br>There is one other way to keep cost down but that would require some policy changes.<br><br>Dr Paul Barter said: "There may be a public policy case that could be made - that taxis are a special type of car and they should not be necessarily lumped in with the Category A cars as they currently are for the purpose of taxes like additional registration fee or here in Singapore, we have the vehicle quota which means people have to buy an extra certificate of entitlement."<br><br>For SMART Cab, it says it will observe market reaction and consult its drivers.<br><br>But it is likely to follow suit.<br><br>The other player, Trans-Cab, did not respond to Channel NewsAsia's queries.<br><br>Trans-Cab operates 1,642 taxis while SMART Cab has 655 taxis. - CNA/ir</div>

But instead, some of them pressed a different button that shuts the meter down.<br><br>Over-the-air recalibration started on June 26. On July 4, the company sent notification to 300 cabbies with meters that had failed to recalibrate, asking them to go to Turf City on July 7 for manual adjustment.<br><br>But 100 did not turn up. Among them was 57-year old Tony Pang.<br><br>"I found out only around 7.30am on Monday, after my first passenger," he said. During the morning peak period, he had five customers.<br><br>If the other 99 cabbies had the same number of peak-hour rides, their total lost income would have amounted to nearly $700 ($1 rise in peak-hour surcharge, 10-cent rise in flagdown fare and an average 25-cent rise in distance charges).<br><br>Althought not a large amount, Mr Pang was puzzled why it happened in the first place and why the company did not try harder to contact affected drivers.<br><br>ComfortDelGro said it called them on July 7, but the 100 drivers still did not respond.<br><br>Mr Pang said: "Do you think drivers will ignore something that affects their rice bowl?"<br><br>The affected drivers eventually had their meters fixed on Monday.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(Article can be found in the Home Section, Page H3 of today's Straits Times)</span></div>
