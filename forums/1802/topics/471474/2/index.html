              <p>Education is important becos it impart knowledge, no doubt about it, but how you educate or get educated is a different stories.</p>
              <p>Just quote you a country that produce milk, cheese, football and many other products of great need in the world, yet it is alway a slow and steady pace country, the land of windmill technology, Holland.</p>
              <p>During my sailing years, I visited Holland, the education system for a child start from 8 to 14, they go thru basic education with no examination and ranking, failure is a norm, in it, they can play and learn all these years, at the end of 14 yo grade, they are then ask what they actually like, from here, they are then place on what they like and what was advice on them.</p>
              <p>Let say a boy said he wants to be a banker because he like to play as a banker, so he become one, learn the trade, muster them in math, accounting, international banking system and so on. He is not going to learn more about science or history or languages which take away his time and effort, and not long, he become a banker, a professional, a specialist in banking, and anytime, a top FT in any country that employ him.</p>
              <p>Ours education..u should know better. Stress, position and grade focus is not going to make a talent, and that is why, we are short of talents, so to speak by our govt, but the root of it, they ignored it and just get FTs to settle the problem</p>

              <p><br>Talking about housing ar?? I damn fedup.</p>
              <p>How can govt put HDB, an essential housing for the citizens at the same level as open market force?? The prices is the highest increment in Singapore that set all cost of goods to go up and thereby set high inflation rate more than what was stated.</p>
              <p>It had become a situation whereby even a young graduate cannot even afford to buy it without a few years of saving, not to mention those bread and butter man like us, who, pathetically are struggling day by day to put off the load and installment.</p>
              <p>If the blacks are the former slave for america with whip and food, we are now technically, the modern slave of singapore,  hunger for $$ to pay off high debts to a govt that created an intense no money, no talk society.</p>
              <p>And that is why when we open our eyes only, we think of how to make $$ to survive, how to put better food on the table for our family and for a mere TD, how to cut lane, how to interview, how to Q, where to pick, or how to control a radio station and so on.</p>
