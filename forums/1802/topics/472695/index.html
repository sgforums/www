              <p>Talent is a very individualistic concept, how we define talent is different from one another, some just base on education, some just base on skill, and most will base on can do and can deliver concept. Like I bring my car for repair, I dun care how many years experiences is the mechanic, nor what education he holds, as long as my car is repaired, tested and drive with no problem, I can rightly said, he is a talent, I will go back to him and also recommend frens.</p>
              <p>Singapore ruling party had lost much of it humanity in ruling, they are much more profit driven than citizen drivern.</p>
              <p>To generate more profit, more tax, more buyers of houses, more Gst and business, the only way in a resouceless nation is invest on peoples, with more peoples, profit increase from all levels. And in a long run of chasing for profit, our govt might had lost its way of governing a nation, more of a corporation than a nation.</p>
              <p>As such, they die die must get the peoples in, if out of 10 beggars and can get 1 talent, they do not mind. But slowly, they also eroding the culture and values of this nation which most of us cherished as we are true blue Singaporeans. And with no value in it, your identity is lost, your direction is vague and your future might not be so pink as thot.</p>
              <p> It will come to an extend that to identify a foreigner, just said KNNCCB to them, and you get no reaction from them, more funnier will be, they might said thank you to you.</p>

              <p>Actually we cannot blame them. If you in their shoes, you would do the same right? I have taken cabs with Chinese and Indian nationals, also a HK once. They are of course citizens. New citizens, but still citizens what. The fault lies with those that gave them the citizenship.</p>
              <p>But so far this is a small problem at the moment for the taxi industry. The bigger problem is for lower scale workers, who are losing jobs to them. That one must be solved first. As if you guys didn't know, taxi drivers since when became a priority?</p>

              <p>Even you talk about HDB, thru the years, I seem to notice that Govt is pushing the citizens to live further away from the city, places like punggol, yishun end, sembawang, woodland, Jurong side..and the city are now becoming more reserve for rich foreigners who can paid the 20% stamp duty and all the upfront without a blink of an eyes.</p>
              <p>So, dun we as citizens have a say on this?? why are we deprive of good location in our own land?</p>
              <p>In ancient china, the emperor will kick those who he dun like out of the city wall, and this is exactly what is going to happen or already happening</p>
