              I think the transportation market is slowly getting use to apps ride and taxis system, so are most TDs, we are more or less getting use to these apps ride taking away part of our job, but frankly, taxi driving is still a viable market.
              
              Discount and promotion are short term basis of attracting so as to enhance the base number, but on the other hands, drivers might suffer at the expense of all these discount, and in long term, when the discount and promo subsided or become unable to sustain, or that drivers start to give up in huge numbers, then the cost will fall back on paxs again.

              <p>however it seems the damage is done on the taxi trade.</p>
              <p>those commuters that are tech savvy, have gone to choose the cheapest and convnient ride</p>
              <p>Taxis can ply POI and places private pick up can't do and join the the queue</p>

              Grab taxis is available, it is not an option, but rather a tool. 
              
              Like you want to fix a light on yr ceiling, you need tool like drill, screws, screw drivers, hammer...and so on. You place them in yr toolbox and get to work, but there are essential tools that is a must..like the drill and screws, without it, fix nothing.
              
              So in taxi driving, MDT is an essential tool, cab meter is an essential tool and the cab itself is also an essential tool, and in the public, sometime lanjiao paxs also take you as a tool rather than a human. 
              
              As for Grabtaxis, it is a tool too, but not essential, but as long as it is a tool, you would mind bring it along, you might need it...however, the more tool you bring, the more heavier and congested is your tool box.
              
              Have you seen people with 5 hps on their cab??

              Yes, the word "relief" already tell you to relax and definitely better than a hirer unless you really need a car.
