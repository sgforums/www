              <p><br>I failed section 2 and section 5.<br><br>Section 2: Routes and Landmark<br>Section 5: Name &amp; Location of Buildings<br><br>Seriously and honestly, I put in alot of effort studying and I only got 1 incorrect mistake but I failed. Just failed by 1 mark only. Each time also like that. Horrible!<br><br>By the way, not only did I failed, alot of other people failed too. None of them managed to pass by 1 single attempt. Those in the morning came back in the afternoon. Failed same section with me. 2 and 5. An uncle failed section 5 3 times and paid $45 in total.<br><br>2 of my friends I got to know from Excursion failed Section 2. Another one failed Section 2, 3 and 5. So I think I didn't do so badly after all.<br><br>The questions are still lingering in my head, questions like:<br><br>- Which Road is Israel Embassy located at?<br>- Where is Norwegian Embassy?<br>Many many questions about Embassy until I crazy....<br>I studied about Embassy in Napier Road, The British Council, <br>- Embassies at Nassim Road, Japan, Turkey, Phillipines, Russian and Saudi Arabia<br>- Embassies at Orchard Road, Peru, Netherlands, Germany Thai and New Zealand High Comm<br><br>Also did ask about which road is Canossian School for the Hearing Impaired (This is not mentioned during Excursion)<br><br>Suddenly asked about Hotel Windsor also which I got it right cos I always take bus 62 and knew it is located at Macpherson but not many of the other candidates knew about this. Sijori Resort, alot of them got it wrong as well. Garden Hotel too, at Balmoral Road confused many of us.<br><br>Got this question, "Where is Villa Delle Rose located?" also for "Astrid Meadows" and many more...</p>

              <p>I got study hard too CM840_2009, I can't accept failure in myself as I'm a perfectionist. I passed my Basic Theory 1st attempt, passed my Final Theory 1st attempt, TP 1st attempt and when my online taxi course, I passed all 1st attempt. I should say, the online quiz really doesn't help at all! Must study the book! WTF sia??!!!<br><br>But I won't give up, will carry on taking it. My exam started 9am, end up I retake my exam so many times till 5pm... so malu~~~</p>

              <p>Haha bro CM840_2009, I did study on the Embassies, but I did not study ALL of it. I only study those normal ones at Tanglin, Orchard, Nassim, Napier, Chatsworth etc. Did pay attention to even Poland Embassy which appear on and off... Horrible sia..<br><br>I learnt my mistake... Next test date still unknown. The little girl Ah Lee San told me that I will need to walk-in to go sit for my test and it's base on how fast the test candidates took their test lay. If those pre-scheduled candidates take too long, then I got to wait long long lor.... zzzzzzz<br><br>So far retook 2 times Section 2 and 5.<br><br>Failed by 1 mistake 22/30, 40/50. Passing is 23/30, 41/50. :S</p>

              <p>Hmmm, u're right bro Pool, I would say that it's 5 or less questions but these 5 are critical also. 3 wrong = contributed 10% of the failure rate + 3 from here and there, then + another 2 = 8 wrong = contributed to my 8 wrong answers which resulted in 22/30 which is a failure and need to resit for my exam again.<br><br>So far I've seen some many people took also failed these 2 sections. Someone did pass by chance of "guessing" but then failed at Rules and Regulations, so suay sia!!! I did so well for Rules and Regulations, 50 questions!</p>

              <p>Share with you Axel, i just passed my TVDL this morning.  Excel in every sections except section passed by 1 question.  I found out that i've to develop a strategy 2 days ago on how to study routing which is my weakest.</p>
              <p>I cannot study by hard or rote learning with memorising. So i study the fundamentals like the flow of traffic in certain areas i am unfamiliar. </p>
              <p>Eg: paya lebar connect up north to Upper paya lebar. Rochor connect to Rochor canal and is a one way traffic.  If the alternative answer is Rochor rd-sungei rd- bukit timah rd..</p>
              <p>Then it is wrong -  you have to eliminate errors and narrow down to only one choice.</p>
              <p>I celebrate today.</p>
              <p>Hope you are doing well with your retest.</p>

              <p>This morning, many failed their section 2 and 5... my section 2 is borderline and thanks to my realization of where is my weak point in this section. </p>
              <p>My weak point is to understand the logic flow of traffic. Certain road is one way and this is part of the tricks in multiple choice.  Also spelling error like Anderson or Henderson, misleading names like Paya lebar Road and Paya Lebar Way.....</p>
              <p>Haa.haa.. if you study by memorizing -- then you cannot outsmart LTA... they design the roads and maps.....they can change the standard 3 choices to another 3 sets of alternative answers.....so if you memorize the former standard 3 choices...then wantang liao...</p>
