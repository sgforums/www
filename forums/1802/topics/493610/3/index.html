              Wrong, the objectives is remove the age limit and replacing the old drivers, 
              
              During my general meeting with NTA, LTA, WDA, EDB and many other govt institution and of cos, taxi companies CEOs, the govt produced a trend of dwindling and aging taxi driving in our ever increasing population.
              
              If age is to remain at 30years to qualify to drive taxi, and that only Singaporean can drive, in 10 years times, we will see taxis driver retired more and more, with no youngs taking up taxi driving, it will be a huge problem for the govt, as taxis is an essential transport as it is classified as Public Transport.
              
              Therefore, the decision to invest in Grab and Uber by our Govt is critical to bring back a corhort of young drivers who prefer pte car than driving a taxis, and as young as 21 or 23yo, you can drive, that will make up for the shortage, as many, by the time they reach 30yo, might have find another stable job.
              
              So, it is not so simple as you think, you need deep thinking and a holistic approach to understand why UG is allow to do almost whatever they like, why they allow so young driver, why got so many new rental cars at low prices...why still got incentives, there are reason for everything, not just by what you see at face value.

              <p style='margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Following approval granted by the authorities last week, five taxi operators — SMRT Taxis, Prime Taxi, Premier Taxis, Trans-Cab and HDT Singapore Taxi — will implement dynamic pricing from next Wednesday for trips booked through the Grab mobile application, under a collaboration between the operators and the ride-hailing company.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>The new JustGrab service will be trialled from today among Grab employees and commuters on its rewards programme, using cabs from SMRT Taxis, Trans-Cab, HDT Singapore Taxi, as well as private-hire cars.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Announcing the roll-out date yesterday, GrabTaxi Singapore head Melvin Vu also sought to allay fears that dynamic pricing — or surge pricing — would not only lead to higher taxi booking fares during periods of high demand, but also the likelihood of cabs ignoring street commuters during peak hours.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>The fare system for JustGrab will be similar to the system for Grab’s private-hire car service GrabCar, which charges a fixed fare, subject to dynamic pricing. Grab said that based on data from January and last month, average fares for GrabCar, in some instances, were a few dollars cheaper than fares for its GrabTaxi service, which uses a metered fare system.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Given the larger supply of vehicles under the new JustGrab service, the company said it expects fares to be even lower (at least a dollar cheaper than fares for GrabCar).</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Speaking to TODAY, Mr Vu reiterated that a “measured and calibrated” approach would be taken for dynamic pricing, and with a “huge supply pool” right from the start, “prices will be cheaper and fluctuate less”.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Grab declined to reveal the number of taxi drivers who will be part of the new service. Nevertheless, the five operators have a combined fleet size of around 10,700 vehicles.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Grab said that fares for JustGrab will range between S$4 and S$100, depending on travel time, distance, booking fees, and real-time demand and supply for taxis. Based on last year’s figures, only 1 per cent of private-hire car rides were over S$60, and of these, only one trip on New Year’s Eve crossed the S$100 mark, Grab said in response to TODAY’s queries.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>The new service will also do away with current taxi surcharges, which apply to midnight fares or rides in the Central Business District. Trip prices will be reflected on the booking screen, although these do not include Electronic Road Pricing charges.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Based on past data, for instance, a trip between Tampines to Choa Chu Kang during peak hours would cost an average of S$29 for a metered taxi and S$25 for a fixed fare private-hire car. During off-peak hours, metered taxi fares could fall to S$26, whereas private-hire car rides could dip to S$24.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>JustGrab will provide commuters with an added option: Those who wish to take metered taxis can continue to hire them through the Standard Taxi icon on Grab’s app. Likewise, commuters who wish to book a private-hire car can still do so via the GrabCar icon.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>On concerns that surge pricing could result in cabbies shunning passengers on the streets, Mr Vu acknowledged that while this may happen for a “handful” of taxi drivers, the majority of cabbies have told him that it is “not economical” to cruise without any passengers in the hope of getting higher fares through bookings.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>He added that taxi drivers have also told him that they prefer picking passengers off the streets to accepting a call booking.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“Because it’s a confirmed job. Because they put a bum on the seat of the taxi faster and they cruise less,” he said. Grab would be taking a cut of 10 per cent for each JustGrab ride. In comparison, it charges a 50-cent commission for each metered taxi fare booking now.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Last week, Singapore’s biggest taxi operator ComfortDelGro, with close to 17,000 cabs under its Comfort and CityCab brands, said it will strike out on its own with a flat-fare structure similar to metered taxi fares for trips booked via its in-house mobile application. Based on the timeline provided earlier by ComfortDelgro, this could be rolled out around the same time as JustGrab’s launch. Mr Vu said the “devil was in the details” of the rival service.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“I don’t know how they will match demand and supply effectively. We’ve been doing this for three years and we’re a firm believer in matching accurately — at the time of booking — demand and supply,” he said. Grab claims that it expects rides to increase by a fifth for taxi and private-hire car drivers who use JustGrab.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Meanwhile, as competition within the industry looks set to intensify, Grab also announced enhanced perks for its taxi drivers, with a monthly 8 per cent Medisave contribution based on their earned incentives. Private-hire car drivers receive higher Medisave contribution rates at 10 to 15 per cent, depending on their performance.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'> </p>

              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>It also expects this new option to cut waiting time for rides by up to five minutes.</p>

              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>As used by Grab and ride-hailing rival Uber, it is meant to encourage drivers to get out on the road when demand is high.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>But when taxi companies, including ComfortDelgro which controls about 60 per cent of the taxi fleet here, announced plans to introduce dynamic pricing earlier this month, several commuters expressed fears about higher fares and the availability of taxis on the streets, especially during peak periods when some cabbies might chose to rely solely on bookings to get higher fares.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>Addressing these concerns, Mr Vu said surge pricing for taxis will be introduced in a "measured and calibrated" way and stressed that commuters still have the same choices as before, such as metered fares and current options such as GrabCar, GrabHitch and GrabShare.</p>

              Old taxis drivers, especially those who had already make and keep some money during their heydays of 13th quality CBD trips in first 2 to 3 hrs of evening peak and are use to common phrases when there are lots of paxs by ":LET THEM ROT LAH" If you can do that now, I chop my lanjiao off.
              
              And for me, in the 70s and 80s, private own taxis yellow top, this is my time, if you are a taxi driver, you are damn well respected, many park their taxi in their landed property, not HDB hor. That time, paxs call taxi driver, towkay, boss or at least mister, can you please take me to....not now smlj Uncle, orchard road,....then look at the phone liao.

              Old  uncles already in retired mode. Low daily target for them.
              Just a few trips easy  easy can meet their target.  No pax just wait. Raining no drive, no risk. No need so troublesome take booking, grab, uber, etc... dont waste time on this. retired mode. 
              Now u should know why many taxi cannot meet 250km per day.  Retiree no need to work so hard, children all grown up. Just passing time and some allowance will do.

              <p>Wrong, the objectives is remove the age limit and replacing the

              <p>During my general meeting with <span>NTA</span>, LTA,
              <span>WDA</span>, EDB and many other govt institution and
              of cos, taxi companies CEOs, the govt produced a trend of dwindling
              and aging taxi driving in our ever increasing population.</p>
              <p>If age is to remain at 30years to qualify to drive taxi, and
              that only Singaporean can drive, in 10 years times, we will see
              taxis driver retired more and more, with no youngs taking up taxi
              driving, it will be a huge problem for the govt, as taxis is an
              essential transport as it is classified as Public Transport.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the decision to invest in Grab and Uber by our Govt
              is critical to bring back a corhort of young drivers who prefer pte
              car than driving a taxis, and as young as 21 or 23yo, you can
              drive, that will make up for the shortage, as many, by the time
              they reach 30yo, might have find another stable job.</p>
              <p>So, it is not so simple as you think, you need deep thinking and
              a holistic approach to understand why UG is allow to do almost
              whatever they like, why they allow so young driver, why got so many
              new rental cars at low prices…why still got incentives, there are
              reason for everything, not just by what you see at face value.</p>
              <p>...shhhh…please keep all these to yourself. thanks</p>

              <p>You dun talk cock lah. smlj get younger drivers to replace older drivers.  Taxi succession is the last thing the gahmen is worried about.  If so worried, why not just reduce the age to 20 yo instead of 30yo to get TDVL?</p>
              <p>If gahmen can get older people to work longer as taxi drivers, they will.  Reduce the burden on the state.</p>
              <p>Temasek invest in Grab?  You know how much they invested anot?  Less than 2% of Grab's total investment income.  You know how much Grab lost in 2015?  Temasek investment all kena wiped out liao.</p>
