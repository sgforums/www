              <div class="quote_body">
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;">I regret
              going for the recent Grab online training, I am automatically sign
              on for JustGrab, which there is no way for me to opt out this fixed
              fare option, I requested for a button to turn off JustGrab as I
              think this fixed fare pricing is a FARE CHEAT to taxi
              drivers. </div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;">When I got
              a JustGrab job, I always on the taxi meter (covered) to compare the
              metere fare with fixed fare and found that the difference is about
              $4 to $12, even though I followed the route suggested by the GPS.
              The difference may be due to the timing (peak or non peak hour),
              location (CBD or location charge), traffic condition, and the route
              that I took (sometimes pax want me to use a longer route with
              smoother traffic). Base on 10 rides, I actually lost $40 to $120 a
              day.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;">As all Grab
              jobs are forcefully push to me, if I ignore/cancel those JustGrab
              jobs, it affect my AR/CR, which also affect my incentive for
              standard taxi, since I am not going for JustGrab incentive,
              I think JustGrab incentive is a SCAM. Base on 7 days &amp; 70
              jobs, I already lost $280 to $840 just to get $300 incentive/50
              JustGrab jobs.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;">Grab told
              me that I could get more jobs with JustGrab but before all this
              competition between the booking companies, I use to get about 10 to
              18 standard taxi jobs a day, but nowaday, I still get 10 to 18 jobs
              a day but 30/70% to 40/60% of standard taxi/JustGrab jobs.
              Furthermore, Grab is aggressively promoting JustGrab/Grab car and
              taxis are treated unfairly with no Grab Taxi Promo, that's why the
              comsumer preference changed.<br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large;">I really
              wish to turn off JustGrab as I don't wish to provide my premium
              taxi services with experienced driver and insurance for a low fixed
              fare pax.</div>

              Actually, for me, after all the hoo and haa on grab this and that, I still find taxi driving viable, that is the most important, I mean, yes, there is abit of lesser pax at certain times, but on other times, there is a high volume of paxs....which more or less compensate the lesser side.

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">When Uber and Grab entered the Singapore market in 2013, they stressed that they were not taxi or private-hire car operators, but tech companies.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">They convinced most people, including the regulators. Perhaps that is why Singapore has treated these foreign companies with kid gloves.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">In early responses to queries on whether Uber should be regulated like taxi firms, a Land Transport Authority spokesman reiterated that Uber was not a taxi company but a "technology company providing a matching service leveraging on technology".</p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">That was in 2014. Less than a year later, Uber set up Lion City Rentals, which rents out cars to those who want to drive for a living. In doing so, it is doing exactly what taxi companies are doing, but without the livery, rooftop signage, meter, regulations, and service criteria that cab companies have to meet.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Now, with Grab in talks to take over SMRT's taxi business, it is once again clear what these newcomers are: taxi companies with new technology and new ideas.</p>
              <div style="box-sizing: border-box;">

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">The authorities will point out that private-hire vehicles still cannot pick up kerbside fares, but that is irrelevant. The smartphone has become the new kerb. And with so many taxi operators adopting Grab's hailing app, the question of kerb or no kerb is less material. What is material is that we are now witnessing the second phase of these "tech" firms' foray into the multibillion-dollar door-to-door transport business - all in just four years.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">It would have taken them much longer to get this far if they had taken the traditional route of applying for a taxi-operating licence. Now that they are entrenched, it will be a matter of time before they start doing what they set out to do: Make money.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">For commuters, that means fewer freebies and discounts in the years to come. For incumbent industry players, thinner profits. And for the country, perhaps, lower economic returns as more cash gets repatriated to the home countries of the two newcomers - the United States and Malaysia.</p>

              Aiya, no matter tan, goh, lim, lee or wong..etc etc, as long as got $$ flow in, people can do wonder thing, and there are bubbles in everything, from church to bubbles tea to property to banking, prostitution, sports, soccer and even to transportation etc etc. One of these day, when the bubble exploded,  then maybe you can see the ugly side of it.
                  
              In the meantime, enjoy while it last.

              New technology got it bad and good, but as long as the good out played the bad, it is consider ok to use.
                  
              Everywhere you go, there will be scam and cheater in whatever system, peoples will find loopholes to explore and take advantage of it, this, we cannot deny. There are many high IQ and EQ peoples doing driving, unfortunately, they use their talent on small matters only, or smaller way of going around the bushes. Moreover, it is a waste that they are doing driving.
              
              You can do whatever you wan to cheat, call, shout, write, post.,...but just dun get caught, like someone use uber to do his private own picking, hence do not have to pay that 20%, he got his regular clients, but then, one day, he got into an accident with the regular client injured...now,...you think Uber or the car rental company will pay for his and client injuries or that even the car insurance will cover a non commercial trip by driver??
