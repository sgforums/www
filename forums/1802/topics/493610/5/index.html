              <p>It will be incentive driven, just like grabcar and uber, if you
              do not hit the incentives, it will be a great lost if you use JG,
              incentives will be the carrot, driving and using JG for long hrs
              will be the stick. Same same like UG, but different vehicle and
              uncle only.</p>
              <p>For the past 2 to 3 years, Grab had just managed to get around
              40,000 grabcars on the road, including partimer but not including
              grabtaxi…but introducing Just Grab, they just add another 10,000 in
              just a day.</p>

Travel delays due to traffic jams would not add to the fare, unlike the metered-fare option, ComfortDelGro said.</p>

It is important to allow time for our drivers to get used to flat fares and for the company to monitor our fare pricing competitiveness in the market. It is also important to ensure that our street-hail customers are still being served.”</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Commenting on this latest move by ComfortDelGro, transport expert Park Byung Joon from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said that this flat-fare option by the operator would provide a competitive edge against other services offered by Grab and Uber, by continuing to appeal to commuters who are flagging taxis on the streets.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“This is the oldest strategy, which is to offer something cheaper,” he said.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>However, the moment they choose to go into dynamic pricing, this could mean the end of the metered fares, given that ComfortDelgro occupies a “dominant” position, he added. This could ultimately lead to a price war among the various operators, or force the operators to come up with more creative ways to capture the market share, such as by coming up with a loyalty programme, for instance.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Economist Walter Theseira from the same university said that the market impact would ultimately depend on commuters’ preferences.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>His view is that they are more likely to choose private-hire companies because of their aggressive discounting strategies, rather than flat fares from taxi firms.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Given that private-hire companies such as Uber and Grab have “years of experience” in adopting dynamic pricing compared with taxi companies, it is understandable that operators such as ComfortDelGro is taking its time to develop the right formula for dynamic pricing.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“Pricing is a difficult problem since the system must balance supply and demand, while bearing in mind that both drivers and commuters dislike volatility,” Dr Theseira said.</p>

              <p>Collaborating with ride-hailing app Grab, taxi
              companies SMRT Taxis, Prime Taxi, Premier Taxis, Trans-Cab and HDT
              Singapore Taxi took up this option.</p>
              <p>ComfortDelGro said in its statement yesterday: â€œDynamic
              pricing, which essentially allows for fares to fluctuate with
              commuter demand, is something the company is still exploring. It is
              important to allow time for our drivers to get used to flat fares
              and for the company to monitor our fare pricing competitiveness in
              the market. It is also important to ensure that our street-hail
              customers are still being served.â€�</p>
              <p>Commenting on this latest move by ComfortDelGro,
              transport expert Park Byung Joon from the Singapore University of
              Social Sciences said that this flat-fare option by the operator
              would provide a competitive edge against other services offered by
              Grab and Uber, by continuing to appeal to commuters who are
              flagging taxis on the streets.</p>
              <p>â€œThis is the oldest strategy, which is to offer
              something cheaper,â€� he said.</p>
              <p>However, the moment they choose to go into dynamic
              pricing, this could mean the end of the metered fares, given that
              ComfortDelgro occupies a â€œdominantâ€� position, he added. This could
              ultimately lead to a price war among the various operators, or
              force the operators to come up with more creative ways to capture
              the market share, such as by coming up with a loyalty programme,
              for instance.</p>
              <p>Economist Walter Theseira from the same university said
              that the market impact would ultimately depend on commutersâ€™
              preferences.</p>
              <p>His view is that they are more likely to choose
              private-hire companies because of their aggressive discounting
              strategies, rather than flat fares from taxi firms.</p>
              <p>Given that private-hire companies such as Uber and Grab
              have â€œyears of experienceâ€� in adopting dynamic pricing compared
              with taxi companies, it is understandable that operators such as
              ComfortDelGro is taking its time to develop the right formula for
              dynamic pricing.</p>
              <p>â€œPricing is a difficult problem since the system must
              balance supply and demand, while bearing in mind that both drivers
              and commuters dislike volatility,â€� Dr Theseira said.</p>

              No choice lah, today, plying business on the road, hate it or like it, it is going to change, firstly, call charges will be diminishing, secondly, fares will reduce, thirdly, less and less bidding job, more of a accept the job or not accept the job.
                  
              So, if you want to continue to drive, you must expect all these to happen, but there will be lots of calls, 
              
              it is up to individual on how they want to look at it, but at the end of the day, for the drivers, especially those in their 40s and 50s, it is a serious matter of earning a living and sustainability.
                  
              If you find you cannot sustain to all these kind of new fare structure, you can thrown key, it is your right and absolute power to do it, but if you are rising a family, think thrice before thrown key (can go for cheaper rental cab), 
              
              and make sure you have a job in hand before throwing key, because outside employment market is also not looking good, more so if you are in your mid life.

The difference may be due to the timing (peak or non peak hour), location (CBD or location charge), traffic condition, and the route that I took (sometimes pax want me to use a longer route with smoother traffic). Base on 10 rides, I actually lost $40 to $120 a day.</div>

Furthermore, Grab is aggressively promoting JustGrab/Grab car and taxis are treated unfairly with no Grab Taxi Promo, that's why the comsumer preference changed.<br></div>
