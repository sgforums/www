              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://e27.sg/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/gomyway-app.png" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p><strong>GoMyWay is Singapore’s dedicated taxi sharing app that 
              provides taxi riders a secure way to share fares, save time and meet new
               people.</strong></p>
              <p>A new app in Singapore aims to change the whole taxi experience in 
              Singapore. GoMyWay, an iPhone app that allows you to share taxis with 
              other people, has officially launched and is now available for download 
              from the Apple App Store. While the idea of taxi sharing is not a new 
              one, the potential of the market is enormous. According to the GoMyWay 
              team, there are more than 26,000 taxis in Singapore, making an average 
              of 900,000 trips per day.</p>
              <p><strong>Factors supporting the launch of the app</strong></p>
              <p>In Singapore, because of the fear of traffic congestion problem, the 
              Land Transport Authority is capping the taxi growth at 2 percent per 
              year, but the population of Singapore is growing at a far higher rate. 
              This promotes the need for more car pooling and taxi sharing in 
              Singapore to meet the rising demand for more taxis. Another interesting 
              fact that was shared by the GoMyWay team was that, most taxis in 
              Singapore are actually underutilized, with an average of 1.1 passengers 
              per trip. With the high smartphone penetration in Singapore, it makes 
              sense for GoMyWay to come in and capitalize on this opportunity.</p>
              <p><strong>Security a huge concern</strong></p>
              <p>Of course, one of the major concern for most of the app users 
              revolves around the security issue. Female passengers might not be 
              comfortable sharing a taxi with a total stranger. To solve this problem,
               GoMyWay allows one to select his or her taxi sharing buddy. When you 
              list where you are going, you can choose to only share the taxi ride 
              with your preferred gender. On top of that, every profile is completely 
              anonymous until both parties decide to share the taxi together. There 
              will also be an built in chat system for you to chat with your taxi 
              partner. All GoMyWay users also need to register and verify their mobile
               number, so the identity of all users is easily traceable.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p><strong>Do I have to pay for the app?</strong></p>
              <p>GoMyWay is a free app. When you sign up for the app, you are given 20
               taxi tokens. The taxi tokens will be deducted once every successful 
              taxi sharing. Once you finish using them, you can then purchase more 
              tokens through the in app purchase feature. The additional tokens will 
              cost you US$0.19 to US$0.30 depending on the package you buy. To avoid 
              complicated fare split arrangements, GoMyWay also provides users with 
              the following simple guideline – the first alighting passenger pays 60 
              percent of the fare due at the point of alighting (including all 
              surcharges) to the second passenger. The rationale for the 60 percent 
              split is that it’s likely the second passenger had to make a detour to 
              drop off the first passenger, and also a fixed starting fare means the 
              first kilometre of the taxi trip is significantly more expensive than 
              subsequent kilometres.</p>
              <p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>As the team does not have a technical cofounder, 
              most of the technical works are outsourced to BuUuk. Moving forward 
              after the launch of its iPhone app, the team is working on pushing out 
              an Android app in the coming few months.The team is also exploring 
              possible expansion to other countries like Malaysia and Australia. 
              Several app feature enhancements that may come out from its future 
              iteration includes smart banner ads as well as partnerships with food 
              and beverages outlets, merchants, as well as the government agencies.</p>
              <p><strong>Possible challenges ahead</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>Although the idea of taxi sharing would seem appealing at first glance, I had a couple of concerns:</p>
              <p>1) Critical mass. To help taxi riders find the right match, GoMyWay 
              will have to achieve a critical mass. The GoMyWay team has a couple of 
              marketing campaigns lined up to attract more users to use the app. The 
              concern is that early adopters may find themselves logging in to an 
              empty app and leave. An upcoming competitor app, Split-It, plays on a 
              different strategy by only deciding to launch their app once they have 
              hit 10,000 sign ups.</p>
              <p>2) Consumer behaviour. The GoMyWay has addressed the adoption of 
              their app from the perspective of rising demand for taxis, 
              underutilization of taxis and high smartphone penetration. The bigger 
              question would be the consumer’s acceptance to the idea of sharing taxis
               with complete strangers, something that comes more from a cultural 
              approach rather than just on the opportunity to save cost. Sharing taxis
               when the opportunity presents itself is one, but actively looking for a
               taxi partner could be something that has higher barriers of acceptance.</p>
              <div>It will be interesting to see what strategies the GoMyWay team has 
              to tackle these challenges and help Singaporeans reduce their 
              transportation costs.</div>
