              <p>In the past before working as a TD, you guys know the pathetic private limo income. Companies like Imperial, C&amp;P etc.</p>
              <p>Came across transitioning.sg so I asked Gilbert (owner of the website) for help. But I find he had may have a hidden agenda. His focus is not on solving the problem for people who came to him but on whacking the foreigners &amp; the government. Makes me feel like he is someone like Chee Soon Juan number 2.</p>
              <p>Now...how true these articles are is also a question mark. I won't deny the job market is spoilt by the foreigners. But there is a way out to problems. Out of every crisis is an opportunity. You guys may be complaining here &amp; there but I am thankful that I chose to work as a TD. At least it earned me a decent income comparing to those pathetic wages in the job market. The wages are getting from bad to worse in the face of the rising cost of living. LHL nightmare had became true. A nation of agents &amp; drivers.</p>
              <p>But at least I am not dumping the skills &amp; knowledges that I had. I am still a FOC automotive service advisor to my network of taxi friends.</p>

              <p>Is Mike in this forum?</p>
              <p>------------------------------</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Lam (PAP MP),<br> <br> I, Mike Yeo, stand before you at my wits end.<br> <br> I used to be a Regional Marketing / Sales and Training Manager for
              a pharmaceutical company and it was effectively a Regional
              Director’s position. I was earning about $15,000/month then.<br> <br> I spent almost 10 years in the industry and company, since January
              2005 and was made redundant in March 2013.<br> <br> I immediately made many changes of lifestyle and even went into a
              repayment mode with several banks and financial institutions and
              even got the car finance company to take the car back in and to
              change the shortfall of the loan into a personal loan.<br> <br> After being unemployed for almost a year, I managed to join an
              Indian start up as its Business Development Manager and helped it
              to connect with the doctors I had contacts with and so on.<br> <br> But after 6 months. the management said that I was too expensive
              and got rid of me again/ In my previous company, I was earning at
              least 15,000 per month, in the Indian company, I was only getting
              $5,000.<br> <br> So I was willing to downgrade and even start much lower so that I
              could try and get back a life. I used most of the $5,000 ($4,000
              after CPF) to repay my debts and also to feed my family, but once
              made redundant again, I had no more income and could not make any
              repayments and or any other significant financial
              contribution.<br> <br> So I immediately got a Real Estate Agent license from CEA and also
              a taxi vocational license to enable me to bring in some income.
              However sir, I am now working almost 15 hours a day every day just
              to be able to feed my family and also to repay some of the more
              priority debts likes power and gas and marketing and so on.<br> <br> I do not even have money to put my 5 year old child to school and
              or to pay for any medications.<br> <br> I can bring in $200-$250 a day, depending on the day and time I
              spend on the roads, but on average I am bringing in closer to $220.
              This is because of not being experienced enough to know where to
              catch passengers and or being able to drive fast enough to make
              more trips.<br> <br> I am sure that as I spend more time on the roads, I will improve my
              earnings. But my cost is $120 for rental and $50 for fuel and not
              including food and ERP and so on. So I am only confidently bringing
              home $50 a day. This is a far cry from my previous pay and an even
              further cry from my last proper job.<br> <br> So I am in great financial distress and am also facing great
              pressure from the various banks and institutions to repay my
              debt.<br> <br> I am most happy and willing to do so, but I am not earning enough
              and I am also unable to respond to them in a timely manner as I am
              on the road in the morning at 5 am and am driving till 7-8pm each
              day.<br> <br> And I am not taking any significant breaks. So I am not able to
              answer phone calls, sometimes even from my own family like when my
              daughter was having high fever.<br> <br> I have discussed with my family and am now in the midst of selling
              my HDB flat. At least the proceeds will be able to be used to repay
              my debt of almost $100k and then I am able to breath again. I am
              also very tempted to self declare bankruptcy, but to do this, I
              have to pay $1,800. If I had that much money, I would have used it
              to pay some of my bills and debts. Also becoming a bankrupt is also
              not a viable option as I have a CEA license and this will be null
              and voided if I am declared a bankrupt.<br> <br> As a property agent, if I can sell my home and also a few more,
              earning enough in commissions to pay off a $100,000 debt is a
              simple matter.<br> <br> Being a cab driver, even if I were to earn $100 pure profit a day,
              it will go no where far in paying down any debts.<br> <br> So sir, I need your help 1) to see if you can speak to CEA to give
              me an exemption so that even if I am declared or if I self declare
              myself a bankrupt, I am able to still work as a property agent so
              that I can at least bring my life back into line, 2) Help me to
              find a way to rent a HDB rental flat once I sell my 5 room HDB so
              that we can have a place to stay and I can then rebuild my life, 3)
              please introduce to me anyone who can help provide financial
              assistance to a low income family so that they can send their child
              to school and also to be able to find the funds for self
              declaration.<br> <br> As I am driving almost throughout the day (a simple investigation
              of my car logs or even Comfort Delgro electronic tracking of my
              taxi) I am almost unable to speak on the phone at most times and
              also after each shift,<br> <br> I am sure that you can understand the pure exhaustion I feel. So if
              you can help, or if your personnel can help, please lets start a
              line of communications through this email and please help me if you
              can sir.<br> <br> I thank you in advance for your kind consideration and any
              assistance you can provide me and my humble family
              henceforth.<br> <br> Kind regards,<br> <br> <br> <br> Mike Yeo<br> <br> * Letter first appeared in Transitioning.org, a support site for
