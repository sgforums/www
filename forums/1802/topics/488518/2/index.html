So, when you ask O and A level people to drive taxis, you think they cannot think logically meh, they can be much better than those foreign paxs with mill certification from dunno smlj University..lols

              So, in retrorespect, the rules has changed, a cabby is allow to ask a pax to alight wherever he find or suspect that it is not safe to ferry such person any longer, if the pax refuse, the next best action is to call the authority (police) for mediation.
                  
                  
              The key word here is NOT SAFE, how you define it, I guess as TDs, we are expert in it, it can be we find this pax keep coughing, scare got MERs..it can be too drunk and violent, it can be a tempermental pax, it can be a pax too demanding, it can be a pax that in a way endangered your driving on the road...UNDERSTAND BO....smlj cannot chase down pax, can...why cannot, but talk nicely, dun collect the fare...
                  
              If you come and buy my fish head curry, but kpkb this and that, add this and that, shout here and there, limpek can tell you to fark off, I nicely tell you that I dun want to sell it to you, can or not..not happy, call police lor, arbo police in station seibei eng one hor, saw many playing hp games..
              
              As a happy taxi journey is defined as both pax and TDs clap hands, if paxs dun clap, taxi driver jialat, same as if TD dun clap, pax also jialat...the yin and yang rule apply
