              <p>Just like some people just think that TAXI DRIVERS owes them a
                  ride. We are compulsory to pick up anyone, not to forget there are
                  alot of people who chose taxis on the street, comparing those 3.80
                  to 3.70 to 3.20 bla bla bla.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers are contracted as Independent Contracters, meaning
                  we are not under any employment. No one owe us a living, nor we owe
                  anyone a service.</p>
              <p>I think those SeLFISH complanants who keep complaining about
                  taxi drivers being choosing customers have to wake up their idea. No one
                  owes you a ride. I think taxi drivers should have thier little
                  luxury on how they wanna operate their 1 man business.</p>
              <p>If you are really that urgent and need a to get somewhere which ownself knows that is very inconvenient, there
                  is always to bid for priority by just calling a cab, not to expect
                  by standing on the roadside like a KUKU waving for cab at the Very
                  Peak hours, and any available cab SHOULD service you to deliver you
                  to your designated KUKU location spoiling their day and flow.</p>
              <p>There was once an Ang Mo pull down half his bermudas and show the taxi that was infront of me who was waiting for traffic light to turn green :) He revealed his undies, and later turned around do the SUCK IT move by triple H :) really retarded. My passengers had it recorded..</p>
              <p>Additional note, i dont know if me only or anyone else experiencing the same thing, sometimes when you on form, u can pick up customers and going convenient location non stop. When bad, every pick up is going to the same old KUKU location.</p>
              <p>Sometimes after circling for awhile with no pick up, go for a smoke, a drink or a pee, especially go have a meal. When you restart your driving, you would miraculously have someone waiving for you at kuku hours (midnight after 2am) at the kuku districts. having same experience?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well anyone agrees?</p>

              <p>You are in a hurry, desperate for cab.  You call for cab but no cab available.</p>
              <p>You rushed out to the roadside.  So many green lanterns passed by. You waved frantically, but none stopped for you.</p>
              <p>One green lantern stopped, interview you.  When you say u want to go Kuku location, he just drive off without even saying a word.</p>
              <p>And you had to wait for one hour in the rain before finally getting a cab.</p>

              <p>If think like that, best is drive SBS bus or East-West MRT. No need to see face, no need to interview.</p>
              <p>As cabbies, we must serve the public. Only if you think the pax are trouble-makers or got big dogs or got big parcel, you siam because our job is to ferry people, not goods, not animals (drunken people are also considered as animals hor). Otherwise try your best to pick everyone including people with wheelchairs or NTUC groceries. You will not earn more if you siam a wheelchair. You also will not earn less if you stop for them. Because sometimes the disabled are grateful, and may tip you or let you keep the change.</p>
              <p>There are people specialising in ferrying live pets, dead pets, cargo, furniture and coffins. Why compete for business with them? If a taxi is supposed to fetch everything - then I also can book a maxicab and load a coffin inside.</p>
              <p>Nobody can complain to LTA because we refused to stop for people with a cupboard or dog. But if a pax hail a green lantern and the cab does not stop, it is an offense.</p>

              Good!, you know that when I was in China, Beijin, the China taxi driver (older elantra model) told me, any 3 to 4 chinamen in a group, they will not take, they prefer to take foregniers, ladies and family

              Actually we should not term it as chase pax down, but rather, ask pax to leave our taxi as they pose a danger with their unruly behaviorial.  You go office lim kopi, DRO said.."Uncle you cannot chase pax down after they board, you know or not". You must be smart enough to reply, "Madam Lau Kuay Bu, I did not chase them out, I asked them to leave my taxi due to their unruly behavor which we, in Singapore, as a gracious society, is not acceptable, hope you understand"
