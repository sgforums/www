              <p>Land Transport Authority to further strengthen the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco </span>operations control, the new taxi service operating licenses by adding a number of new provisions, including the prohibition expressly provides industry fleet "outsourcing" business sublet to others in order to protect the interests of passengers.</p>
              <p>Comfort, city taxi, <span style="color: #ff0000;">DUCK</span>, SMRT and Premier <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco</span> has just updated recently approved 10-year license, they are required to follow the new regulations, or the worst may be revoked licenses.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yum</span> (Prime) Texaco's license will expire in 2017, the smallest <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shengda</span> (Smart) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco</span> deteriorating due to service, Texaco number can not meet the minimum requirements, has not renew the licenses granted in the year September 30 After the end of the business license expires.</p>
              <p>LTA by the advisory said, according to the new provisions of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco</span> operating licenses, in addition to taxi companies have been registered for the class taxi driver or the driver, taxi companies can not put the team sublet to others, or they will face for a maximum fine of 100,000 yuan, suspension or revocation of operating licenses.</p>
              <p>The spokesman said, adding that this new section is to protect the passengers and taxi drivers' interests. As to whether there are similar complaints received or suspect that any taxi companies to team "outsourcing" sublet to others, LTA by the advisory did not disclose further details.</p>
              <p>National Association of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco</span> chef consultant Hong Dingji by the advisory said, to his knowledge, indeed before the taxi driver and passenger complaints, some of the highway <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco Texaco </span>team does not seem to directly registered by the driver of operation, suspected others to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco </span>company "package" under the convoy, and then sublet.</p>
              <p>Let taxi driver aggrieved that rent these taxi drivers seem not with other peers, strictly follow the taxi companies and the various LTA regulations laid down, and these drivers but had some behavioral problems by other Company blacklisted.</p>
              <p>He said: "The authorities should act on such complaints, through regulations or inspection as to whether action by the LTA decided."</p>
              <p>Drivers should also be registered for the class</p>
              <p>In addition to these provisions, LTA also expressly provides that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco </span>Company shall ensure that all taxi drivers, including drivers for the class prior to the company register in order to obtain driving <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco</span>.</p>
              <p>Moreover, to improve taxi service levels, to ensure that taxi companies to respond to the feedback of passengers, the industry also required to establish a 24-hour hotline and ask passengers reply within three days.</p>
              <p>LTA said that the new provisions have been discussed with the taxi companies, taxi companies have accepted all these new conditions, and that they do not operate on the existing wide implications.</p>
              <p>Several companies, including <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco </span>ComfortDelGro, SMRT and Premier<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Texaco </span>by the advisory said, their operation has met the LTA requirements, including a 24-hour hotline. Premier Executive Director Linchong Wu said: "The company has already set up hotlines, also require all drivers to register, I believe LTA these regulations is to set out in black and white."</p>
              <p>However, Hong Dingji requirement for 24-hour hotline was incomprehensible. He said: "The technology is advancing rapidly, why need to rely on manpower to solve the problem? Allows passengers to provide feedback via e-mail, do not necessarily rely on the hotline."</p>
              <p>LTA announced in March last year operating license application for amendment <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texaco</span> regulations, including regulations taxi fleet operators to increase the minimum number of vehicles, the device controlled by the company headquarters - call (On-Call) signs, and ensure that they have the ability to payable on-call services.</p>
              <p>The new taxi company was awarded the license in the first year, you must launch 200 Texaco (in the past for the 100), renew the licenses of existing industry in the team when you have to make sure to at least 800. Council also tightened the Texaco service quality standards, regulations industry in the on-call service, safety, and the three major aspects of passenger satisfaction, follow the more stringent requirements.</p>
