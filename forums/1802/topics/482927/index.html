              <p>but when u are omo, that 12hours shift, the same 250 gross becomes 100 nett as your rental cost is doubled</p>

              Yes, the labour market shall remain tight even after election, maybe till 2020 before it self correct by itself. And that is also why I keep urging taxi companies and LTA to increase taxi fares and not rental, but seem like turning into a deaf year, so cabbies out there should know what to do come 2016 election.
              
              As I melted out previously that income in Singapore must increase inorder to offset inflation, the years of dependency on foreign labour had depressed our local wages for a long time, and that depression hit even freelancers like TD in a dominos effect.
              
              Prof Tommy Koh had once pointed out to the govt that a driver in US or europe having a lower or same GDP as us is earning 5 to 6k euro or US dollars, and we are just merely 3 to 4k except some heros saying 6 to 7k, and yet in those develop countries like us, the driving hrs are shorter and our is driving like a slave. 
              
              Former prof of NWC Dr Lim asked the govt to give a shock therapy of 50% increase in wages for all locals, and he was laughed off as insanity and crazy. But to be frank, that can be true, but not in absolute value, perhaps incremental which imply within the next few years.
              
              As depressive layman's wages bring down taxi driver income, an aggressive layman's wages increase shall bring up driver income, simply to put it, if a hotel driver is earning 3k, who would want to drive taxi, maybe yes, but little, therefore, there is a market value that govt must look into it. And beside, higher wages lead to more taking taxis without a blink of an eyes.
              
              Most traditional companies who are here for along time are the one most reluctant to changes, especially in wages, because most still practice on low wages policy by employing foreigners in a way to higher profit, and that lead to negative productivity, the managment of these companies who are so adapted to engage cheap labour will had lost all skill in how to improve productivity, to them is a slow process and must work on it, why not just get a cheap labour and profit goes up, quality will be sacrificed. End up labour productivity very high.
              
              I bet these companies will loose out to newer and more understanding and productive establishments or organisation. Such as older hotels are losing top staffs, who are head huntered by newer hotels with new managements.
              
              As we go along, Mom is going to reduce further quotas, increase levies, and filter out non relevant entry permit, and at the same time, catch those cheating employers on fake certificates and wages. Mom Minister Tan, who was formerly a general in SAF is for once, commended for his policies and more importantly, his readjustment and waking up of MOM staffs and managements.
              
              \ In comparing to previous Mom minister, I should that by far, this younger man is the man, if he is to take over LTA, that will be a bonus for TD
