One day too times how many hours I lose? How to continue driving like this? Now the fares are so bad and business is dull Â— how to manage the rental?"<br><br>Another taxiÂ—driver, Tan Ah Kin, said:"We used to drive 10Â—12 hours one day Â— now at the very most you can drive 4Â—5 hours. So the waiting time is going to kill us."<br><br>What is worse is that the company has not raised its metered fares and wonÂ’t do so for at least three months.<br><br>The company has only imposed the city surcharge from 1 Jan 2008 but most passengers donÂ’t know this.<br><br>So the drivers are suffering the same drop in business as other cab drivers by as much as 30 per cent.<br><br>In a statement, SembCorp Industries, which runs the CNG station, said one of its two compressors had an unusual malfunction and the spare part that is needed should arrive within a week.<br><br>In the meantime, the company is exploring all possible solutions and has advised some users to switch to petrol for now.<br><br>Prime Taxi management said it is still working out solutions to alleviate the taxi driversÂ’ woes.<br><br>This includes possible rental rebates and petrol vouchers.<br><br>Mr Tan Soon Chye, General Manager of the Taxi Division for Prime Car Rental and Taxi Services, said: Â“While the gas company is doing their best to rectify the situation, we at Prime Taxis had a dialogue with taxi masters and we have worked out a package to alleviate their problems at this time while the pump is undergoing repair."<br><br>One of the main problems that has left taxis idling is that there is only one CNG refuelling station in Singapore which is located on Jurong Island.<br><br>However, three more such refuelling stations are expected to open throughout the rest of the year with the next one expected to open in about two weeks time.
