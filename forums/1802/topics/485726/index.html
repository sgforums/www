              Everytime a MRT line start to function, we TD will kong wu kong bo about affecting our business, but in reality, from centre line to whatever line that had operated, do you sincerely feel a reduction in pax and your income?
              
              As singapore expand it heartland and population, it must provide good infrastructure to support it, infrastructure such as transport, hospital, school and housing must be present before doing any structure changes to the population and the society as a whole, and for that matter, Singapore govt failed in it miserably. It is like making a cake, with all the dough, flour, cream and ingredients ready, but forget that there is no oven or that the oven is too small. 
              
              We therefore is experiencing a sudden kanchiong move by the govt to built housing and transportation at all cost, lot so construction going on, but does it affect our Taxi business? By right yes, but by left, it is only dispersing the current crowded MRT during peak period, what you might experience when all mrt is up will be people asking your to this station and that station.
              
              So, the challenge for TD here is not MRT, the challenge is private transportation company like Uber and grabcar that is going to affect our business, and for a start, these companies' drivers do not even need to take taxi lesson...

              <p>Not in terms of earnings or types of pax opinion only.</p>
              <p>What I'm referring is what type of standard will it be for the taxi industry?</p>
              <p>Will it become smaller in terms of fleet size? Will it raise the standard bars in selecting the drivers? Will it become a luxury for paxs to take taxi? Will the taxi standard become the level of other 1st world country?</p>
              <p>The changes will definately come (like it or not) and they (MRT) are there in the long run, but how can we cope and/or make changes to adapt to the needs</p>
              <p>Private transportation (IMHO) like Uber might not really affect the taxi industry unless their fleet size exceeds the taxi companies size.</p>
              <p>I was asked this question last night.</p>
              <p>My opinion: Taxi is and will be there to stay regardless of what is being built.</p>
              <p>But I believed when the older generation TD is replaced by the younger generation due to retirement.They might raised the standards of TD which is comparable to other 1st world country standard (including the fare hopefully)</p>
              <p>just my opinion...</p>

              Raising of standard goes with generation, like my time, I was the most saki even I only have sex 2 education, most driver are not even primary school educated, but as our population and even the world get more educated, the standard need to be adjust, but frankly in my opinon, do you really need a O level to drive a taxi in Singapore?  Do you chicken farm in defu need driver with O level or driver with brain?
              
              If you compare yesteryears diploma graduate and today graduate, tho both are diploma, but there is alot of standard different, because today getting a diploma is like getting a N level, in yesteryear, a diploma is consider very talented people, but today ah neh, ah pinoy also can go in even without a O level...as such, our govt are tarnishing our education intergrity.
              
              Today youngs are also known as the pampered generation, why, because most of their parents are ok and earning well, so this pampered generation tends to see think differently from us, wake up already got bf ready, just work and wait for parents CPF and houses, most are over weight and never suffer a hungry stomach for days.

              We had been psycho'ed by our govt too much liao, if you ask many foreigners including workers from india and bangadeshi and those FT, they will tell you, Singaporean poor life, whole life working.
              
              So it all depend on how you want to look at it, by 40s, if you still want to chiong, take care hor. You can and of course must work in the context of Singapore aging and decreasing population, but you also must know yr limit, and at the same time, if can, spend time with loveones to go and look around the world before you cannot even fly

                  Wrong or right channel is not the issue here,
                  
                  Let me give u a mind of thought,
                  
              Most people in their mid forties who had become supervisor and above, they would had guide and mentor the junior so as to pass on the skill, if not, the experiences.

              But because of economy driven at all cost by our govt, lots of young foreigners, be it talent or fallen, silently move into our workforce in large amount with wages that can smartly survive in a 3rd or 4rd world countries, ultimately, this depressed our wages and for many, their careers advancement. So you end up people in mid forties or even fifties are still struggling day in and out for a living in a First world 4 most expensive city in the world.
                 
              Think about it, why TD income hv not gone up in tandem with cost of living, whereby taxis are also in high demand at peak.
