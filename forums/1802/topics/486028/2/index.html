              Driving taxi do not need to fine tune, it is a very situation based job, you will not know what the next minutes will be like. Time of the day, road, weather, locations and taxi driver mood do play a part in your decision on the spot, and it has to be quick and fast.
              
              Given the situation I mentioned above, luggage man might just be going to change house, chio bu might be going to a nearby shoppping mall, the call can also end up no shows. Whatever it is, take the chio bu...why? because it is guaranteed, first in line of waving, and maybe tiko pek like me, can peek abit and also smell better perfume.

              <p>Think the most lucrative way is to not waste time lah. Go where the yield is the highest at the shortest possible time delay without being a loser TD. For me, night driving, always go near town area or into CBD better. After pax alight at ulu place, go back to the nearest "office" place or go back to town.</p>
              <p>Picking and choosing pax like the loser TD at marina bay hotel really sucks and will backfire in no time. He deserved it to be asked to fark off. This type of people got no sense of fair play and consideration for other TDs.</p>

              Dun just zoom down to city lah..give yourself a few rounds, and maybe 5 minutes later..then move off to town, to know whether the town is ghosted or not is simple
                  
              1. 5 taxis only 1 hired..town is ghosted
              2. No calls.
                  
              Try to move along heartland road before moving out, like for eg. tio ah yishun..
              Move along ave 2 out into lentor..you might get pax at end of ave 2 going to town

              Where to find? most cabbies will keep to themselve one lah, but frankly, mostly are those 24hrs eating places and heartland KTV. As you drive along, you will ultimately form a pattern of your own style of driving, where, 
              
              when and how or what is you know only, by that time, once reach those ah rong, ah wood and so on places only
                  
              You know where to go and search for paxs, but does not mean you will get paxs, however,  the chances to catch them will be higher...it is a basic instinct every seasoned cabbies would have had in their mind.
                  
              Even everyday you start driving, you will have a pattern to drive the same road first..out of carpark, right will tend to be right unless you took a call. It is something like habit, experiences and luck mix together. 
              
              But do not be so desparate until the extend of cutting others lanes and keep praying to taxi God like my bro keepthechange when he was a taxi driver.
                  
              By and large, you will form your style of driving, but in whatever you drive, be it no pax or got pax, must also be careful, touch wood, if you get into an accident or kenna summon, yr earning and hardwork can be gone, 
              
              As long as you drive safe and avoid all these, you are sure to make money, just a matter of more or less, gum or not gum, luck or not much luck.

                  Good question,
                  
                  1stly, Humans have a weak point in their emotion, and that is idolisiation. Others emotion like Love and attitude do hv its weak point, but it also hv its good point, a double edged sword, so to speak.

              Let take an example of Hello Kitty, you can see those who idolise hello kitty as fan, in their heart, hello kitty is part of their life motivator, an imaginary caring partner that last forever. They will support and even deny that hello kitty is not a cat...lols.
                      
              However, we do respect others idolising as it is their rights, and some, not to comment further, make them their gods which is a sensitive issue.
                      
              The american and japanese are good in creating such figure, from spiderman to pokemon to ultraman..they built these into every childs in the world when they are young, and that alone, created Americanisation and Japanisation. It bring about great influences for them. 
              
              However, countries like China, do not take that into their account, and that is why if you ask a PRC gal hello kitty, she will tell you..WTF is this? and if you talk abt superman to russian girl, she will tell you..are u toking abt super Mario?
              
              Back to taxi god, taxi god is therefore a self creation, a believe with a faith, whatever it is, one thing good is that it elevate one spirit to perform safely, drive smart and hard to earn more, it can be anything or nothing, but it lies within every taxi driver heart and soul that nothing how you do it, be it put flower, bath with holy water or simply put a chow chai mao...it give that spirit and determination to strive and drive on. That's taxi god.
                  
                  But then, you can alway fark care all these and just drive..
