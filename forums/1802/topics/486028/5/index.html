              <p>Actually it is not got pax or not, but what kind of returns or yield at a particular time and place. CDB, you get the surcharge and usually longer distance trip to home. Heartlands, no surcharge and more likely shorter trips.</p>
              <p>To each his own, but a lot also depends on luck. I try not to go AP empty, not worth queueing. Even if you use the mobile apps, sometimes also cock up, got to wait long long and waste time. Time is all we have.</p>
              <p>My strategy, don't mind sharing because it is not new anyway, is to head towards town during the "Golden Period" from 6-12pm - lots of pax, calls and surcharges. After midnight, too many cabs in town, too much competition, very hard to get pax quickly unless you are lucky. See the long long Q of cabs also sian liao.

              <p>Mon to Thurs, quite tough to get pax after midnight. So have to cheong before that and take minimal breaks. Singapore got lots of ghost towns after midnight.</p>

              <p>Bro, you hit the right target liao... best returns on time and effort... is queuing an effort?? Yes, definately but might not be best returns because it can be as long as 45mins for your turn</p>
              <p>Heartland mall is mostly short trips, that means you can get back to the mall again for the short trips. And who knows after the short trips, you can get a trip to town  -- the so called golden area...</p>
              <p>Heartland area is something that you have to be very familiar with and you would know where to go for your paxs at different timing...</p>
              <p>Luck (or co-incidence) is something that you have to create it..meaning you have to be on the road  --- not in coffeeshop or find bak bak area...</p>
              <p>Now compare the above with an empty cab straight down to town and with the sceniaro you had mentioned abt town ((( long queue of taxis, as most TD love to go there )))</p>
              <p>What i'm saying is during Fri and Sat night, the impossible 
              (improbable) can become possible (probable) and these 2 nights 
              definately are different from the rest of the nights. So, the strategy 
              should be different....</p>
              <p>Perhaps or maybe, shorter distance (especially 
              after midnight) will be a btter return in terms of time and effort come
               end of the year....</p>

              Don't believe me, try going into Tuas (cumfxxt lah) ard 10pm on
              those 2 nights.. sure got call leh...</p>
              <p>Anyway, the real tip on Fri and Sat night is just drive, just
              move around estate also can... the time to go to town is after 2am
              onwards anytime.... For Fri and Sat night hor.. the rest of the
              nights (if no special events), stop after 1 am pack up and go home
