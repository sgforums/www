              Since you begged, I put a few cents into your bowl.
              
              Quality unlike quantity, is invisible, can be well defined by one, abut differ alots from many other perspectives. Therefore it is more of oneself appreciate, I might said, the food quality here is nice, you might not.
              
              Therefore, you might deem quality, your family member might not...might only hor..dun say I talk cock hor.
              
              I am a grandfather liao..knn, what stereotype or booster you talking abt...also got mistress liao..lols
              
              If die and living need to tell our govt, then I think our life is not there yet.
              
              Anyway, there are choices in life, it is up to one to decide, one might live till 90yo, but only more than 1/2 our life are awake.
              
              You are the head of the family, you run the show, you are also the management, your wife the assistant mgt, naturally, what you said, they just listen, but dun end up becoming a ATM.
              
              Story again, there was once a guy like me, work at marine, cdg, casket, car downloading and taxi driving. He makes ton of money, everytime, when he spent with his family, he gives them resturant foods, buy branded goods for them and take the best seat in any events. And he always give money to his childrens.
              
              One day, as he was going out to drive taxis in the evening, his youngest son asked him, Papa, how much you earn per night of taxi driving.
              He replied...abt $150
              So, his youngest son went to break his piggy bank, counted $150 and give it to his father and said, Papa, here is $150, can you spent a night sleeping with me, I got lots of thing to talk to you.
              
              The father seeing it, hugged his son and said...sorry child, I am so sorry, I this while I thought I had given you my best...but nothing beat the human touch and love your shown.

              Yes, I did told my grandkids, for him, the future look more worst than us..during the 80s and 90s, we saw many degree holders in the west lost their job, I hope singapore will not be such a position, it is ok to take a degree, but make sure you take the right one for the right choice, not one that is for show and end up still living in 99 years HDB.
              
              Drive so hard lah, where got work so hard,.,..the key is Time, I just want drivers to truly ask oneself, can i hv more time of my own than sitting inside a square box with a steering wheel, driving hard for the first few hours for others, and thereafter, my earning.
              
              Cost living tight, vote them out in 2016 lor..but I hv to qualify that some peoples alway say cost of living damn high, but drive new car, wear branded clothing, eat at posh restaurant..like this, smlj also high lah

              Brother, this not stereotyping lah, this is somethng of a judgement, as to why had HDB gone 300 to 400% price up in the last 15 years? As to why cars price had gone up 120% and so on, we need to make certain comparision inorder to justifiy certain issue, and that is why we need to know the history so that we can judge today.
              
              There are side effect of an afluent society, and that side effect are showing in today context, the like of degree not carry more heavy weight, the likes of less marriages and low birthrates and the like of high cost of living are all side affect of an afluent society. 
              
              Of course, I hv to agree that opportunities today are less, couple with an increase of 3 millions foreigner with 1.5 consider talented (degree to diploma to trade skill), we chao chao have 5 to 6 millions peoples to compete each other, therefore that drive down the weightage of a degree, nevertheless, the good is the it kept the economy flamboyant and cruising well.

              ...before voting them out, there will be a drastic change in taxi in Singapore, it will flavor most TDs. And that is why there is a delay in taxi fares restructuring, it is not they do not want to do it now, as most of us have been waiting till balls also drop liao...but it will happen during the election year, 
              
              Singapore Govt have never underestimate Taxi drivers, they know that most TDs in Singapore hates the govt policies becos in every taxis, when you talk about govt, the TD will curse and swear..and this protray a bad image for the govt especially so when we, the TD of Singapore are also consider a marketing tool for Singapore in a way we communicate with tourist, new comer and citizens.
              
              But Drivers like my ex chief and many others tends to forget when goodies are brought out before election...and when govt win the TDs heart, half their job is done, thereafter, another 4 years of hell for TDs
