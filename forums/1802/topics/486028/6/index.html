              <p>No No No.. depend on your target... I saw a post here stating
              able to nett 100 ard 10 to 11 pm starting from 5pm... So another
              couple of hours should be enough for target and better go back rest
              early for next "hunting" night....</p>

              <p>yup i was the one who told you that you are able to nett 100 around 10 to 11pm. Provided you start @ 5pm onwards. Of course, depending on your garang-ness, whether you will take short breaks in between that period.</p>
              <p>my rental @ 56, 4 bucks wash teksi. Altogether $60 liability before driving.</p>
              <p>On average, get $30 per hour for 5 hours.</p>
              <p>It's also true i take toilet breaks every 2 hours....</p>
              <p>This one dont need to hide. Problem is whether can you tahan driving anot?</p>

              <p>I start at 6pm, take short breaks only but not able to cross $100 nett before midnight except on Fridays. The most $80, more commonly less. Maybe I don't take enough bookings, maybe wrong strategy? Need to test and find the best niche or strategy. To each his own, I guess.</p>
              <p>After midnight, the earnings can increase but depends on luck and how your drive and how long you drive.</p>
              <p>Just to share some thoughts with bros here. Don't just drive and drive untill you got no more energy for other income ideas. Don't end  up like those very old taxi drivers in their 70s still slogging it out. I feel sad whenever I see a very old cabby doing the night shift.... he should be in bed resting at his age.</p>
              <p>Spare some thought on how to use your taxi earnings to build a side biz or residual income of some kind. So you can retire before 60 or at worst 70 and not have to slog day in, day, night in, night out. That's not what being a Singaporean should be.</p>

              <p>Wah lau eh, I really saw one ah lau TD struggled to get out of his taxi at AP near toilet. He was a pitiful sight lah. Really old and tired. I don't think he is driving for fun, at AP where got fun? It was early in the morning leh.</p>
              <p>But still better than those old cleaners, I supposed. Not that I looked down on them, just feel sorry that at this age, in most other countries, old people can enjoy life and retire, not slog so hard. CPF life is so little and only if you can meet the MS. For old cabbies, how to meet MS?</p>

              But in taxi driving, best is that you have another contingent plan in your pocket, while driving, look out for other opportunity, some paxs are good people who we can chat and gather information to learn new things and find another way of earning a living beside TD.
                  
              Today, youngster prefer to be relief and do partime than commit themselves to full time TD, because Taxi driving had in a way become a second or third choice to supplement their existing income of their daily other jobs. 
                  
              And as more and more such trend follow, together with more ah laus retiring, we might see a no hirer Taxi trade in Singapore, which is happening as some cab are going to be share by both, both take responsible of it, both take charge of it, one location pick up and return, same location servicing and same location putting up fuel.

              Companies must make profits, otherwise, do business for fark, invest for fark, work for fark???
              
              For Taxi companies, there is only 2 ways to increase that profit, one is to increase rental, two is to increase their fleet of taxis....no matter which ways they uses...TD is sure to lugi....so if you think you are free,...go e2i at jurong east...see can find a better job or not

              Ah Laus like me, is game over liao..still go bother who take over for fark? But as a responsible citizens and true blue locals, I hope the youngs can take on taxi driving as their profession, but let truly look at our local young population, it is diminshing faster than the old dying away. That's a fact.
              
              And taxi driving is the least thought on the mind of any young guys on the street, taking from age 25 to 40yo, unless he met with some mishap down his career lines or personal life. Nearly 70% local youngs today have teritiary education, and even those technical school like ITE pupils are the most wanted people by many companies in Singapore. 
              
              So with all the grabbing by banks, hotels, biotech, engineering firms..and so on....on a diminishing nos of youths, how much do you thing Taxi industrial will be able to attract them?
              
              Professionalism is one proclaim, as a ah lau, I drove my cab, got MDT, got GPS, got smart phone, got phablets, auto gear, people wave I stop, people tell me to stop, I also must stop, people call I take or grab, people Q, I also Q, people no show, I also lan lan...smlj professionalism do you want more???

              Singapore had being on full employment for many years, plenty of jobs, and as govt (MOM) start squeezing on the Quotas of foreigners, and a job bank that require companies to employ Singaporean first, today you see companies scrambling to get locals to make up the quotas and be in line with govt objective of employing Singapore first inorder to get funds.
              
              I have seen friends closing business due too much foreigner against locals, I have seen crying foreigner workers working for 10 to 15 years in singapore asked to go back due to the new quotas rules. 
              
              And what does that tell you...civil servant paid is going to increase more and more, private companies will catch up, with a tight labour market, it is a labour market, you paid 2k, bull to you, you pay 3k, limpek consider, you pay 4k, you get the man.

              <p>A tip for bros here. If Q is long at some places in town after midnight, just cruise around a bit to test other areas like hotel lobbies, side streets, etc.</p>
              <p>Early this morning at 1-2am got lots of pax at Fullerton Bay Hotel lobby with no taxis while a long Q of taxis  waits at a place just 100/200m behind at 1 Fullerton, it is insane. Luckily I decided not to blindly follow the taxi Q and moved ahead and saw the pax crowd there at the hotel lobby with a single taxi on call there, no other cabs around.</p>
              <p>Went to test the waters and the door man quickly wave me over to take some pax with lots more frustrated pax behind waiting.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story is don't blindly join long Qs. Dare to be different.</p>

              <p>A taxi driver is a funny vocation.</p>
              <p>To be a full time taxi driver when you lose your job, it is considered the very last resort, slightly better than security guard and cleaner only.</p>
              <p>As a job after retirement, it is considered a good past time to earn some pocket money and get away from the nagging wife.</p>
              <p>As a part time job driving weekends whilst you still have a well paying full time job in order to feed whatever hobby you have, it is the best.</p>
              <p>So, depending on what stage of life you are at or what your existing circumstances are, taxi driving can be either hell or fun.</p>

              Even you said you drive on weekend and yet hv a full time job on weekdays, time is also a factor, especially those with younger kids or family, you will not a get a good life balance, and life is not that long. 
              
              On the other hand, bachelor may end up no time to find a DECENT gf and get marry, so it is not about spending all your whole year slogging for money, which is a must but not to the extend that it occupy all your lifetime working for others.
              
              Then by the time you died, I send you, be it heaven or hell, if there is, the authority there might ask you..what the fark you doing as a human being??? work almost all your life away...since you like to work and drive so much...ok, be horse and cow
