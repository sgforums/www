Once I drove a bad passenger who drank too much form a karaoke session as he told me his destination is Bayshore Park, I mistook it  as Hazel Park, half way through the journey, I wake him up and ask him whether he prefer to go by Bukit Timah or PIE, He became so angry about me in going to the wrong direction, I keep saying I am sorry it my fault, and this passenger keep scolding through the journey to Bayshore park. When we reach the destination I even provide him the customer feed back number and even my name to ask him to call the customer service. I even offer not to take a single cent and he insist to pay me $15  as the fare is $14.80 I return him  20 cents back and he still complaint and scold the f words. in the end he want his $15 back, and I even return him, he told me he don't want to complaint anymore. I return him the $15 and drove off. as for this journey I was scolded by him non stop and also he didn't pay me back my 20 cents and also my fuel. What do you guy think? This is just one of the many encounter I came across. and even a silver cab driver does not admit his accident mistake and make me pay $1000 for nothing and my cab company can't even help me even I want to pursue the case I have to pay $5000 more. I do come across bad driver. So what can a good driver like me can do. Nothing... but I still try my best to serve my passenger even how much bad incidents I encounter...... Nothing personal but something to put it out of my mind.</p></div>

              <p><br>Why do you pay the $15 and $1000?</p>
              <p>Is FEAR taking over your life right now?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's easy to be a bad person, but it is almost impossible for normal people to be a good person.</p>
              <p>Because in order to be a good person, you will need to be the worse person than those bad people then you will understand why it is tempting for you to become a good person. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>got a nasty one; old man send china woman back home from dunman to sims ave. then continue to sembawang. after woman got off, this drunk old man complain and fuck me all the way to sembawang. he claims I purposely go the wrong (long) way. any way I asked him to direct me which he did and we went a much longer way.</p>
              <p>it's past midnight and the fare would reach more than $30. I endure him all the way to his home and when the money was collected he was still fucking. I step out of the taxi and call '999'. when he saw me using the mobile, he asked me who I was calling.</p>
              <p>"The police lor!" I answered.</p>
              <p>He walked very quickly to his lift landing and disappeared.</p>
              <p>If the destination would have been less than $30  I would have had dumped him at the nearest police post.</p>
