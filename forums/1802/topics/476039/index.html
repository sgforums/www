              <p>Who cares...Pax pay you and you drive them off to their destinations. Happy start meter and pick up or else tell them off and drive away.</p>
              <p>Remember...they wont sit your taxi forever..they are your transportation customers..just like you provide a service to them..</p>
              <p>If they see you up do you expect to pay you tips or more tips...at the end of the trip, they dun own you anything but cab fares...they dun hire you..you dun talk relations to them, they are just strangers to you...</p>
              <p>Most importantly, you just feel happy most is to achieve your daily income and spend your happy times with family or your true friends.</p>

              <p>Once a group of pax (should be tourist), wants to go taka. Part of their group left slightly earlier by another cab. </p>
              <p>During journey ask if this is the 'right' route. I replied since u replied me for fastest way, this is my best knowledge.</p>
              <p>But when I was turning in to the driveway, they asked me if this is the right stop. Upon alighting their friends no where to be seen yet.. </p>

              Knn lah, taxi drivers already dun respect taxi drivers, you expect paxs to respect us???
              
              Like keepthechange666, hammer and my bro ct..all never respect me on leh, see me only...call me siao eh! bo go geyland ar? paxs in my cab hear already, see me no up liao.
              
              By the way, since most are in their 50s and above, naturally our lanjiao also no up liao, dun blame the pax lah. What you expect them to do, kowtow to you, say please, sorry, thank you to you??? tan ku ku hor, they are the ones that put food on your table hor.
              
              And you must also differentiate btw polite and status, some might say thank you out of their own cutlured politeness, but that does not represent they see you up hor, some ah bengs/lians never say thank you or please one..but they see you very high up, end trip, $15, give $20 and say keepthechange. 
              
              Keepthechange to taxi drivers, frankly speaking is one of the most polite and see you up word.

              Huh? what most in 50s no education??? aiyo, limpeh in my 50s leh, so are many ex principal, ex SAF warrant officer, ex Managing director, ex teacher, ex police officers, ex captain...and like me, ex sailor with diploma in marine and degrees from the city of columbia.
              
              Brother brother, if you look into the statistic of taxis drivers getting into trouble with pax or touch wood, accident at fault and so on. Most are those below 50s hor. 
              
              Driving taxis is not much about education, education is nothing if the application is not there, and depend on what kind of education, in our system, we are educated to work, not become businessmen, and that is also why we fail to produce many entrepreuners. And those like me, who are not so educated, most of them end up as businessmen employing educated people.
              
              By 50s, most of these TDs would had translated their knowledge and skill into wisdom, to say 50s less educated is certainly a discrimination, we are much better educated in term of the society changes, public relationship and people handling skill, and all these are self educated thru the years at face valued upfront engagement that no classroom education can ever learn.

              That is discipline, in whatever trade you are in, if you are not discipline, that is it, moreover, Taxi drivers are mostly simple people with simple mind, and that give way to them very liable to get hook onto something which they might had missed during their working life. 
              
              And most of these with mistresses, gamble, affair are mostly OMO.
