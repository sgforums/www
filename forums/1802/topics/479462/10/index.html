              Look, this KTC is driving with a debt, every cabby on the road come into TD have a reason, either big or small reason only, so, it depend on each individual reason of becoming a TD. OMO, how far can you go, if not with debt and a fark up attitude, you think he will OMO??? do you really think he never get a relief before??

              7 years is all he can take it as OMO, even you said he kenna 4D big big, he could had drive on, and even if he did not kenna, he might only last 10 years as OMO, and whatever health problem he suffered later, might be due to his early years of OMO chionging.
              
              Because his agenda for driving taxis is bigger than many other driver who merely drive to make a decent living, and all this kind of drivers you can notice them on the street that you ply day in and day out, once they sit inside cab only, they might go all the way for 6 to 8hrs without off the engine or even left the seat, and every turn is at 70km/hr, every cruise is at 120 and above

              Si loh, $3.70 leh, people also take like normal cab...who said cannot drive, but no turbo, so abit bo lat, but good mah, if not, all kenna burnt and accident. 
              
              Under Cdg investigation, the burning is due to turbo timming, hot air release too slow due to outlet turbo charger run out of timming or irregular timming, that is also why, sometime you feel a jerk before the turbo kick in. 
              
              So now, cdg decided not to go for turbo lor, smrt also follow by taking pirus,..but this knn TC still go take renault//...haiz
