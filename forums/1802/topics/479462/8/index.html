              Hello, it was declare that we alway hv surplus, this year is 3.8 billions, so every year got surplus, what they going to do? spent more on economy like building airport, garden by the bay or tuas south? 
              
              Our govt have more money then you thought, and that is why we are able to withstand many economy crisis from SAR to asian to global to oil crisis, our govt are a conservative one, a prudent one that save for themselves in economy and their paid more than taking care of its citizens.
              
              When a govt is pro economy and their paid driven, they would plough their money into making it more than giving back to the citizens, and that was how and why, we become TDs. However, a bite on the election report card had make them back paddler on the liberal economy policies. 
              
              They start to intervene in property, transport, immigration, S pass, E pass, PR and also medical cost, why? 
              
              Because if they dun, the disparity of the rich and poor will widen, the notion of no money no talk will become more real that it will overtake human compassion and graciousness, and frustration among the lower rung of the society will KPKB more like you and me.
              
              What they are giving is not about taxing others to give you, what they are giving is what they owe us for a long time and finally, realise that as govt, you are accountable for the citizens, the 2016 coming election prepareness and to further lower inflation run away cost for the poor by assisting them with medical cost which is one of the high cost in Singapore that is most needed by the lower income to middle income group

              Dun just listen to one cabby and u start to forgo cdg, all hirers of course will like to make the most out of it, not only cdg, from red to silver, same wolves in different color only, but to be fair, there are many good wolves, there are still people offering $50 to $52. For those offering $58 to 56 and yet do not share benefits for whole week driving, then most properly, they can hardly find relief and that is why, you get all these people desparately looking for relief, complain about no relief or tell company, no relief, the relief co recommend was fark type...of course fark type lah, hirer fark type, relief is sure to be fark type one mah.

              And then on the other hand, it is not easy to find a good match, like finding a gfs or wife, you hv to be patience, because you also want a nearby one, a cheap one, a good new cab one,.a responsible and yet chin chai one, a understandable, but where to find cheap, new and good? even geyland also very hard to find.
              
              Therefore, you hv to give and take, I took a $55 one, but no need washing, no need to do the servicing, no need to worry about not driving, will not collect anything, to me, that is fine, somemore nearby only, no need parking coupons..take lor

              Newer cab rental can be compensate by the flag down and lower fuel consumption, less problematic and of course, more comfortable.

              go or no go is a question you must ask yourself, want to drive or not, meaning, do you want to drive taxis or not?

              <p><br> Dun just listen to one cabby and u start to forgo cdg, all hirers
              of course will like to make the most out of it, not only cdg, from
              red to silver, same wolves in different color only, but to be fair,
              there are many good wolves, there are still people offering $50 to
              $52. For those offering $58 to 56 and yet do not share benefits for
              whole week driving, then most properly, they can hardly find relief
              and that is why, you get all these people desparately looking for
              relief, complain about no relief or tell company, no relief, the
              relief co recommend was fark type...of course fark type lah, hirer
              fark type, relief is sure to be fark type one mah.</p>
