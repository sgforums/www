              Just a simple hirer and relief system also cannot trash it out, imagine if 3 to 4 are involve, and just as relief keep cursing hirers, hirers also keep cusring reliefs, and most of the time, got no one to curse, so both curse each other.
              
              Human with animal instinct tend to build boundary, and the different is that animal will go after you if you overstep their boundary, but for human, most keep it inside their heart, die die remember it, waiting for chance to eat back, curse and swear. 
              
              So practically speaking, we need to spell it out if we feel uncomfortable, all those courtesy and public ethics can keep oneside when the need arise to voice your concern rather than keep it inside and end up, both brew more hatre and dislike for each other.
              
              Anyway, human also like animal, hv the migrating mentality, we do not wish to stay in one place for long, we tends to see the places on the other side of the river or mountain are better, greener and livier
