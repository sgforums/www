              whole week driving, then most properly, they can hardly find relief
              and that is why, you get all these people desparately looking for

              $105 per day, knn many of the smelly leg tell relief $115 per
              day..... since i cannot accept old taxi, and the i40 is more of a
              tranny taxi, i m getting ready to go defu for the renault, $3.90
              start fare, 20 pax a day will cover up $14 as compare to sonata, if
              can get relief driver it will match the old sonata rental
              price...... fuel milieage also better, bhp 170, wow... more
              powerful than the new cdg merc (167bhp), no call nevermind lah, can
              do without, if cannot find relief then just get super relief for 1
              whole day per week loh, i think i will be happier, no need to argue
              about diesel, punctuality, and cleanliness, if cannot meet the peak

              <p>honestly i prefer sonata (less than 2 yrs) more than any other taxi, if not for the price increased, i wouldn't have given a second thought for other taxi, less than 2 yrs of driving it, i'm already very used to the handling of the car, in future when all taxi replaced by those sissy 134 bhp taxi, the only choice leftover for higher bhp is merc (167 bhp)? really hope they will come out something in between around 150 bhp turbo like sonata  by then........ </p>

              <p>Wow..... How come rest few weeks? Your place so difficult to find hirer? Which area u staying? I had changed more than 10 hirer less than 2 yrs, however I have never break more than 3 days before, maybe u might to consider to be relief for a few diff company, so that choice is wider...... once things not right have to start looking for new hirer liao, don't wait until your mind explode, once found new hirer, it's up to your own creativity to let him taste his own blood for your own tekan pleasure.......... </p>

              <p>i40 be relief can lah, but if be hirer, I rather take Renault, rental same, better car, but can forget about epica, I think now smrt n transcab got many epica no takers, the epica must be very problematic until now transcab is giving out $500 refferal fees.</p>
