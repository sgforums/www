              <p>ya i agree with you. Some old hirers really treat relief as chop carrot head. But still, my own opinion, i prefer my hirer will stay next block to me. So when i just take my time go down carpark, is convenient.</p>
              <p>some shared with me the bonding between hirer and relief, i do agree with bowah at one point that sometimes, when comes to business it's best to have good ethics.</p>
              <p>I just told my hirer ill stop driving him by this month as i am running shift. so depends on my new shift work, see how my schedule before i start driving again.</p>

              Hirer and Relief stories never end one lah, like hokkien drama..can act until the actor and actress grow old...lols.
              
              But as long as there a mutual understanding, so be it, cab belongs to the company, not the hirer and certainly not the relief, hirer quote the price, if gum take, not gum, dun go negotiate, once lowered, hirer altho agree, but buay song liao.
              
              Most of us a mature men, not just born yesterday, we knew the market in and out, even the benefits, so to speak, Hirer must also quote a justifiable price, otherwise, he will not get relief or even get one, but will not last long once that relief found out that he paid too much. Hirer be frank to relief, relief take the cab, pump and wash accordingly.
              
              At the end of the day, the purpose and objectives are almost similar, that is to make a decent living and bring better food for our family. By thinking along this line within a mature mind, I believe the relationship can be a lasting and enjoyable one.
