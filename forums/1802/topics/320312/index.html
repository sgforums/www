              wow lan... diesel price up and up.... i seek pax understanding if i have to reject taking them... e.g. after 8pm scotts road to woodlands:
              
              - Fare is about $19 (excl ERP). 
              - Diesel costs $8 for 2 way cos very likely empty trip back to town
              - Rental is $3.5 per 50 mins (2 way will take about 50 mins)
              - Profit less than $8... 
              
              Conclusion: Certainly not worth it... plus if pax wants to take other route instead of CTE-SLE.... that one is even worse... 
              
              last time diesel much cheaper i dont mind... now i need to adjust my driving pattern to stay in business...

              allulu,
              
              it is down to business sense... 
              
              only if LTA or comfort says they will subsidy me, else i will ask them to fly kite.... as one cabby wrote... during bad times, companies can find ways to cut cost, cut unprofitable transactions etc.... only taxis are expected to remain as good samaritans even if it means earning less... fair meh?
              
              one saturday at 7.57pm amk mall... long q of pax at taxi stand... i ok lah go and pick lah... 3 women, 1 wheelchair with 1 trolley full of provision.... i waited for them to slowly carry disabled women in and then slowly load up my boot... by the time all sat in taxi, it is 8.01pm... just lost my peak hour surcharge... wow lan....at sengkang destination, they took 4 mins to unload... all these for a fare of $6.2.... very good deal for the pax... i greeted them politely... but i know i am running a very bad business if more trips like this... if i am a millionnaire driving taxi i dun mind... most cabbies are not.... i too slog for money eventually...
              
              as i learn from our leaders, as long as you work hard, it is perfectly fine to be greedy and ask for higher pay....
              
              i only feel apologetic towards pax who stay far or have huge load to carry... i hope they meet a millionnaire cabby

So if we know all this, why we can't make a better deal on discount to the Hirer as many Hirers are waiting for we as relief to help them on their burden. So Hirer is first class and Relief is consider second class,if this is so where is our right,  i will question them with my feebback with email to them of my ignornant on this issue if this is so.

              This is all rules and regulations set.
              
              But let me ask you, like those Car Pool every morning downtown to CDB by private individual car owners and the so called passengers their private arrangement picking up each and other together one trip downtown to their offices downtown.
              
              Is this legal or illegal, i think this and those Pirate Taxis in the sixties, there are not much a  different anyway and why this is allowed by LTA, there is money consent transaction in this point...they are on business, no GST involve no Tax involve and all the car owner benefits with something...SO.

              u received such message from MDT? My guess is many hirers quitting cos cannot find relief... why not enough relief? cos fuel price up... in fact i was also thinking of stop driving a while and rest.... 
              
              nowadays on tue, i will stop after 11pm plus cos it cost a bit more now to drive empty to town for pax

            <div class='col-md body'>So as you told Relief alway got the say, stop mean stop no rugi wat. Hirer need to pay full rental even he stop, relief nothing. Even as OMO hirer day and night shift for 400km or more what is their intake you know and how long he or she can run. At this current situation. look at the matching hirer and relief you should know the data is there. That why MDT keep flashing this message during the day but not sure about the night.</div>

              CDG said to remove 30c surcharge when subsidied pump rate back to 1.19. Currently still 1.33. 
              
              So if pump rate fall below 1.33, cabby happy... if below 1.19, cabby and pax happy.
              
              but diesel price quite strong, not falling as much as petrol... think cos diesel user need it to business, unlike petrol more for private use which is easier to cut down...i think

              <p>gotta admit that you cabbies are getting a raw deal both ends....</p>
              <p>on the one hand, the operating cost is going up and on the other hand, the income is declining.</p>
              <p>i for one has started to skip cabs becos it is getting costly. since i sold my car 2 months back, i started taking cabs on weekends to run my errands. after a month, i now rent a car instead the cost is roughly the same. i pay only slightly more on a car rental but i have the flexibility and no wait time.</p>
              <p>hope things get better for you guys....</p>
