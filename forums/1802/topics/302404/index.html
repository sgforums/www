But he now earns about S$10.<br><br>So that means that he has to drive for 12 hours to pay for his rental and diesel fees which amount to about S$120 a day.<br><br>SMRT said it is still monitoring the situation and cannot give an average earning of its taxi drivers.<br><br>Transcab said it has computer problems and cannot provide a figure.<br><br>It also added that it is too early to conclude the effects of the recent fare hikes.<br><br>As for SingaporeÂ’s largest taxi operator, ComfortDelGro, it said the average driver is taking about S$9 more a day or S$270 more a month.<br><br>However, ComfortDelgro cautioned that this is based only on the first week since the new fares were implemented.<br><br>It said its figures are very preliminary.<br><br>As for commuters, not everyone is clear about how much more they have to pay, and why.<br><br>One commuter said, "No, definitely not clear."<br><br>When asked why the commuter said, "ItÂ’s after a while...it took several taxi drivers to explain it to me."<br><br>Another said, "I know that it has increased a lot because I take taxis quite frequently....I only have a brief idea that if I actually (take) a taxi in the city area, I need to pay S$3 more and even a 35 percent surcharge."<br><br>However one commuter noted, "(I am) rather clear (about the new fares) because I take a taxi almost everyday. But I will avoid taking taxis during peak hours."<br><br>On the recent concern that Comfort taxi drivers were still displaying the old fares, the company has printed a reply in a newspaper.<br><br>\The corporate communications department said there was a delay in printing but now all of its taxis are displaying the new decals.
