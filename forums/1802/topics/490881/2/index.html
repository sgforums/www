              Aiya, brother, you must understand that there are peoples who live by the days, not by month or year, already broke until cannot broke already, where got deposit to give, so if you say these stranger exploited them, I can also said, at least they help them to get a job, therefore, there is 2 perspectives to it. We hv to look at the lowest level and not at yours or mine level to understand these issues.
              
              And for all you said, we are also exploited by our bosses, govt and shareholders we work in, but that is how a capitalised society works.

              a tiny piece of beef.</p>
              <p>Comfort taxi and bus also mah. In the advertisements, I see a
              young handsome driver and nice seats. But when I boarded the taxi,
              I saw an old man pushing a funeral director business card to me.
              The bus lagi no need to say. Never greet me is ok, never smile is
              ok. Never comb hair, or no hair to comb is also ok.</p>
              <p>What I dont like is the bus driver doing hard braking. As a
              standing pax, if I accidentally bang my crotch into a young girl
              how?</p>

              <p>Exploitation lah, smlj exploration??? knn, wonder how you work

              <p>Aiya, brother, you must understand that there are peoples who
              live by the days, not by month or year, already broke until cannot
              broke already, where got deposit to give, so if you say these
              stranger exploited them, I can also said, at least they help them
              to get a job, therefore, there is 2 perspectives to it. We hv to
              look at the lowest level and not at yours or mine level to
              understand these issues.</p>
              <p>And for all you said, we are also exploited by our bosses, govt
              and shareholders we work in, but that is how a capitalised society
              works.</p>
