              In a nutshell, it is alway an hide and seek society, paxs wants cheaper fare, fast and good service, TD wants profits with less cost of operating, taxi companies want increase rental and put in more cabs to earn more rental, LTA wants more taxes and expect taxis to be on the road, NTA wants members and control taxi driver mutiny if any. 
              
              All these players include us have different interest, and if put them together and seek the overlapping common of each interest, there is only one common goal, and that is, to make money. The society therefore needs to adjust themselves to understand taxi drivers as we understood the objectives of companies, LTA and paxs, but the society/players alway tend to choose to ignore Taxi drivers plight and suffering because TD is alway deem as the lowest rung of the group of players in this industry.
              
              Any taxi companies will care for their taxis and rental more than taxi drivers which is a living thing, any govt will take care of the general paxs and taxation rather than a mere pathetic taxi drivers, any Unions in concern will take care of it membership fees and objectives of peace and harmony other than the real needs and understanding of Taxi driver.
              
              But these players who talk and plan alots forget to realise that, at the end of the day, it is the taxi drivers who get the job done. Taxi drivers are actually the most important part of this cycle but are alway led by the nose by all these goondos, so please, be united

              Be united in a way that we see thing on the same par, not one TD talk this and the other talk that...or worst, TD fighting or quarrel each other over ego and pride which only make other players laugh.
              
              We must be united for a better share of the pie, one of the agenda in liberation of taxi companies is to disunite the simple minded taxi drivers, with disunity, different thinking, different perspectives, govt and taxis co can have better control over us.
              
              To enlarge that share of pie, which is also known as productivity, we must hv a same thinking, but of course on the road, you cut me I cut you is a total different issue, every jobs got it anger and frustrated moment, it is about the thinking, the parallel thinking that we must hv, and that is not about going against the govt or companies, but to tell them in a way as Hey, dun bully us too much ok

              Well, it can be done, if hitler can move the whole german army to die for him, if Mao can change china, if PAP can rule singapore, there is never a cannot, it more of a matter of whether we all can see thing from a common perspective and work toward it.
              
              But of course effort and strength is needed to climb this uphill task, it is not going to be riot or protest as we are mostly better and decent citizen than others, it more of reasoning with facts and basis to negiotate or argue our course.
              
              NTA is created by NTUC and supported by govt and all those taxi companies, on surface, it is an association that look into drivers rights and welfare, below that surface, the association is more of a lackey for NTUC and govt, and being funded/sponsored by taxi companies thru NTUC, peoples in that association must jolly well know who is the boss.

              <p>Bro Bowah, I understand and also felt that ALL TDs should be united and reason out with relevant parties (only relevant hor, not those only talk shit type). However, sad to say, even the relevant party also work for the G.. Even our union reports to the G...</p>
              <p>Then how to reason? For this, maybe we can be united in reasoing it out with the companies first before it can trgger the interest of the higher level (relevant party).</p>
              <p>All in all, still a good point as in ALL TDs must be united for the good (only good hor) cause that can create a win/win sitaution for all parties including commuters.</p>

              The diversity of taxi companies had separated the unity of taxi driver further and thereby prevented a strong united front of taxi driver.
              
              NTA currently holds 14000 members, the industrial have 28,000 hirers + approx 20,000 relief drivers (super relief included), that is a total of 48.000 cabbies plying taxi trade in singapore, total holding taxi licence is about 99,000 
              
              When NTA talks, they are taken to represent the whole singapore taxi drivers, when they agree to something like rental increases and acceptance of 300km mileage per day and so on, they are taken to represent the whole of Singapore taxi drivers. But in actual fact, they only represent 14,000 out of 48,000 cabbies, do they therefore, hv the mandate to represent singapore taxi drivers???
              
              If we take a voting rights, I would said that 34,000 cabbies are not with them...so who the fark are they to make decision for us??? think about it along this line

              NTA is a body set up by govt under NTUC to control taxi drivers, like NTWU that control transport workers in singapore like bus drivers, mrt drivers and so on. 
              
              There are many industrial unions under NTUC, NTUC is like the HQ, each unions hv a president and a govt personel like MPs or some high ranking civil servant that include ministers to over see it, the president, like our Singapore president, more of a figure head only, so called Jiak liao Bee president. The MPs or ministers that oversee it holds the executive powers to give order and steer the Unions in the flavour of govt with an hidden agenda of getting support in the political arena.
              
              So, let take a look at NTA, they got a jiak liao bee president for show, but behind him, it an important figure, MP Ang, I heard he also hold position in NTUC and many other unions and govt sectors. And that is also why everytime he is on news more than the president with issue regarding taxi trade.
              
              NTUC is a set up by PAP, it aim is to control the industrial for peace and harmony, and also to gain support in it political way. 
              
              But the failure and cracks in NTUC are seen in more recent even especially the SMRT PRC bus driver strike, one of the director racial remark on malay marriage ceremony and so on
