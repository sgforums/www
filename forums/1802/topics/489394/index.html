              <p>Can pay and get over with it is best. Why waste time fight in court unless u really jin rich and free? If lose end up paying more or go jail for a few weeks if u cannot pay up. Have u been to court before or not? The subordinate court cases rarely take more than 3 minutes for the judge to read out his judgement. Then next offender gets called. Some days u see long queue of hand-cuffed offenders waiting for their turn. Want to argue your case? You will need to hand in a written submission and then wait for next hearing. On the day, he glances thru and if he is not convinced, within 1 minute he reads out the new judgement which could mean an increase in the fine or sit in jail for longer in default of payment. The judge is not a fool. You cannot argue with him. There are ten to twenty police officers hanging around each court room to ensure your obedience.</p>

              Yalor, go court is for more serious case, usually, can appeal, reduce the issue and may only get a warning, and getting the pax as witness must also ensure the pax got time and willing to co operate.

              <p>My case was ,I was stop by traffic police car after the traffic light junction at Pasir Ris central that connects fr Pasir Ris Dr 1,I was turning left.  Just directly in front is the White Sands shopping center. The officer accuse me of not giving way to a woman and a small child at the signalized crossing.But me and my pax sitting in front didn't see any child and woman crossing.We were commenting why a young man was dashing across the crossing when the green man was already blinking.FYI I did stop for this guy to cross.</p>
