              <p>I am honoured to be invited, no matter what, he is my former chief, have to give some respect, for without him, this forum may not even be around.</p>
              <p>The last time I met up with them was quite long ago, they are indeed nice people, from my loyang office, I took any comfort cabs available after repair (so as to truly be a taxi driver), drove to Changi there, I did a check on them and found out that it was indeed a legal gathering of Taxi brothers there.</p>
              <p>But I parked the taxi at other people chalet, kenna honked and farked by them..lols, RSM helped me to move out and told me to park properly, he really take care of his brother and friend.</p>
              <p>Chief welcomed me with both hands, really very touching, he also offered me a beer, he is indeed a good chief, then I saw many others, all good peoples.</p>
              <p>Then one good brother Mpv..something offered me a sotong BBQ by hammer, but later that night, I went toilet a few times, but I never said it out because I never want to show negative to my brothers who offered me food (anyway I also paid $40).</p>
              <p>As I settle down, I can sense some suspicious eyes, those who are smarter ones do indeed suspect me, my age or my position, either way, the tense moment was removed after I yam seng with all of them.</p>
              <p>So, just a beer and a few sotongs (peng by hammer), I came, I saw and I confirmed that it was not an illegal gathering, I drive back the taxis to loyang and then, went home by BMW.</p>

              August. Those of you who want to join us please let us know. Will
              have lot of good info and sharing for you to learn. Especially
              newbies. Only chief and RSM have the heart to share and guide
              unlike the big mouth here.          
                 Offer open to all except the useless people like
              Joeraj and Rbs and the fools that follow them. Bowah can come but

              <p>1st let me say thank you for calling me useless and not inviting me. I would be very afraid if strangers I never met start saying I very good. I dont want to be a hero, I dont want to be joining anything illegal or grouping, wait later anything go wrong I become implicated. So thank you for saying I useless, maybe I will show my boss this. I got no follower and I dont want anybody to follow me, except my children, thank you very much.</p>

              <p>7 month I got lot of invitation also never go. National Day I got free tickets go dinners where guest of honour is Ministers and MPs, also I won't go. Hari Raya coming I got around 10 invites from relatives and friends, at most maybe I will go to 1 or 2.</p>
              <p>You think I will go for dinner for with self proclaim chief and RSM? Dream on, free also dont want, in fact pay me to attend also no thank you.</p>
              <p>And dont worry about Rbs, also, unless got people want to buy or sell house, I dont think he will go. All this bo eng things he also got no time (sorry Rbs for bring you in the picture, but he mention us, so I took the liberty of answering for both of us).</p>
              <p>So enjoy your dinner, listen to your chief and Rsm, learn whatever you want. Dont worry about me and Rbs, automatic next time no need to consider us ok?</p>
