              <p>FEWER taxis are on the road as weaker demand because of higher fares
              and belt-tightening have combined to force many drivers to give up
              their cabs.</p>
              <p>Operators estimate the percentage of cabs not rented out to drivers to be more than 10 per cent for some firms.</p>
              <p>'Same time last year, only 4 per cent of our fleet was not hired
              out,' said Mr Lim Chong Boo, managing director of Premier Taxis, which
              has about 2,300 cabs. 'Today, it's more than twice that.'</p>
              <p>Last year, more than 90 per cent of Smart Automobile's 800
              taxis were hired out, said managing director Johnny Harjantho. Now it
              is more like '80-plus to 90 per cent'.</p>
              <p>Publicly-listed SMRT Corp claimed that less than 10 per cent
              of its 3,000 cabs were not hired out, while ComfortDelGro Corp said its
              rate remained unchanged at 3 per cent.</p>
              <p>SMRT's cab business, however, is still in the red, while
              ComfortDelGro's fleet has dwindled from a peak of about 17,000 three
              years ago to 15,200 today.</p>
              <p>There are about 24,400 taxis registered in Singapore - 2.3 and
              6 per cent more than same time last year and in 2006, respectively.</p>
              <p>But the number of people who hold a cab driver's licence has dwindled, from 93,000 last year to about 89,000 now.</p>
              <p>Industry players said the better takings enjoyed by cabbies when
              fares were raised last December have been eroded by rising fuel prices,
              higher ERP charges and a fall in passenger volume.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo Kiang Ang, managing director of Trans-Cab, observed:
              'Drivers are beginning to feel a little stressed these past few weeks.'</p>
              <p>With the economic crisis, passenger numbers are shrinking
              further. Daily taxi ridership fell from 991,000 in 2006 to 945,000 last
              year, following a fare hike in mid-2006. It was 927,000 up to March
              this year, according to Land Transport Authority data. From April to
              August this year, average ridership sank further to 921,428.</p>
              <p>Premier Taxis' Mr Lim said higher electronic road-pricing expenses had also put off some cabbies.</p>
              <p>Apparently, that and high rentals. Both Trans-Cab and Prime
              Taxis reported that almost all their cabs are matched with drivers.
              Their fleets are made up largely of lower rental cabs: either smaller
              vehicles or older models.</p>
              <p>Prime's 1.5-litre cabs go for $69 a day, versus $90 for the
              2-litre models elsewhere. Part of the rental, amounting to $16,000,
              goes back to the drivers as bonus at the end of a five-year contract. -- ST (29/10/2008)</p>
