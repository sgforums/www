              then when we explain why can why cannot..they will argue back, aiyo i not first time take ok, other times other drivers will do all theese shortcuts to help me save money, you are public transport, its your responsibility to help us passenger save as much money as possible
              
              then this is best of best, this one i meet before, so did my friends, 1 of them kanna this quite recently...someone take at peak hour from southern all the wayy to northern..then when reaching, she say, sorry paiseh not enough money. when the driver get shock, she will argue back becos you are driver, u know shorter cut but you no take..and when explain to her its not short cut, its still normal route but jam, then she will say back, u r expert driver, u should know where got jam, where no jam, u should change way to be flexible mah, why die die must go this way leh? i mean short cut is as driver, u need to make sure u get to the place at the same costs, dont give excuse jam so meter higher...if necessary u should cut road, overtake others mah, why wait in jam??. since u driver no help her save money, so now she no money pay you lor..if u wan, just $20 she have, she insists usually she pay only like that, but the meter $3X!! if not, then sorry lor up to you, becos she no more money, anyway u all earn so much what...

              Like that ar? play with her lor, call police lor. 
              
              Look, the public is full of wolves and you hv to open yr eyes and play your game well, otherwise, you may not be fit to work as a transport provider for the public.
              
              Q full of people, lagi good, can come out and argue, see who malu, but do not use vulgar words, do not touch her, just use sarcastic words to make her malu. 
              
              Wa! wear so nice, so up market, no money pay taxis, then take MRT and bus lah. Make a commotion, and at the same time call police.
              
              End of the day, it is not about who is going to win or loose, but when police come, she or he is sure to pay up. However, time, as I understand is a matter to TD, time=profit
              , so you may hv to waste some time on it. 
              
              But let look it differently, you do not get these type of cheapo often, maybe too bad, once a blue moon. But by making them difficult and pay full for their ride, you actually done a good deed to all the taxi brothers and sisters in Singapore. From then on, see if he or she dare to play with TD again.

              <p>Sounds like TS has the kind of quai quai face that make pax think of eating him up.</p>
              <p>Learn to protect yourself first.</p>
              <p>Double white, Yellow box, junction all these very simple. Who's the driver? Who gets the demerits? Never heard of cameras? I point out the cameras to you dear pax.</p>
              <p>Confirm route, after that jam is nothing to do with you. Sounds like you pick up a lot from taxi stands where all the cheapos are, especially during peak hour.</p>
              <p>Take the risk, take a call.</p>
