They did not plan to care much about drivers, as long as rental fees are paid, whatever drivers do is not going to be an adminstrative cost to them.

              <p>Wu ya bo? Transcab is owned by Teo Kiang Ang with 41 million shares. The rest are minority private shareholders with a few thousand shares, except for Tan Lee Tiang with 9.9 million shares.</p>
              <p>Civil servants, especially top ones are not allowed to hold shares in private companies lah..  They are only appointed to the board as officers/directors of the companies, not shareholders.  CDG, SMRT, Citycab shareholders are companies, not individuals.  Ppl like Yang Ban Seng, Desmond Kuek, Lim Jit Poh, Kua Hong Pak, Chin Harn Tong are directors of the taxi companies, not shareholders. They are appointed directors to represent the interests of their parent companies who are the shareholders. </p>

              With Transcab is to go into IPO, they will not make it, City Spring created by temasek was a failure, Teo being one of the top management there suggested CNG taxis, and he offered temasek a way out of it investment in City Spring, initial City Spring offer was 1.50, today is hover around a dollar and below, only good is their pathetic dividends.
              
              If TC is to cut off CNG, which they are diverting to diesel, City Spring will lost more, Teo in a way, is not obligated to public opinon as TC is not listed, that is also why, complain ta boleh jalan one

              <p>Teo was never a civil servant.  City Spring is an infrastructure business trust set up by Temasek and Teo is not on its board of directors nor is he an officer of the trust.</p>
              <p>He may have worked with them on certain projects, but that does not mean he is a civil servant.</p>
