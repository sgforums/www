              Stars are born out of the blue, so are politician, every parties got is own problem, the mindset of Singaporeans must be in unity, same goes to all TD of singapore, because Unity is the key to many successful thing. But how to unite is going to very difficult, and that is why great leader are well respected for the ability to unite it people.
              
              Singaporean must not look into just WP as a strong hold to challenge the Papaya, there are other parties who might hv some good candidates for consideration. 
              
              The aims is not to say which party should be there, the aims is to create a diverse parliamentary, in layman term, to hv different parties in the parliament, these alone will set pressure on the ruling party to perform and not suka suka set rules and regulation.
              
              For example, if WP had not won anything in the parliament in the last election, you think govt going to reduce foreigners, you think govt going to care about Singaporeans, the old ones and so on, and you think they will be so courtesy to you whereby in the past, they walk with air and look down on you, You see the changing?? 
              
              And in more lay man term, everyday eat the same rice and veges, buay sian meh?? add abit of roast duck, fish soup, tee ka also good mah

              <p><br>well, i feel they have more impt things to attend to rather than poking the Party vs people on the little india riot.</p>
              <p>Taking over Aljunied GRC from Party vs People is a huge task and i believe it's a can full of worms. To sustain a GRC involves $ therefore i believe, they are given 5 years to maintain that GRC if not ppl will vote PAP back.</p>
              <p>Given that limited resources unlike PAP who can transfer funds easily, they have to come up different ways to raise funds.</p>
              <p>I will still support WP as of now cause i dont quite like the way PAP runs their constituencies. Use cheap labour, materials and engage 3rd parties to maximise their profits, while doing nothing....The pinky and team are enjoying their father's hard work and not doing anything. Only know how to say sorry.</p>
              <p>For example, lift upgrading programme...how long liao? For example, i stay in jurong. In the past, there's 2 lifts just beside each other. Now because of that programme, every family has to fork out a certain amount to do the upgrade? Upgrade what? Shift 1 lift to another side? Initially i thought they increase from 2 to 3 lifts, i was wrong...only shift lift nia.</p>
              <p>After the programme, one of the PA member was actively distributing leaflets to say that there's a small gathering by PAP to 'celebrate' the completion of the lift upgrading programme. Then he ask me to join. i ask him. Join what? I even told him off. Your party dont even increase 1 more lift, only shift the farking lift. what for celebrate?</p>
              <p>I agree to most blocks that some do benefit from the programme but not all blocks. Sadly, my block dont benefit from it.</p>

              We all must understand the differences between action and present. 
              
              Take for example, a traffic police stand with his bike beside the road, what happen, every vehicle will slow down, become alert and wary, quickly switch to proper speed and for slow vehicle, quickly change to the slow lane. Each and everyone will check their belts, their passenger seats, and make sure no handphone on ear, but the TP did not take any action, he merely stand there only, and that alone created order and wary among all drivers.
              
              But when the police took action on a vehicle, the rest just slow down at first, then later, when passed by , will zoom to high speed and cut here and there again.
              
              Opposition party in Singapore is stil at it very infant stage, small and fragile, the role in action is going leave them with no concentration on other major things, and by intervention, they know that still do not hv the muscle to go against the ruling party who are still very much in control of the steering.
              
              What transpire here is that just being present, govt become wary and ensure proper system are in place, people problem are better attended and citizen sentiment are proper aligned with their policies.

              WP or smlj party, I am not going to give a damn if they perform or not, as long as opposition holds more seat in the parliament, our govt, the PAP must be on the ball, that is what we must look for, to add pressure on them to care for SIngaporeans. Now without WP wining much of the seat in the last election, do you think
                              
              1. Govt will reduce the inflow of foreigner
              2. Reduce foreigner quotas
               3. Provide medical coverage for those above 65 
               4. Increase cleaner pay to mini 1000 
               5. Make employers to employ Singaporean first
               6. Cooling down the housing
               7. Increase taxation on foreigner including levy, personal tax and housing tax like stamp duty 
               8. Provide more buses and other transportation means 
               9. More and better healthcare 
              10. More engagement 
              11. More stringent on corruption including civil servants ethic 
              12. More scholarship and bursary awards 
              13. More rebate on power supply and conservative charges 
              14........ 
                              
               And if parliament got no opposition, PAP can open 10 tables, 5 tables of mahjong, 5 table of si ki pi 9. Reconsider on it 6.9 million population roadmap

              The case of today Singapore politics, it is no more a one man show, nor a one time pay all back system, this mindset must change inorder for us to progress to so called "True democracy society", there can never be a total social justice and equality, but if we can at least improve it, we can achieve a better living.

              To be frank, altho singaporeans do criticise our ruling party, most of them, especially the oldies and middle ages are still glued to the doctrine of LKY, this mindset hv to change, the mindset of ...aiya, govt alway win lah, aiya, take 5 cts later give back $100, common lah, aiya, we are all control by govt,.where got you said one...
              
              Typically, you see all these chanting and grumbling or even scolding at every corner of Singapore including social media, but at the end of the day, the oldies still hv the mindset of LKY rule all, but time had changed, LKY is consider a legend, but a legend dun rule, therefore the main worry part for PAP, which they themselve acknowledged, is the younger one, younger TD, younger Staff.., these group are not influence by LKY, to them, he is history. My grandson called him...the rubberman.
