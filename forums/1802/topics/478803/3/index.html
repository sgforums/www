                  \There are many old folks who still prefer wet wet market, even you put the whole of NTUC cum SS cum Shop and save or prime below, they also want to go wet wet market. 
                  
                  This issue was last noted when SS and NTUC wanted to buy all the wet markets in Singapore to sell their product under airconditioned market, and all stall owners will come under rental + must order everything from them. Then all these stall owners bang tables, kbkp, public also bang tables..then govt scare lost votes. bo biah, allow them to carry one lor.

              Like TD, last time ownership, now become hirer and somemore must purchase their fuel for better discount and follow their rules and regulations, but that time, TD never kpkb and bang table, so now lan lan lor. 
                      
              If today TD is still ownership of his or her own taxi and Govt wants to change to hirers and no ownership, I think my ex chief will holds a taxi protest at LTA office in Sin Ming, sure win one..

              their product under airconditioned market, and all stall owners
              will come under rental + must order everything from them. Then all
