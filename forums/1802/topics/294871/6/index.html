Citing the price hike as a way of a bonus scheme for cabbies would not be a fair illustration. The nature of cabbies is to have an "unlimited" upside to their income ( of course not forgetting downside) thus comparing wage schemes would be inappropriate.<br><br>Next up, people spending on branded stuff does not make it an excuse for the taxi companies to raise their price. So if your point was that people would not feel the pinch if they could afford branded stuff, that is another fallacy.<br>So could mac donalds use that as a reason to rise prices.<br><br>So to the main argument that the rise of cost particularly oil prices is the leading factor to this hike. What I feel is that oil price up leads to higher cost..<br>Ok fair enough to rise price. But is this the real reason? Did the companies, cabbies, campaign for a lower taxi fare when oil prices were lower or for this instance would they ask for a lower taxi fare when oil prices were to revert to the old prices. That Im quite sure is a big NO.<br><br>I'm not whining here because I feel the hike is unfair for commuters ( although I presonally think that's the case) but rather at the manner it was raised.<br>The hike is simply exorbitant and for someone like me, an incomeless student, I would only be taking less taxis; definitely only when it's absolutely necessary. But I do feel for those who does not have a choice. A few dollars extra per trip can easily add up to over a hundred dollars INCREASE.<br><br>But this is a situation which cannot be helped. What can we possibly do?<br>Just less taxis I suppose.</div>

Up to now, they still cant decide who should set the fare. Fare setting was shifted from LTA to PTC and then passed to taxi companies. As I said earlier, this is like nokia setting your M1 phone bill rate! Wonder what would comfort say if one day toyota set comfort rental rate...<br><br>But then I think it is fair for taxi companies to set their own rental, but they certainly cannot control set the fare as well. Like that, taxi drivers slog and commuters suffer.<br><br>Think about this suggestion.... PTC set the fare... city surcharge $5, call booking $1 .... taxi demand may drop a bit, taxi will not wait for call, comfort dominance drop (much less booking), taxi drivers shift away from comfort, comfort reduce rental, drivers and commuters happy...<br><br></div>

This is not so.<br><br>He said four out of five believe the new surcharge also applies to the whole fare, including ERP and booking fees. In reality, it applies only to the metered fare.<br><br>Mr Azman said it now takes about 30 minutes to pick up a passenger during peak periods Â— compared to five or 10 minutes previously.<br><br>The perceived higher cost of taking a taxi is hitting taxi driversÂ’ earnings.<br><br>Mr Azman said, "Most of them feel that the 35 percent (surcharge) is not helping them. They are losing money and putting back the S$2 will help them. And that is also an incentive encouraging them to drive during the peak hours."<br><br>He hopes his earnings will improve when more people go back to work next week.<br><br>Comfort taxi drivers who still have the old fare chart are being given copies of the new fare chart, while new ones are being published.<br><br>The Corporate Communications Department of ComfortDelGro said it has not received any concerns about the 35 percent peak period surcharge on the metered fare from commuters or taxi drivers.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s secondÂ—largest operator, SMRT, said it has also not received any feedback on commuters confused about the new 35 percent surcharge.<br><br>However, some of its drivers have reported passengers saying it is too expensive to take a taxi.<br><br>TransCab said its drivers are experiencing a lack of passengers, but believes the problem is only temporary.<br><br>The Taxi OperatorsÂ’ Association, which represents the six operators here, said it has not received any feedback of the new surcharge driving customers away.

DonÂ’t have the 35%. This 35%, the public doesnÂ’t know, really. They thought that the increase hits their pocket," said Mr Abdul Halid, referring to the 35% of the metered fare levied for peak hour travel.<br><br>Like Mr Abdul Halid, some taxi drivers would like a meeting with the Taxi OperatorsÂ’ Association (TOA), which represents the six taxi operators in Singapore.<br><br>The main agenda Â— to assess if the current fare structure is the best for the drivers.<br><br>Meanwhile, SMART Cab OperatorsÂ’ Association says it has not received any feedback on the call for a return to the old $2 peak period surcharge.<br><br>Its president, Chia Hock Peng, said that if it does get such a feedback, the association will forward it to its executive secretary Chan Meng Dong and Seng Han Tong, its adviser and MP for Yio Chu Kang.<br><br>As for SingaporeÂ’s largest taxi operator, ComfortDelGro, it has not revealed if it too is planning to meet its own Comfort Taxi OperatorsÂ’ Association about the recent rise in taxi fares.<br><br>The TOA says in an email that it is still monitoring the situation, adding that it wants to give the new fare hikes some time before reaching any conclusions.

            <div class='col-md body'>I was at Tiong Bahru MRT going to Tanjong Pagar this morning when an old lady, probably at her late 70s (from her all-white hair and thin build), approached me and asked me in Hokkien which train to take to go to Bugis. She showed me a doctor name card and told me she needed to go to Raffle Hospital for medical attention, but did not have any idea how to.<br><br>I showed her the way to the train as I was heading there (Tanjong Pagar) too. As usual, the train was crowded. We managed to squeeze out a standing space right beside the train's door. As the train accelerated (and de-accelerated, or sudden break), the old lady had to press on the train's door to stabilise her body. On a few occasion she almost fell down.<br><br>Another standing passenger politely cleared out a standing space near the holder for the old lady. The passenger asked where shes heading and why was she alone. The old lady said that she lived alone and going to Raffles Hopsital. She continued to say that she used to take cab from Tiong Bahru but due to the rising taxi fare (and other living expense), she had to take MRT instead.<br><br>When I reached Tanjong Pagar, the old lady asked me again had we reached Bugis. I told her Bugis was a few station away but I had to leave her as I was rushing for work...<br><br>My feel is that as we progress towards a better nation, some minor group of people (esp old folks) are left behind. Most of them are retiree with no income and rely on their CPF for living. With rising living expense, this minority group will find it harder to coup...<br></div>
