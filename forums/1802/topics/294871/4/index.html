            <div class='col-md body'>Omg pooooor Taxi companies, you all need to raise fare so that the drivers can earn enough etc etc. <br><br>Pleeeease. It's not like only the Taxi Drivers ain't earning. If you can raise the cab fare to help the drivers, then who is going to raise our salaries to help us? Cab drivers can complain abt the rising price of the petrol or whatever, &amp; immediately the fares are adjust higher, so that we, the citizens are helping the cab drivers to balance out &amp; pay for the rising oil price from our own pocket.<br><br>But when the citizens complains about rising cab fares, no one even F u c king cares to raise our salaries to help balance the situation.<br><br>So what gives the cab drivers a right for us to pay more out of our own miserable salary to help them continue to earn the same/more amount of salary?<br><br>The conclusion, Just take a bus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>COME next Monday, prepare to fork out as much as 49 per cent more for a cab ride, now that ComfortDelgro, Singapore's biggest player, has unveiled its 'overhaul' of the current taxi fare structure.<br><br>This follows what it says was an 'in-depth review' of the taxi industry to address commuters' concerns, simplify the fare structure and encourage call bookings 'to better match the demand and supply of taxis'.<br><br>City Area Surcharge - Up<br><br>First, to incentivise more cabbies to ply the Central Business District during peak hours, the city area surcharge, which is now $1, will be raised to $3 between 5pm and midnight from Mondays to Saturdays.<br><br>The lack of taxis in the city at the end of office hours on weekday evenings is a frequent complaint from passengers, the company noted.<br><br>For drivers who are afraid of paying Electronic Road Pricing charges to enter the city and risk not getting a passenger, ComfortDelgro says it will even pay an 'ERP rebate' to cabbies who cannot land a passenger within 15 minutes of entering an ERP zone.<br><br>Late Night Surcharge - Up<br><br>The late night surcharge between 12am and 5:59am daily will be revised back to 50 per cent of the metred fare - instead of the staggered 10 to 50 per cent surcharges now in effect.<br><br>Will this revive the old problem of 'disappearing taxis' between 11pm to midnight? The company says no, 'given that the City Area Surcharge will be in force right till midnight, giving little reason for taxi drivers in the city to 'hide'.'<br><br>Peak Period Surcharge - Up<br><br>Instead of the standard $2 peak period surcharge now in effect between 7am and 9.30am on weekdays and 5pm to 8pm from Mondays to Saturdays, passengers will have to pay an added 35 per cent of their metered fare during those hours.<br><br>A detailed breakdown of this extra 'premium fare' will be shown on each receipt 'to ensure transparency', the company says.<br><br>Flag down, distance rate, waiting time - Up<br><br>As hinted earlier, the flag down fare will be raised by 30 cents from $2.50 to $2.80 for the first kilometre.<br><br>But the distance rate and waiting time will also be adjusted to 'more accurately reflect the cost of travel', it added. So instead of upping fares by 10 cents for each set distance or waiitng time, this will soon go up by 20 cents each time.<br><br>Specifically, every 385 metres for the second to 10th kilometres, and every 330 metres above 10 kilometres.<br><br>The waiting time will also be raised from the current 10 cents for every 25 seconds to 20 cents for every 45 seconds.<br><br>Call Booking Fee - Down<br><br>Bucking the trend of the increases, call booking fees will be cut from $4 to $3.50 during prime time hours, which are 7am to 9.30am and 5pm to 11pm on weekdays.<br><br>It stays at $2.50 for all other times.<br><br>10 to 49 per cent more in overall fares<br><br>Under the new pricing structure, ComfortDelgro says, the bulk of its passengers who travel during off-peak hours will pay 10 per cent more in fares.<br><br>All other passengers will be expected to pay between 18 per cent and 49 per cent more.<br><br>The biggest jump in fares will affect those who take cabs out of the city from Mondays to Thursdays, between 8pm and midnight. Instead of $7.65 currently for an average 9km trip, they'll have to fork out $11.40.<br><br>With all these changes factored in, ComfortDelgro explained, peak-hour cab fares in Singapore are about the same as Hong Kong's but still only half that of Sydney's.<br><br>Local fares are also only about a quarter of London's.<br><br>'Better match supply and demand'<br><br>Refering specifically to the current difficulty of getting cabs in the city during peak hours, ComfortDelgro's CEO (Taxi Business), Mr Yang Ban Seng, said: 'We think this fare revamp will better match supply and demand of taxis. Our aim is to try and ensure that more taxis will go to areas where they are needed most and at the times they are wanted most.'<br><br>Mr Nah Tua Bah, president of the Comfort Taxi Operators' Association, added: "The higher city area surcharge will act an an incentive for drivers to make that trip back into town."<br><br>Welcoming the increases, a joint statement by six taxi operators' associations called the latest fare adjustments 'fair and timely'.<br><br>The associations said cab fares should 'reflect the operating cost of the taxi business' and that the primary consideration should be the 'income stability' of drivers.<br><br>The group urged other taxi companies to follow ComfortDelgro's lead and also adjust their fares 'as soon as possible'.</div>

But why Sporeans can't? coz they got to stay here for the rest of their lives and earn Sing $ and spend Sing $. but for foreigners, just tolerate here a few yrs and return home rich! and these foreigners most prob come here alone and will get bored if got a day off and would rather work everyday. but Sporeans cant coz their families in Spore! and currency exchange also different when they remit money home!<br>big bosses are the ones getting richer and richer but at the expense of the poor!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How will cab fare hikes help?</span></strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : A day after ComfortDelGro announced what some say is the biggest overhaul of the fare structure to date, other taxi companies have taken the first step to adjust their meters too.<br><br>Smart Taxis, with 800 vehicles, is aligning its new fare structure with that of the market leader. Besides raising meter fares, Smart said it would triple the city area surcharge and impose a 35Â—perÂ—cent peak period premium to replace the flat surcharge.<br><br>The companyÂ’s managing director Johnny Harjantho told TODAY that ComfortDelGroÂ’s new pricing structure, which will kick in next Monday, is Â“reasonableÂ”. Â“If we do anything different or cheaper, we may not please our hirers or our commuters. It is best we retain a universal price.Â”<br><br>Smart, which notified the Public Transport Council (PTC) on Tuesday of its move, said the new fare structure will take effect on Christmas Eve.<br><br>SMRT, the second largest company here with 3,000 taxis, also notified the PTC about a fare adjustment. A SMRT spokesperson was tightÂ—lipped about details, only saying that it would release them early next week.<br><br>Meanwhile, PremierÂ’s managing director Lim Chong Boo said the operator was still considering and would make known its decision soon. New player Prime has said it would not raise fares for three months.<br><br>ComfortDelGro, which operates 15,000 taxis here, announced its new pricing structure on Monday designed to address both cabbiesÂ’ soaring operating costs and the dearth of taxis during peak hours. Passengers will pay between 10 and 49 per cent more.<br><br>The operator said this would Â“differentiate taxi services from public transport services like bus and rail which do not offer customers a pointÂ—toÂ—point dedicated serviceÂ”.<br><br>But observers TODAY spoke to are divided on whether a price increase alone would allow taxis to pull away from buses and trains as recognised Â“publicÂ” forms of transport.<br><br>Mr Han Songguang, a transport researcher at the National University of Singapore, argued that the fare adjustments are simply measures to manage consumer behaviour on the assumption that the demand is priceÂ—sensitive.<br><br>But, he noted, much of the demand for taxis is not so Â— tired whiteÂ—collar workers going home after a long dayÂ’s work, people carrying bulky items or many shopping bags, or partyÂ—goers. And for them, taxis fill the need for a pointÂ—toÂ—point form of public transport, which buses and trains do not provide.<br><br>Mr Cedric Foo, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for transport, called for public transport to be further improved Â— by keeping fares affordable while upping the level of service.<br><br>While the Government works on building a more extensive rail network, meanwhile, premium buses and express buses can help meet the need for better public transport coverage, Mr Foo added.<br><br>There are also concerns as to whether the new fare structure will benefit taxi drivers, who gripe about escalating operational costs.<br><br>With the general fare to increase by at least 10 per cent, there are marginal benefits for cabbies, said NUS don Lee DerÂ—Hong Â— but they would benefit more if they switched to alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, to escape the hike in diesel prices, he argued.<br><br>Mr Ong Kian Min, deputy chairman of the transport GPC, postulated that if the 10Â—perÂ—cent general increase deterred passengers from taking taxis, it might result in a glut of taxis during offÂ—peak hours.<br><br>Hence, he suggested that taxi operators come up with different flagÂ—down rates instead that could help taxi drivers garner more passengers during offÂ—peak periods.<br><br>Some observers hoped that smaller operators could be Â“more creativeÂ” in their pricing strategies, instead of simply copying ComfortDelGro, to give commuters a choice.<br><br>But Mr Harjantho summed up the dilemma facing an operator with a small fleet: Lower the price, and a passenger may still not bother to wait for a Smart taxi to arrive; raise the flagdown fare but keep surcharges lower, and passengers may boycott Smart taxis.<br><br>Â“In this industry, ComfortDelGro is still the leader. There is no way we can adjust our fares according to what we want,Â” he said. Â— TODAY/il</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When things (e.g. fuels, GST) increase, they will sure wan increase. When the price of fuels drops, the blood suckers hide their balls. If fuel is really that expensive, then go for the CFG cars lar. Still got govt grant to convert and much cheaper cars.<br><br>They complain no top up stations in mainland. If all taxi companies engage the service, u realli tink there wont be top up stations being set up? Consider the amount of taxi's in the market. It's a matter whether they have the balls to make the move coz the petrol stations will be affected the most.<br><br>Taxi drivers are just the prawns sandwiched in between and used as baits to get the fare hike implemented. Will the taxi companies dare publish their annual earnings and let the public see if they are really suffering losses. So far not even one campany dare come transparent and show the public that they are in the RED and thus to justify the hike. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Just another plot of the blood suckers (taxi companies). Just wait and see for yourself who emerge the winner if ppl tink the cabbies will stand to profit. Too bad most cab takers are all talk no action. They grumble and complain the most but still "LL" take taxi. If stay united and boycot the fare hike, see if they can survive.<br><br>I will definitely boycott the taxi ride from now considering how long had it been since the new price hike from the previous.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

But why Sporeans can't? coz they got to stay here for the rest of their lives and earn Sing $ and spend Sing $. but for foreigners, just tolerate here a few yrs and return home rich! and these foreigners most prob come here alone and will get bored if got a day off and would rather work everyday. but Sporeans cant coz their families in Spore! and currency exchange also different when they remit money home!<br>big bosses are the ones getting richer and richer but at the expense of the poor!</div></blockquote>Face the fact...our salaries level is of no concern by them.
