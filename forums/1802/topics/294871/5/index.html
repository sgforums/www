When the price of fuels drops, the blood suckers hide their balls. If fuel is really that expensive, then go for the CFG cars lar. Still got govt grant to convert and much cheaper cars.<br><br>They complain no top up stations in mainland. If all taxi companies engage the service, u realli tink there wont be top up stations being set up? Consider the amount of taxi's in the market. It's a matter whether they have the balls to make the move coz the petrol stations will be affected the most.<br><br>Taxi drivers are just the prawns sandwiched in between and used as baits to get the fare hike implemented. Will the taxi companies dare publish their annual earnings and let the public see if they are really suffering losses. So far not even one campany dare come transparent and show the public that they are in the RED and thus to justify the hike. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Just another plot of the blood suckers (taxi companies). Just wait and see for yourself who emerge the winner if ppl tink the cabbies will stand to profit. Too bad most cab takers are all talk no action. They grumble and complain the most but still "LL" take taxi. If stay united and boycot the fare hike, see if they can survive.<br><br>I will definitely boycott the taxi ride from now considering how long had it been since the new price hike from the previous.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>So ..... u see fuel prices to go down next year ???<br><br>I think more ups than downs ... to be honest !</div>

Tacking short term instead of long term. It is only recent years that the price of fuel shot up. There was a short stint where the price drops. But wat did they do? Hide their balls.<br><br>So if fuel still go up as u mention, then we are expecting more price hike again lah. A neva ending increase. Wah Kau! No difference from Pirates of the Straits. Too bad no Jack Sparrow here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hopefully they would honour their word that they increase for the sake of the drivers.

However, this will cease to be a problem come January next year when more CNG kiosks are set up in Singapore."<br><br>Nonetheless, the company does not think there would be more CNG taxis on the roads anytime soon.<br><br>"99 percent of the taxis running on the road now are powered by diesel. In order to convert to CNG, they need a substantial amount of money and time," said Mr Tan.<br><br>Prime said it is raising meter rates and city area surcharges in line with ComfortDelGro to attract its drivers into the central business district during peak hours.

            <div class='col-md body'>Govt encourage us to be smart and dun be too dependent on one source as you will be held at mercy. See wat i mean? Diesel price shot up, all of us held at mercy.<br><br>2 very simple examples will do:<br><br>a) We got held at mercy with price increase for water by M'sia, wat did our govt do? Source from Indonesia, have our own sanitation plant and produce New-water as alternative.<br><br>b) Again held at mercy for sand issue by Indonesia, govt dig into their sand reserves resources as well as replace non crucial components in structures by using less sand (better technology).<br><br>We had CNG as alternative but chose to ignore it. If the govt had still stick with the same old source, our price of water and buildings would have soar up already. Just a matter whether the men playing golfs wants to bother or not. To them, a simple and easy way is to increase price.
