            <div class='col-md body'>and finally the article is out.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Cabbies feel pinch, seek fare hike</span><br>Takings of drivers have fallen by about $800 a month, says taxi operators' association</strong><br>TODAYonline Â• December 3, 2007<br>Leong Wee Keat<br>weekeat@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>THE pressure is growing on taxi companies to raise taxi meter fares as cab drivers complain of rising operational costs.<br><br>The Taxi Operators' Association (TOA) Â— which represents six affiliates Â— has been in talks with taxi companies to raise meter fares for the "past few months".<br><br>TOA adviser and MP Seng Han Thong said: "In view of the rapidly rising operating cost, especially the price of diesel, the TOA has been urging all taxi companies to increase their taxi-meter fares."<br><br>Last Wednesday's increase in the price of diesel brought the retail pump price to $1.523, an increase of about 20 to 50 cents per litre from last year. According to the TOA, the "more-than- 20-per-cent increase in diesel pump price since early this year translates to a $12 to $15 increase in daily fuel cost".<br><br>The 2-percentage-point increase in the Goods and Services Tax in July also translated into higher taxi rental and call booking costs of about $2 daily. The association estimates that the operating cost for a driver has increased by $25 to $27 daily, or about $780 per month.<br><br>Taxi driver T G Poh, who has been driving for the past 13 years, is one of those feeling the pinch. Even though he buys diesel at a subsidised price from his taxi operator, Mr Poh said the price has also increased Â— from about 70 cents last year to about 90 cents now. He estimates that his takings have been reduced by about $20 each day due to the higher fuel price.<br><br>The increases in Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) charges have also hit their earnings, say taxi drivers. Mr Steven Neo said he would "think twice" about entering downtown areas to pick up passengers as he has to foot the ERP charge himself if he does not have a passenger.<br><br>"It'll be tough if taxi fares remain as they are," he said. "Costs are rising and we have families to feed too."<br><br>When fares were last raised in July last year, rising fuel prices were cited as a reason for the fare hike, with the market price of diesel Â— at around $1.07 per litre Â— having gone up by 30 per cent from a year before.<br><br>Singapore's largest taxi operator ComfortDelGro raised flag-down fares by 10 cents for normal taxis and 20 cents for limousine taxis Â— the first time fares were raised by the company in eight years.<br><br>Observers Today spoke to agreed that taxi fares here are lower compared to those in other developed cities, and increases in fares would help cabbies fight rising costs.<br><br>Mr Han Songguang, a researcher in the Department of Geography at the National University of Singapore, pointed out that while bus fares have increased this year due to rising costs, taxi fares have "lagged behind". He feels that fare increases for taxis will take place "sooner or later".<br><br>Transport engineering consultant Gopinath Menon said an increase of the flag-down fares would initially result in lower demand for taxis, which may be corrected as commuters get used to the new fares. A very steep increase in fares, however, will lessen the demand for a longer time period and may also affect taxi drivers' earnings, added the adjunct professor with Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>"Hence, there needs to be fine balance if flag-down fares have to be revised," he said.<br><br>Mr Seng hopes the taxi operators will address cabbies' rising costs "as soon as possible".<br><br>He said: "The overall taxi meter fare should reflect the operating costs of the taxi business. The TOA's primary consideration is the income stability of the taxi drivers when fare adjustments are made."<br><br>For now, the market is waiting for market leader ComfortDelGro to make the first move. The transport giant, with close to a 70 per cent share of Singapore's 23,000-strong taxi market, has refused to comment on fare changes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Dec 4, 2007<br><span style="color: darkblue;">Taxi fares likely to go up soon </span><br>Flag-down fare may hit $2.80, and the meter will jump faster, sources say </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By Christopher Tan &amp; Tracy Sua</span><br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20071203/ST_IMAGES_CTFARES.jpg"><br><span style="color: gray;"><span class="small">TWEAKS UNDER WAY: Meters in ComfortDelGro's 15,000 taxis have been adjusted for next year's public holidays, but the fix also includes a chip allowing the fare structure to be adjusted wirelessly. -- ST PHOTO: JOYCE FANG</span></span><br><br>TAXI drivers want it and their associations have asked for it, so all that remains is for the biggest taxi operator ComfortDelGro to go ahead and do it - raise taxi fares that is.<br><br>All the signs point to it happening, and soon. A year after the last increase, which saw the flag-down rate go up by 10 cents to at least $2.50 and peak period surcharge double to $2, sources say a bigger jump is imminent.<br><br>The flag-down fare is expected to rise by 30 cents, bringing the minimum starting fare to $2.80.<br><br>Newer taxis such as the Hyundai Sonata and Kia Magentis charge 20 cents more, so their flag-down rate should hit $3, The Straits Times understands.<br><br>Distance and time-based rates are also expected to change. Currently, the meter advances by 10 cents every 210m or every 25 seconds of waiting. After 10km, it jumps 10 cents every 175m.<br><br>Industry observers expect leading operator ComfortDelGro to make the first move this month, but the company has remained mum about its plans.<br><br>'Fare adjustment is a commercially sensitive topic, so we cannot comment on it,' ComfortDelGro spokesman Tammy Tan said.<br><br>For the past three weeks or so, the company - which has a fleet of 15,000 taxis - has been sending its cabs to have their meters adjusted.<br><br>Ms Tan said this was mainly to update the meters for next year's public holiday slots. There is a $1 surcharge for public holidays.<br><br>But The Straits Times understands the tweaks - taking around 20 minutes per cab - also include adding a chip to allow the metered fare structure to be adjusted wirelessly.<br><br>Taxi drivers have been calling for a fare hike for several weeks now, citing the higher cost of fuel and the two percentage point rise in the goods and services tax, which has raised their rental rate by an average of $50 a month.<br><br>Diesel at the pumps, after a discount, has risen by around 20 per cent since the last cab fare increase in July last year, raising fuel cost per cab by around $300 each month.<br><br>Member of Parliament Seng Han Thong, an adviser to the taxi operators' associations, said taxi fares should be pegged to the cost cabbies bear. He told The Straits Times two weeks ago that the taxi operators' associations have been lobbying for a fare rise.<br><br>'Although taxi drivers are always worried about losing business if fares go up too high...they still hope there would be a fare increase,' Mr Seng said.<br><br>Some quarters have called for fares to rise substantially to manage demand, so that commuters who need a cab will find it easier to get one.<br><br>Cabby Chew Lian Sheng, 37, said that is the 'only way to manage demand', since taxi companies are unable to put more taxis on the road because there are not enough drivers around.<br><br>Mr Chew said the flag-down fare should be between $7 and $10. 'There'd be a public outcry. But cabbies can earn a living with fewer trips.'<br><br>Mr Chew is also of the view that surcharges must be removed or at least, simplified, as they 'create an artificial market'.<br><br>Cabby Manjeet Singh, 62, said the flag-down fare should be $6 or $7. 'It's pathetic now,' he said. 'We should also abolish the surcharges - they are very confusing.'<br><br>Transport researcher and National University of Singapore lecturer Lee Der-Horng said simply raising fares would not solve all taxi woes. He said a 'package solution' was needed.<br><br>This includes having Electronic Road Pricing subsidies to encourage cabbies to go into the Central Business District; more designated taxi stands in the city centre; and simplifying surcharges.<br><br>Associate Professor Lee also suggested having 'a centralised call booking system...This way, passengers will just need to dial one number to get access to the pool of taxis from all taxi companies',<br><br>He said doing away with all surcharges may not be the answer. For instance, how can cabbies be encouraged to ply the 'graveyard shift' otherwise?<br><br>Nevertheless, he reckons the imbalance between demand and supply 'cannot be fully resolved'.<br><br>christan@sph.com.sg<br><br>tracysua@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
