This is in addition to the existing 80 stands. So, there will be a taxi stand within 300 metres from each other.<br><br>LTA has added more stands because it is prohibiting the hailing of cabs in the area from March 2008. Â— CNA /ls</div>

For the test you need to memorise 400 routes and bring the tester on a bike.<br>BUT<br>They earn 3x more and drive half the time as much as singapore driver(Check BBC online).<br>Are singaporeans willing to pay for that kind of service?<br>London cab driver can take their time with each passenger, more than opening doors and load/unload luggage.<br>Singapore cab drivers have to rush for the next passenger, their meals and have much less time with their families compared to their London counterpart.<br><br>What matters is not how much the fare is increase but how much the driver is earning. fares need to be more flexible.<br><br>1] flag down fare increase will depend on rental payment increase.<br><br>2]surcharge during peak period will cover cost, so taxi will go to areas that have traffic jam(CBD), meaning longer time per passenger, meaning less number of passenger. The worst the jam, the higher the surcharge, otherwise the taxis won't enter. they can earn more in the less crowded housing estates.<br><br>3]And how fast the meter increase should depend on the cost of fuel. diesel price increase and/or decrease in diesel subsidies will translate into faster meter increase.<br><br>4]ERP...taxis are public transport...shouldn't be charged or at most be charged a fix subsidies rate through the taxi companies.<br><br>As you can see the increase will mostly cover cost. The taxi driver's earning should only increase slightly to take into account cost of living.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiya, until the correct group of people get to set the taxi fares, we can talk until tomor about the taxi fare structure but nothing will be done... At this moment taxi companies are setting the taxi fares. Think about this - What do you think your h/p usage charges will be if nokia set your monthly plan charges instead of Singtel? It is sure to be artificially low, so that more will own h/p... and Nokia will reap huge profit and M1 will suffer... in the taxi case, it is worse, cos it involves many drivers have been driving for a long time and they are not trained to switch line easily...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyo, should have been like that years ago..... now is time for commuters to kao peh for 2 weeks, then demand will be back to normal..... I think this adjustment is good for both drivers and commuters. Even better for non comfort drivers. But comfort company will lose out in terms of much less booking liao... me drive comfort also will not wait for booking in town liao...<br><br>eh, poolman and fellow cabbies, what u think?</div>
