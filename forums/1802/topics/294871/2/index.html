Taxi fares are going up.<br><br>Taxi giant ComfortDelGro Corp has notified the Public Transport Council (PTC) about an imminent fare increase. The PTC could not say more.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Commuters can expect to pay more from as early as the week before Christmas</span>, as taxi operators have to inform the council at least two weeks before any fare changes.<br><br>For its part, ComfortDelGro again declined to comment, as it has for several weeks since speculation about a hike first started.<br><br>Sources, however, said the adjustment will include a 30-cent rise in flag-down rate. This would bring the minimum starting fare to $2.80. For newer cabs which meet the stringent Euro IV emission standard, the flag-down will go from $2.70 to $3.<br><br>Currently, ComfortDelGro has about 2,000 of such cabs in its fleet.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Commuters can expect changes to the distance and time-based charges too. Surcharges are also expected to be streamlined.</span><br><br>There is speculation that the operator might help cabbies defray electronic road- pricing charges to encourage them to enter the Central Business District - where demand for cabs is high.<br><br>The signs of a fare hike had been there for some time as cabbies and their associations have been lobbying for it for several months now, arguing the increase in diesel price and the goods and services tax have eroded drivers' income substantially.<br><br>The plight of cabbies is not lost on commuters. Said merchandiser Ivy Ong, 41, who takes cabs regularly: 'Will this fare adjustment be helping the taxi-drivers? If their taxi rental goes up, I don't think it would.'<br><br>Citigroup Singapore strategist Lim Jit Soon does not think ComfortDelGro would raise rental this time round as it wants to retain as many drivers as possible 'in this buoyant market'.<br><br>'What it means is that it might gradually remove some subsidies,' he said.<br><br>For instance, ComfortDelGro is still selling diesel to cabbies at 94 cents a litre, 36 cents cheaper than diesel dispensed at stations run by oil companies.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taxi strike over fees, fuel prices slows transport in Chinese city<br>BEIJING - A STRIKE by taxi drivers demanding relief from management fees and fuel prices caused widespread disruption to transport on Wednesday around the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin, drivers and local businesses said.<br>There is little public transport in the city.<br><br>The strike mimics actions in other Chinese cities by drivers squeezed by high monthly fees they must pay to their management companies regardless of how much income they bring in.<br><br>Exacerbating that is a nearly 10 per cent hike last month in gasoline prices that was not met with an accompanying rise in fares.<br><br>Staff at Harbin hotels reported a severe shortage of cabs, while one driver said taxis had been attacked, apparently by drivers seeking to enforce the shutdown.<br><br>'There's not a single taxi at the hotel, and we have received many complaints from guests,' said a receptionist at the riverside city's Flamingo Hotel who declined to be identified by name because she wasn't authorised to speak to reporters.<br><br>Taxi driver Wang Yuewu said fees and higher fuel prices had cut take-home pay to almost nothing for some drivers, adding his company had forced some to work but most were parking their taxis and refusing to take passengers.<br><br>At least two of the company's cars had their windows smashed by other drivers, he said.<br><br>While usually brief, such strikes have the potential to cause major disruptions because cities such as Harbin, a regional tourism and industrial center with 3.8 million people, rarely have efficient public transportation such as subways to fall back on.<br><br>The strike also points to economic turbulence wrought by rising global oil prices. While China subsidises the price of gasoline and diesel, some local governments have been forced to apply rationing and other measures to ensure supplies of diesel for trucks that keep the export-oriented economy humming. -- AP<br><br>Desperate persons when cornered can be dangerous... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Taxi fare hike a burden to middle class: Analyst</span><br>But before adjusting their meters, other operators await details of ComfortDelGro's plan</strong><br>TODAYonline Â• December 6, 2007<br>Leong Wee Keat<br>weekeat@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>AHEAD of an imminent fare increase that some say will deal another blow to the pockets of middle-class consumers, taxi operators are waiting for market leader ComfortDelGro to reveal further details before adjusting their meters.<br><br>This is despite the sentiments of at least one smaller taxi operator, Premier Taxis, who told Today that fares should have been raised as early as "six months" ago because of rising costs.<br><br>ComfortDelGro has notified the Public Transport Council of its plans for a fare increase. The council said yesterday that it has not received any letters from other taxi operators on fare adjustments.<br><br>Regarding this issue, an SMRT spokesperson said: "We are looking into it." The operator has about 3,000 taxis in its fleet.<br><br>Smart Taxis managing director Johnny Harjantho highlighted the dilemma facing small taxi operators, saying: "If we are the ones who take the lead by increasing our price, passengers can choose to boycott us. If you see our taxi, you can choose not to board; you wait for another minute and a Comfort taxi will arrive. On the other hand, if you want to boycott Comfort, you may have to wait for some time before a taxi from another company comes along."<br><br>Mr Harjantho said his 800-strong fleet might follow ComfortDelGro's lead in adjusting flag-down, waiting time and mileage rates, but not on surcharges.<br><br>Taxi drivers and the various associations have lobbied for months for fares to be raised in light of rising diesel costs and the two-percentage-point increase in the Goods and Services Tax. This week, Today readers urged taxi operators to do more to help drivers fight rising costs.<br><br>Premier Taxis managing director Lim Chong Boo said his company, which has about 2,300 taxis, has tried to help its drivers offset rising costs by offering free rentals and subsidised diesel prices to its drivers. But operators' costs are also escalating. "Our hands are tied. How far can we go in helping our drivers before our bottom line gets affected?"<br><br>Will the proposed fare hike substantially offset drivers' costs? Observers are cautious, saying that rentals will have to stay constant and that the "total package" of fare increases will have to be looked at, before taxi drivers can breathe a sign of relief.<br><br>What of commuters Â— already primed to face projected inflation of 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent next year, after a 3.6-per-cent year-on-year increase recorded in October?<br><br>Asked if the fare hike would cause further unhappiness, Mr Ong Kian Min, deputy chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for transport, said taxis are a premium service.<br><br>"People have a choice to take taxis, buses or the MRT. If they think taxis are too expensive, they could move on to other modes," he said.<br><br>But he acknowledged that those residents not well-served by public transport and who have to catch a taxi as a result could be affected.<br><br>Mr Han Songguang, a transport researcher at the National University of Singapore's Department of Geography, noted that the middle class and the less mobile, such as the elderly or the disabled, would be affected by the taxi fare hike.<br><br>The middle class, he said, is facing a "lose-lose situation" as the hikes will not have a big impact on the problem of the shortage of taxis, especially during peak hours.<br><br>What's more, "the middle class does not have a credible alternative. Cars may be out of reach and too expensive, while public transport may not bring them to where they want to go", said Mr Han.<br><br>October's consumer price index for transport and communications went up by 2.3 per cent as a result of higher prices of cars, petrol and increased bus fares.</div>
