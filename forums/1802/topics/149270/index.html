            <div class='col-md body'>In Johor Bahru's Senai Airport (the "Lapagan Terbang Sultan Ismail") there are special white-coloured (maybe licensed and registered with the Senai Airport) taxis taking passengers out to Johor Bahru.<br><br>Well, to get onto these taxis, one must first head to the arrivals hall, which is a 5 minutes walk from the departure hall located at the same level as the arrivals. Then, there would be a special queue after the domestic arrivals gate leading to the counter to buy the prepaid tickets (the fare for Johor Bahru is about RM 40/person ?). Go to the taxi stand which is outside the arrivals hall, show the ticket to the inspector at the taxi stand, and from there a smooth trip to your destination begins. (The trip to JB takes about half an hour, and could be more direct than the erratic Senai Airport Express.)<br><br>Here are the photos of these special dedicated taxis............please slowly enjoy!<br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/taxis/senai1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/taxis/senai2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/taxis/senai3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/taxis/senai4.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/taxis/senai5.jpg"><br><br></div>

However, fares are dependant on location. My ride was RM28 from the airport to a location 3km away from KOMTAR.<br><br>However, to go to the airport, you can take the normal public taxis..

JB Senai Airport has specialised taxis solely for Airport transfers activity, unlike Singapore ones which they can go practically anywhere for fares. Those white taxis for the Airport are probably ran by another company.<br><br>In Penang, the airport (Banyan Lepas), they also have this similar airport taxi scheme. However, fares are dependant on location. My ride was RM28 from the airport to a location 3km away from KOMTAR.<br><br>However, to go to the airport, you can take the normal public taxis.. Like this, malaysian cabbies has to work harder for fares, since the airport is usually have good fares...<br><br>Singapore cabbies some how is luckier that they can pick fares from airport  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div></blockquote>As for the Penang one, the Airport taxi scheme is too expensive, so we took a taxi secretly from the departure hall back then to the Snake Temple, not far from the airport.<br><br>Also, while I admitted that I had carelessly put the wrong dates on my signature, the trip to Senai Airport was originally planned to be on buses from Kota Raya 2.<br><br>Sadly, the schedule was erratic. The frequency could be between 10 mins and an hour something, instead of usual 30 mins on the clock face frequency (It was WEF 10 Nov 2005, and I had the photo of the schedule though.) And so my family had to take the taxi from the Kota Raya 2. Quite speedy but long trip though (33km from JB at about 45 mins).<br><br>Only when we return to JB (City square) did we took the white airport cabs.</div>
