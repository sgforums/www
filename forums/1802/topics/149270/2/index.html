            <div class='col-md body'>haha, thanks, Also, as I've talk to a sales person for Toyota Macau, they said the Corolla are the same spec as the Singapore STTA once, which is 200XLI Diesels, and also, the Liteace are the same as the yellowcab once...But the mercedes are little different..They are the Vito 115cdi (Which in Hong Kong are only sold as a panel van with 5 seats).<br><br>Also, the reason for Macau to introduce these new taxi type is because of the Hong Kong taxi Changed to use LPG, (which means the excess unsold cabs cannot be shipped to Macau (as Macau has no LPG station) therefore, Inchape decided to sale 4 seaters corolla instead (smaller size so it will fit the market better..)  and for a while there are more 4 seaters then 5 seaters (mostly mid to late 90's Cedric unsold from Hong Kong).  However, with the new casino open up, the demand of 5 seaters cab are high again.  However, due to both Toyota and Nissan doesn't make 5 seaters diesel anymore (infact, Nissan stop selling LPG taxi cab late 2004 in HK, pulling out a 36 years old market), they only make Singapore spec. 4 seaters.  Therefore, they introduce the Liteace 5 seaters.  And Mercedes also want a piece of the large taxi market due to tourism rising, they introduce the 6 seater taxis (so far only 2 of them exists), and Hyundai soon follow with 2 more example...BTW: around 2000 Mercedes did try to market the Mercedes Vito 114 LPG as an accessible taxi in Hong Kong, but they failed after less then 1 month of trial.</div>

As those Cedric were left over Diesel stock of Hong Kong when they switch to LPG.  Also, the market for taxi were used to be similar to Hong Kong (except the Isuzu Aska, Mazda 323, Toyota Corolla, which were never popular in Hong Kong in the early 80s, but popular in Macau)  due to the small size of Macau market, and similar regulation of vehicle.  For the Corona however, latter stocks were specially for Macau (as Hong Kong stops the sales of 4 seaters around 1990, hint the interior door panel is painted black/ white, but not red).
