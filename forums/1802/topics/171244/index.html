Hence, with little sacrification of convenience, we may be able to provide them a cheaper way of operating this public transport.<br><br>2) Diesel is related as a product from oil. Hence any increase in oil price will direct increase in diesel. It will likely to see raise as price is likely to be up/up all the way.<br><br>3) LNG will be practical when there is the infrastructure builted.<br><br>4) CNG may not be practical in the term of energy in gaseous form is less then it is in liquid form comparing the same volume cylinder. To compress gas, there will be a limit that you can go for.<br><br>(For your information, modules can be reduce to 600 times in liquidified form at very low temperature.<br><br>5) LPG As mentioned, it is liquidified, hence the energy is more than gaseous form. LPG coming from petrol as a by products, can be easily obtained. Look like the one you used in your house hold, bottled gas.<br>Compared LPG to LNG, due to the component inside both. LPG mainly pethane while LNG mainly methane. (Any chemist to help me on LPG? please confirm, I don't wish to misled anyone).<br>LPG will have higher energy compared to LNG (under same pressure supplier, cylinder volume, supply conditions. There is no need for high storage of LPG around any petrol service station as this only mean to serve taxi only. The various distributer can arrange and collect the bottles for refill at their terminal.<br>I would have taken LPG powered taxi, you can have air-con etc. Most importantly, the fare may be able to be capped at a lower price.<br><br>For your reading and thinking only.<br><br>I remain<br></div>
