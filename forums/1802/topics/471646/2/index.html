              <p>I dont think it's so much about terminating drivers of cheaper rentals in order to make a few extra bucks. Yes it will work out to a sum, an extra profit but this is miniscule to what CDG already making.</p>
              <p>Rather its demand and supply, they now have a large pool of potential hirers especially newer ones whom they can tie to a longer term because of contract. Because of this, they now have the luxury of being picky. Any driver that doesnt fit their bill, will be targetted for removal to be replaced by a more obedient one.</p>
              <p>That is the hazard of driving CDG. If you drive for them, you either be like my former hirer, everything for him cincai, never lose temper at pax, prompt paymaster and follow their rules.</p>
              <p>OR you look at your own interest and do things you feel comfortable but doesnt really suit their policy. If you do this, then you gotta accept that a day will come when they will terminate you. That's just the way its with them at the moment.</p>
              <p>Honestly I don't think CDG will actually terminate someone and then or because of higher rentals, rent to someone else who pays more. Eg an older Sonata that the terminated hirer pays at $104, they rent this out now at $114. I dont think so.</p>
              <p>Rental based on price of purcharse and COE. My former hirer got a new Sonata at the old rate, because it was purcharsed before the COE increase. His friend changed to new one also but paid more in rental because it was purcharsed in later batch. Both cabs difference only about 2 months, both brand new, so cant be 1 pay 104 and the other 114 just to profit more.</p>

              <p>Cdg now run by graduates or at least diploma holders, most rather young, for middle management positions. These ppl have to prove something to their bosses, so they come out with a plan to make CDG image better and the best way to do that is look at the public view first and then followed by how to increase profits.</p>
              <p>Most of them not like the previous time managers/officers - old timers who understand taxi driving, many were drivers before too. These new ones, never drive cab before and probably never will.  So they listen and imagine themselves as pax not so much as Tds, and as such come out with a lot of rules and requirements. It looks good on paper, it looks even better in national papers and makes public happy also, not forgetting LTA.</p>
              <p>Then they look at improving profits, so you hv more cashless to corner the market and urging drivers to take calls, especially newbies who must do 30 each month. I dont think increased rentals for older cabs is done, because that would be unethical and if it came out it was being done, you can expect a backlash if it came out in the papers or if the Oppsition raises this. Will make CDG look very badly as being greedy and selfish and profitting at their 'empoyees' (technically the hirers) expense.</p>
              <p>So with the younger and 'smarter' management, they only look at public view and then the rules by LTA, so they expect you to follow, if you cant or wont then too bad, you can go, because replacements are already in place, to take over the very same day you h/over your keys.</p>

              <p>Finally to end my essay today ( today off day - Sat/Sun what, so can write many stuff) - driving for CDG is an occupational hazard too just like drunk pax are occupational hazard.</p>
              <p>If you are obedient and cincai (everything they say you do), then driving CDG no problem for you, unless of course you sway kena 2 accidents in 1 year which is your fault - then that one automatic red - because of their lower excess.</p>
              <p>But if you like me before or someone who will follow most rules and ignore others, or really gung-ho, do whatever you like, then it boils down to your luck. If you lucky you can operate under the radar and escape, if unlucky kena caught or complaint twice which you at fault, then that's the price to pay.</p>
              <p>However there's still a small card you can play, if you break some rules - you have a very good reason for doing so or know how to cover yourself in event of compalint or get caught.  Eg: if you wear sandals but have a medical document excusing from shoes temporarily, then you can call their bluff. If they unreasonably sack you, you will raise this issue up with the press and other authorities.</p>
              <p>But take note, you cannot do this often, just once normally and you must preferably keep them inform - ie; inform a DRO or somebody officially.</p>
              <p>But in the end of the day, if you really cant be bothered with so many silly rules, then drive until your luck runs out. But dont worry, there are other companies. For TS, best is red - dunno if still got any Wish left, if not epica lor. Red not so strict, but got their own faults as well, somethings which CDG are much than them. You can't always expect everything to be very good all the time.</p>

              <p>This situation is more like image to me. It's more for regimental issues. Want you to follow this, want you to follow that. Learn this in army during liability period. You guys should know mah.</p>
              <p>In this market as of now, supply of ppl applying for CDG jobs more than demand of taxi on the road. Definitely those rotten ones / make slight mistakes sure kana golden hand shake. Unless the demand of taxi is higher than dont say la.</p>
              <p>Not happy dont join CDG lo.</p>
              <p>But i need to highlight this situation which is slightly different from serving NS. It's your dough bringing back to your table for your family to eat.</p>
              <p>NS happy not happy still can attend B, attend C, eat snake. You try taxi job to be same as serving NS. Some serve with pride, some serve with heart filling with shit, thinking why need to serve. As for me, simple equation. My heart fill with shit once i work in private sector.</p>
              <p>Difference between working for gahmen and private sector is that gahmen tell you to serve as loyalty to the country, to look after your loved ones. All bull shit one, they only want their KPI. Public sector equation is like A + 0 = A (if you notice 0 is infinity, it means tell you how big the sky, the moon is), results still A. As for private sector, A = A. Private sector is more realistic. They are almost shit as public but they dont smoke you like public sector do, though everywhere still have politics.</p>
              <p>NS very simple for me, all they want is attendance so as to hit their KPI. KPI = results = bonus in the fiscal year.</p>
              <p>Me simple, tell my CO. either u ROD me, u just see me come for attendance for show nia.</p>
              <p>Damn im way out of the topic. Anyway there are still other taxi coy, not only CDG. It's not end of the world yet. If really cannot find jobs, u can start to look for your MP.</p>

              <p><br>Well, alot of TD are old liao, and then young time, like me, play here and there, now engine and below brother all cannot stand liao,..so, yr under cannot stand is understandable lah..dun worry, we are on the same boat.</p>
              <p>You see, people, especially middle age guys tends to produce more hormone on egos and pride instead of sperm. Most given a new taxis is like becoming a boss overnite, full of pride, kind of like I can drive a 2.3 turboed engine kind of feeling, and relief will be like a worker working for me, as such, the lost in monetary become secondary, pride and ego had over taken it.</p>
              <p>As such, taxi companies, taking on these added advantages, rent out their car to one hirer, deal with one hirer and only look for that one hirer, much easier to admin and discipline. No rental, go for the hirer, accident, go for the hirer, LTA problem..etc etc..just call the hirer.</p>
