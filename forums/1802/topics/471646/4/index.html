              <p>LTA won't make it compulsory to have two drivers to a cab.
               They will just increase the minimum daily mileage such that
              you have to drive 18 hrs at least to hit that mileage. So, you need
              to drive 2 full shifts and automatically you need 2 drivers to do
              that.</p>
              <p>Now is honeymoon period, give another 6 months grace.
               After that, fine the Company, then Company fine the driver.
               You have no excuse cannot find relief.  You think LTA
              set up the online matching portal for fark?</p>

              <p>As i dont head or tail recieved a letter to come n see officer
              but cant go due to other  work.after a few days pai lang
              officer called n shouted why didnt come ,never recieve letter ah n
              i say no lah act blur ,oh ok he say if u dont come tommorow wait
              for terminate letter ,oh i got worried n the next day went there to
              see a guy name b*@ nard had a nice interview n say i cant wear
              shoes as my toes r swollen n he asked for letter n explain that if
              i did not come today u get this  termination letter ,he gave
              me the letter n ask me to go back n wait for another letter ,n sure
              enough after 2 days letter came saying its a final warning if seen
              again will get terminated,</p>
              <p>so in the first place wonder why there is no warning letter but
              immediate termination after seeing a relief whos been drivng for
              comf@#k for more then 15 years .so in the we must conclude
              ourselves that there is no sympathy or long services considered in
              this company so drivers beware if u get the cheapest rental go for
              if there is ,cause this company just wants to earn as much as
              possible n dosnt care a single bit about our welfare ,paying union
              money every month also dosnt helps,but lucky for me i got a final
              chance ,thank god i can still feed my family .</p>

              <p>My advice to you is go find an NTUC MP and explain to them what happen and how you were treated. Say you got medical problem, toe swollen, still need to feed family and drive and yet they treat you without compassion!</p>
              <p>This warning letter can be withdrawn if you do it properly and teach them a lesson in showing compassion and understanding.</p>

              <p>My only advice here is, never never take any organisation or
              companies as a human with a compassionate emotion, companies are
              just an entity for churning profits, create jobs and pay taxation
              to the govt. And when coming to taking profits, they can be worst
              than a monster.</p>
              <p>At all times, we must not have the assumption that loyalty
              and long services in a company can earn some respect from
              company, because when problem arises, frustration and stress
              increase tremendously out of nothing.</p>
              <p>You go sign a contract, being given a hand book and DRO
              explaining to you about the rules and regulations, you nodded and
              sign out a taxis, you drive and make your livinghood out of it, you
              paid rental promptly and follow the rules and regulations, you dun
              own them anything, nor do taxi companies own you anything, you
              agree to the rental, they provide you the taxi (tool) and all other
              thing for you to operate your income, they also owe you nothing.
              Therefore,</p>
              <p>This misconcept of company owe us a flavour due to our long
              services and loyalty is a thing of the past, today corporation
              can execute/terminate workers or drivers without a blink of an
              eye, because they got no eye, it is a non living thing in
              action.</p>
              <p>Many taxi drivers come to me and said I drive so long, I never
              commit any serious offences, I all the while very loyal to them,
              and so on, but I just tell them, they owe you nothing, nor do you
              owe them anything, it is a zero sum game. No emotion involve.</p>
              <p>Take a simple example like my former chief, so good and
              discipline with cdg, even wanted to bring cdg name up, was awarded
              as one of the best, but in the end?? what happen, and worst is that
              when you feel so inferior about it, you get more frustrate out of
              it, therefore, created a deep hatre. But if he had listened to my
              advice then, he will be a much happier man now.</p>

               name is Mr.xxxxxx ,a taxi driver in your company as I was driving 
              your cab recently I was spotted wearing sandals as my leg was swollen I 
              had no choice but to cover the rental I kept driving even when I am sick
               but it was unfortunate that I was spotted but why do they have to 
              terminate me without even counseling or getting a reason from me for my 
              fault even when I was caught twice at both times I was sick though the 
              1st time I came to explain to them they gave a warning but my leg was 
              still swollen that day as I cant walk wearing a shoe ,isnt there any 
              sympathy or consideration of my service to comfort for driving for more 
              then 15 years ,isnt there any consideration as a sole bread winner 
              providing for my 3 school going children of on how n where should my 
              family get their next meal?I mean
               your men could be doing their job of spotting bad drivers but isnt 
              there any system as on how to handle bad drivers such as giving point 
              systems such as driver beating a red light also were give time to change
               their behaviour  to and points to avoid another mistake and why cant 
              you implement this kind of system and avoid the immediate and drastic 
              action as to cause ones job n rice bowl for a minor fault .</p>

              <p>count yrself lucky...If sick or under medication, TD cannot operate vehicle...why ???</p>
              <p>Bcos u are endangering the safety of pax and other road users.</p>
              <p>When complaint are filed, TC hv to take action.</p>
              <p>and this could cause TC to kana a heavy fine by LTA when they submit their report every 6mth.</p>

              <p>My name is Mr.xxxxxx ,a taxi driver in your company as I was driving your cab recently I was spotted wearing sandals as my leg was swollen I had no choice but to cover the rental I kept driving even when I am sick but it was unfortunate that I was spotted but why do they have to terminate me without even counseling or getting a reason from me for my fault even when I was caught twice at both times I was sick though the 1st time I came to explain to them they gave a warning but my leg was still swollen that day as I cant walk wearing a shoe ,isnt there any sympathy or consideration of my service to comfort for driving for more then 15 years ,isnt there any consideration as a sole bread winner providing for my 3 school going children of on how n where should my family get their next meal?I mean your men could be doing their job of spotting bad drivers but isnt there any system as on how to handle bad drivers such as giving point systems such as driver beating a red light also were give time to change their behaviour  to and points to avoid another mistake and why cant you implement this kind of system and avoid the immediate and drastic action as to cause ones job n rice bowl for a minor fault .</p>
              <p> </p>
