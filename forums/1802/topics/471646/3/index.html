              <p>Clearly a clone by someone who wants to get us to open another kind of war with them, or as OT says, could well be him/them trying to promote their forum.</p>
              <p>Either way, no concern of mine. I don't normally respond to clones, unless I know who the clone is.</p>
              <p>Anyway whoever want to be chief/RSM/Lcp/Cpl all good luck to them. We only recognise ranks in real uniform.</p>
              <p>Anyway back to TS, I also have to agree CDG is getting a bit too far. Wearing slippers/collarless shirt etc, is acceptable to have some rules, but to terminate for them, even if 2nd warning is a bit too much. This not military. Terminate should be for more serious stuff like being very rude to pax, insulting pax, cheating etc. This kind of minor breaches should not equal dismissal unless repeated over and over again with numerous warnings given.</p>
              <p>Better to have a driver in slippers and t-shirt than a driver to sends pax wrong way and overcharge right?</p>

              <p>I think like it or not, every organisation had their own protocol to follow, if the set of rules and regulations did not state anything, I would agree that it is wrong to penalise or terminate those wear slipper or collarless shirt,</p>
              <p>but, by and large, its was written, noted and taught from every aspect of it discipline.</p>
              <p>Harsh it might be, but if a provision of lax is given, the consquences will be great, then we might see more cdg drivers wearing slipper and collarless shirt. It is a thus a corporate image that one have to follow when one is committed.</p>

              <p>My only advice here is, never never take any organisation or companies as a human with a compassionate emotion, companies are just an entity for churning profits, create jobs and pay taxation to the govt. And when coming to taking profits, they can be worst than a monster.</p>
              <p>At all times, we must not have the assumption that loyalty and long services in a company can earn some respect from company, because when problem arises, frustration and stress increase tremendously out of nothing.</p>
              <p>You go sign a contract, being given a hand book and DRO explaining to you about the rules and regulations, you nodded and sign out a taxis, you drive and make your livinghood out of it, you paid rental promptly and follow the rules and regulations, you dun own them anything, nor do taxi companies own you anything, you agree to the rental, they provide you the taxi (tool) and all other thing for you to operate your income, they also owe you nothing. Therefore,</p>
              <p>This misconcept of company owe us a flavour due to our long services and loyalty is a thing of the past, today corporation can execute/terminate workers or drivers without a blink of an eye, because they got no eye, it is a non living thing in action.</p>
              <p>Many taxi drivers come to me and said I drive so long, I never commit any serious offences, I all the while very loyal to them, and so on, but I just tell them, they owe you nothing, nor do you owe them anything, it is a zero sum game. No emotion involve.</p>
              <p>Take a simple example like my former chief, so good and discipline with cdg, even wanted to bring cdg name up, was awarded as one of the best, but in the end?? what happen, and worst is that when you feel so inferior about it, you get more frustrate out of it, therefore, created a deep hatre. But if he had listened to my advice then, he will be a much happier man now.</p>

              <p>In the laws of Singapore, it alway flavour the employers or the one who offer you a contract, so to speak. It is a very business flavoured laws in term of employment relationship.</p>
              <p>Many peoples do not know that a taxi company can terminate you without even a single reason, the laws provide them the perogative to hire and fire, to engage and terminate. Meaning they have all the rights.</p>
              <p>But if Taxi companies is to anyhow terminate drivers, then who will drive for them??, but that does mean they do not hv the right. It just like if you are owner of a house, you can at anytime terminate the tenant who rent it, and get them out. It is your rights.</p>
