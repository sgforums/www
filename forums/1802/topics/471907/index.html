              <p>SINGAPORE: A taxi driver who punched a motorcyclist was sentenced to two weeks' jail on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Forty-three-year-old
               Poh Teik Eng admitted to hurting 28-year-old Yen Chee Jiang by punching
               him in the chest with two clenched fists in February last year.</p>
              <p>The incident happened along Havelock Road towards Upper Pickering Street at about 9am during rush hour.</p>
              <p>Mr Yen was riding on his motorcycle behind Poh's taxi. The two men were on the right-turn only lane.</p>
              <p>The
               accused wanted to filter to the left lane and in the process, he jammed
               his brakes. Due to the heavy traffic, Poh had to turn back to the 
              initial lane he was on.</p>
              <p>He then tried for a second time to filter out of the right-turn only lane and again jammed his brakes.</p>
              <p>The victim, who was still behind Poh, sounded his horn and shouted at the accused as he rode past the taxi.</p>
              <p>A heated exchange ensued and Poh ran towards the victim to punch him.</p>
              <p>Prosecutor Daphne Lim said it is in the public's interest to deter such instances of road hooliganism.</p>
              <p>In mitigation, defence lawyer Diana Ngiam said the victim was the one who first shouted at the accused.</p>
              <p>She said it was under such circumstances that the accused reacted.</p>
              <p>Ms Ngiam added that Mr Yen's injuries were not serious and urged the judge to give her client a second chance.</p>
              <p>Poh could have faced a maximum penalty of a two-year jail term and a S$5,000 fine.</p>

              <p>When I am near my neighbour house, he come at me again.</p>
              <p>Again, I siam but he still keep coming, so I threw a couple of punches at him. He fell again.</p>

              <p>Yeah 2 weeks is very reasonable liao. I was in court these past 2 days attending a case.</p>
              <p>But I think also has to do with a new ruling from the High Court. 1 guy broke a taxi driver's finger, he got 8 months (VCGH because the finger fracture) On appeal in the High Court it was reduced to  just a few weeks. That case was also road rage, plus assaulting transport worker.</p>
              <p>Your cases perhaps under the 'old regime' nowadays we got a new CJ and judges who are more willing to be compassionate. Those days under CJ Yong, you jialat liao.</p>

              <p><br>Can why cannot, just that if Taxi driving can make one end up with a landed property, then you can see the Q for taxi all the way from kovan to defu lane liao...lols</p>
              <p>What I am trying to intrepret here is, landed can be your ancestors left behind, those like me, ancestor left with nothing, drive taxi or casket can never make one buy a landed property, condo already hei hei chuan liao.</p>
              <p>And childrens good or not is not the issue here, my sons and daughter are doing v well in their life, what I am trying to said is that, if ancestor left you with something big, it will be wiser to expand it rather than driving Taxi. Eg, can rent out the property, then use the rental to buy another one and so on.</p>
