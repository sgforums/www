              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Last week after some member got fed up with you and gave you a proper scolding, I told him, No, never mind just leave her. Let her keep her grudges. Whatever she wants to report let her do so. I can answer and willing. What to be scared? You think authority got time for such stupid things? Want to kena pluck go ahead report 100x also proceed. Always got 2 side. Evidence, ill intent - evidence ki lan.</p>
              <p>Then just now some member bring to my attention this following post:</p>
              <p>http://sgforums.com/forums/3317/topics/472952</p>
              <p>Knnccb stupid things threaten to report think scare dog will kill cat? Lansai la. This was the most horrible things ever posted. Knn that sob not just condemn LKY, he also curse him, scold him make wildest allegations what you do?</p>
              <p>Knnccb you entertain him, can join his thread and post some more. Maybe last week my member some say went overboard, but I think it was fair because your stupidly ban him and threaten him when your members insult and threaten him, call him names, he just answer back. But ok I give benefit of doubt and say my member wrong for farking you upside down for your patterns,</p>
              <p>But today when I saw this post by Dalforce and your support of him. Did you ban him? Delete the thread? All no, you support him, encourage him to make more wild allegations against the top leader of our country.</p>
              <p>So now I say this to your face - you are a real fucking shameless bitch. A pua ccb. 2 faced snake in the grass with no morals. Go ahead go report me, go sue me go do whatever fuck. You are the biggest hippocrite and piece of shit in the forum.</p>
              <p>Whether you make police report or not, I definitely will make sure a police report will be lodged against you against your forum and against dalforce. You really want to play, I will let you play for real.</p>
              <p>Knnccb even maybe I dont like PAP so much, I always give the due respect to MM Lee and what he did. I would never tolerate any forum member in 3426 saying such a thing.</p>
              <p>But you are so filthy and desperate for attention, you support and encourage that fucker to post such things and then go and harrass my members who are just posting here and talking to other tds. Between them, none of your farking business.</p>
              <p>All the evidence has been taken down already, and I'm sure got several members ready to lodge the report against this forum. I only pity Jason, he's a nice guy and did his best for this forum. Just that he chose the worse moderator by choosing you. A real low class, bitchy and no degree of fairness. But because you ruin his forum, you must pay the price.</p>
              <p>I am not making a threat but a promise to see justice is served. I might sent a copy to the PM's office of what you encourage and allow in here.</p>

              <p>Oh, it is my chief...finally.</p>
              <p>Dear Chief,</p>
              <p>Although I am a small player here and some said old ah lau driver, but I will like to give you some sound advices so that you can at least be more calm and have a better peace of mind.</p>
              <p>:You see chief, in my line of work, I alway see peoples on the brink of their death, and it is at this moment, what goes in their mind is a blank, and whatever they had done in their life, is all over, not even history. So if I will take it from here, why get angry, why create enemity, why keep holding on to your egos and pride, because at the end of the day, I can bet you, that you will find it funny and stupidity.</p>
              <p>As mature men, we should know when to get angry, when to accept and when to give back, and as you, a chief being look on by say 200 members, (mine is 12,600), you need to show a true leadership base on trust and responsibilities, not heroic nor ego drivern, what is right is right, wrong is wrong. As such, your members will respect you more and more, member increment will go on naturally instead of having to struggle for it.</p>
              <p>Because people look at who is the leader, you can be right that you MM Lee is a leader, beside his other bad motives, he, no matter how we look on it, created what we are today, peace and harmony with plenty of job, tho lower pays and more foreigners, but then, nothing is perfect, just near perfect will do.</p>
              <p>I hope that you can play a more truely helping roles than one that demand return, which is not helping but more on motives. Be true to yourself, who you are, what are you in, how old are you and let move on in a way MM Lee had created..and that is peace and harmony.</p>

Where got commander will disclose operational plans? You know what is intel and pschological warfare? Admit nothing deny everything, just follow your orders and mission. Ask your darling mod dont anyhow ban people then our members come here no need re-register. we never purposely clone. I only had 1 other accounts here which tio ban, this is 2nd. The rest are other members come here to defend our chief and group.
