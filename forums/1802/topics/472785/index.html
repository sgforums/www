              <p>I just don't like to see post go off topic, then some members talk among themselves, got army ranks discussion, apple polish about how good is their ex chief, worship him/her, try to recruit members to join them blah blah blah, then there'll be some flaming here and there</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to me its just disrupts the intention of the thread topic. And seems some members or supporters here not willing to let go.</p>
              <p>my understanding is 'poolman' should be the so called chief in past forum as I have yet to see him post in the new forum.</p>

              <p>Last week after some member got fed up with you and gave you a proper scolding, I told him, No, never mind just leave her. Let her keep her grudges. Whatever she wants to report let her do so. I can answer and willing. What to be scared? You think authority got time for such stupid things? Want to kena pluck go ahead report 100x also proceed. Always got 2 side. Evidence, ill intent - evidence ki lan.</p>
              <p>Then just now some member bring to my attention this following post:</p>
              <p>http://sgforums.com/forums/3317/topics/472952</p>
              <p>Knnccb stupid things threaten to report think scare dog will kill cat? Lansai la. This was the most horrible things ever posted. Knn that sob not just condemn LKY, he also curse him, scold him make wildest allegations what you do?</p>
              <p>Knnccb you entertain him, can join his thread and post some more. Maybe last week my member some say went overboard, but I think it was fair because your stupidly ban him and threaten him when your members insult and threaten him, call him names, he just answer back. But ok I give benefit of doubt and say my member wrong for farking you upside down for your patterns,</p>
              <p>But today when I saw this post by Dalforce and your support of him. Did you ban him? Delete the thread? All no, you support him, encourage him to make more wild allegations against the top leader of our country.</p>
              <p>So now I say this to your face - you are a real fucking shameless bitch. A pua ccb. 2 faced snake in the grass with no morals. Go ahead go report me, go sue me go do whatever fuck. You are the biggest hippocrite and piece of shit in the forum.</p>
              <p>Whether you make police report or not, I definitely will make sure a police report will be lodged against you against your forum and against dalforce. You really want to play, I will let you play for real.</p>
              <p>Knnccb even maybe I dont like PAP so much, I always give the due respect to MM Lee and what he did. I would never tolerate any forum member in 3426 saying such a thing.</p>
              <p>But you are so filthy and desperate for attention, you support and encourage that fucker to post such things and then go and harrass my members who are just posting here and talking to other tds. Between them, none of your farking business.</p>
              <p>All the evidence has been taken down already, and I'm sure got several members ready to lodge the report against this forum. I only pity Jason, he's a nice guy and did his best for this forum. Just that he chose the worse moderator by choosing you. A real low class, bitchy and no degree of fairness. But because you ruin his forum, you must pay the price.</p>
              <p>I am not making a threat but a promise to see justice is served. I might sent a copy to the PM's office of what you encourage and allow in here.</p>
