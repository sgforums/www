              <p>I never say CDG won't be like that, but they are more clear cut......</p>
              <p>Meaning? When taxi in workshop, smlj also stop liao, including Giro.....So some might have been otang a few days rental, CDG won't be so stupid to keep asking you to pay up knowing that your taxi in workshop......but, when your taxi is ready, we have to make our own effort to "chase" the arrear liao, or else, Finance will still be coming after you, because they know your taxi on the road liao......</p>
              <p>Other coy? Just too many story heard liao including bro Getcarter one......</p>
              <p>A very good plus point to drive CDG, not say you are chow kar, but most time due to environment, everywhere also need money mah, talk to Finance nicely, whatever promises you make to them, don't failed them, simple as that......</p>

So, it is more of a company culture, if boss got no social responsibility and allow flexibility, too much self interest, then such business dun last long, you can go up high initially, but when you fall, if will be a deep fall into the shitholes.</div>

              <p>Most cases of TD is such, suddenly need money, otang few days first, maybe let's say 5 days......</p>
              <p>But this 5 days arrear can owe very the long, becos even you put in daily rental, without putting extra, it won't decrease......</p>
              <p>So taxi coy must judge la, SMLJ also tow back, if I'm the boss, I see that the arrear never increase, this TD still making effort to put in daily rental, try to help him la.....</p>

              Brother, currently, Red are the one most effected by those private apps booking, and you know red drivers are mostly hot temper and bo yiew lan type, they will change wherever there is better opportunity. 
              
              The lack of welfare and care for their drivers make thing worst, but that is not for us to bother, during their high time, everyone were saying they are the best company, all the LV brother jumped ship to them, but some jumped into the water.
