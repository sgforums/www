              <p>Taxi drivers are bracing themselves for tougher times ahead, as the economy continues on its downward swing.</p>
              <p>And they also feel that the cash rebates announced by their taxi
              operators, while better than nothing, would not help things much.</p>
              <p><em>Jeremy Koh</em> has more.</p>
              <p>Taxi ridership has been adversely affected by the downturn.</p>
              <p>Prime Taxis driver Jeffrey Tan, for instance, said his takings have dropped by 20 percent in recent months.</p>
              <p>"Peak hour in the housing estate, i would say significant drop lah.
              People tend not to take the taxis. Last time even with peak hour, it's
              quite easy to get, but now not so, so we have to go to town area."</p>
              <p>Comfort taxi driver, Mr Pang, also said his takings have dropped by 20 percent since last October.</p>
              <p>"It's very hard to find people now. The call bookings are also a lot less. You have to drive a long time to find passengers."</p>
              <p>And after the Lunar New Year, when Singapore is expected to face a
              wave of retrenchments, Mr Pang expects business to be even worse.</p>
              <p>"It's not like bus, you have to take bus anyway since it's the
              cheapest transport. But for taxis, you only take it when you're in a
              rush, or in an emergency. Unless you have money to spare, otherwise
              you'll take the bus or MRT."</p>
              <p>To help their drivers tide through these tough times, the various
              taxi operators have decided to give out monthly cash rebates to their
              drivers.</p>
              <p>This ranges from about 25 dollars a month for Prime Taxis, to 51 dollars a month for ComfortDelGro.</p>
              <p>But both Mr Pang and Mr Tan hope that more can be done.</p>
              <p>"It's definitely a help, but without passengers, it'll be useless."<br> "I won't think so much help also. It's something we take as extra,
              that's all. I think the bottomline still, can they reduce the rental?"</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers have to fork out about 70 to 130 dollars a day for their taxi rental.</p>
              <p>Still, despite the tougher times ahead, Mr Tan said he's prepared to ride out the downturn.</p>
              <p>"At this moment, you want to find a job offer, another difficult thing also. Maybe more hardworking, drive a bit longer hours."</p>
              <p>Mr Pang also said he'll keep driving for as long as he can.</p>
              <p>"When the economy is bad, you have no job and you don't want to drive, what do you eat?"</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>the $51 is given by the gahmen. CDG talked in the ST about studying how to help out it's cabbies. So how? What's the conclusion? Don't tell me $51 for 6 months hor. Dare I dream of rental reduction or diesel rebate? At $0.95/litre without rebate, there's no subsidy to speak of. No wonder CDG's operating profit rose on diesel sales. Got "staff price" meh??? I joined CDG cos of 1) bookings 2) cheap diesel  3) Nets/Credit card despite them having the highest rentals. Seems like there's no competitive advantage now. Prime &amp; Silvercab (30 rental free days?) are looking more and more attractive.</p></div>

              i think he means evening peak no demand in HDB... nothing new leh.... evening peak always not good in HDB... maybe nowadays is worst.... it was never good for me....
              
              morning shift is mostly about HDB... evening shift is mostly about town/industrial....
              
              my benchmark of the performance of a nite shift biz... 
              
              - 8pm to 9pm town: if pax q for taxi means solid nite
              - 9pm to 1030pm town: if no pax q for taxi means shitty nite
              - 1030 to 1130pm town: if pax q for taxi means solid nite

              HDB - before the evening peak hr 35% surcharge, HDB also not much pax leh... the problem is mostly about demand...reduce fare also not much effect... 
              
              Town - with town surcharge and lower mrt fare and higher mrt frequency , more pax switch to mrt.... price can help boost demand... but again with every taxi usually full during 830pm to 1030pm , less price means less earning.... 
              
              maybe the town surcharge can be reduced after 11pm loh...but dont later complain that 11pm to 12am no taxi again hor... 
              
              and if no surcharge 5pm to 8pm, surely no taxi supply cos of high ERP... who want to pay high ERP to go empty to town.... me confirm go home sleep better...
              
              
              at the end of the day, taxi companies are the winners... cos most taxi drivers lower income also can't find other jobs...
              
              so taxi companies continue to huat in recession while maintaining high rental.... plus got diesel tax rebate windfall from govt... this year they more huat than other booming years.... knnccb...
              
              aiya say so much also no use wan... me just chatting and bitching... if got money, me start taxi companies and collect rental... haha

              <p><span>HDB</span> – before the evening peak hr 35% surcharge, <span>HDB</span> also not much pax leh… the problem is mostly about demand…reduce fare also not much effect…</p>
              <p>Town – with town surcharge and lower mrt fare and higher mrt frequency , more pax switch to mrt…. price can help boost demand… but again with every taxi usually full during 830pm to 1030pm , less price means less earning….</p>
              <p>maybe the town surcharge can be reduced after 11pm loh…but dont later complain that 11pm to 12am no taxi again hor…</p>
              <p>and if no surcharge 5pm to 8pm, surely no taxi supply cos of high <span>ERP</span>… who want to pay high <span>ERP</span> to go empty to town…. me confirm go home sleep better…</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, taxi companies are the winners… cos most taxi drivers lower income also can’t find other jobs…</p>
              <p>so taxi companies continue to huat in recession while maintaining high rental…. plus got diesel tax rebate windfall from govt… this year they more huat than other booming years…. knnccb…</p>
              <p>aiya say so much also no use wan… me just chatting and bitching… if got money, me start taxi companies and collect rental… haha</p>

              Tough time still can choose destination?
                If these drivers wanted to change shift,just display the
                location sign board there,i will not flag him,don wait  till people tell you destination then you say you don go!
                Obviously these drivers have earn enough,they don need any
                relief!

              <p>ha...you be the  taxi driver than....than you know what is all about at the time of changing shift senerio....tough time good time not much different and questionable, still all  taxi drivers are practising the same...everydays... maybe this sotong taxi driver forgotten to activate the change shift location on display, but one question the taxi  that you flagged still stop and asked you where you wanted to go, so is not too bad either... let it be...at last did you manage to get another taxi..so. what a big fuss on this issue...ya</p>
