              For the govt, the perfect scene will be those after 50s better die fast fast otherwise, very soon, govt will have to keep giving out pioneer packages, which is a huge amount in their budgeting.
              
              But the problem is, all these lau kok kok will live on longer, seibei stubborn and can tong very long..so govt bo bian, hv to increase carpark fees, ERPs, COEs, etc etc to give to these lau kok kok people, otherwise, they may lose vote.
              
              If the republic of Singapore is to change their constitution in election by only allowing those below 60s to vote...govt will not even bother to care for all these lau kok kok like me.

              "If the taxi industry wants private-hire operators to compete on a completely level playing field, then they might have to contend with Uber and Grab drivers being allowed to pick up street hails."
              
              But I thot Grab and Uber are now already doing street pick and Q at taxi stand, the field is already overly leveled.
              
              
              "So in the morning peak hours where we have inadequate supply of full-time taxi-drivers, many of the commuters' interests are served because there's supplementary drivers that come in the form of Uber and Grab, and these are mostly part-time drivers."
              
              Its is supply and demand equation, if there is no grab or uber, there will be many joining taxi companies, but since the option is given, most TD jump ship over to Uber and Grab, morning peak uber and grab are full timer, only the nite peak are partimer, how come they never do a survey and start talking cock...
              
              
              "For commuters' interests, if you level completely the playing field, and Uber, Grab and taxi companies become homogeneous, then we will not be able to have the innovative disruption that private-hire car brings to the industry," he noted.
              
              For a driver today, driving for uber, taxi or grab is still a driver, there is nothing innovative about it, taxi also got apps, booking and call, so are grab and uber, does the minister understood what is innovative disruption??? dun tell me driving is also an innovation? Go ahead and level the field, as driver, we can shift, but your GLC taxis companies might have to close.

              <p>simply, Gov dun wan to intervene too much, because Grab/Uber help solve the peak hours taxi not enough issue which Gov is unable to resolve despite introducing so many measures (min mileage etc)....</p>
              <p>more options for paxes and less complains from paxes also. some paxes also willing to pay higher price (surcharge) to take grab/uber since taxi also have 25% surcharge...Â </p>

              Well, everyone have his or her rights to earn his food for the family, if he or she can gain more, why not, why should I take a pax up to sembawang and game over for the shift, offensive, so be it, because the authority are not enforcing it, and given a call structure, why should I not wait for calls to earn more? 
              
              Today, more and more lower income people are getting poorer because of higher and higher cost of living, you could be right to say, who ask you to be poor, and it doesn't mean being poor can anyhow break the rules, but if I can find a niche in my driving that is a gain more than a lose, why not. 
              
              So what is the problem? no enforcing and high cost of living are driving people like TD, Uber and Grab drivers to break the rules and the purpose is to bring better food on the family table, morally speaking, that is not wrong, if govt can increase fuel taxes when oil price went down, if govt can put a EPR gantry here and there, if govt can collect $4 per entry ERP, why can't a taxi driver create his or her own niche of surviving on a cut throat society.
              
              And all these so called interview and waiting for call at peak period down at CBD is created by who?? Govt lor, smlj $3 surcharges 25% more...etc etc

              In many countries, even big one like USA, taxi drivers are mostly foreigners, and they go on street protest and strike to get their right against Uber.
              
              And they are just completing with Uber alone, we here in Singapore, the taxi drivers have to compete on 2 fronts, Uber and Grab...fair? And Singapore taxi drivers are Singapore Citizens, if it is foreigners, long long shenton way or orchard road kenna block liao.
              
              Govt dare to challenge local Singapore citizen's taxi drivers is simply because they knew locals are toothless, scare die, scare no job, scare here and there, disciplined since school days to army days, very easy to makan, especially local middle age to older generation of Singaporeans, but for the coming X or smlj Y group...they better be careful, these group are very much expose to globalization, they are not going to be like the Z and older generation like us guai guai type.

              We all kenna play out, taxi drivers in Singapore seibei ho jiak, why not he go study Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and many first world country that ban Uber..and they are still performing.
              
              If our govt is to care for transportation, it need to structure it well, it is either you want taxi or apps ride, full stop, if you are going to mix it like rojak and then roti prata it, the problem will persist and get worst, TDs are not unreasonable peoples, I have Hirers as young as in their early 30s driving to support family as sole breadwinner, it is trade, a job that earn an honest bread and butter.
              
              People take apps got other agenda, it is not even a trade, it is just a freelancing job as long as you hv a car licence, not just mainly to support a family, but to have a car, a travel machine.
              
              If the Govt of republic of Singapore is today dare to support it citizens and hold firm on it transportation structure with regards to taxis, only taxi can ply on Singapore road, ban all apps rides, do you not think all TDs will be happy and up their effort and antennas to serve the public better, if other 1st world developed countries can ban apps ride and still able to support it public demand, why Singapore govt cannot, especially so on a little red dot.

              When the stroked minister Heng Swee Kiat was minister of education, he was a one man show, (that is also why he got stressed out), then when he become Finance minister, it is also a one man show. 
              
              Now you get 2 goons to become Education Minister, meaning 2 goons doing 1 man job, so they are more free, more relax mah, and one of them somemore can be adult education minister...Wee!, I can also be..and citizens like us are paying more and more tax and expenses because now got more millionaire minister to pay mah.
              
              Then that Transport Minister Khaw now can get acting minister to help him, also very free, last time, Ah Liu when got help??? tong until resign himself. And of all thing Khaw needs to do to here and improve transportation, he go mantle with HongKong MTR for fark???
              
              If Limpek is PM, I sack my jia liao bee Minister, all these see collar one, can hardly make it, but the key word is usually, "if"
