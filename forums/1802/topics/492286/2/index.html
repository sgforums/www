              Aiya, I just comment only mah, we are not referring to cost, we are more referring to banning of apps ride, Japan uphold their culture and tradition very well, they do embrace new technology, in fact, they will be the first to go into driverless very soon.
              
              They can forgo economy to uphold their own homogenous value and culture, die die also not allow cheap foreign labours, die die also not allow uber into their society as such will erode their samurai spirit of never say die.
              
              We, on the other hand, see economy more than preserving local culture and values, if you have live thru the 70s, 80s and early 90s, and compare it with today, yes, you can see economy success, high tech and high education, but at the expense of losing your identity, value and culture.

              <p>This is very true. I came into this world staying in 2-room hdb in a now demolished flat. I remember the black and white TV, rediffusion, film cameras, cassette tape songs. No computers then. Only got BMX, marbles and tai chi quan classes.</p>

Last time no money to buy nice school bag so always envy classmates with rich parents, now I can afford LV bags, belts and shoes. No doubt I became a cabby during a low point in my life, but managed to quit it for good. Last time eat $1.50 chicken rice, which became $2 and now $3. Now I can afford nice restaurant food.</p>

              As a partime casket driver, I hv visited hospitals and homes witnessing many peoples (Locals) who are going to die soon but are still asking their childrens about the bank interest rates and how much this property will cost or that bonds and funds should be managed.

              Wha, brother, talk until so far for fark, $2000 is my fees, there are still many other expenses hor, like buffets, Malaysia 6% Gst, tolls fees, licence fees, land fees, undertakers cost...bury needs 4 manpower to carry hor, you think like our electric cooker ar, just push in automatically and all problem solved liao ar??
              
              200 years, limpek bones also gone liao. Be more realistic lah, today, youngs are also more realistics than us, you dun hv to take care of them so much one lah, many times I see lau peh not yet die, all cry and wail, when lau peh died, all start to talk about asset, bank account, shares, ....who get how much,...then if one not happy, call lawyers. Died already, they careless where lau peh buried or burnt, and like my MR Lim said, Money is the most important hor

              <p>alamak. kong oo kong bo again. nvm I understand. Salesman always dua pow to attract people, then when the buyer was going to sign, the salesman panicked because he quoted too low. I know because I did the same thing.</p>
              <p>For me, it is not important whether my children are filial or not. After I die, I no longer exist. What I set about to do in this life, is to compensate for what I failed to receive in life. I want to give to my children what I never received. Whatever happens after that, it is their choice. Gratitude, being unfilial or hatred in return are out of my control. I just try to do what is best while I am still breathing.</p>

              Casket and funeral parlour salesman are different lah, and up to today, there is no such courses or diploma in this trade, you can go ask any polys, WDA, or any private academy, there is no courses for this one lah, it is all base on own intuition and instinct.
                  
              During a CC MP dialogue, I once asked a Minister about having such course for people like me, How to sell casket and promote funeral sales, knn...all the ministers and MP laughed, including the crowd..nabey, even the polices on guards also laughed
                  
              So, if you think we panicked, no lah, for doing dying sale, what is there to panic about, because the basic fundamental is easy, and that is, in one way or the other, everyone must die, it is either you are on this side, or the other side.
