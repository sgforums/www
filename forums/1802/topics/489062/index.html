              <p>If our welfare organisation will just take him in like that, there will be a long q of people trying to be self-employed airport taxi q marshallers. Singapore got many homeless and sick people living meaningless lives. This country got no welfare one. Look at TAFEP for our PMEs, WDA assistance schemes, PGP medical benefits - focus on the entry requirements. None of the schemes will help the destitute old man picking cardboards and empty drink cans for a living.</p>
              <p>Things like Utilities-Save, Workfare, S&amp;CC rebates - are given to people who dont need it. They should pass it to these destitutes. Our system rewards those who know to game the system.</p>

              Aiya, as said, in giving, we should not question where the giving goes to, the essence is in yourself, your heart, your compassionate side and your blessing. 
              
              You give him $2, he takes it, it is his, and whatever he do thereafter, is beyong our control, the key lies that you give, after giving, you feel happy, you feel you helped someone and you hv a compassionate heart.
              
              You dun give him, also not wrong, no need to feel remorseful or guilty that you do not give, it is up to you, there is no rules governing it. Drive on and happily take your pax.
