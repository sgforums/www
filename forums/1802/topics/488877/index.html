              <div class="article-content">
              <p>NOTHING like a little technology to keep bus lanes more free-flowing.</p>
              <p>Since their introduction in 2008, CCTV cameras on board buses 
              have proven to be highly effective in deterring bus lane offences, 
              according to the Land Transport Authority.</p>
              <p>The number of motorists
               caught by these onboard cameras has plunged from 2,112 in 2008 to 866 
              in 2014, the authority said yesterday.</p>
              <p>And as of May this year, there were 228 cases - a drop of more than 50 per cent from the same period last year.</p>
              <p>The LTA said about 4,000 buses, or around 80 per cent of the total public bus fleet, are equipped with these cameras.</p>
              <p>The bus cameras complement wardens standing on the kerb during bus lane hours.</p>
              <p>Operating
               hours for normal bus lanes are 7.30am to 9.30am, and 5pm to 8pm on 
              weekdays. Operating hours for full-day bus lanes - marked by red lines 
              instead of yellow - are 7.30am to 8.00pm on weekdays and Saturdays.</p>
              <p>The restrictions do not apply on Sundays and public holidays.</p>
              <p>Retiree
               Gary Tay, 64, said he is always mindful of bus lane operating hours, 
              and has never had an infringement, adding that although "we understand 
              the rationale for bus lanes... it can sometimes be a little frustrating 
              to see an empty bus lane when you are caught in a jam".</p>
              <p>He said 
              that because of the way some bus lanes are drawn, motorists have to 
              swerve abruptly when they want to turn into or emerge from a side road.</p>
              <p>An
               LTA spokesman said: "To further remind motorists of onboard bus CCTVs, 
              we will be rolling out a series of banners and bus advertisements."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
               the authority has been stepping up enforcement of the Mandatory Give 
              Way to Buses Scheme, which was introduced in 2008 and is now at 330 bus 
              stops.</p>
              <p>In the first five months of the year, there were 2,336 violations, up from 1,764 cases in 2014.</p>
              <p>Motorists
               who fail to give way to buses pulling out of these bus stops face a 
              compound fine of $130 - the same penalty for those driving in bus lanes 
              during operating hours.</p>
              <p>Offenders who do not pay up may be hauled 
              to court, where they face a heftier fine of up to $1,000 or a jail term 
              of three months.</p>
              <p>The LTA said it will leverage more on technology this time to monitor how crowded bus stops are.</p>
              <p>In
               a one-year trial, it will install video cameras at five selected bus 
              stops from the fourth quarter of this year, starting with the one in 
              front of Thong Teck Building in Scotts Road.</p>
              <p>Besides giving 
              real-time assessment of crowd levels, the LTA spokesman said: "The 
              system will allow us to work with public transport operators to make 
              timely intervention such as adjusting bus schedules, replacing 
              single-deck buses with double-deck or bendy buses, or injecting half-way
               trips to help ease crowding."</p>

              <p>Situation very subjective.....</p>
              <p>In heavy jam situation without bus lane ruling, give and take, try to stay behind dotted line for any awkward situation arise.....</p>
              <p>If traffic is clear, my advise is just give way la.....whether we are before the dotted line or not, as long there's a bus within the bay.....</p>

              <p>During red light yes got stop before yellow box give way to the bus yellow big box.</p>
              <p>I talking about is when traffic is moving, near the bus stop got the mandatory give way white triangle painted on the left most lane. All vehicles are moving smoothly, then when one bus signal right going to come out, must stop before yellow box for the bus to come out.</p>

              Must lah, give way to bus is a good citizen mah, bus carry abt 20-30 peoples, you carry only 1 to 4 peoples, who bigger? 
              
              Got one cdg driver also never give way, bus come out...bang...who wrong? traffic moving, dept said, 50-100% fault, final verdict, 100% cab fault. End up driver engage personal lawyer to whack Cdg insurance...then end up tia kong, he was sacked, but still refuse to admit the fault, later it was settled at 50%, but his lawyer fee already more than the 100% aka $2000. siao eh
              
              It is mandatory to give way to bus, because such lane are using built in a way that buses once filtered into the bus stop, will not be able to move out as the traffic keep moving, so to help the buses not being late, such give way become a necessities.

              Get ram from behind is better than get ram onto others mah...the drivers can claim kau kau liao..if he bought premium insurance, he gets a free car to drive till the car is fully repaired, all at the expense of the rammer.
              
              I alway wait for someone to ram my rear...but all seibei careful...limpek want to beo those lady driving BM or merc...if they ram my rear..hosay liao
