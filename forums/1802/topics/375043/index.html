              <p>Hi all bros, I just got my TVL and had just attended the MDT course @ comfort today.  Sh hv read abt all ur experiences b4 signing up with comfort.  Too late now. Waiting for cab. New bird on the roads, is it better to get relief instead of OMO? I plan to drive fr 5am-10am, then 6pm-12am.  Any advice if timing ok?  Able to collect at least $250 per day?</p>

              <p>Hi Hornet! Welcome to the taxi forum.</p>
              <p>Better to start at 6am unless u got adv call to airport.5am hard to get pax unless u chiong straight to town example boat quay &amp; st james</p>
              <p>the evening part maybe start at 4pm better instead of 6pm.4-5pm good biz as many are changing shift</p>
              <p>$250 or even $300 can lah if u have the right approach.Morning part cover rental &amp; diesel,evening part salary.make full use of 2 peak hrs esp the evening one</p>
              <p>Good luck! </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Another way is start at 11am drive to 11pm (Mon-thur) then 4pm to 6am (Fri &amp; Sat)</p>
              <p>this timing you can at least have 8-9hrs of continuous sleep</p>

              <p>green hornet, today is my 6th days on the road. Probably i have found myself some niche.</p>
              <p>Not everyone is the same style. Just whack on the road for certain timing you plan and see for yourself. If no good, change and find out your time and territory to ply the road.         </p>
              <p>Poolman have listed a list of many "cabby type" and many more. Some people made good as Hotel Cabby, some are Club cabby and don't mind park their car there and wait.</p>
              <p>I have never tried all, but i think i am good in town area.  Becos 100 perecent of my lifetime living in town area. Downtown and West area are my favorites.</p>
              <p>I hate those area Alvn stayed like all the xxxgang areas.  If i sent paxs there, i don't waste my time finding connection in those areas.  I will become a Tom Cruise and slowly head towards my homebase via main road and secondary road. Not highway. If got pax, take it lor, if not okay with me.</p>
              <p>Hope my story help you as new starter.</p>
              <p>Good Luck.</p>

              <p>Yes Sir!  Will continue to learn from all of you.  Actually I still got some more questions.</p>
              <p>I will try out Teo's suggestions.  Plan A: I will drive from 6am-10am to try n cover rental charges n fuel.  Then rest and start again 4pm-12am to make salary. Will do so for 1st mth. If can't achieve target (at least nett 2.5k) then I'll try his other suggestion: Plan B: Mon-thurs 11am-11pm, Fri &amp; Sat 4pm-6am.  Sunday family day.</p>
              <p>U think I can make enough for familIy? I want to get relief for sun, what r the norms, eg how is the method to split rental/fuel? etc etc.  If really nite shift better, then I may consider full nite driving and let relief drive daytime.  But will take time to explore the different ways.</p>
              <p>Any suggestions or experience to share? 1 more thing I m only driving a toyota crown.  Don't know if relief will hiam?</p>

              <p>bro u can consider driving till 11am or 12noon,6am to 10am only 4 hrs...unless u can achieve $35/hr.</p>
              <p>Crown need abt $130 rental + diesel to break even</p>
              <p>For evening part I don't set wat time to go home,once I hit my targeted salary I stop.</p>
              <p>1 hr $25-$30,u decide how much u wanna earn </p>
              <p>Sunday relief normally is $10-$20 off rental. I charge my sunday relief $70 whole day.I handover taxi to him full tank &amp; he will do the same.It's up to u to decide whether need to wash taxi</p>
              <p>U can try to post at <a href="http://www.cabby.com.sg">www.cabby.com.sg</a></p>

              <p>Hey Teo, thanks again for clarifications.  Yes I'm willing to drive later till 11am or so in order to cover overheads, so long as I can tahan.  Jobless for quite a while already, so really urgently in need to make more $$$.  Will try out Plan A once collect cab. Now my only worry is comfort gives me lousy crown, then I shiong liao.  Getting relief to drive crown also not easy I realised.</p>
              <p>No choice, I thought can make use of the 6 mth incentives comfort is giving, so after that then may change to sonata or company.  Now only pray for everything 'soon, soon' can get good cab n start to chiong to find $$$.</p>

              <p>Hi all seniors, got a few newbie questions to ask as abit lost on certain things.</p>
              <p>Got my TVL recently and intend to drive part-time relief. As I am working shift, I only can drive on alternate Sundays and would like to try alternate Tues and Weds. All day shift.</p>
              <p>What is the best time to start on sunday for newbies like us?</p>
              <p>Have posted on cabby.com.sg and list myself on Comfort website and thru phone, but was advise that it will be difficult cos of my shift pattern. I went to Loyang today to get some hirers listing.</p>
              <p>Have received 2 calls from 2 hirers last week (ie . think is Comfort and Premier Merc) but no confirmation as I am a newbie and need to attend MDT if let me partner with them.</p>
              <p>Today, got another call. This guy told me  he can let me be Super relief for alternate Sundays or call him or he call me on which days I am free to drive. He say depends on which days, it could be Sliver Cab Crown or Silver Kia.</p>
              <p>All I need to do is go to Premier Cab alone to register and pay for one year insurance which is about $80 or 90 something. He will give me a cab number when I confirm to go down.</p>
              <p>I ask him about deposit and need to open any account, he say dun need.</p>
              <p>Just to check with all the senior bros here, it is ok to register like that? Legal bo?</p>
              <p>Also, if I register with Silver Cab by buying the insurance for one year, can I aslo partner with another hirer who may be from another taxi company (eg. Comfort or City Cab)? Meaning I can drive for Silver Cab or Comfort/City Cab as a part-time relief?</p>
              <p>Sorry for asking so many questions as really newbie. Thanks in advance. :)</p>
