              I guess most of you would had read the book on "Who moved my Cheese" if not, you can now get it on the net.
                  
              But that is a western version, in our context, it will be "Who moved my rice bowl"
                  
              As we move along, technologies, innovation, creativity and changes arises, and in today scenarios, these movement are getting faster and faster that we might not be able to catch up.
                  
              But if we remain status quo, meaning, dun do anything, we might be able to see our rice bowl soon.
              
              This is inevitable, it is not about people taking yr rice bowl or people snatching it, it is a natural process of evolution at play.
                  
              Someone come to think of Uber because he or she cannot get a taxis/ or that taxis drivers are too proud and arrogant, or that he observed a long Q but no taxis..or that from a business perspectives, can make a profit out of it. 
              
              Someone come to think of Grab, easy, Hailo and so on. And all these will not cease as long as human existence remain, because human evolution is a natural process.
                  
              So taxi/transportation of human on the road trade have changed over the years at a pace never experienced before and getting faster. 
              
              No sooner, you will see more new things, new apps, new way of booking will be coming, and thing like grab or uber may not be relevant anymore, as the like of LV or radio station are history and very soon, our beloved MDT
                  
              As such, we must change and adapt inorder to stay in line in this trade or any other trades, so to speak, no one will be taking away your rice bowl if you are able to accept changes and adapt to it, you may lack behind technologies and innovation, but as long as you follow up, you are sure to find a niche in your rice bowl. 
                  
              So, at the end of the day, like it or not, it is alway You, Yourself that have to make an effort to learn, to know, to experience and put it into a good use on a continual basis. But then, people tends to blame on others, the mass, the society, which in a way, can be part of it, but the most important is still "YOU"

              <p>Of course must adapt to new technologies.  But the issue is level playing field.  Taxis got to queue for hours at the airport for pax.  Uberx drivers no need. If you are the pax and got to queue at airport after your plane touch down vs no need to queue if book Uberx, which would you choose?</p>
              <p>3rd party apps have to follow the new rules and regulations to be implemented by LTA this year. This is to protect pax and level the playing field.</p>
