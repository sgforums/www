                  Why? because the big 4 apps investors are also CDG big shareholders..so either you use apps or cdg calls, they still utong aka profit, and because of anti corruption laws in place if not, these shareholders may even reward those apps managements with monetary, not only just thank you very much.

              <p>No lah, per 2 weeks, calculated wrongly, sorry. Read my other posts, these incentives are only temporary so we must make the best of it. Sooner or later they will remove them and uber style cars will eat into TDs earnings.</p>

              <p>The writing is on the wall - Uber &amp; Uber clones will murder the taxi industry here..</p>
              <p>Now we are at the first stage where Uber and copycat Grabtaxi tries to get as many customers as possible to try their taxi matching service. To do that, they also need to get taxi drivers and give them incentives.</p>
              <p>Later when the customers get used to their platform, they will slowly shift them to the uber car service. They can do that by removing the TD incentives so customers will find it easier to use the car service instead. Why do they want to do that? 20% comm is a lot more than 30ct booking fee lah.</p>
              <p>They will tweak the uber car pricing so that it can compete with taxi fares. But on the other hand, the drivers will get less earnings, right? That's why they are promoting to car owners who already have cars and any extra earnings they can make is good enough for them. Of course TDs won't be interested but they won't care less.</p>
              <p>So it is a little like crowd funding - get lots &amp; lots of part time car owners to be drivers. Each individual car owner might do only a few trips but when added together, it is a tremendous force.</p>
              <p>So Uber &amp; its clones will win (20% or maybe 10-15% also good), customers win with cheaper rides, pte car owners win with extra cash.... the loser? TDs lah.</p>
              <p>It is a scary scenario to think that TDs may only have street hails to makan and then again, these street hails will also get smaller &amp; smaller if the uber cars can be cheaper and more convenient.....</p>
              <p>Think about it....</p>

              <p>Said earlier already lah, joining the other side is not a solution also. Why? Because there are/will be lots of part time drivers (those agents, salesmen, etc) who already own cars and just need to earn a bit extra cash to cover costs. So they don't mind earning peanuts, how to compete with them? There are potentially thousands os such people around and that's the beauty of Uber's evil plot - making use of underutilised cars to make a killing for themselves.</p>
              <p>Of course drive on lah and see how. That's what I said, enjoy this golden period while it lasts but be prepared for shocks ahead.</p>

              <p>I disagree that it is about lost tax revenue. Simply too small for them to bother. It is about public safety and backlash if anything goes wrong. But they are already embracing these mobile apps so very likely UberX and clones will prosper here, IMHO.</p>
