              <p></p>
              <p>The rise of Uber is destroying the traditional taxi business, 
              according to this compelling chart from data compiled by the New York 
              City Taxi and Limousine Commission. It tracks sale prices of taxi 
              “medallions,” the pricey licenses that give companies the right to 
              operate a yellow cab:</p>
              <p><img src="https://static-ssl.businessinsider.com/image/54f04cf0dd08952a338b46e6-625-684/b-ldms5uiaehymf%20(1).png" alt="" width="625" height="684"></p>
              <p>The data was compiled by <a href="https://twitter.com/DonutShorts/status/570089747860869120">Donut Shorts, a Twitter account for investors</a>. It comes <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/industry/medallion_auction_current_and_past_auction_results.shtml">from the NYCTLC</a>.</p>
              <p>The scariest part — for taxi companies — is the bottom part of the 
              chart where the blue bars indicate sales coming from foreclosures.</p>
              <p>Medallions used to confer on companies a type of monopoly or cartel —
               you could not operate a taxi in New York without one. Now, however, 
              Uber lets anyone drive a taxi for the entry-level price of merely owning
               your own car. For many drivers there is simply no point in owning a 
              medallion or working for a medallion company. And so the transaction 
              value of those medallions has dropped off a cliff, even though the 
              economy in New York has gone through the roof.</p>
              <p>We haven’t seen anything like this in the UK yet but there are early worrying signs for traditional cab fleets.</p>
              <p>Addison Lee, which has a massive fleet of private hire drivers in London, <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1373303/carlyle-puts-brakes-on-800m-addison-lee-sale">recently cancelled its planned private equity sale</a>. And then it announced there would be <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/addison-lee-considers-job-cuts-as-uber-and-hailo-encroach-on-london-minicab-market-10044146.html">90 job losses at the company</a>.</p>
              <p>Uber’s arrival in London already caused protests from Hackney Cab 
              drivers. When Uber launched in Birmingham, drivers there said they 
              didn’t care. <span>“We are not particularly bothered about Uber
               coming to Birmingham,” Mohammed Taj, a member of Birmingham’s Black Cab
               Drivers’ Association (BBCD), <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-launches-in-birmingham-2015-2#ixzz3SwQKKrER">told the Mail</a>.</span></p>
              <p>The stats from New York suggest cab companies ought to start being bothered a bit more.</p>

              Whatever the competition might be, we as taxi drivers of Singapore are flexible and versatile in our own way. Grab, Easy and Uber had in a way, waking up our oligarchy taxi companies, it is good to have them around. As a driver, we are free to move, search and join for the bigger pie of share on the road.
              
              Uber can survive in a country of Freedom, be is freedom of association or freedom of economy and human rights, Uber can thrive in US because of it free economy, which is totally different from Asia controlled economy and some, even state controlled with a fake label of privatisation. And in US, business is very aggressive, the US business alway put themselve on a global model, meaning that when they want to create a business, they make sure they hv the planing and support and on a global scale, unlike our locals SMEs.
              
              Therefore, I see the restriction imposed by our govt on Uber shown a protective economy, and more importantly, on security and remain in control. For as a taxi driver, we are flexible, if Uber got no restriction and it start to bloom, we can alway change ship...just like our bro hamm, ct, ex chief pool and his LV kids..their ability to switch and change in according to the market condition is really admiring

              <div class="smallfont"><strong>Driver who allegedly charged passenger $97 for ride not one of ours, says Uber</strong></div>
              <hr>
              <div id="post_message_92306538">Driver who allegedly charged passenger $97 for ride not one of ours, says <span class="highlight">taxi</span> app Uber<br> Adrian Lim<br> Updated today at 07:23 AM<br> SINGAPORE - Ride-booking service Uber said on Monday that the driver 
              involved in an alleged case of overcharging - which is going viral 
              online - is not one of theirs.<br> <br> This is in response to a Facebook account by a passenger, who said he 
              was offered a ride in a private Honda car and ended up paying $97 for a 
              trip from Beach Road to Yio Chu Kang.<br> <br> Uber said that the car, with a licence plate SJT 1444Y, was not 
              registered with the company, and it has filed a police report over the 
              incident.<br> <br> Mr Joverst Lee, 22, who made the Facebook post, told The Straits Times that he was waiting for a <span class="highlight">taxi</span> along Beach Road on Sunday afternoon, when he was approached by a driver who claimed to be from Uber.<br> <br> Mr Lee, who was with his wife, 21, and his daughter, 3, and 
              one-month-old son, said he was told there would be a flat rate of $3.90 
              along with a $0.70 charge for every kilometre.<br> <br> However, Mr Lee said he was in for a rude shock when during the journey,
               he noticed that the fare - which was being displayed on a phone app - 
              had amounted to $50.<br> <br> Mr Lee said they were on the Central Expressway then, and he told the 
              driver to drop them off at the nearest exit, which was at Yio Chu Kang, 
              instead of going directly to his home in Woodlands.<br> <br> The final bill amounted to $97, with the driver changing his tune to say that the charge was $8 per kilometre instead.<br> <br> Mr Lee, who works in the construction industry, said he was concerned 
              with the safety of his family then. "I didn't want to do anything harsh,
               I paid him the money and just go," he added.<br> <br> Mr Lee's story has gone viral on Facebook, being shared more than 9,600 times as of 11pm on Monday, with over 1,700 likes.<br> <br> An Uber spokesman said this is the first case of its kind here, and that
               all of its rides are booked through the Uber app and the company does 
              not allow street hails.</div>

              <div>Driver who allegedly charged passenger $97 for ride not one of
              ours, says <span class="">taxi</span> app Uber<br>
              Adrian Lim<br>
              Updated today at 07:23 AM<br>
              SINGAPORE - Ride-booking service Uber said on Monday that the
              driver involved in an alleged case of overcharging - which is going
              viral online - is not one of theirs.<br>
              <br>
              This is in response to a Facebook account by a passenger, who said
              he was offered a ride in a private Honda car and ended up paying
              $97 for a trip from Beach Road to Yio Chu Kang.<br>
              <br>
              Uber said that the car, with a licence plate SJT 1444Y, was not
              registered with the company, and it has filed a police report over
              the incident.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Joverst Lee, 22, who made the Facebook post, told The Straits
              Times that he was waiting for a <span class="">taxi</span> along
              Beach Road on Sunday afternoon, when he was approached by a driver
              who claimed to be from Uber.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Lee, who was with his wife, 21, and his daughter, 3, and
              one-month-old son, said he was told there would be a flat rate of
              $3.90 along with a $0.70 charge for every kilometre.<br>
              <br>
              However, Mr Lee said he was in for a rude shock when during the
              journey, he noticed that the fare - which was being displayed on a
              phone app - had amounted to $50.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Lee said they were on the Central Expressway then, and he told
              the driver to drop them off at the nearest exit, which was at Yio
              Chu Kang, instead of going directly to his home in Woodlands.<br>
              <br>
              The final bill amounted to $97, with the driver changing his tune
              to say that the charge was $8 per kilometre instead.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Lee, who works in the construction industry, said he was
              concerned with the safety of his family then. "I didn't want to do
              anything harsh, I paid him the money and just go," he added.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Lee's story has gone viral on Facebook, being shared more than
              9,600 times as of 11pm on Monday, with over 1,700 likes.<br>
              <br>
              An Uber spokesman said this is the first case of its kind here, and
              that all of its rides are booked through the Uber app and the
              company does not allow street hails.</div>

              Uber or teochew ber will of cos said Not their Driver lah...even if he had driven for them for years...that is the problem with Uber, no authentication, no identification of driver, anything can just wipe off. Which organisation will be in the right mind to admit??
              
              That is why Govt aka LTA is not happy with Uber, you know our govt work in a way of control, this control, that control, every one of us as TD are registered and easily get identified, but currently many Uber drivers are only register in their account, not with LTA.

              Oligarchy meaning a country, business, etc., that is controlled by a small group of people. : the people that control a country or a sole business. 
              
              All these farking companies, from cdg to TC to smrt and including LTA are in a way competitor, but when it comes to making money, they are a united group...and when they decide on thing in regards to Taxis, your life and my life and our family life will be affected.

              <h2>Fake Uber driver: Vehicle impounded, LTA investigating<br></h2>
              <p><strong> </strong><strong><br></strong><br><strong> The Land Transport Authority says it takes a serious view of 
              complaints about a person posing as an Uber driver and overcharging 
              passengers.</strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said a 
              vehicle allegedly being used by a person masquerading as an Uber driver 
              was impounded on Monday (Mar 2) and the case is under investigation. </p>
              <p>"LTA
               has received complaints against the vehicle owner and takes a serious 
              view of the incidents," a spokesperson said. "If found to have 
              contravened the Road Traffic Act, which disallows private vehicles from 
              being used for hire and reward, the offender may face possible fines, 
              imprisonment and forfeiture of the vehicle."</p>
              <p>Ride-booking service Uber had earlier <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/car-sharing-app-uber/1690592.html">issued an alert</a> that the car in question with license plate SJT1444Y is not registered 
              with the company. This follows a complaint posted to Facebook that went 
              viral - from a man who said he was charged S$97 for a trip with his 
              family from Beach Road to Yio Chu Kang. Uber has filed a police report.</p>
              <p>Mr Joverst Lee's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1011898362172154&amp;set=a.389305291098134.105936.100000559982993&amp;type=1&amp;fref=nf">post</a> has been shared more than 10,000 times. The 22-year-old technical 
              applicator said the driver asked for cash payment, saying he does not 
              accept payment by NETS, and did not provide a receipt.<br><br>Mr Lee and
               his family were intending to travel to Woodlands but stopped the car 
              when they realised that the fare had shot up to S$50. Within three 
              minutes of stopping the car, the fare had increased to S$97, he said.<br><br>The
               estimated fare on Uber's website from Beach Road to Woodlands, under 
              the UberExec service, is between S$58 to S$74. Uber transactions are 
              normally cashless, and drivers are reimbursed by the company.<br><br>Mr Lee said he lodged a complaint with the police on Tuesday.<br><br><strong>S$168 TAXI RIDE</strong></p>
              <p>His
               Facebook post has prompted others allegedly cheated by the same driver 
              to come forth to share their story. Mr Kenneth Yeo, 35, a sales manager,
               said he was charged $168 by the driver for a journey from Emerald Hill 
              to Marine Parade.</p>
              <p>He echoed Mr Lee's experience, saying the driver
               had used an iPhone app as a fare meter. And he said the driver insisted
               on cash payment instead of the usual online payment method via credit 
              card, Paypal, GoogleWallet or Uber Credits. "Uber taxis usually charge 
              to my credit card, therefore I assume he was able to charge to my credit
               card. But he explained that he is driving under Uber Executive 
              (UberExec), which collects cash," said Mr Yeo.</p>
              <p>A check with a fare
               estimate feature on Uber's website shows the estimated charge for a 
              ride between Emerald Hill and Marine Parade under UberExec service would
               cost S$28 to S$36.<br><br><strong>MAN ASSISTING POLICE WITH INVESTIGATIONS </strong></p>
              <p>Channel
               NewsAsia understands that a 29-year-old man is assisting police with 
              investigations in connection with the case. Police said they received a 
              call for assistance on Feb 18 at Unity Street, and a criminal breach of 
              trust was reported when they arrived at the scene. The car involved in 
              that case, is believed to bear the same licence plate.</p>
