              <p>If you talk about religion, be it ah Jesus or ah buddha or

              <p>However, we prefer to put it from a commerical perspective, one
              of the most important aspect is safety, which is the most critical,
              but stopping is one of the most sensible, Good for drivers, good
              for paxs, and good for other road users.</p>
              <p>You can remain silent and get insulted and abused by pax all the
              way, but no matter how you remain quiet, your mind will be cursing
              and racing mad, of course, your believe like religion might calm
              you down, but I can tell you that if there is a God, he or she
              would advice you to stop due to <span>SAFETY</span>.</p>
              <p><span>CDG</span> should get rid of the mindset of alway
              pax is right and that cdg usually support paxs, this, I believe is
              the old mindset that happen when <span>CDG</span> was the
              sole taxi operators and call centres in Singapore. Today,
              <span>CDG</span> do lend a listening ear to driver and
              respect them more…why? because no cdg, still got TC, smrt, silver
              with Grab..Easy..</p>
              <p>The game had changed, drivers should be more bold when make firm

              <p>Yes you are right lah. Dont be afraid of complaint if you are in the right. But my point is that it is no point getting into an argument or a confrontation cos it will only spoil your day n affect your mood to drive n earn money.</p>
              <p>if can tahan the noise, just let it be n do your job. If really can't, then stop the car n ask the guy to shut up or get out.</p>

              I agreed to a point that in some rare issue, you do not need to argue, maybe we make a wrong turn or dunno the way, yes, we can get insulted in a way of our profession, we remain quite and move on, after scolding, pax remain quiet and that endanger no one in term of safety.
                  
              But in this case, cabby do no wrong, and the insult is all the way in a commanding and abusing directives that goes deep into our pattern of driving and trying to control it, at the same time making unreasonable demand like "you make sure no more car cut into my lane"...is that abusive and endangering beside self, pax and also other road users?
                  
              If you let this guy dictate your way of driving, then you are not in control, and if you remain quiet...the next taxi he board might be my cab...and he will do the same, sooner or later, he might meet someone like bro hammer...what will be the consquences, or someone like my timid bro Ah fool, he might lost his concentration and knock into a kid on the red light or zebra crossing..touch wood.
                  
              I will alway take my arguement back as a justification of saving the public, other cab drivers, my dignity and also this guy future.

              Ultimately TD should believe in his or hers judgement in terms of road directions or otherwise.
              many times paxs are blur themselves.  Give wrong directions and later complaint . My friend kena. ..listen to pax and pax later call cdg  to complaint.  
              Dun let paxs detate you.

                  Brother brother, it is good to have a CSI mind that challenge issue from the underdog perspectives, tho empty talk it might be, we might probe into more evidences and maybe an alibi (a claim or piece of evidence that one was elsewhere when an act, typically a criminal one, is alleged to have taken place). Appreciated.

              However, you might be threading on the wrong water, this is a taxi forum, not stomp or facebook or some smlj youth or PAP forums.
              
              So, with that in mind, hope you can take yr arguement to another platform that support and sympathise passengers rather than taxi drivers. 
              
              Unless you can prove otherwise, when come into pax ignorances and fark up behavorial, TDs are united. 
              
              
              But when it comes to calls, grabs, Q and on the road, they are not united, instead they become competitors.

              <p><br> Brother brother, it is good to have a CSI mind that challenge issue
              from the underdog perspectives, tho empty talk it might be, we
              might probe into more evidences and maybe an alibi (a claim or
              piece of evidence that one was elsewhere when an act, typically a
              criminal one, is alleged to have taken place). Appreciated. Bowah,

              <p>We cannot control people mouth. And we also cannot condemn
              people just because of the F and A word that they say in anger. The
              PCB pax salah first, the taxi unker can either choose to beat him,
              or stop the car and ask him to get off, or to suan him online.
              Different people got different style of expressing their anger.
              Maybe the daughter should not say Fucker or Asshole. But she was
              very mad, so let her vent lor...  Its not a crime, the police
              cannot do anything. If I say she is a bad girl, then I must be
              worse because I said many bad things before. Suak liao lar.</p>
