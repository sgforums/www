              No lah, gentlemen, 
              
              As this current Phua CB issue is hot, there will be lots of bloggers and journalist aka reporters trying to fish some news out of it, and TDs are in the main focus, so if you are approached, becareful, because only exclusively for this issue...your talk carries weight at yr own risk.
              
              "Even if the customer is in the wrong, you cannot pick a fight with all rude passengers or you will become very agitated," said Mr John Foo, 52."..so if customer want to whack you with a rod or bottle, you let him whack??? Just like one cabby kenna whacked by a indian until kpkb and even lost his spectacles.
              
              "People always assume we cab drivers can do wonders, so they keep shouting at us to drive faster," he said....who is the boss of the cab?? who is in control of the wheel? why allow people to shout at you, you can alway ask them to drop off without collecting any fare, because shouting at abusing you is dangerous on the road whereby safety is in concern,,,
              
              So gentlemen, dun be a good guy, alway stay in control of your cab and life, not let others including paxs to take over you, dun be a loser, you do not need to raise you voice, now why people like me, bro CT, hammer and his buddies got no such problem??? because they are in control, not pax

              Brother, dun underestimate some cabby Uncle endurances and tolerances, if u need to know more abt endurances and tolerances, can ask Capt CT, during his stint at OCS, how he endured and tolerated. Many of us are army trained, different from men of other countries like philipines, malaysia, india, mynamar and chinese, but koreans and taiwan are also army trained.

              <p>this taxi uncle who got bullied is someone who can endure alot of rubbish. No wonder his daughter respects him so much. How many people got sons or daughters who can help their father by using social media against rotten paxes? This taxi uncle has successfully fed his family, gave his children a good education and probably still married and not divorced. He has done well in life.</p>

              <p>this taxi uncle who got bullied is someone who can endure alot
              of rubbish. No wonder his daughter respects him so much. How many
              people got sons or daughters who can help their father by using
              social media against rotten paxes? This taxi uncle has successfully
              fed his family, gave his children a good education and probably
              still married and not divorced. He has done well in life.</p>

              It is because of his endurances, that is also why he gets bullied and still a Taxi driver. As a man, you should fight back, especially when your dignity and intergrity get abused. One might see good in him, but for me, there are many flaws in him, and I guess one of them is no guts, hokkien said bo ji

              <p>Bowah, he can fight back, I also can fight back, many people also can fight back, ISIS also can fight back and cut people neck off. But very few people can endure. Its not about balls. Its about consequences. If I start a fight, surely that fat man will die, or his balls will be crushed. And then what happens to me and family? Mai lah, here Singapore leh, not iraq or indonesia. I will fight only if I can get away with it. Someone as a cabby or pax with booking, yr ID can be traced easily.</p>
              <p>If there is anger caused by pax, breath slowly, spend some time to meditate and gain enlightenment. Fighting is a last resort. When pax brings out a knife or hits you, then its time to put kung fu into good use.</p>

              F1, fighting back does not imply you need to get violent with arms and legs, it can come in many form, for me, I will "suan" him until he cannot tarhan, let him have a taste of his own medicine, but internally, still remain calm.
              
              We can also use sarcastic remark back on him, or that we can also tell him go fly kite..if you insult me personally, I can insult you back personally, nothing wrong with it, its personal, not professional. 
              
              Like he said i want to reach telok ayer by 6.30, you tell him, "You want me to call cdg helicopter?" , then you see he gets more angry, then you stop and call police lor. 
              
              So, we have lots of avenues to plough our unjust treatment from pax, but if you keep tiam tiam and let pax shoot here and there, then this farker will take for granted that TDs in Singapore can be insulted, scolded and farked, hokkien said "knn...singapore TDs, seibei ho jiak and ho kan" guess that will be the way he spread his ho lian action to his colleagues and friends . We certainly do not want that to happen.
              
              We can hv defensive driving, we can hv procedure protocol if being rob or attacked, we should also have a personal protection against personal insulting by pax.

              <p>I discovered the "ignoring" trick when observing an incident where a guy was being scolded or suan by a girl, he simply ignores her and do his thing. By doing this, she lost all her power over him.</p>
              <p>That's why Jesus said "turn the other cheek". There is power in that. It does not mean let people bully you but it means don't react in a negative way because that will give power to the other person and make things worse.</p>

              If you talk about religion, be it ah Jesus or ah buddha or whatever, your believe overides your decision due to the religious discipline that you adhered.
              
              However, we prefer to put it from a commerical perspective, one of the most important aspect is safety, which is the most critical, but stopping is one of the most sensible, Good for drivers, good for paxs, and good for other road users.
              
              You can remain silent and get insulted and abused by pax all the way, but no matter how you remain quiet, your mind will be cursing and racing mad, of course, your believe like religion might calm you down, but I can tell you that if there is a God, he or she would advice you to stop due to SAFETY.
              
              CDG should get rid of the mindset of alway pax is right and that cdg usually support paxs, this, I believe is the old mindset that happen when CDG was the sole taxi operators and call centres in Singapore. Today, CDG do lend a listening ear to driver and respect them more...why? because no cdg, still got TC, smrt, silver with Grab..Easy..
              
              The game had changed, drivers should be more bold when make firm decision especially so in regard to Safety
