              <p>229 caught in Sept, from 566 in March; ST check finds illegal pick-ups in some areas downtown</p>
              <p>THE number of cabbies caught picking up passengers outside Central
              Business District (CBD) taxi stands is dropping, the Land Transport
              Authority (LTA) revealed.</p>
              <p>But the practice, which was made illegal earlier this year in an
              effort to improve traffic flow, is still rampant in some parts of
              downtown, including Chinatown.</p>
              <p>During one hour last Friday, The Straits Times saw 10 cabs either
              picking up or dropping off passengers along Eu Tong Sen Street and New
              Bridge Road.</p>
              <p>Over at Robinson Road, there were six such sightings and at Cecil Street, one.</p>
              <p>The LTA said enforcement officers make daily patrols in the city, but keeping tabs on cabbies can be difficult.</p>
              <p>'The fact is (enforcement officers) can't be everywhere at the
              same time,' said Mr Jeremy Yap, the authority's group director of
              vehicle and transit licensing.</p>
              <p>The rule was implemented in March, requiring passengers from
              Orchard to City Hall and Chinatown to Shenton Way to wait at taxi
              stands on major roads. Drivers faced a $100 fine for picking up
              passengers on the roadside.</p>
              <p>The regulation met with resistance from drivers and passengers alike, who said it was inconvenient.</p>
              <p>In March, 566 taxis were caught flouting the rule. But the total dropped to 229 in September - fewer than 10 per day.</p>
              <p>Mr Yap said officers also noticed fewer passengers trying to
              hail taxis from the street. The changes are 'encouraging signs', he
              added.</p>
              <p>The taxi-stand rule was meant to reduce traffic disruptions
              and accidents caused by cabbies stopping suddenly to pick up
              passengers.</p>
              <p>However, statistics show no change in those numbers: One in three accidents that happens in the city involves a taxi.</p>
              <p>Cabby Yeo Seok Hock, however, said the taxi-stand rule has made
              a difference to him. The 48-year-old said he does not need to keep a
              lookout for passengers at the side of the road.</p>
              <p>His only complaint: Passengers do not know the rule or insist on hailing cabs from the street.</p>
              <p>'We (cabbies) have to follow the rule, but some passengers
              don't want to. And some drivers don't care. They are tempted by
              business, so they will pick up passengers,' he said.</p>
              <p>Passengers said they were a bit confused by the timings of
              the rule, which runs from 7am to 10pm, except for Sundays and public
              holidays. Others said it was just too troublesome to look for a taxi
              stand.</p>
              <p>Lawyer Prem Raj, 28, summed up the views of a number of
              commuters when he said: 'Sometimes, after a day's work, you just want
              to flag a cab and go home. You don't want to spend your time looking
              for a cab stand.'</p>
              <p>The LTA said it is continually looking at feedback on where
              more taxi stands could be placed. There are now 117, up from 80 last
              year. This works out to one within a five-minute walk of every major
              building in the city.</p>
              <p>Each stand also has directional signs pointing towards it.</p>
              <p>The Taxi Operators' Associations, which represents drivers,
              said it had worked with the LTA to identify potential locations for new
              taxi stands within the CBD.</p>
