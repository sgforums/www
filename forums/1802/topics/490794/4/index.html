              <p>I have been to Legoland and Hello Kitty area many times. The
              Iskandar projects looks good but JB property is such that you must
              occupy it. Not buy and leave it empty. Quite impossible for me
              though, because my family hates going there. We dont need to save
              on groceries. They word 'cheap' does not excite us. The slow pace
              of life makes me, wife and children very irritable. Being born in
              the city, suddenly switch to kampung lifestyle is sibei jialat. So
              called stressful life in singapore is quite enjoyable and relaxed
              for me.</p>
              <p>People like me is cannot sit down and idle one, except in army -
              chao keng, attend B all the way, eat in canteen, play arcade
              machine, sleep in bunk and ask cook to make special dishes using
              leftover ingredients. Everything say dont know, and take cover as
              much as possible. That time no iphone or smartphone. I also dont
              know how I passed my time.</p>

              Depend on what you want, yr profile, your limitation, you can plan yr spending by determining the opportunity of it, like in our everyday life, u will alway come into a situation of want to buy 4D or save it to buy a tonic, what you decide shall in a small way, determine the flow of economy and also your future, which is opportunity in a sense.

              <p>There 2 ways to buy a bungalow.</p>
              <p>First is use your own money.</p>
              <p>Another way is groom your daughter into a fhm model / singer, and with a hopefully american degree. Hopefully she hooks a rich man and assuming she is filial, I will be able to retire in a bungalow that I dont have to pay for.</p>
              <p>So that is why it is important not to spend too much time at work. To be a good father, you need to be able to bring money in, yet work very little. Idling mostly and spending time with your kids and guiding them.</p>
              <p>My sons already very handsome. I am sure they will have no problems finding a hot chick - if can hook a rich pretty girl will be the best. I just have to ensure they walk straight, dont get into trouble offline or online and make the right friends. For them to hook a rich man's daughter, I also must make sure they dont think and behave like an ah beng tio bo?</p>

              <p>zulkifli, I was very happy to read that you managed your family
                  well, and found contentment and success in life.</p>
              <p>For me to be honest, my secret dream is to live in somewhere
                  along the west coast of america - places like santa clara san jose,
                  right where my idols are - apple, tesla and amazon.</p>
              <p>Whatever disgraceful and shameful things I had to endure in my
                  life was so that my kids can get an education and hopefully find
                  the motivation to search for success in america. Then again, I dont
                  believe in forcing my ideas on others. Humans cannot be compelled
                  through constant criticisms. Much encouragement and just a little
                  bit of caning to keep them straight. I hope they find well educated
                  spouses with big dreams.</p>
              <p>I did not chose this country because I love it so much. The main
                  reason is because this is the only proven place on earth where
                  people can dream, collaborate (not the a-star style of rubbish
                  collaboration), make many mistakes, persist and finally find
                  success.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Hello f1taxidriver.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Thanks for your kind words and your response. I understand what you mean.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">My second elder sister, her husband and daughter live in the U.S. now for about slightly over 20 years now. First they resided in Arizona, Phoenix, Glenndale because my brother-in-law was deployed there with F16 RSAF detachment in 1989. He was an aircraft technician back then. Then after his contract was over he worked for an aviation company there for many years. Now they are in Texas, Houston and he is a manager of an aviation company there. My sister started as a high school teacher. Now she is taking her master degree in Texas University. My niece grew up there, went to the University in Arizona and now she is married to an American from Texas too. They are doing very well there. I doubt my sister and my brother-in-law will ever return to Singapore here to retire.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">My eldest brother and my sister-in-law (formerly a Hong Kong citizen migrated to Singapore at a young age with her parent then became a Singaporean), left for Canada and migrated there somewhere in the late 2000s. They have a son born in Singapore but who grew up and study there too. Unfortunately, about a year ago he has to return to Singapore to serve his full time NS. He is living with my eldest sister in Singapore now. My brother and his wife work for a School Bus company in Canada. His wife gave up the Singapore Citizenship about a year ago and about 2 months ago my brother too gave up his Singapore Citizenship. Both of them are now Canada Citizens. Before my brother gave up his Singapore Citizenship, the Singapore Government requested for all his siblings particulars. They asked him why he wanted to give up the Singapore Citizenship. My brother replied, "I want a different lifestyle from Singapore."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">When I was in my teens and 20s, I was very proud of Singapore. <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">I thought that Singapore was the best country in the world and the only country in the world that could fulfil your ambition and dreams. But all that changed my views after I stayed abroad and look at Singapore from outside Singapore.</span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Not that I am not proud of being a Singaporean now but I just became a different person and my feeling for Singapore was not the same too. My perspectives, principles and philosophy too changed. I was awakened from a deep slumber. Its a long story but to make the story short, CPF, NS (though I had served my full-time with the SAF diligently and obediently with good conduct) and Singapore's governing policies are some of the issues that I find it hard to accept totally. I felt cheated.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Its like an insurance company promising you that when your insurance policy matures, you will get your principle amount with interest but along the way they change the agreement many times with so many excuses and at the end you will only receive your money when you are dying or already dead due to old age. Or its like a company that issues you with a cheque, then it bounces, then they issue you with a post dated cheque but it bounces again, then they issue you with a new post dated cheque and you unsure whether it will bounces again.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">About Singapore story. Its like the hare and the tortoise. Or like the SIA situation in the past and now. We have to be wise when comparing others with ourselves.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This much I can say. In my own view and opinion, to be successful in your life you must start young when you are still strong physically and mentally. When you still have that energy to endure and persevere to make your dream come true. You must think positive but not too positive because it may be the start of your downfall too.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I wish you all the best bro. I am sure your children will have spouses with good academic qualification with big dreams when they are there. Have a good weekend to you and your family.</p>

              <p>Much like you, I also felt cheated in ns. However my personality is such that if i was paid peanuts, monkey biz is what u get. There are no complains, long faces or threats. I just ninja it into the deal. For less than $200-$300/month, i could not find the energy on tekong to do the 24 km road march and SOC test during my bmt. People marched in the rain. I slept in the bunk. I was never worried about getting screamed at by the platoon sergeant. Now after so many decades, i wished i behaved better ;)</p>
              <p>Like it or not, NS cannot be scraped. I had done the calculations. If u want to see a million sinkie soldiers in the event of a war, the current policy must stay. The way to reduce this burden of 2 years NS is to increase the population. Either way, the pap will be slapped both ways by many hateful citizens.</p>
              <p>Even as i voted opposition, i am mindful that pap should hang around. They should not get 50%, but also not 70% all the time. Like exam grades, u dont want to fail them, but also dun want them to get A grade. Why? Many many reasons. All interlinked.</p>
              <p>Many people commented our ministers are v good in explaining things away. We complain about old people collecting cardboards. But the minister in one sentence said these old people are doing exercise. No more problem liao!! They excel at sweeping problems away. I hated them for decades until i realised the brilliance behind it. Nevertheless i will still vote opposition since they got 70/100 last round. These intelligent scholars need to eat humble pie every 5 years.</p>

              <p>What happened to your friend is terrible leh..</p>
              <p>However I always viewed death as liberation. The end of consciousness and meaningless existence in a universe that is infinitely big and an inconsequential self. Whether u did good or evil, it means nothing after a million years.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I see people in the casket and say in my heart - congrats you are free from life's burdens. So for me, i almost never cry when i see death - as long as it came naturally or as an act of nature. Getting murdered is a different story.</p>
              <p>It is never good to tell your fellow citizens to quit their country of birth. People want to complain and voice dissatisfaction - let them be. While we are alive, we should value differences in each person.</p>
              <p>It will be a terrible thing for this world if everyone thought, looked and said the same thing.</p>

Most key management employees are clearing their annual leaves and going for the holiday and they are not really thinking about work or hiring new staffs for that matter and so on.

              <p>Starting up a business outside Singapore is never easy. You have to go through those obstacles regardless of the situation if you want to succeed. SMEs in Singapore need to expand outside Singapore too if they want to survive.</p>
              <p>Yes, vehicle hijacking is quite common in big countries, especially containers hijacking that worth millions of dollars are very common. It can be a one man operation or collaberate operation with inside job. Singapore is a small country and when this happens, the culprit(s) can be easily arrested.</p>
              <p>What I did was, I oversee all the necessary jobs that need to be done personally and I made sure I was there most of the time, then I get someone I knew in Malaysia that I could trust, hire the locals and lastly I hired my childhood best friend to oversee all operation there. Rented for him a bungalow, lease a company car and hired a driver for him and he reported directly to me. And I still make sure I went to the office in JB regularly. My office was at an office building which is now Amansari Hotel in JB. Anyway, all that is over and in the past now.</p>

              Singapore without foreigners..property agent like KTC will go back to open plate at geyland, in the 70s, 80s and 90s...got foreigners?? what is our GDP everyyears, how was our culture, how was our cost of living then. 
              
              So I think in saying singapore without foreigners is never a need to imagine, it happened and only in begining of 2000, the influx of foreigners were relentless..and now, we become a dependent of them, but could we still survive without them? would our property be so high, would our cost of living be so high, would our culture and identity getting more vague, would our GDP be at single digits of 1 to 2% and let be more practical, would our MRT breakdown so often?

              I remembered one minister saying this statement, "Singapore is like a good food stall with long queue." Then you need more manpower to service your customers or else they get dissatisfied and your food stall will get a bad name.
              
              I think Singapore is more like this. Its a food catering company. You keep taking orders until its more than it can handle because company want to have more profits but the staffs are underpaid, exhausted and overworked. The food not cook in time until the cooks prepared the food anyhow and its not to the customers standard, the staffs setup the tables and food late. The customers start to complain and ask for discount for the bad service.
              
              Or
              
              Its like an operating theatre/room. Too many patients and doctors awaiting for the availability of the ORs. Before the ORs can be disinfect thoroughly from contamination, the doctors scolded the medical staffs to push their patients quickly into the OR and place onto the Operating Table and commence the surgery on the patient. SOP are comprise and then what happens, infection breakouts slowly within the hospitals and then spread to the public.
