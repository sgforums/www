              <p>Pa bao chia, private limo business wont die out one. Private app booking cannot eat everything. I got my reasons, solid reasons. At the end of the day, whether its uber or grab or limo or taxi, its still driven by an ex- or current cabby. Apps got their uses and clientele. Private limo and pa bao chia got their traditional clientele. This pie is too big for any one party to makan everything.</p>
              <p>You as a normal taxi, unless you tried before and tasted it, dun be too quick to dismiss it. Just like singapore got 200 casket companies. Why some keep getting called? Same for ambulance service. Got public and private ambulances. Same thing for private buses. Got CDG, SMRT and SBS 42 seaters buses, but still got private 42 seaters. My limo biz covers all kinds of transportation modes from small to big, except trains lah. You think i only do peh chia jobs ah?</p>

              But no matter how, with 4,000 apps rider and abt 6,000 limbo on the road..pie will get smaller, howeve have to agree that Pie get bigger is due to population increases .//// to 6.9 millions.
              
              Aiyo, where got 200 casket companies leh, only abt 120 provide transportation lah, some only provide places for funeral and buy casket, they sub out to me for transportation, I am specialise in oversea transportation of casket too, this one very unique casket business, must go thru more courses, I would say, there are more players coming into the market, but the market is also getting bigger, like casket, tho there are more start up business doing it now, but because of more older people like you and me, more death will occur, as such, to open a casket funneral is profitable...
              
              ...So, ai join venture mah, Bowah Casket Pte Ltd

              I would say, in limbo today, more are cursing, the key is to make one man look higher only, but at the end of the day, still a driver mah. Like I sometime also drive limo..mercedez wagon, also higher cost for pax, smlj also higher, I myself also look higher, wear bow tie somemore...knn...but for rich people who passed away and want a Mercedes casket like LKY.
              
              Yes, driving merc casket do earn more than normal casket van or lorry, but not much people order, so in casket driving, at least you can switch from normal to limbo, limbo back to normal, taxi companies should also allow that so that more will take up their limbo.

              Aiyo, Uncle, overqualified doing taxi or security job is call Underemployment lah
              Structural unemployement is when the market job need highly skilled or knowledge people, but the people are yet to train or educate to that status, so such unemployment is know as structural unemployment.
