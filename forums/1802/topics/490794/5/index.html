              <p>Singapore has an open economy which is dependent on trade. So when the world is not doing well, Singapore's outlook is also poor.</p>
              <p>Eg China reducing interest rates to boost economy, reduced growth targets. Europe slowdown and the Greece debt. Japan still fighting to stay out of deflation. US also not doing well. </p>
              <p>You can also see the market outlook is negative when stocks go down coz people are scared.</p>
              <p>All these factors will affect the job market. You can also ask your friends who just graduated and are looking for jobs, and those who are looking to switch jobs. Job market is weak.</p>

              Economy is cyclical, when up, rich people save, poor people spent, when down, rich people spent to buy, poor people no money to spent, and also no money to save.
              
              That is why it is important to save for raining day, economy down, interest goes up, many people who over committed in car or house or shares will hv to force sell, and the rich are there waiting for low force sell prices, so, if you hv money save for raining day, it is also good to buy some, and when economy up, prices up, you sell and save.

              Do not create new financial debts for yourself. Live and spend within your means. In other words, don't "Hutang" anymore. If you cannot afford it, you really cannot afford it. Do not try to force yourself to get something that you cannot afford. Do not swipe your credit card(s) anymore when you do not have cash in your saving. Pay cash. Spend what you need and those things that are necessary. Most people tend to swipe and purchase those things that they do not really need it. Save money now for your future and family future. 
              
              If you do not like to keep your money in the bank, an easy way is to purchase gold physically like in jewelries or small gold bars. You can wear it or keep it in your safe box or deposit box. When you travel abroad and you find that it is profitable to buy gold jewelries abroad, buy some and keep it. Take it like an investment. One day in the future your collection of gold items, it will make you quite wealthy.

              The problem here is, most people are very prudent in their financial issue and approach, however, most are make to be in debts by laws which our govt are an expert in it, you buy a decent HDB only, you are in debts, you or yr loveones go hospital only, you are in debts, and like taxis drivers, before you drive, you are in debt with the rent already.
              
              Therefore, most of us are alway in debts, and that is how our govt what it to be, you be in debt, so you hv to slog thru your life, and that allow the economy and banks to move, to create more debt by increasing this and that...therefore, never underestimate debt, it is a one of the anicent method of slavery.

If the problem is incurable - u got to do the right thing, deny treatment and send the sick loved one to their final destination. This is called love.

              <p>There is a doctor and patient confidente relationship. As a patient you can always tell the doctor personally and quietly to let you go peacefully. But the doctor must keep it as a secret and the patient must be prepared to endure whatever pain he is going to go through for his decision before he/she pass over.</p>
              <p>That is the reason sometimes we see many old people corpses around Singapore. They just want to go because they feel it better for them to go then burdening their family further.</p>

CPF is still your money, why should you be paying an expensive HDB flat of approx 400k when it cost of building is only 20k.

              <p>Our government got many costs lah. If they sell HDB to you at $20K, or even double the costs, very very soon, we will have no HDB to stay.</p>

              And worst of all is that it is getting smaller and smaller...we are all conned. Citizens have the right to land and subsidaries, by charging more than 1000% profit on a piece of 10m sq house floating in the air..is a call for concern.
              
              If SAF is high cost, sub it out to foreigner.

              I feel sorry for the younger generation of Singaporeans. In 1987, a 4S Room HDB flat only cost about $44,500 for a 25 year loan directly with HDB.

              <p>Assuming the girl started working at the age of 19 and the guy at the age of 21, before the age of 30, they would be able to pay off a 4-rm flat without even taking a loan.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, majority of them are still studying at that age. They only know is study, study, and study hoping for a degree. They live within their parent comfort zone for shelter and financing. So when are they going to start work and earn a living for themselves, support their family and themselves? I'm not against them pursuing their academic achievements and by the time they start work, their age are around 24 or 25 or 26 and even more than that age...nearly 30 year old. And they don't have enough CPF to pay for their downpayment to get a HDB flat and their parents have to pay for their downpayment. And by the time they settle their housing payment their age is nearly 60 year or even more than that...until they retire I guess.</p>

              <p>A man owns a burger stall and was doing very well for decades. He sends his son up to the university to gain academic achievements. So one day, he got old and his business still doing very well. Then one day his son came back home and said to his father, "Why are you still selling. Business is not good now. Our country economy is facing a recession/depression now. Every businessmen/businesses are getting bankrupt. You should close your business before its too late." So he closes his burger stall on that day itself. The next day, a customer asked him,"Why you close your business?" His replied,"My son told me that there is a recession/depression now. I should shutdown my business before its too late." </p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Learned from the Israelis and U.S. Its cheaper to innovate weapons and manufactured it than to buy from other countries. Manufactured the small/light firearms for SAF and also sell it to other countries, not sure where but some of the U.S. Military units are using Singapore made weapons. The new Light Armoured Vehicles are manufactured for SAF and the outdated/second hand ones are sold to other countries. Most of the Heavy Weaponaries like Armoured Tanks/Mobile Artillery Tanks are bought from the U.S. Some are stationed overseas like in the U.S. and Australia for SAF training purposes usually for SAF live firing exercises/manoeuvres. During my time in the SAF, we artillerymen went to R.O.C. (Taiwan) and Australia for live firing exercises/manoeuvres.  </span></p>

              Defense budget alway take away about 1/3 of the total budget for the year.
              
              Today, parachute packing are done by third party contractors, aka PRC workers
              Food is also done by Singapore Food industrial, who also employ PRC and Bangala for muslim food.
              Army clothing and accessories are make in PRC and vietnam. 
              
              So I was wondering, why not sub out the whole SAF to China, then we will spent less on defense in the budgeting. And locals men will not need to do NS or be NSmen, they can concentrate on their studies and career better.

              <p>To be honest, this SAF rigging outsourcing is something I was pondering for a while. I was wondering are our SAF commando officers crazy? No. Are they born and bred here? Of course. Do they love this country? Of course. Were they expecting outsourcing to improve things or make it worse? Of course to improve lah. If our parachute rigging increases fatality, whose head will be chopped?</p>
              <p>So I believe this was a considered decision, and they must have seen these China professionals doing their job, and satisfied themselves that these chinese guys can do things equally well.</p>
              <p>Think about it. As an artillery or infantry soldier, did you pack the gunpowder into the cartridge? No. Can you make better and more reliable ammunition than those from ST Kinetics, where the actual floor production crew could also be from china? Ammunition that is not made properly can result in chamber explosion, killing innocent people.</p>
              <p>So back to parachute rigging. Is this an art that only singapore army knows? No. It is not a secret. Folding the parachute and the lines back into the bag is meticulous labor. Might as well outsource it and let our rangers and commandos focus on other aspects of their training.</p>
              <p>Afterall when sent on a real mission, the parachute may be discarded in the drop zone, depending on the mission specifics.</p>

              <p>How many soldiers got chance to parachute? Only the elite soldiers. Dont tell me MT line, clerk, cook or MP also got chance to be airborne? So its not a general thing. This outsourcing of parachute rigging only concerns a small group of soldiers. Just like cookhouse job got outsourced to SFI during my time.</p>
              <p>But yes, every outsourcing decision surely needed defense minister approval, so yes in that sense its the whole SAF. Whatever decisions they make, i am confident it was thought long and hard and its for the better.</p>

                  the girl started working at the age of 19 and the guy at the age of
                  21, before the age of 30, they would be able to pay off a 4-rm flat
                  without even taking a loan."</strong></span></p>
              <p>In Singapore, majority of them are still studying at that age.
                  They only know is study, study, and study hoping for a degree. They
                  live within their parent comfort zone for shelter and financing. So
                  when are they going to start work and earn a living for themselves,
                  support their family and themselves? I'm not against them pursuing
                  their academic achievements and by the time they start work, their
                  age are around 24 or 25 or 26 and even more than that age...nearly
                  30 year old. And they don't have enough CPF to pay for their
                  downpayment to get a HDB flat and their parents have to pay for
                  their downpayment. And by the time they settle their housing
                  payment their age is nearly 60 year or even more than that...until
                  they retire I guess.</p>

              <p>Remember I quoted the example of below average ITE couples....not degree holders....  degree holders would earn higher salaries after graduating if they can find a suitable job (actually double at $3200 per month).... so as long as they have the disciplines to save, there should be no problem.</p>
              <p>$3200 x 12 = $38400 + $3200 + $6528 = $48128 minus $400 tax = $47728.</p>
              <p>2 person save 50% so savings per year = $47728.</p>
              <p>So only need to save for 5 years to buy 4-rm flat.</p>
              <p>Guy graduate at the age of 24, lady graduate at the age of 22-23.</p>
              <p>By the age of 29-30 can fully own a house if they appy for BTO at the age of 26-27.</p>

              <p>To be honest, with a $3200/month job, assuming the spouse also earning the same, even if they cut down on wedding expenses, its going to be hard to save anything at all once u factor in the mortgage, utility bills, groceries every 3 days, renovation costs, pregnancy consultation, baby food, toys, clothing. If both working and parents cannot help, u still must hire a maid. Later the baby grow up, need to pay for nursery, piano classes, tuition, school bills.</p>
              <p>Your costs keep going up as your family grows. It never gets cheaper. You as a parent must keep earning more and more.</p>
              <p>If your wife decides you as a man should bring in the dough while she become a housewife, then u better be making more than $10K a month to keep your baby and mummy happy.</p>

              <p>What I was saying is you must have family planning.... save a lot before you marry.... after marriage burden not so much such that the wife can anytime stop work anytime to have a baby and take care of home without having to hire a maid.   5-6 years of two degrees holders savings at 50% rate could generate a lot of money .</p>
              <p>How many people could earn 10K a month by the age of 30?  Not many....but $3.2K a month to feed 2 adults and 1 baby possible or not?   Sure possible one.</p>
              <p>However if you go for matured-estate BTO, Condo or HDB resale, you would have to service your loan for a much longer time unless you earn very high salary.</p>
              <p>Also there are optional money that need not be spent like piano and tuition.  School fees are cheaper than nursery cost but only for two years only.... Mother can ownself teach kid so no need tutor.</p>
              <p>Big expense renovation count it together with flat price.  If not enough, work a few months extra before wife quit job to have a baby.</p>
              <p>However, if the person and wife did not study hard enough to at least reach ITE level, then they would have to work very long hours to make ends meet (Security Guards and class-4 drivers could earn more than 2K per month).</p>
