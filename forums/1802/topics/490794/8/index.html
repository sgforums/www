              And in conclusion, unemployment rate is down 0.2% for the last quarter 2015, comparing to 2014 same period, it was 2.2%. What does that tell you, there are many jobs created and more people are working.

              Hoping that after the CNY, economy would pick up but the reverse is taking place...the signs and indication are all there...companies going to retrench more workers soon..
              
              Lets see how this year...its still early to tell...however be prepared, especially PMETs.

              I agree with you there...many a time...the news say good things about the economy and job market....but in reality on the field...its the reverse...I think more like propaganda...they cannot take that risk of telling the Singaporeans the Truth...but people outside Singapore could see the wayang...

              It would be very very difficult unless the voters really really want to see that their lives, rights and power as citizens to be restored to them again, they must realized that Singapore need more opposition MPs in Parliament.

              <p>everything in this world is a gamble. You can love and get slapped in return. You can also slap people who were trying to be nice to you (but you thought otherwise). Of course love can also beget love. The most important thing is to follow your basic instinct.</p>
              <p>I have been following my own basic or 'animal' instinct since young. I call it 'animal' because I cannot define it. I just know shit may happen if I take a certain path. The only regret is I never listened to my heart more. I avoided many many troubles and even escaped death a few times. All because I listen to my senses and not my 'brain'. This is why Star Wars is such a great movie.</p>
              <p>May the force be with you, and listen to it - let it guide your path.</p>
              <p>Just like in 'Star Wars', there are many many people who are born without the 'force'. Many people simply lack the 'inner wisdom' to guide them. So end up doing stupid things or worse lose their own life. Without this inner light, it is almost impossible to prosper in this world. Give these people money, they will also lose everything.</p>

              Yes, only when you have extra cash then you can do that now, Its difficult now. You cannot dump all your money to buy a property in Malaysia now without any extra cash in hand or sufficient savings in your bank. 5 to 10 years ago, an average income earner Singaporean/Foreigner could own a landed property or condominium in Johor Bahru or other part of Malaysia easily. The property market back then in Singapore was booming. 10 years or 5 years back then, the minimum price to own a property in Malaysia was only RM300,000, then it went up to RM500,000 and now RM1,000,000. However, there are still some housing developments that had launched its projects and sales before the new law of minimum purchasing price RM1,000,000 came into effect in Malaysia. The Singaporeans/Foreigners can still purchase and own a property at the minimum purchasing price of RM500,00.  They can go to JB Sentral, there are many Sales Gallery booths there and enquire more information from those available housing agents station there.

              If Singaporeans who wish to buy a property in JB or other parts of Malaysia, I'm just wondering whether the Banks in Malaysia will look into those Singaporeans who are interested in taking loans from them but those potential Singaporean customers already have 60% or more financial commitments with banks in Singapore? Will their application for housing loans be approved by Malaysian Banks or Singapore Banks that are already present and doing business in Malaysia? I'm not sure about this.
