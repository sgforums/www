              That loop to swing upward can be achieve if one is prepare for the downturn, therefore, vision in business and trade is very important, you need to keep up with the changes, the trends and have latest information, it is not easy, it hard work too, but some people hv that talents and passion in it. 
              
              What happen is that most of us do not care much what the future holds and also reluctant to change and adapt, so when a downturn arrive, they are not prepare and that slope will go down very fast till when they start to realize the impact of it, but too late.
              
              Therefore by understanding the impact and aspect of the economy is critical in making decision to uplift the business or economy, and even at the extreme harshness, at least you dun fall like a vertical slope...but in a more gradual slope that allow you to adjust, re plan and start again.

              <p>Yes, true.</p>
              <p>The economy of countries globally varies. Depending whether those countries are already a full developed countries (first world countries), developing countries or third world countries.</p>
              <p>Most of the developed countries usually need to innovate and change. This is in a way help them hopefully to sustain their economy and create new markets within the countries or outside their countries.</p>
              <p>One example that I can quote is China. During the 90s when China started to open up their market to the outside world, the World Economy was booming. Every countries in the world would like to invest and trade with China. And China is the second largest economy in the world.</p>
              <p>For Singapore companies, they have to venture out because Singapore market is very small with a small population. They need to create new market for themselves besides depending on U.S.A. and China to sustain or lift the economy. The African continent and India are some places they should look into and Singapore companies must be willing to leave their comfort zone to explore for new markets. And Singaporeans too must be willing to leave their comfort zone to explore and gain international corporate exposure for managing skills, knowledge, talent and technologies. Many Singaporeans are not willing to give up their comfort zone and shift to country even like Indonesia for corporate posting. So how are they going to manage an MNC company in the key management positions without the exposure and experience of working abroad?</p>
              <p>Anyway, the TPPA agreement will definitely benefits Singapore and Singaporeans. See how it goes. And about ASEAN economics community agreement, I think Singapore will be the last country within ASEAN to really readily ease or lift up the immigration/labour policy of management/skill workers employment within ASEAN.</p>
              <p>Having said that, I just like to ask you something here. Don't you think that UBER is an innovative business and it is a brilliant business idea; and maybe taxi transport companies in Singapore is going to be something of past in the future? Those with UBER are receiving good income if compare to any taxi companies in Singapore. This is similar like what the logistics firms are doing. They engage private locomotive vehicle owners to work for them. It's productive and cost effective; and it makes more sense in term of business perspectives.Â </p>

              <p>Uber is a company that taxi drivers and taxi companies hate. Â  In many countries, they have been driven out as they operate like a pirate taxi company unlike regular taxi companies. Â  LTA has not regulated them and I suspect the only reason why they are still operating in Singapore is because the taxi drivers are unable to meet peak hours demands.</p>
              <p>I am not sure what kinds of incentives Uber is offering Uber drivers but after calculation, if Uber does not gives incentives, it is better for taxi drivers to continue driving taxis rather than switch to Uber if they do not have a car or are driving taxi full-time. Â  Â Uber advertised at $55 rental for a car. Â  However that is a 8-9 year old small car (that is not as stable and spacious (passenger space and boot) as a Sonata) with insurrance for 4 passengers. Â Moreover, more likely the $55 cars are already taken up and one has to rent a $70 car. Â A Sonata goes for $110. Â So there is $55 difference assuming one can rent a $55 car. Â However, if you make $250 per 12 hours of driving, you have to pay $50 to Uber. Â Furthermore, you have to pay at least $15 extra for fuel over Sonatas. Â So $55 of gain minus $50 minus $15 = lose $10 per day.</p>
              <p>Uber is not regulated and would "rib off" customers whenever demand for Uber vechicles are high (such as during MRT breakdown periods). Â  I see Uber as a big unregulated pirate taxi company that does not provide insurrance for passengers.</p>
              <p>So Uber is just providing a false illusion of being a good income company with not-fixed extra incentives to drivers that could be taken away anytime.</p>
              <p>Currently LTA is not letting more experienced taxi drivers become yellow-top taxi drivers. Â  But they are letting Uber drivers use their own private vehicles to fetch customers for commercial use without having to buy insurrance for 4 passengers. Â They should be doing something about it to level the playing field.</p>

              Ok. What if UBER is regulated in the near future? Its still a brilliant business innovative idea and everyone with or without a vehicle can earn extra income besides from their full time job. I mean these UBER drivers they have more time for themselves and family. Its like work life balance. Its like renting your rooms to outsiders for extra income too. Its almost like income or wealth redistribution but the only difference is that the UBER drivers need to work for it.

              <p>Singapore industry cannot have too many people providing car transportation for customers otherwise everyone in the industry would be crusing empty very often and working very long hours. Â  Â  Ideally it should be only for the very serious ones who would be working full-time. Â  If a lot of people with other full-time jobs are coming to compete with us for extra-income, we taxi drivers who spent a few months getting the taxi license would be suffering. Â  Remember taxi drivers are probably working the longest hours among Singaporeans working in Singapore. Â  Each double-shift taxi driver works 12 hours for 6-7 days. Â  The OMO drivers work even more hours per week. Â  Don't forget too, we also pay rentals on public holidays and Sunays and we do not get additional 14 days holidays that employees get.</p>

              <p>I personally have no problem if Uber operates like a regular taxi company here in Singapore on equal terms as other taxi companies (just that they would have to start off with a smaller fleet). Â But I think currently they are operating on unequal terms with not serious drivers entering the market without having to pass the examination to get a taxi license and without having to be subjected to regulation rules. Â Â </p>
              <p>Remember, the smaller 4 taxi companies are being fined heavilly by LTA for not meeting the taxi availability standard every year.</p>

              Uber is not a taxi.....I repeat...Uber is not a taxi. 
                  
              Singappore has being known to rank SECOND in the WORLD as THE WORLD FREEIEST ECONOMY, and last year, we maintained that title and I think this year will be the same.
                  
              So Uber is a company doing business in the world 2nd freeiest economy. And when you said Free..you hv to mean it. So, how on earth is one going to put a stop or make problem for Uber if you are so called the world 2nd freeiset economy.
                  
              World free economy is also equal to a free market forces to churn itself so as to create competition which help to improve services and products to the benefit of consumers and society at large.
              
              How many TDs you hv here in Singapore...let me see, roughly with relief is 56 thousands..the public is 5millions...you think the govt aka LTA care for you or the public?

              economy. And when you said Free..you hv to mean it. So, how on
              earth is one going to put a stop or make problem for Uber if you
              are so called the world 2nd freeiset economy.</p>
              <p>World free economy is also equal to a free market forces to
              churn itself so as to create competition which help to improve
              services and products to the benefit of consumers and society at
              large.</p>
              <p>How many TDs you hv here in Singaporeâ¦let me see, roughly with
              relief is 56 thousands..the public is 5millionsâ¦you think the govt
              aka <span>LTA</span> care for you or the public?</p>

              <p>This is also a matter related to why they put a stop to pirate taxis many years ago. Â Uber fares are not regulated too and they can suka suka raise the price by a few times whenever demand is high (Â <a style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; white-space: nowrap; line-height: 1.231; color: #660099; cursor: pointer;" href="http://dictionary.pinpinchinese.com/definitions/s/%E8%B6%81%E7%81%AB%E6%89%93%E5%8A%AB-chenhuodajie">Ã¨Â¶ï¿½Ã§ï¿½Â«Ã¦â°âÃ¥Å Â«Â </a><span style="white-space: nowrap; line-height: 1.231;">) like they would raise the prices substantially whenever there are MRT </span><span style="line-height: 1.231; white-space: nowrap;">breakdowns.</span></p>
              <p>If no need to be regulated and can use own cars, must as well let all taxi drivers drive own yellow-top taxis. Â </p>

              Pirate taxis are created by people without any company and rules, they infact cannot even be trace if pax is not wary of the cab and driver face. Those are the day, whereby one can buy a car, and just go choose, interview and pick. 
              
              Uber is a registered company, however I do agree that certainly regulations are not well spell out, mostly from the govt side, not Uber.
              
              Therefore, when govt grant licencee to Uber, Uber start to operate it business within a context spelled out in their application, so who to blame??? Uber or the govt or Singapore TDs??

              <p>Are you sure Uber has a special license from the government to operate in Singapore that is something on top of the normal $2 companies in Singapore? Â  It could be just as simple as an internet company that provide pickup services for people who wish to go from point A to point B.</p>
              <p>The difference between pirate taxi and a pte limited Uber is one has no supplied address and one has a supplied address. Â  Pirate taxis drives also set the rules themselves like Uber bosses and employees set the rules themselves. Â Previous days pirate taxi drivers also agreed on price before fetching customers to destination.</p>
              <p>Regulated taxi operators have to submit to LTA for approval before raising the fares. Â The individual taxi drivers can reduce the prices (eg for regular customers and handicaps) but cannot raise the prices.</p>

              <p>That one known as business permit. Â  Like a casino needs business permit and an additional casino license, a telco needs business permit and telco license, Â a taxi company needs a business permit and an additional taxi operator license. Â A special license is something in additional to a business permit (for the cases of companies or business firms).</p>
              <p>For example, some renovation companies have business permits but no HDB renovation licenses (they renovate using other people's permits so it is considered other people (those license holders) renovate those places if renovation work is carried out).</p>

              Usually those who are dealing with online business would be seen eccentric individuals. They have sleeping disorders and they are not happy people. Because they spend so much time in the internet and cyberworld, and some became so addicted, their real life falls apart.......many too have marriage problems because they lose touch with the real world. For them, the real world is the internet....sad to see this happens not only in Singapore but all over the world.

              Excerpts from ex-top civil servant force to resign and starting a new life overseasÃ¢â¬Â¦
              
              Ã¢â¬ÅI was told 2015 would be a challenging year, and by my own reckoning, there will be more Singaporeans in need by the time we get to the middle of the year. My own experience taught me we should open up our minds and hearts to the larger world out there: I know many Singaporeans bulk at the idea of putting everything behind to get a job overseas, but when push comes to shove, and with few options on the horizon, sometimes, one needs to take a bold leap of faith.
              
              I cannot say that my life would be better here in Cambodia than in Singapore, and sure, there are many certainties in the days ahead, but whatÃ¢â¬â¢s important most for me is to ensure I keep working, and as long as I have that, and my family with me, well, I guess everything else can be sorted out Ã¢â¬â especially pesky demand notices from banks and such.
              
              My parting words as I end this long sharing of mine: to my fellow Singaporeans, keep your heads up and stay positive. The world is a lot bigger than that tiny dot of an island we call home, and if itÃ¢â¬â¢s about looking for a job to re-entrench yourself somewhere and grow, donÃ¢â¬â¢t just look at absolute salaries, be bold and venture. And when youÃ¢â¬â¢ve worked everything out, you could always go back home when youÃ¢â¬â¢re established and secure.
              
              Or not.Ã¢â¬ï¿½
