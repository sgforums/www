              <p><br> Usually those who are dealing with online business would be seen
              eccentric individuals. They have sleeping disorders and they are
              not happy people. Because they spend so much time in the internet
              and cyberworld, and some became so addicted, their real life falls
              apart.......many too have marriage problems because they lose touch
              with the real world. For them, the real world is the
              internet....sad to see this happens not only in Singapore but all

              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 13px; line-height: 1.4; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #333333;">SINGAPORE: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wage growth will likely moderate in 2016 amid tepid employment demand and reduced tightness in Singapore’s labour market</span><span style="color: #333333;">, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in its biannual macroeconomic review on Wednesday (Apr 27).</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 13px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">“With lower labour demand and supply, total job creation this year is expected to stay modest. As such, overall and resident unemployment rates are likely to rise slightly in 2016 alongside the weak cyclical conditions, intensifying industry reconfigurations in some sectors, as well as increasing skills mismatches within the resident workforce,” the MAS said, adding that redundancies could continue to rise in sectors buffeted by weak external demand and restructuring efforts.<br style="font-size: 18.0216px;"></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 13px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">As such, the overall resident wage growth is forecast to “moderate to about 2.5 to 3.0 per cent, from 3.5 per cent in 2015”.<br style="font-size: 18.0216px;"></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 13px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">However, salary increments will vary according to sectors.<br style="font-size: 18.0216px;"></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 13px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">In industries such as the community, social and personal (CSP) services sector where vacancy rates are higher, employees are likely to see higher increments, while those in sectors with greater slack, such as manufacturing, may see weaker wage increments.<br style="font-size: 18.0216px;"></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 13px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">“Both labour demand and supply in the economy are settling at permanently lower levels, in line with the moderation in Singapore’s trend gross domestic product (GDP) growth and ageing population,” the MAS report said.<br style="font-size: 18.0216px;"></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 13px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The central bank added: “Alongside the fall in labour demand, there has been a reduction in foreign labour supply growth amid the tightening of foreign worker policies. Meanwhile, the supply of resident workers grew at a fairly stable pace, despite an increase in the entry of part-time workers into the workforce. Going forward, structural headwinds and demographic ageing could intensify and further moderate the trend component of employment growth.”<br style="font-size: 18.0216px;"></p>

              This type of report, no need MAS to report lah, we day in day out in the street, knows better than them.
                  
              GRab and Uber aka apps rides have been around for 2 to 3 years, and till today, their financial book is still in red. It is believe that the shareholders and investors is getting impatience with them, prolong incentives and cut fares is never a business model that can sustain in long run.
                  
              With the inability to conqueror taxi industrial, it still hv a long way to go, especially so when operating in a small city like Singapore which have limited expansion unlike china or Europe or US, therefore recently, these apps groups decided to go dutch on their fares structure, a final challenge to worn off competitor which is taxis. 
                  
              So far, it had penetrated a certain percentage in gaining the market share, but a recent black out in MRT prove to show a different structure that they aim for, TD were called, hailed and flagged more than 90% than apps ride. And even with apps ride going for the kill, we can still Taxi driver like Mr Bowah, still drive song song to jurong, soon soon to Yishun and swee swee to bukit ho swee...
                  
              ..eh Mr Bowah, have apps ride affect you taxi business? if so, how much?
                  
              Mr Bowah "How much??? what u toking? taxi business cannot be measured, sometime up, sometime down, and SMLJ is apps ride??? it only for those partimer who cannot make much in their life, so no choice, hv to take up partime job, that is all, it does not really affect much, every taxi academy are full of peoples..where got affect? Business is cyclical, more important is the structure,..understand BO???"
                  
              Thank you Mr Bowah

              <p>I think this is true.   Every week also got people die.   When economic slow down, even more people die.   So more business.   Only difference is when economy not good, customers would opt for cheaper packages.</p>

              No lah, today Singapore people are living longer, life expectancy prolonged by 10 to 15 years, that is why, many richs and poors of other countries like to come here, our foods are mostly clean and checked, our air is good (except haze), our medication and care here is good, peace and harmony, and many other factors etc etc are better than most country, that is why, it is vote as one of the best livable city.
              
              Hospital in Singapore treat mostly the rich sickness, not the injured or accident most, many here are so well fed that they hv to go into hospital, unlike other countries, mostly lack of nutrition and starving due to lack of food. So our hospital mostly cater for curing the rich sickness...so good life until sick. Rich sick are like diabetics, high blood pressure, and so on.
              
              Base on good health care...many live longer, so my casket van business also not much business, even got, also like taxi and apps call, must bid for it, but no we bid, company or contractor aka sai kong, iman, priest, monk, or conman bidding.

              The Singapore Economy is getting worsening now.....
                  
              I remember one of the taxi driver Sg Forum member here mentioned in the Singapore Taxi Forum here that it would become a nightmare for the Singapore Government when most of the Singaporeans, young and old (with low or high education), would ended up having a Driver Profession in Singapore...and its happening now....especially those who die-die wish to own a car in SIngapore would sign-up with UBER.

              To govt, Uber is a technology moving toward a complete digital age that they hope and wanted it to be, it is consider a new tech like google, g+, google chrome, etc etc, and as it is a new age, it require new blood to run it within a lowest possible cost of operating.
              
              And in term of COE, govt is careless if it is Uber bidding or private bidding for it, as long as it can bring in more money into their coffer, they will continue to blah blah black sheep as long as they like, and for that matter, they are doing it well..see COE increased.
              
              When temasek announced buying over SMRT, people will think..ah, it is right hand pocket going into left hand pocket, nothing special, I agreed, but who owns Grab? the implication for taxi drivers, especially those in SMRT and COMFORT will have to surrender themselves to GRAB, as simple as that.,..
