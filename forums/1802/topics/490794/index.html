              Magnetic field.
              
              The market is bad, just that the govt is trying to massage the figure aka GDP to keep it alive, oil price is down, middle east chaotic situation, terrorism, low demand from consumer, slow growth in major economy like US and China, all these are sign of bad times, but certainly not a melt down. 
              
              As oil price decline, Oil and Gas and even Marine are taking the brunt of it, thousands will be retrenched by all these MNC in Marine, Oil and Gas market including offshore, these will more or less effect all other industrial, from financial to F&amp;B to transportation like Taxis and many others.
              
              As such, many will look for  temporary alternatives, the bulk that hold TVDL for years but yet to drive may enter the market, and we might see more and more taxis, private apps cars on the road to compete each other.
              
              However, Singapore, with it strong pillars, usually is able to take the downturn hard on, for the past years recession, we are still able to cope and also did well on the coping and better when the upturn arrived.
              
              As for taxi drivers, dun worry, in a global downturn, many will flock into Singapore looking for $$, as most countries will tends to suffer more and many get retrenched. Coupled with the ever increase of population here, TD will still able to make a living, AP will still be busy and people travelling around this city will still prevail and active. Just that with more cabbies and apps pte drivers, each of us may get a little less share of that enlarged pie

              <p>Dun anyhow say limo earn no money. Even though limpeh quit driving taxi. I still got an ongoing limo biz from years ago. Here and there got 10hr disposals at current cdg rates. Now dec season, got many sixty or seventy cent transfers. None of my pax give uber or grab a fuck. When it comes to airport departures n corporate jobs, for some reason people still prefer a personal touch, they still want an operator to speak to.</p>
              <p>What one of my limo buddy makes in a day, is no joke one. Say out u also wont believe. So better dun say. People like us got no time for reporters, everyday just busy siew lui, stay low profile n stay out of trouble.</p>

              <p>Many green lanterns does not mean everyone also got no pax. Its like opening a hawker stall. Neighbour stall always got long queue. My stall got very few. Ren bi ren, qi shi ren.</p>
              <p>Our limo business has changed since grab and uber came in. Some adjustments were needed. For sure we got affected. But there will always to pax. Just like fishing. No more fishes coming up the hook? Maybe u need to change the location, the hook size, the fishing line length, fishing hook depth or maybe the bait must change.</p>
              <p>No use opening a school. All the skills are public knowledge. It is whether you got the right combination of determination, knowledge and attitude to pull it off. Most importantly, do you like this biz?</p>
              <p>If we suceeded, it was not overnight. It takes many many tries and I had to switch so many partners over the years. Taxi biz got many many taiko. Many unreliable people. Many who want money but got zero discipline. Want money but late for pickup. How can they ever earn more than a cleaner? Drive for 10 years still net around $50 a day. These people got the wrong attitude, lazy, arrogant but keep thinking they deserve a better life.</p>

              Agree with some Limbo do make a profit out of Limbu job, but the percentage is getting lesser, that is why, see more and more on Q at Ap, shopping centres and hotel with Normalimo, we, as normalimo will be very happy if Limbo can huat, because they will not come and disturb and take our Q, making our Q longer,...and for sure, these Limbo is affected by pte apps ride, it is a matter of sooner or later.
              
              You can hv pax fark care about pte apps, you can also hv pax fark care abt Limbo? And that tide is changing hand once the fark care about pte apps paxs tasted pte apps services.
