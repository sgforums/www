              <p>You are right many people are underemployed. But in life one thing leads to another. So we got many people in their 40s, 50s who because of a single disagreement with their boss, especially foreign boss - end up getting sacked or asked to resign. End up no choice they went into taxi trade - and became underemployed.</p>
              <p>Since they got sacked, their skills cannot be passed on to new employees. There are many things you dont learn in university. New graduates got jobs, but many many work in diverse jobs which have nothing to do with their training - contributing to structural unemployment.</p>
              <p>This happens in MINDEF too. Imagine you were in navy for 20 years. I am sure you learnt many secrets. But too bad you cannot stand life there anymore, and decide to quit. I am sure you wont teach the new recruits - let them go figure things out like you did.</p>

              <p>Your statement can be correct sometimes, and not true in other cases.</p>
              <p>I had to hire people in a former job, and tried to hire singaporeans. But these young graduates got many job offers. Like many taiko cabbies, they 'wound down their window and asked for destination'. I decided to hire a foreigner in the end - because they never wind down window. They simply 'went where u asked'. Singaporeans with the best qualifications are the most kaisu bunch. Thats why people like our kee chiu minister can only work for pap. Everything also must be the best. But remember, our top scholars have the same taiko mentality as many fark type cabbies who insist on 13 quality pax and will only send them to destinations that the taiko cabby wants to go. So in fact people like our esteemed mentor pool have the same pattern as many of our ministers. Of course we know poolie is not an academic. But i hope u catch my drift.</p>
              <p>So isn't it a unsurprising until today, asians are incapable of starting innovative companies like Apple? But back to topic, many locals lost to FT simply because the FT was able to do more work for less money. Its not that we are no good. I mean - companies like Tesla - u think these companies came about simply because the boss could do more for less money? No no... Its because Elon Musk is a brilliant man. So same here, we got many brilliant singaporeans, but unfortunately our culture does not value the smart brains. They just want the cheapest car, clothes and shoes. And that is why FT are able to take over our jobs.</p>

              <p>The problem with the PAP government is they loosened up the Locals (Singaporeans+PR) to Foreigners ratio by too much.   For example for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">service sector</span>, the ratio is 55:45.  When you consider the fact the PRs are also foreigners, you would find out that the ratio actually allows more foreigners to be hired than locals.</p>
              <p>Given the fact the foreigners are cheaper, Singaporean guys have to go for reservist trainings and Singaporean ladies are given long maternity leaves, employers obviously would employ foreigners.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim Tean of NSP mentioned before local a First Class Honors graduate had problems getting a job because the jobs he applied for were taken up by foreigners ( <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/nsp-singaporeans-deserve-better-from-govt">http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/nsp-singaporeans-deserve-better-from-govt </a>).</p>
              <p>Developed countries like USA, UK, Japan, Germany and Australia have a much tigher foreign worker policy than us.</p>

              <p>What I am saying is the ratio ensures less than 50% of Singaporeans can find work in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Sector</span> since we do not consider PRs as Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>There are hardly any Bangalas in Service Sector.   If you are in an industry that needs Bagalas, you maybe in a sector that many Singaporeans do not wish to work in.   And even if you need to pay for their lodging, it is easy to take care of them since you basically could have  90%-100% of them....and they can fit in cheaper domintories.   9 years when I was in the renovation sector (cames under Construction Sector).   The Singaporean aircon subcon told me his profit eroded so much since Gain City utlized a huge team of Bagalas to compete with them...and Gain City exanded so fast.  As indicated by the taxi uncle ( <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/61-year-old-man-finally-passes-taxi-licence-test-after-failing-it-for-79-times">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/61-year-old-man-finally-passes-taxi-licence-test-after-failing-it-for-79-times</a> )  who needed 80 times to get his taxi license, locals were driven out of Construction Sector too where the ratio is 1:9 (more like 0.5:9.5 when you consider the fact that PRs are not Singaporeans).  Given such ratios, which Singaporean would want to enter this trade?  It ended up with a part-time lorry driver being Singaporean and 95% are foreign workers.   I also saw a company that fully employs Bagalas to compete against other companies whereby the Singaporean boss personally does the installation of high-class Black Galaxy marble table-tops.   So after the boss retires, it would be almost 100% foreigners.</p>
              <p>Our Food Courts are full of Ah Tiongs......more of them as appearing in Coffeeshops and Hawker Centres.   I am not saying we totally should not have foreign workers, I am saying our liberal foreign worker employment ratio allows too many of them in. </p>
              <p>Speaking about the issue of local lorry drivers fetching foreign workers....if not because the police looking at the employment pass job title and catching drivers who do not hold the title of Driver driving lorries, even local lorry drivers would be eliminated as they would ask the foreign workers to drive.</p>

              But its still much easier and cheaper to hire Malaysian workers. Employers don't have to secure the $5000 bond for them, only pay the monthly levy. Acommodation is not a problem for Malaysians because most of them either go back to JB after work to commute in and out on daily basis or they will stay with their relatives who are PRs/Singaporeans living in Singapore.

              <p>Neutral, i had small enterprises in mind - those sole proprietor and 1-2 person pte ltd. Budgets are nowhere in the million dollar range. This stage between starting out and hitting your 1st million is the hardest. Virtually no government support. As a one-man show - pls try to hire your foreign worker from anywhere. I can confident a singaporean is still the cheapest and easiest.</p>
              <p>All your examples are big corporations. Even if u hit a million dollars in revenue as an sme, u still need the support of a big extended family as ghost employees to shore up the local to foreigner ratio, just so u can hire that myanmar, chinese or malaysian. I saw this nonsense happening in many labor intensive businesses myself. For these kind of work, there is no use harping on productivity, u simply need those extra hands n legs.</p>
              <p>Of course there are ways to skirt this ratio and have 100% foreign workers. But it could be illegal. Dont bother envying those bosses because they are mostly engaged in hit n run trades. These businesses are not meant to be passed on to the children.</p>

              I give up. 2015 is my last vote for the GE. I will not vote anymore and I do not care anymore. Let those voters see what happens in the future themselves. Anyway, I have been taking care of myself and family without the government help. Ever since I moved to Johor Bahru, in Malaysia permanently in 2005, I have more than enough money and I am much happier. I am semi-retire now, working sometimes part- time just to pass time and buildup my own saving even more now than when I was living in Singapore in the past. Full retirement is not a problem for me when I am living in Johor Bahru, Skudai district. I am financially debt free and life is stress free for me now too.

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I work part-time in Singapore so I earn dollars then change some of my earning into ringgit malaysia.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">In Johor Bahru, there are two kind of workers. There are those living in Johor and working in Johor. These are the Malaysian workers who will complain about the cost of living in Johor. And then there are Malaysian workers who work in Singapore. These are the Malaysian workers who don't complain about the cost of living in Johor. In fact they are wealthy people and have plenty of money.</p>

As for my case, the property I'm living in now was purchased back in 1992 that was build on an international lot whereby foreigners (mainly Singaporeans) and Malaysians could buy too and its a freehold.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">About foreigners or Singaporeans buying properties in "Boleh Land" (Malaysia). Currently so far in Johor Bahru, about property value of RM1 million falling below RM1 million after purchasing it, it doesn't happen. Foreign investments in Iskandar Projects in fact are pouring and increasing every year. In 2015 itself, it about RM160 to 170 Billion ringgit. If you are a property speculator who are looking for a fast profit in a short term, it will not be a good deal for them at this moment. But if you buy because you want to live there and retire there, its a good deal because it doesn't affect you with the up and down of sales or resale value of that property. Its about timing and location as Sam Goi said in his interview. So its about your objective of buying a property in Malaysia too. In Johor Bahru for instance, once most of the Iskandar Project are completed and with the Express Train from Singapore in Tuas, running through Johor Bahru and connecting with mrt line systems in Johor within 5 years time, most property values in Johor Bahru, landed or condominiums will go up in value. Your property in Johor Bahru may go up in high value when that happens. Its all about what do you want from that property?</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">About speaking literally about crossing the bridge between Johor and Singapore, its not easy now. Well, its about getting used to it and after sometimes you will get used to it. The ironic about crossing the bridge is this for me each time and also for most Malaysians who are working in Singapore. The minute you set foot in Johor Bahru, regardless whether you take a bus in or you have you own transportation to return to Johor Bahru or you walk in, all your stress that your are feeling will somehow disappear and you will really feel good and happy. Funny but its true. A Malaysian told me once, "Its maybe because of the energy of the country", haha.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Thanks for your kind words. I am really having a peaceful life and I am happy in Johor Bahru.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">p.s. With S$3000 only, I can stretch that sing dollars to a year. I'm serious and I'm not joking.</p>

              <p>Again me and ktc is same POV. The best n fastest place to get rich is right here in singapore. Not JB, unless u got permission from TMJ to deliver sand to singapore. In JB u need to have royal links in order to prosper. But if the royal family comes every week to tanglin mall to shop for groceries, electronics (eg iphones) and medical treatment, what does that tell u? As royalty themselves, they also worried about buying fake iphones and toxic food in jb. TMJ does not even drive a malaysian car. He prefers a range rover.</p>
              <p>Singapore got many many things u can do to flip a profit. I spend 4 hrs here doing my own biz, maybe u need to work a week to earn the same amount in jb. Singapore is very safe.</p>
              <p>For instance (just one of several personal profit channels), my money is all changed to USD. Now with US interest rate hike, I got instant profit by thousands. I was not a fool to play leveraged online forex. I buy USD and sold SGD at a local bank months ago. This kind of kang tao, i am not sure i can perform in jb safely. Almos maciam money changer liao. </p>

              Malaysia also not so cheap anymore, best is still thailand, land of a thousand smiles and also a thousand problem.
              
              Well, as the saying goes, no risk, no pain = no gain, no shiok. Everyone of us, be it successful or retired or still struggling, whatever it is, each of us got our own limitation, you can go JB hv a good life, you can do a business and carry on with it, you can sar kar female lau chee boss and hope to get more income and stability, that is all up to you, but at the end of the day, there are also people like me, who just want a simple life, nor risk, nor pain but still can get the gain and shiok.
              
              So to each and everyone, as long as you are passionate with what you are doing, no harm anyone like our KTC, family happy, mistress ok if any, go in, go out people call you towkay or datuk, 4 meals per day of good foods, peace and harmony, and most importantly, healthy both physically and mentally, then we should say, that is a good life.
              
              But to be happy, it is different from a good life, happiness derives from giving.

              <p>Good, usually a stronger currency country will know how to use that benefit to fix into a lower currency country, is just like a British, when come Sinkie land, with the advantages of pound, they can adjust well........</p>
              <p>I'm into boleh land property since the early 2000s till now, white elephant projects, abandon projects see until don't want to see, Iskandar, so far, to my knowledge is still one of the reliable development in JB, mainly becos is on higher ground, drainage system not that critical.......</p>
              <p>Let me clarify my point on million ringgit property, I don't mean boleh land property prices is unstable, what I meant is from $300k ringgit curb to Sinkies to $500k to recent year 1 million ringgit, it show what? Too many foreign investors swarm into boleh land and with the weakening of ringgit, resulting in property ballooning too fast, hardest impact will be non other than their local itself.......</p>
              <p>Raising the minimum sum is necessary, what I meant is, a reasonable apartment or landed property usually won't price more than million ringgit, affordable for their local to purchase and their property index was at such.......</p>
              <p>Personally, I bought my unit in Jalan Rimba last time, just a piece of land for $150k ringgit that time, those are the time, with inside info, many foreigners like me rush in to buy........</p>
              <p>Living in boleh land is very much different, just quote some example, blackout, when blackout time, is not like Sinkie land hor, just call, very soon it will be restored, in boleh land, sometime it will takes days in order to rectify the fault.......Water, some area got this water ration thingy, they will close your water every 2-3 days, very destructive, there's is still a lot more to quote but just want to enlighten what kind of living standard you expecting in boleh land, even you stay in a nice bungalow........</p>
              <p>All the best to you, pm me if you interested in Iskandar projects <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">, currently a few projects selling like hot cake becos most units tag above million ringgit, knn, you say lor, locals will die bo, hahahaha........</p>

              <p>I have been to Legoland and Hello Kitty area many times. The Iskandar projects looks good but JB property is such that you must occupy it. Not buy and leave it empty. Quite impossible for me though, because my family hates going there. We dont need to save on groceries. They word 'cheap' does not excite us. The slow pace of life makes me, wife and children very irritable. Being born in the city, suddenly switch to kampung lifestyle is sibei jialat. So called stressful life in singapore is quite enjoyable and relaxed for me.</p>
              <p>People like me is cannot sit down and idle one, except in army - chao keng, attend B all the way, eat in canteen, play arcade machine, sleep in bunk and ask cook to make special dishes using leftover ingredients. Everything say dont know, and take cover as much as possible. That time no iphone or smartphone. I also dont know how I passed my time.</p>

              <p>Good, usually a stronger currency country will know how to use
              that benefit to fix into a lower currency country, is just like a
              British, when come Sinkie land, with the advantages of pound, they
              can adjust well........</p>
              <p>I'm into boleh land property since the early 2000s till now,
              white elephant projects, abandon projects see until don't want to
              see, Iskandar, so far, to my knowledge is still one of the reliable
              development in JB, mainly becos is on higher ground, drainage
              system not that critical.......</p>
              <p>Let me clarify my point on million ringgit property, I don't
              mean boleh land property prices is unstable, what I meant is from
              $300k ringgit curb to Sinkies to $500k to recent year 1 million
              ringgit, it show what? Too many foreign investors swarm into boleh
              land and with the weakening of ringgit, resulting in property
              ballooning too fast, hardest impact will be non other than their
              local itself.......</p>
              <p>Raising the minimum sum is necessary, what I meant is, a
              reasonable apartment or landed property usually won't price more
              than million ringgit, affordable for their local to purchase and
              their property index was at such.......</p>
              <p>Personally, I bought my unit in Jalan Rimba last time, just a
              piece of land for $150k ringgit that time, those are the time, with
              inside info, many foreigners like me rush in to buy........</p>
              <p>Living in boleh land is very much different, just quote some
              example, blackout, when blackout time, is not like Sinkie land hor,
              just call, very soon it will be restored, in boleh land, sometime
              it will takes days in order to rectify the fault.......Water, some
              area got this water ration thingy, they will close your water every
              2-3 days, very destructive, there's is still a lot more to quote
              but just want to enlighten what kind of living standard you
              expecting in boleh land, even you stay in a nice
              bungalow........</p>
              <p>All the best to you, pm me if you interested in Iskandar
              projects <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">, currently a
              few projects selling like hot cake becos most units tag above
              million ringgit, knn, you say lor, locals will die bo,

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I'm living at Taman Sri Putri, Skudai. Its a 2.5 storey double terrace house with high ceiling. Its a corner house with extra frontyard compound.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">In the beginning it was only a weekend house for family and also for my 2nd elder brother to stay for about 7 years with his wife and daughter until they get a suitable HDB flat again for themselves after they sold their HDB flat and also until my niece started her primary school education in Singapore. I was in Jakarta and then in Bali. Bought a landed property in Tomang, in Jakarta then sold it and moved to Bali. Bought a new property there at Taman Griya Nusa Dua, Nusa Dua, Bali. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Yes, you are right. Living in Boleh Land is alot different when compare to living in Singapore. You need to adjust and adapt your mindset and go with the flow. When you start comparing, you will feel frustrated and probably miserable. I learned this while I was living in Indonesia. The period between 2000 and 2009 was a roller coaster ride for most countries in this region. The 911 event, the war in Afghanistan and Iraq; and the global economics crisis caused economics recession in many countries. So its not surprising you see many white elephant projects back then. <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">That was one of the reason I decided to shift JB permanently.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> And yes, back then there were many blackouts. I had made sure that I had enough candles and enough torch lights should there be blackouts. LHL once told a joke in his speech that he was told by one of the foreign politician that, "Probably Singapore need to have more blackouts so the birth rate in Singapore will increase." Haha quite funny ya. Well, eversince Iskandar started to kick off somewhere in 2006, now since 2011 I think, hardly any blackouts anymore. They have upgraded the electricity power plants. Back then whenever I</span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> called the TNB call centre, the technician would call me within minutes to check and though its not that fast like in Singapore, they would arrived at my premises within 1 or 2 hours to rectify my electricity supply. Its better late then never. Usually its about my electricity fuse outside the house that was worn out and they replaced new one free of charge or the circuit breaker fuse that had worn out which they would advise that I replaced it with a new fuse or to check my internal wiring. That I needed to get an electrician to do it for me. They were not supposed to do if for me since it was inside the house and not outside the house. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">About restoring electricity supply, now TNB has a 24 hrs task force. Now usually my complain to them are the street lights in my neighbourhood which failed to light in the evening. Usually it get restore on that very same evening itself or the next day. Better late then never haha. Lately, I've seen many houses and condominiums installing solar panels on the rooftop to conserve energy and for alternative electricity supply. I think that is going to be a common sights in JB soon.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">About water rationing. In the past until now, no problem with water supply and in my neighbourhood we don't have water rationing even during the long dry season. Most of the landed properties in Taman Sri Putri, water tanks are installed above bathroom ceiling. Yes, water rationing did happen to other areas mainly because of the long dry season. Probably when they replace those old water storage tanks with a new larger one in those housing estates that were affected it will solve problem during the long dry season. Besides that the water saving campaign will help them to educate the public about the precious water usage.  </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Johor Bahru or Johor State has so much land. The locals have many options. If they choose to buy a property within Iskandar Project areas, they must prepare to pay the market price. Or they can choose to remain living in their current homes whether its a small or big house on their own land or within the housing estates that are located within Iskandar Project area, have it renovated or rebuild it again from scratch for a bigger space. Those first time home buyers from low income household can opt to buy low cost housing, "Rent As You Own" housing scheme from the government. There are many matured low cost housing flat and single storey terrace houses which they can buy on resale value too if they know its within their budget. They can even buy those houses located outside Iskandar Project further up in the north or in other town in Johor. Or they can choose to sell their properties and shift to another town or state. The Iskandar Projects are designated for foreign and local investments. There are many areas too that are meant for low cost housing or average cost housing for the locals. They just need to make the right choice for themselves.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Food are affordable too. They can choose too. They are many Pasar Tani (Farmer Markets), Wet Markets, Mini Markets and Supermarkets for them to buy their daily needs. And the prices are monitored and control by the government, more stringently especially before the coming of any festive celebration.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">There many foreign companies in Johor Baru or in Johor State now. They can work for them and earn a living. The current national minimum salary for them is RM900 per month for Malaysians and migrant workers. Malaysians are paid higher salary. A McDonald crew who is a Malaysian is paid a basic salary of RM1100 per month excluding OT.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The trend now, there are many Malaysians from other states in the north are transiting in JB, hoping to get work in Singapore because of the high currency exchange rate. So its up to them to choose.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">No thank you. Taman Sri Putri now is within the area of Iskandar Project. Its near to The Platino condos, The Paradigm, Mutiara Rini and Mutiara Mas residence. Besides, I'm 52 right now and I don't want to create a new financial burden for myself</span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Thanks and all the best to you too bro.</p>

                  Everyone of us, be it successful or retired or still struggling,
                  whatever it is, each of us got our own limitation, you can go JB hv

              <p>So to each and everyone, as long as you are passionate with what

              <p>My second elder brother married to a Thai. My sister-in-law got her Singapore Citizenship after living in Singapore for 20 over years. They have a daughter born in Singapore. A few years ago, my brother sold his HDB flat and all of them migrated to Thailand. They are doing good there. My brother own a small Hotel and a cybercafe there. My niece is studying in an International School there.</p>
              <p>Being contented in life and having a simple life now is good and happiness for me. Giving is whenever you help anyone that need your help in whatever and whichever way you can help them. That will make you feel satisfied and happy too.</p>

              <p>zulkifli, I was very happy to read that you managed your family well, and found contentment and success in life.</p>
              <p>For me to be honest, my secret dream is to live in somewhere along the west coast of america - places like santa clara san jose, right where my idols are - apple, tesla and amazon.</p>
              <p>Whatever disgraceful and shameful things I had to endure in my life was so that my kids can get an education and hopefully find the motivation to search for success in america. Then again, I dont believe in forcing my ideas on others. Humans cannot be compelled through constant criticisms. Much encouragement and just a little bit of caning to keep them straight. I hope they find well educated spouses with big dreams.</p>
              <p>I did not chose this country because I love it so much. The main reason is because this is the only proven place on earth where people can dream, collaborate (not the a-star style of rubbish collaboration), make many mistakes, persist and finally find success.</p>

              They are many Pasar Tani (Farmer Markets), Wet Markets, Mini
              Markets and Supermarkets for them to buy their daily needs. And the
              prices are monitored and control by the government, more
              stringently especially before the coming of any festive
              celebration.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">There many foreign companies in Johor Baru or
              in Johor State now. They can work for them and earn a living. The
              current national minimum salary for them is RM900 per month for
              Malaysians and migrant workers. Malaysians are paid higher salary.
              A McDonald crew who is a Malaysian is paid a basic salary of RM1100
              per month excluding OT.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The trend now, there are many Malaysians from
              other states in the north are transiting in JB, hoping to get work
              in Singapore because of the high currency exchange rate. So its up
              to them to choose.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">No thank you. Taman Sri Putri now is within
              the area of Iskandar Project. Its near to The Platino condos, The
              Paradigm, Mutiara Rini and Mutiara Mas residence. Besides, I'm 52
              right now and I don't want to create a new financial burden for
              myself</span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">.</span></p>

              <p>One thing about dealing boleh land property, check, check and check, screen, screen and screen, before committed, of course again, those are the years, currently, a million ringgit property in JB don't really got much choice, Condo, apartment confirm is out, terrace house, provided is corner with big build up, maybe 75 x 35 type, other than that, now Sinkies only can invest in Semi-D or bungalow, not easy to lease out, for own stay is too big to maintain.......</p>
