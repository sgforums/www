              Work is no problem, working actually is a double saving, as you work, you earn and do not spent, if you no work, no earning and yet more spending. But are we born just to work with no life, are we so stagnated and generic in our process of our life.
              
              Born, study, work, Married, work harder, have childrens, work more harder...till the end. Is that what we want in our life...it so robotic isn't it.
              
              Work is of course a must lah, but also must hv time for yourselves, enjoy the lifespan and at the same time, be simple and contended, otherwise earn $20k per month also no enough, like me, spent life wisely, call bak bak also call the cheap one, then eng eng go drink, drive casket and do some other easy income job and happily past our life.
              
              Planning for tomorrow is ok, but many peoples end up worrying about tomorrow. That is a big different.

              <p>That quotation you are basing on are the nett household income of a couple. They need to spread their expanditures and they cannot really save on the full salary for savings. They definitely will not have enough CPF to put that 20% downpayment for that 4 room HDB flat. After deducting their monthly 20% of gross salary, about 60 or 70 per cent goes to their expenditures and finance support to their family (that if they are supporting their parents and the household expenditures if they are hopefully).</p>
              <p>Graduates in Singapore average salary now is at S$2400 to $2500 per month. And for ITE is around S$1800 to S$2000. Those without ITE/G.C.E. 'A' Level (tertiary education) are even earning a salary less than S$1800 per month, approximately about S$1100 to S$1300 salaries per month. Those are statistics salaries figure as a whole and not individually. You will be surprised in the job market, many employers are not paying that salary figures to those students just graduated because they have no working experience. This is because they joined the workforce late or very late. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">They could only afford to pay that 20% downpayment (without their parents help) for a 2 room or 3 room BTO HDB Flat. If they wish to purchase a 4 room BTO HDB flat or more, they need to accumulate their CPF for many years before they could even pay for that 20% downpayment deductable from their CPF account.</span></p>
              <p>So my question here is, at what age they should start work? The earlier the better. Lets say 17, 18 or 19 years old, so that they will have enough CPF to get a HDB flat (but that is not possible because many Singaporeans youth are Paper Chasers; and especially for male, they have to serve full time NS and many even keep deferring that NS because of their studies, and many of them also even fake their NS deferment with an excuse of pursuing their studies). Or the Singapore education system is the cause of Singapore youths to join the workforce and start their career late?</p>
              <p>So what age should they start work and save and have enough CPF to buy HDB flat? Or is it, because their salary after graduating from Secondary/ITE/College/Polytechnic/University is not enough for them?</p>

              <p>What I was saying is you must have family planning.... save a

              that the wife can anytime stop work anytime to have a baby and take
              care of home without having to hire a maid.   5-6 years of two

              .</p>
              <p>How many people could earn 10K a month by the age of 30?
               Not many....but $3.2K a month to feed 2 adults and 1 baby
              possible or not?   Sure possible one.</p>
              <p>However if you go for matured-estate BTO, Condo or HDB resale,
              you would have to service your loan for a much longer time unless
              you earn very high salary.</p>
              <p>Also there are optional money that need not be spent like piano
              and tuition.  School fees are cheaper than nursery cost but
              only for two years only.... Mother can ownself teach kid so no need
              tutor.</p>
              <p>Big expense renovation count it together with flat price.
               If not enough, work a few months extra before wife quit job
              to have a baby.</p>
              <p>However, if the person and wife did not study hard enough to at
              least reach ITE level, then they would have to work very long hours
              to make ends meet (Security Guards and class-4 drivers could earn
              more than 2K per month).</p>

              Sorry bro, not trying to be funny here.
              
              Majority of Singaporeans are average income earner. How many of them have S$10,000 or S$15,000 saving in their bank account? (Please do not include the credit card advance cash because that is not a saving because when you use that amount you are in debt with the bank)

              <div><br></div>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I quoted degree holders salary based on this ( <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/higher-median-pay-for-fresh-grads-last-year-survey">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/higher-median-pay-for-fresh-grads-last-year-survey</a> ).  Poly grads salary is $2000.... so ITE grads salary is lower (based on the fact that only the best ITE grads could advance to Poly level).</p>
              <p>Work age depends on when they finished their education.  Male degree holders could start as early as 24; female degree holders could start as early as 22....so the lower educational qualification people would start earlier than degree holders.  However, in the ITE example I quoted earlier assuming lady starting work at the age of 19 and guy at 21, I assumed they did not fail in school and went to Express stream before going to ITE.   I left out those who went through the Normal stream channel or failed in school before.</p>
              <p>As for down payment, they definitely could afford to pay for 4-rm initial payment after working for at least 2 years of working if they bothered to save at least additional 13% on top of forced saving from CPF (which is 37%) assuming they have at least ITE qualifications.   However, if they do not bother to save or chose not to save, then it would be longer time to pay off loans.</p>
              <p>If 4-rm flat is $210,000, 20% would be $42,000....</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">If we use ITE grad's starting salary of $1600 per month as example, he or she would earn $19200 per year.  However he would receive normally at least 13th month salary and 17% additional CPF contribution from employer.   So effectively he would be earning additional $3264+$1600=$24064 per year.  The tax rates for these lower salary earners would be closed to zero.   If he works for the government, then he would earn even more since they receive 3 months bonuses every year.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">If he or she saves half of this amount, he would be saving $12000 per year.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">So if his partner also saves half, they would save $24,000 per year.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">So they would save $48,000 in two years which is adequate for a 4-rm flat downpayment.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">However, if they are unable to save at least half of what they earn including CPF (it is more than at the 50% mark because not all money in CPF account could be used for purchasing HDB flat), then they would take longer to fully-own their flats.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">However, I assumed that their parents are still working (gave birth to them at age of 35, they are 21, so 56 still working) and do not need them to really chip in a lot for family expenditure and they would not spend a lot beyond required expenditures like bus-fare and food.   So they would have a max expenditure of $1000 ($12000/12) per month on the average each.  </p>

              <p>I quoted degree holders salary based on this ( <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/higher-median-pay-for-fresh-grads-last-year-survey"> http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/higher-median-pay-for-fresh-grads-last-year-survey</a> ).
               Poly grads salary is $2000.... so ITE grads salary is lower
              (based on the fact that only the best ITE grads could advance to
              Poly level).</p>
              <p>Work age depends on when they finished their education.
               Male degree holders could start as early as 24; female degree
              holders could start as early as 22....so the lower educational
              qualification people would start earlier than degree holders.
               However, in the ITE example I quoted earlier assuming lady
              starting work at the age of 19 and guy at 21, I assumed they did
              not fail in school and went to Express stream before going to ITE.
                I left out those who went through the Normal stream channel
              or failed in school before.</p>
              <p>As for down payment, they definitely could afford to pay for
              4-rm initial payment after working for at least 2 years of working
              if they bothered to save at least additional 13% on top of forced
              saving from CPF (which is 37%) assuming they have at least ITE
              qualifications.   However, if they do not bother to save or
              chose not to save, then it would be longer time to pay off
              loans.</p>
              <p>If 4-rm flat is $210,000, 20% would be $42,000....</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">If we
              use ITE grad's starting salary of $1600 per month as example, he or
              she would earn $19200 per year.  However he would receive
              normally at least 13th month salary and 17% additional CPF
              contribution from employer.   So effectively he would be
              earning additional $3264+$1600=$24064 per year.  The tax rates
              for these lower salary earners would be closed to zero.   If
              he works for the government, then he would earn even more since
              they receive 3 months bonuses every year.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">If he
              or she saves half of this amount, he would be saving $12000 per
              year.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">So if
              his partner also saves half, they would save $24,000 per year.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">So
              they would save $48,000 in two years which is adequate for a 4-rm
              flat downpayment.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">However, if they are unable to save at least half of what they earn
              including CPF (it is more than at the 50% mark because not all
              money in CPF account could be used for purchasing HDB flat), then
              they would take longer to fully-own their flats.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">However, I assumed that their parents are still working (gave birth
              to them at age of 35, they are 21, so 56 still working) and do not
              need them to really chip in a lot for family expenditure and they
              would not spend a lot beyond required expenditures like bus-fare
              and food.   So they would have a max expenditure of $1000
              ($12000/12) per month on the average each.  </p>

              Its easier said then done. Many would be spending their money on their selves firsts like automobiles, motorbikes, mobiles, laptop, desktop, fashion wears, patronising the restaurants, the bars at clarke quay etcs. Some would be supporting their family expenditures and probably their other siblings education. Many even went bankrupt before they could start their careers because of credit cards. If this going to happen the way you see, they really need to be discipline in their budget which many can see are not happening here in Singapore.

              <p>There is a loophole in our immigration policy.   Many Malaysians see it this way that it is better for them not to take up Singapore citizenship but continue to work in Singapore.</p>
              <p>They operate within the rules without violation.</p>
              <p>In USA for example, after taking up PR status, you have to become an American citizen within 10 years otherwise you lose your PR status.  However in Singapore, you can be a Singapore PR until you die.     </p>
              <p>So if you are Malaysian after considering all factors, you would more likely choose to remain a Malaysian as you could:</p>
              <p>a) Buy a property (house or shophouse) in Malaysia for less than 1 million ringgit.</p>
              <p>b) You  (and your offsprings) do not have to serve national service and do not have to go for reservist trainings.</p>
              <p>c) Earn same pay as Singaporeans (or get the job because they are cheaper than Singaporeans).</p>
              <p>d) Still be able to buy HDB flat via BTO route if you marry or is married to a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>e) Get a headstart of 2 years over Singaporean males ( two years faster for promotion ).</p>
              <p>f) Earn more money after factoring what you paid for in additional school fees (during schooling years) during the two years when the Singaporean male has to do national service.   [ If he is a degree holder, he earns at least $100,000 in two years and the Singaporean non-officer guy only earns $20000 during two years NS period, he does not pay additional $80000 in school fees over the Singaporean guy]</p>
              <p>g) Focus on just studying to get into university without having to think of training up for NS.</p>
              <p>h) Marry a Singaporean lady more easily because the Singaporean lady finds someone who did not serve national service as same level as them and a Singaporean guy as two years behind (education, career, wealth and thinking wise). [actually NS also cause another social problem in Singapore that the mass media in Singapore withheld (in 1992-1994 MM LKY delivered a speech about it in Australia but it was not published in Singapore) which is the high unmarriage rate of Singaporean female graduates, I have not been able to find data about unmarried female graduate rates in Singapore from the internet)</p>
              <p>i) Have a backup path at home in Malaysia ( if become Singaporean, no backup path in Malaysia ).   Backup path as a businessman not an employee (pay too low in Malaysia) as ability to buy cheap properties is a real advantage.</p>
              <p>j) Company bosses and collegues prefer employees who do not have to take unpaid leaves of 2 weeks to 1 month (SAF offers makeup pay to companies so viturally unpaid leaves) for 15-25 years.   Bosses employed them because they could work 12 months per year not take 2 weeks to 1 months unpaid leaves more than others.  Collegues (including superiors) think everytime they go for reservists trainings, our workload increase so much and it becomes so stressful.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> When you consider all factors, is it better to be a Malaysian guy or a Singaporean guy?</span>  Probably the only advantage to be a Singaporean guy is can become taxi driver if get retrenched but again this advantage almost disappeared with the entry of Uber and Grabcar and could totally disappear since government is taking away tax payers money (including additional $72 million from taxi rental GST and taxi company profit tax) to sponsor driverless car R&amp;D (claimed as driverless car R&amp;D but with the intention of eliminating taxi drivers).</p>
              <p>Back in the late 80s (do not know whether they are still doing it right now), the government was using tax payers money to get RSAF pilot instructors to train Malaysian ASEAN scholars and making sure they would definutely get their pilot license in Junior Flying Club wheras many Singaporean trainees would fail (without this guarantee).  None of these foreign scholars had to serve National Service.   And why did these scholars need Singapore's pilot licenses?</p>
              <p>Back in the 70s when I was entering Primary School, I could not get into any of the 6 primary schools that were within 1.5 KM of where I stayed at despite studying in a government kindergarden in the same district.  My mother had to make a trip to the district MP's office to get it resolved.   What I discovered after getting in is Malaysians PRs got in (I supposed without having to make a trip to the MP's office). The reason why I did not get into any primary school as a born-Singapore was definitely not because I did badly in the kindergarden because I was positioned academically in the top quarter in my primary one class at the end of primary one year.</p>

              True. Like the fable story of Adam. He wanted to be wise like God and he ate the fruit of knowledge after Satan deceived him that he could gain all the Wisdom of God by eating the apple in the garden of Eden which was forbidden by God. Its like all us on earth now.
                  
              I like to parable it  just like a driver who only knows how to drive a car with automated gear versus a driver who knows how to drive a car with manual gear.
                  
              Those who only knows how to drive an auto gear car will have difficulties driving a manual gear car. Whereas for those who knows how to drive a manual gear car will have no problems at all when they drive a car with auto gear car. 
                  
              And one more thing I like to add here. 
                  
              When an auto gear car breakdown in the middle of the road, it get stuck and causes inconvenience to many vehicles. A tow truck is needed to move the car from the middle of the road. 
                  
              Whereas a car with manual gear when breakdown in the middle of the road, the driver can simply push the car to the side of road and hence no obstruction to other road users.

              Recession is inevitable, from kindergarden start, there already have recess time, if there is no recession, there will not be blooming. Therefore, take is as a pinch of salt that the economy need a rest, so instead of looking at stock, which we also got no money to buy and not to mention also dunno how to buy, 
              
              So be focus on how are you going to make a living during such time. Like you know recession will create lots of disappointment, bankruptcy, sadness and so on, so you might see more committing suicide or hv a mental to do it, so you can either go upgrade with yr skilfuture funds to be casket driver, sai kong, priest, iman or monks, or also can be train as counselors to refrain them from suicide or any awkward behavorial.

              "Crisis" derive from a Latin word called "Crossroad". So it mean, at certain time, we will come into a cross road no matter how straight the road is, and at this cross road, it actually give you an opportunity to choose which one to takes, therefore, at time recession is good and full of opportunity for pple to change, otherwise, tiam tiam peng steering, good morning sir, good morning miss,..buay sian meh?

              Yes, but economy fluctuation is unlike our lanjiao, go up very fast, come down also very fast, than stay down for a long time..sometime, really cannot go up. 
              
              At the peak, it can still go up, and form another loop up thru innovation and change, it doesn't mean it must go down after reaching it peak.

              <p>Haha..that is a very peculiar way to describe the economy. I'm going to oblige your answer. Hmm..depending on your age, the penis will go up and down very fast or not. And when you already too old, the penis will have diffifculties in erection and many too their penis never go up again. They take viagra to do that. Maybe in the future, Scientists and Surgeons will find a way to have a penis transplant.</p>
              <p>I tell you this joke ok.</p>
              <p>There was a man. He has difficulties in getting his penis to erect and his wife is getting tired of his inability to have sex with her. So he went to see a doctor. The doctor said he has a device when inserted into his penis he has no problem having a full erection. But he can only use it 6 times. All he has to do is to say "Pip-Pip" to erect his penis and say another "Pip-Pip" to bring his penis down. So he agreed with the doctor and have that device inserted into into his penis.</p>
              <p>So when the man reach his home in the late evening, he saw his wife in the living room and carry her quickly to their bedroom, place her on the bed and he got undress quickly in the dark. He cannot wait to have sex with his wife and satisfy her sex desires.</p>
              <p>Then he said, "Pip-PiP". And true enough he can feel his penis has full erection and he feels excited. But then suddenly, a car passby outside their house and horn "Pip-pip". His penis went down quickly.</p>
              <p>Frustrated with that car driver, he said "Pip-Pip" and it went up again. And again another car horn "Pip-pip" outside their house because the road is busy with traffic. His penis go down again.</p>
              <p>This time he was so angry and frustrated, he yells "Pip-pip". He quickly jump over his wife to have sex with her and then his wife asks, "What is this Pip-pip business?".</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>"At the peak, it can still go up, and form another loop up thru innovation and change, it doesn’t mean it must go down after reaching it peak."</strong></span></p>
              <p>Innovation and change is for long term process. While in the progress of trials and errors through innovation and change, the short term economy process will definitely face downhill. It is difficult for Singapore to stabilize and maintain while awaiting for innovation and change to work...like the Government usually say, "Singapore is going through economics restructuring". How long that driveless vehicles are going to be on the roads of Singapore and becomes a successful projects. How long will it takes for Singapore to become a smart city?</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Singapore has no natural resources and food resources. Singapore open economy is controlled by other countries. Singapore rely so much on import goods. </span></p>
