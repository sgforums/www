              <p>Si Gin Na, what else u expecting from me?</p>
              <p>If u expecting Uncle to just came back from work, dun sleep, still must find time to do research and dig up past post just to "ham thumb" u? please, u not worth my doing all these yet.</p>
              <p>Not many people can draw me out of my self imposed exile to do all these. U know, doing all these needs time and effort and lots of brain cells will die in the process and I am just not willing to do that just to nail you down.</p>
              <p>Gosh! u really got lots of "hate" fans man! In fact, I dun even have to dig, Just woke up and see if this thread is still around, found several PM by yr some call "hat fans" giving me links (bullets) to all your previous post - your very own post that contradict to what u ranting at now. I really cannot be bother to use all these on you.</p>
              <p>Doing so, would make me in the same league as u and JDIL. As they say - Birds of a feather flock together. While JDIL uses his own subforum to bash me up and delete every post I rebutt (akin to tying all my legs and hands) giving me no avenue of defends, you the same in what u doing to Poolman currently. Gosh, u really must have gone through lots of effort just for the words "hate" or "revenge" or as RBS70 uses - "cut grass must destroy it's roots." I am defintely not in that league.</p>
              <p>Things that create alot of bad karma while not beneficial to me, I let u do it, I passed.</p>
              <p>So just woke up, teeth also haven't brush, write so many words for you, u happy now Si Gin Na? I go brush teeth and walk my dog liao.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I know your next reply cannot be better than your last. I had slapped you in my post, you fill the pain right? so it's natural you slapped me back, with as much hatred and feel as u can gather, this is real right? Why u can feel the real pain when ppl "tekang" you while when u do to others, you said it's "virtual"?</p>

              <p>But you are ony half right regarding FireIce.</p>
              <p>At least, she only locked the post, it stays there and doesn't disappear.</p>
              <p>If I post this on Limo forum, it will be gone in no time.</p>
              <p>But while she is doing well, it also make people like u abusing the system by again starting another thread and rant and rant and rant again.</p>
              <p>Soon, she will have no choice but to do what the others do - delete or even ban that asshole.</p>
              <p>Actually, JDIL is just talking cock only, 100% not delete? He never add the fine print there - if you dun talk bad about me in my forum la.</p>
              <p>Who in the right frame of mind would allow ppl to badmouth him in his own forum or posting against his interest in his own forum when he got this veto power of deletion in hand. I say he is mad.</p>
              <p>If he won't do it, he expect others to do it?</p>

              <p>Yawn, another round of talking in circles by the 56 year school boy.</p>
              <p>Can't give 1 straight answer.</p>
              <p>Oh boy 1 or 2 of the fans boys tekan me? Oh dear, can I go cry now?</p>
              <p>Lol, pls ar, tekan all you want, make you shiok I happy for you, after all that's exactly what your chief ordered. Go study his directive properly. He might even promote you, especially with more tekan.</p>
              <p>Anyway thank you for proving a point with your big words, references and infantile comments. Know a little, but talk a lot with a fanciful words, none of which make sense except to highlight your stupidity.</p>
              <p>After everything over then only wanna be hero. A typical cyber warrior like your hero.</p>
              <p>Don't worry I'll let you have the last word. I already had my point proven by you, I wouldn't be requiring anymore confirmation.</p>
              <p>Enjoy being a legend in your own mind.</p>
