              <p>For those not in the know, this was the actual forum that was set up 
                  in sgforums. After some time, a user (Poolman) wanted to have his very 
                  own forum, which supposedly was for taxi drivers only - hence we had 
                  Taxi Drivers forum.</p>
              <p>However he has now abandoned that forum, and 
                  we can once again return here and post. Which I think is a better forum.
                   For too long we have forgotten that taxi driving must have the most 
                  important feature - the passenger. That forum, whilst being very useful 
                  and informative to some taxi drivers especially newbies had 1 major 
                  drawback - it became an anti-passenger forum for the most part.</p>
              <p>1 
                  user namely BingJames, the one who got assaulted has come out to say he 
                  regrets the demise of that forum, as have some cabbies/users. They 
                  regard Poolman very highly, arguing that he as the owner had put in a 
                  lot of time and effort. BJ has gone on with his high command of English 
                  to lambast myself, Rbs and JDIL for forcing Poolman out.</p>
              <p>There has
                   been a lot of back and forth regarding this issue and the blame 
                  thereof. But let not those in glass houses throw stones. Let's put it 
                  back to BJ and ask him this:</p>
              <p>Does he condone the actions of the mod?</p>
              <p>A mod who:</p>
              <p>1) Cheated a pax into paying $150 while he was drunk</p>
              <p>2) Slapped a non paying female pax</p>
              <p>3) Encouraged the taking of law into one's own hands</p>
              <p>4) Encourage taxi drivers to make false reports</p>
              <p>5) Maximising income at the expense of passengers.</p>
              <p>6) Encouraged the disregard of passengers staying in 'lousy areas'</p>
              <p>7)
                   Wished that a major outbreak like Sars would happen again, so most 
                  would give up taxi driving, or taxi drivers must learn to suffer, irregardless of pppl dting.</p>
              <p>And many more. This is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
              <p>BJ
                   says he is a Soka Buddhist and believes in karma. As a Buddhist does he
                   condone all the above actions? Or does he think it's wrong?</p>
              <p>If he
                   does think it wrong, then the question begets: Why didn't you or anyone
                   else raise any objections? Or even the other Mod. Why did you all keep 
                  silent until now? Why not come out and say as you do now, what has 
                  happened to the forum?</p>
              <p>Is it because the Mod is your friend and 
                  you just couldn't bring yourselves to confront him and demand better 
                  conduct online or in real life?</p>
              <p>Then why are you all blaming 
                  others, who objected to such wrongful behaviour? Poolman can be your 
                  friend in real life, he could have helped you in many things, maybe even
                   shared his takings with you on your bad days, but how does that square 
                  with what he posted?</p>
              <p>He could have done many things in the forum. Provided all sorts of useful tips and info, but does that give him the 
                  right to break the law or encourage it?</p>
              <p>When he mentioned in 
                  reference to your assault that in future all td should make a report of 
                  robbery instead of assault so as to ensure the police would do 
                  something, why didn't you as the victim and the 1 with the most relation
                   to it, did not make a stand? Why didn't you post then and say, Poolamn,
                   no, my assault case is assault, we mustn't lie and make it into 
                  robbery?</p>
              <p>What was the other mod doing when he started to add his 
                  own unsubstantiated views in threads that were factual like expresway 
                  cameras, cctvs and other stuff, and some including me disagreed 
                  strongly? Why didn't that Mod come in and edit and say, let's just stick
                   to facts gentleman?</p>
              <p>None of you had the guts or maturity to come
                   in and say, no, we must stop encouraging all this as it puts all 
                  drivers in a bad light.</p>
              <p>Mind you this is not a personal blog or a closed forum, it's an open forum read by anybody and everybody.</p>
              <p>If
                   you guys didn't want to take a stand, then don't fault those who dared 
                  to and said enough is enough. All we asked is to stop posting such 
                  rubbish and return to the facts as it it is. If you want to add your 
                  say, do it diplomatically, not adopt an 'I say means correct' attitude.</p>
              <p>BJ,
                   Poolman may be upset with the police action in your case or with those 
                  involving his friends, but that doesn't give him the license to accuse 
                  the whole force.</p>
              <p>Yours is just an assault, I had the misfortune of finding a taxi driver murdered in his cab!</p>
              <p>I
                   can't remember whether it was 1994 or 1995, but a cab driver was found 
                  strangled to death at Mar Thoma Road off Moonstone Lane. I can still 
                  remember his face. The meter was showing $39.40. That case remains 
                  unsolved and don't say the police did nothing. They poured every 
                  resource into it, but the culprit(s) got away. Or even an unrelated case
                   to tds - the unsolved murder of Winifred Teo in 1985. A young CJC girl 
                  murdered and raped near her school. That culprit remains at large. You 
                  think the officers involved were not affected? Do you think the police 
                  want them to get away?</p>
              <p>So do you still condone his actions? Why 
                  didn't you speak to him and admonish him first? Or do you not have the 
                  guts to do so? Why didnt you ask or stop to think where were all your LV
                   friends and him, why couldn't they spare the effort to help you at CC 
                  View, instead of talking shop at Lavender or grumbling online?</p>
              <p>I 
                  think it's for the better also that that forum is now dead, because at 
                  the rate it was going, it was only a matter of time, before the 
                  authorities stepped in and started taking action against him, or suay suay some
                   of us.</p>
              <p>That forum became the personal plaything of a selfish mod,
                   who thought only of himself and his ego, and in doing so, further 
                  tarnished the image of all ordinary taxi drivers. Only you and his 
                  friends have foolishly stuck with a such a shallow person.</p>
              <p>You are
                   free to join him and follow him, but the moment you all speak in a 
                  public forum, please realise that not everyone will put up with such 
                  rubbish.</p>

              <p>And tolongla, use your brains a bit, don't bring the PAP or politics into it.</p>
              <p>You can be a die-hard PAP supporter, goodonya. But others have a different view.</p>
              <p>Personally I am not anti-PAP. I will be the 1st to acknowledge they have done many good things, LKY did a lot of good, and they have some very good MPS like Lily Neo, Inderjit etc.</p>
              <p>But we are paying them a lot of money to do a job, all we ask is a bit more understanding of how much their policies are now causing problems on the ground. </p>
              <p>If you want, compare your forum Mod to the PAP, he had done a lot of good in the past, but does that give the license to post and do whatever he likes in the forum?</p>

              <p>Ppl complain abt Fireice way of doing things, but I think she acted very maturedly in this whole episode.</p>
              <p>She had 3 options when Poolamn asked her to ban me:</p>
              <p>1) Accede to his request</p>
              <p>2) Ban both of us</p>
              <p>3) Take no action.</p>
              <p>She chose 3, why? Because that's the most logical and matured thing to do. He is a Mod, he is incharge, what is he doing in regard to whatever issue he's facing?</p>
              <p>Shouldn't he</p>
              <p>a) either PM or post asking me the reasons why I was doing as such?</p>
              <p>b) Come out in the open and post a thread calling for a truce and asking everyone what seems to be the issue with the forum becoming so polarised.</p>
              <p>I am no revolutionary, I am a reactionary. I react to what is done. I wasn't calling for his ouster, just for more sensible posting and moderation, not cut, delete or edit everything.</p>
              <p>Yet he couldn't even have the maturity to do that, instead he went sulking and whining, claiming it's his personal forum, he's the big chief, he doesn't have to put up with anti-himself comments. All the time forgetting it's a public one, he doesn't 'own' the forum, he's only the leader.</p>
              <p>As a leader, shouldn't the leader take the first step and find out what's wrong? And solve it?</p>
              <p>Fireice has shown a lot of leadership in this forum, see how she handles controversial topics, she let's ppl post and then locks it, if she thinks it's going south.</p>
              <p>She doesn't try to throw her weight around.</p>

              <p>Dying to be heard? Oh dear, BJ the poor school boy, must only get his say, ppl cannot respond. Like his master.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should brush up on the fatherhood lessons, unless like your chief, it's ok in your home to teach your kids to cheat is all right.</p>
              <p>Lock also better. No point arguing with a clown who can only talk big online. Real life like a mouse.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JoeRaj:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>For those not in the know, this was the actual forum that was
              set up in sgforums. After some time, a user (Poolman) wanted to
              have his very own forum, which supposedly was for taxi drivers only
              - hence we had Taxi Drivers forum.</p>
              <p>However he has now abandoned that forum, and we can once again
              return here and post. Which I think is a better forum. For too long
              we have forgotten that taxi driving must have the most important
              feature - the passenger. That forum, whilst being very useful and
              informative to some taxi drivers especially newbies had 1 major
              drawback - it became an anti-passenger forum for the most part.</p>
              <p>1 user namely BingJames, the one who got assaulted has come out
              to say he regrets the demise of that forum, as have some
              cabbies/users. They regard Poolman very highly, arguing that he as
              the owner had put in a lot of time and effort. BJ has gone on with
              his high command of English to lambast myself, Rbs and JDIL for
              forcing Poolman out.</p>
              <p>There has been a lot of back and forth regarding this issue and
              the blame thereof. But let not those in glass houses throw stones.
              Let's put it back to BJ and ask him this:</p>
              <p>Does he condone the actions of the mod?</p>
              <p>A mod who:</p>
              <p>1) Cheated a pax into paying $150 while he was drunk</p>
              <p>2) Slapped a non paying female pax</p>
              <p>3) Encouraged the taking of law into one's own hands</p>
              <p>4) Encourage taxi drivers to make false reports</p>
              <p>5) Maximising income at the expense of passengers.</p>
              <p>6) Encouraged the disregard of passengers staying in 'lousy
              areas'</p>
              <p>7) Wished that a major outbreak like Sars would happen again, so
              most would give up taxi driving, or taxi drivers must learn to
              suffer, irregardless of pppl dting.</p>
              <p>And many more. This is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
              <p>BJ says he is a Soka Buddhist and believes in karma. As a
              Buddhist does he condone all the above actions? Or does he think
              it's wrong?</p>
              <p>If he does think it wrong, then the question begets: Why didn't
              you or anyone else raise any objections? Or even the other Mod. Why
              did you all keep silent until now? Why not come out and say as you
              do now, what has happened to the forum?</p>
              <p>Is it because the Mod is your friend and you just couldn't bring
              yourselves to confront him and demand better conduct online or in
              real life?</p>
              <p>Then why are you all blaming others, who objected to such
              wrongful behaviour? Poolman can be your friend in real life, he
              could have helped you in many things, maybe even shared his takings
              with you on your bad days, but how does that square with what he
              posted?</p>
              <p>He could have done many things in the forum. Provided all sorts
              of useful tips and info, but does that give him the right to break
              the law or encourage it?</p>
              <p>When he mentioned in reference to your assault that in future
              all td should make a report of robbery instead of assault so as to
              ensure the police would do something, why didn't you as the victim
              and the 1 with the most relation to it, did not make a stand? Why
              didn't you post then and say, Poolamn, no, my assault case is
              assault, we mustn't lie and make it into robbery?</p>
              <p>What was the other mod doing when he started to add his own
              unsubstantiated views in threads that were factual like expresway
              cameras, cctvs and other stuff, and some including me disagreed
              strongly? Why didn't that Mod come in and edit and say, let's just
              stick to facts gentleman?</p>
              <p>None of you had the guts or maturity to come in and say, no, we
              must stop encouraging all this as it puts all drivers in a bad
              light.</p>
              <p>Mind you this is not a personal blog or a closed forum, it's an
              open forum read by anybody and everybody.</p>
              <p>If you guys didn't want to take a stand, then don't fault those
              who dared to and said enough is enough. All we asked is to stop
              posting such rubbish and return to the facts as it it is. If you
              want to add your say, do it diplomatically, not adopt an 'I say
              means correct' attitude.</p>
              <p>BJ, Poolman may be upset with the police action in your case or
              with those involving his friends, but that doesn't give him the
              license to accuse the whole force.</p>
              <p>Yours is just an assault, I had the misfortune of finding a taxi
              driver murdered in his cab!</p>
              <p>I can't remember whether it was 1994 or 1995, but a cab driver
              was found strangled to death at Mar Thoma Road off Moonstone Lane.
              I can still remember his face. The meter was showing $39.40. That
              case remains unsolved and don't say the police did nothing. They
              poured every resource into it, but the culprit(s) got away. Or even
              an unrelated case to tds - the unsolved murder of Winifred Teo in
              1985. A young CJC girl murdered and raped near her school. That
              culprit remains at large. You think the officers involved were not
              affected? Do you think the police want them to get away?</p>
              <p>So do you still condone his actions? Why didn't you speak to him
              and admonish him first? Or do you not have the guts to do so? Why
              didnt you ask or stop to think where were all your LV friends and
              him, why couldn't they spare the effort to help you at CC View,
              instead of talking shop at Lavender or grumbling online?</p>
              <p>I think it's for the better also that that forum is now dead,
              because at the rate it was going, it was only a matter of time,
              before the authorities stepped in and started taking action against
              him, or suay suay some of us.</p>
              <p>That forum became the personal plaything of a selfish mod, who
              thought only of himself and his ego, and in doing so, further
              tarnished the image of all ordinary taxi drivers. Only you and his
              friends have foolishly stuck with a such a shallow person.</p>
              <p>You are free to join him and follow him, but the moment you all
              speak in a public forum, please realise that not everyone will put
              up with such rubbish.</p>

              <p>I set up palringo with first and foremost , the friends i have made in here , secondly away from lurkers and people who remains a mystery like yourself.</p>
              <p>You should know that i have disagreed with Pool over a lot of taxi matters but online is online , offline is offline. Pool and me can sit over kopi after a round of heated arguments over the net.</p>
              <p>Can anyone do that with me? If i posted what i posted against another person, im sure i will get jioed for a 1 by 1.</p>
              <p>Thats the difference.</p>
              <p>ok my apologies that i jumped the gun too soon that i assumed you guys wanna take over the channel.</p>
              <p>Yes yes i agree too that anyone can post what they want , they can carry on shooting their own foot. I am seasoned , i am weather proof. i can dig pax from juz about anywhere.</p>
              <p>Please post more income receipts for those who love doing so.</p>
              <p>no BCL to nnk anymore</p>
              <p>PS : And Richard's set up has nothing to do with anything that i posted in here and i will appreciate that you having quite a good amount of access to information will delink things that happen here and elsewhere.</p>
