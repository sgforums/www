              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">The wholly-owned subsidiary of SMRT Taxis will introduce its fleet of brand-new Toyota Altis sedans progressively over the next six months.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">"Our venture into the private hire business is timely," said managing director for SMRT Roads Mr Benny Lim, adding that it represented a "natural progression" for SMRT Taxis in complementing their MRT and bus services.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">Strides will also be entering a partnership with ride-booking platform Grab, which will allow commuters to book rides through their app.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">The year-long partnership will allow up to 200 Strides drivers to receive performance-based cash incentives from Grab, in exchange for taking bookings through their app exclusively.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">Mr Lim said Strides currently has around 50 drivers, and is currently recruiting more.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">Current SMRT Taxi drivers will also be able to switch over to becoming drivers for Strides, with no restrictions.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">Drivers will be able to rent a Toyota Altis directly from Strides for $79 a day, with incentives offered to safe drivers.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">In contrast daily rental rates for SMRT Taxis range from $73.60 for the Hyundai Azera to $125 for a Toyota Prius.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">A fleet of 27 Toyota Vellfire 7-seater vehicles and 2 Lexus ES Hybrids, with more vehicles to be introduced in the future, will also be offered as part of Strides limousine service aimed at corporate clients.</p>

              This is going to challenge grabcar and grabtaxis...lols, the scenarios of taxi driving will be changing soon, and in years to come, taxi in Singapore might be a history, 
                  
              but people like me, CT and many others got nothing to worry, because, we won't had retired peacefully and gracefully, 
                  
              I may still be driving casket...not for profit, but to pass my time and at the same time, to send my brothers off peacefully

              True, nobody is chasing them away, so more will come and Q, the year is 2016, a leap year for Innovative Technology and intellectual economy to start as the agent of Change. 
              
              Oil price will not change or go up further as countries are looking at alternative such as clean energy and bio fuel, the old way of taxis driving will be out of the scope in the new road map of our govt think tank strategy as you can see, 
              
              They, the govt, if you notice,  are slowly flavoring toward the apps ride and only knock their head at TDs, but when TDs turn away, they just shake their head and laugh it off.
              
              The sign is here, so for those who are optimistic that Taxis will still be the future of Singapore transportation landscape, keep up the optimism, for this time, pessimistic will be better, be prepare, go learn and upgrade oneself, change is inevitable, the earlier you detect and prepare for it, the better it is for you
              
              But of course this apply to younger TDs, old people like me, can shake legs, drink kopi with PRC bak bak and watch the world struggle along the endless orbit.

              <p>True, nobody is chasing them away, so more will come and Q, the

              <p>Oil price will not change or go up further as countries are
                  looking at alternative such as clean energy and bio fuel, the old

                  they just shake their head and laugh it off.</p>
              <p>The sign is here, so for those who are optimistic that Taxis
                  will still be the future of Singapore transportation landscape,
                  keep up the optimism, for this time, pessimistic will be better, be
                  prepare, go learn and upgrade oneself, change is inevitable, the
                  earlier you detect and prepare for it, the better it is for you</p>

              <p>When i read this I make me laugh. sounded æ— çŸ¥ã€‚  Because of high oil price there is a need to invest in alternate energy.   But now the oil slow low, no need to invest on other alternative.</p>
              <p>Clean energy is talk only. Real world is abouut business $..</p>
              <p>Also, oil price will change, it is just a matter of time, how many oil companies can survivies at such low oil price. when those cannot survives remove -&gt; lower supply and if the timing is good with improve business enivronment. oil price will go up.</p>

              In 2013, China led the world in renewable energy production, with a total capacity of 378 GW, mainly from hydroelectric and wind power. 
              
              As of 2014, China leads the world in the production and use of wind power, solar photovoltaic power, and smart grid technologies, generating almost as much water, wind, and solar energy as all of France and Germany's power plants combined.
              
              In 2016, China became world's largest producer of photovoltaic power, at 43 GW installed capacity. Chinaâ€™s renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity.
              
              This is part of the reason for Oil to remain low so as to stay competitive, the other main reasons are more poltical inclined.

              You have heard, Bio diesel are selling at much lower price than diesel at TC bukit batok.
              
              Biodiesel refers to a vegetable oil or animal fat-based diesel fuel consisting of long-chain alkyl esters. Biodiesel is typically made by chemically reacting lipids soybean oil, animal fat with an alcohol producing fatty acid esters. So, guys, dun waste your fatting foods.

              <p>Yes. the reason because the oil price is so low now and it is now -ve growth in supply.</p>
              <p>Your statement :</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.7111988067627px;">Oil price will not change or go up further as countries are looking at alternative such as clean energy and bio fuel.</span></p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>My answer to you is that oil price will change as the current price cannot sustain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What make US from an oil importer country to become oil export country, the key reason is shale oil?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">Some shale oil wells may have a break even point of </span><strong style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">$40 a barrel</strong><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.2000007629395px;"> over their production life despite the higher drilling and fracking costs. However, many sources put the average break even point for a fracked horizontal well above </span><strong style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">$60 a barrel</strong><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.2000007629395px;"> with the higher-cost wells coming in at over </span><strong style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">$90 a barrel</strong><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">.</span></p>
              <p>Many Shale oil companies will close down with such cost.-&gt; reduce in supply. in fact, the tradition oil production countries are trying to bring down the competitors.</p>
              <p>Therefore, oil price going up is a question of timing;ie. when. It is a question about supply and demand.</p>
              <p>If you still dont understand, u know mah bao dan cut the property supply the time is no good and then government open the flood gate. What happen to our property price? </p>
