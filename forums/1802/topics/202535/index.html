            <div class='col-md body'>My view :<br><br>5pm to 8pm , taking taxi in City , not much problem after the raise of peak hours surcharge to $2 .<br><br>The main problem starts from 8pm , why ?<br><br>Reason : It's a straight $2.50 flag down , not extra surcharge , where got time ? I makan dinner better !<br><br>Right ?<br><br>Looked like most cabbies take dinner at 8pm , but .... but ... why did people chose to go back after peak hour ? Save $2 ?<br><br>Right ?<br><br>Then if so many many many of commuters thought the same  , a sudden influx of people to the taxi stand , then the main problem arise !<br><br>Right ?<br><br>Solution : $1 city charge to apply from Mon-Sun .<br><br>Money can really makes the world go round !<br><br>Right ?</div>

Blame it on various factors from uneven demand to, yes, errant cabbies<br>By Jeremy Au Yong<br><br><span class="small">ABOUT 40 people are standing in a queue at the Ngee Ann City taxi stand, staring at cabs that pass by without stopping, each flashing its red 'on call' sign.<br>After a few minutes, people in the line get fidgety. Some wander off to take the bus. Others try their luck by the roadside, or simply give in and call for a cab.<br><br>After 30 minutes in the queue, at least half of the original number have given up.<br><br>Those who stay - most of them tourists - end up waiting more than an hour for a ride.<br><br>This frustrating scene last Thursday evening has been replaying nightly around Orchard Road and much of the city centre for years now.<br><br>Mr Bahar Buasan, a 42-year-old Indonesian businessman on holiday with his family who waited 1 1/2 hours for a taxi because he did not know how to call for one, asked: 'Why is Singapore like this?'<br><br>That question, it seems, is on everyone's lips.<br><br>No one can blame the city for lack of effort, but no matter what it does, Singapore cannot seem to resolve its cab woes.<br><br>Over the last 10 years, the industry has been deregulated, more cabs have been added to the roads, satellite dispatch systems installed, peak hours tweaked, fares raised and checks conducted to catch errant drivers.<br><br>But still the age-old complaints persist.<br><br>'Forget about getting cabs in town at night. It would be faster to take the MRT,' said accounts manager Wendy Tan, 36.<br><br>Asked financial planner Jacob Goh, 45: 'I keep seeing empty taxis circling the roads. Where are they headed to?'<br><br>Others talk about cabbies who pick and choose customers, or those that seem to be perpetually changing shift, or hiding in back roads, only to reappear magically after the midnight surcharge kicks in.<br><br>A Sunday Times test showed that these are not idle complaints.<br><br>Last week, reporters tested waiting times at Ngee Ann City, Raffles City and Bugis Junction at around 9.30pm and found that the wait can be formidable.<br><br>At Bugis Junction, it took 20 minutes. Over at Ngee Ann City, it took one hour and two minutes.<br><br>Flagging for a cab by the road was quicker, with the fastest pick-up timed at 11 minutes.<br><br>The quickest method, of course, was to call. Two out of three showed up in less than 10 minutes.<br><br>So, to paraphrase Mr Buasan's question: Why are we waiting?<br><br>Supply is not the problem. Cab numbers have jumped from around 18,000 in 2000 to more than 22,000 today. Singapore has long had one of the highest ratios of cabs to commuters.<br><br>In 2003, even before the number of cabs ballooned, Singapore had 4.8 taxis for every 1,000 people, compared with 2.8 in Hong Kong, 2.9 in New York, 2.6 in London and 2.3 in Tokyo.<br><br>The problem - according to cabbies and transport experts - comes in many parts.<br><br>First is the uneven distribution of demand. The need for a cab far outstrips supply during peak times, but drops drastically at other times. To make matters worse, cabbies sometimes cruise the neighbourhoods after leaving town rather than drive back empty to the city, where they are most needed.<br><br>To balance demand, Associate Professor K. Raguraman, who is co-chairman of the Physical Development Feedback Group, suggests taking another look at the fare structure.<br><br>'Peak fares have already been raised, maybe we should lower off-peak fares to encourage more usage outside peak hours.<br><br>'But we would also need to extend the peak hours to counter those who might be waiting at work till peak hour ends to get a cab,' he said.<br><br>He also proposed setting up an expert focus group whose singular aim would be to study taxi policy issues.<br><br>Then there is the problem of how to tackle errant drivers.<br><br>Public Transport Council chairman Gerard Ee wants more enforcement, with commuters playing a role: 'We all have phones with cameras now. We can take a picture of those who don't play ball and report them.'<br><br>For its part, ComfortDelGro has been monitoring picky drivers, and a recent check of 7,400 cabs netted 50 who were either refusing to pick up passengers or hiding in backstreets.<br><br>To hear cabbies tell it though, they have no choice but to resort to sneaky tactics to make a living. For them, the solution is straightforward: lower rental prices.<br><br>'Certificate of entitlement prices have been going down for years, but rental still stays the same,' said cabby B.C. Goh, 69.<br><br>Fair comment, say experts.<br><br>Said Dr Paul Barter, of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy: 'There is one dominant player in the market and maybe that is the problem. Companies should be competing for drivers but the competition does not seem very fierce.'<br><br>One industry observer said competition has had some benefits for drivers.<br><br>Prior to the deregulation of the industry in 2003, drivers received $900 a year in rebates and incentives from the operators. Now they are getting $5,000.<br><br>And what of fares?<br><br>Some blame poor service on the fact that cab fares here are too low. Yet, any significant raise would have to be dealt with cautiously in case it becomes a cure that kills the patient.<br><br>In 1985, an increase in flag-down rates from $1.20 to $2 resulted in boycotts that saw cab takings drop by up to 80 per cent. Two months later, the fare was reduced to $1.60.<br><br>Indeed, a straw poll of 60 commuters by The Sunday Times last week found that half were unwilling to pay a cent more for a cab.<br><br>Additional reporting by Nur Dianah Suhaimi, Sarah Ng, Rachel Lim, Reema Jagtiani and Nur Amira Abdul Karim.</span><br><br>jeremyau@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright Â© 2006 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=6fadbe120b93a010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:dda35c7a12bbc010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=6fadbe120b93a010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:dda35c7a12bbc010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>July 30, 2006<br><span class="large"><strong>Up surcharge to draw cabbies to the city </strong></span><br><br>By NEWS ANALYSIS, Kelvin Wong<br><br>THEY are everywhere when you do not really need them, and nowhere when you do.<br><br>I am talking about taxis, of course.<br><br>This dearth of cabs is most apparent at about 9pm or later in the downtown areas. A Sunday Times test last week, for example, found that waiting times can go up to an hour or more in such cases.<br><br>It is a situation that is particularly exasperating for the many executives who are hurrying home after a long day's work, with a quick dinner or a bit of shopping thrown in.<br><br>You could blame it on Murphy's Law, but this perennially sticky issue underscores a more fundamental problem - a mismatch in supply and demand.<br><br>Mismatch, that is, being the word to note.<br><br>Supply, on its own, is not the problem. Singapore's cab to human population ratio, at almost five taxis to every 1,000 people here, trumps even that of big cities around the world like Tokyo and London.<br><br>But the flaw in the equation relates to where this supply is going to during these after-work periods. Cabs abound in the heartland but are hard to find in the city. Some cabbies, by their own admission, say they typically pick passengers up from the city early in the night, then cruise around the housing estates after dropping them off.<br><br>Heading back downtown again without a passenger just does not make financial sense to them. But it is precisely at these times, when shopping malls shut and cinemas are done with their first evening screenings, that the crunch begins.<br><br>Other cabbies say they just want to avoid the jams in town, which result in a waste of both time and fuel. With diesel costs sky high, that is a waste cabbies can hardly afford.<br><br>This gives passengers few options, apart from choosing other modes of public transport. Calling for a cab is a way out, but not an entirely foolproof one. Besides, cab bookings essentially draw on the same limited pool already plying the area and do nothing to alleviate the shortage in the city.<br><br>Short of directing cabbies where to go, cab operators are, to all intents and purposes, just as powerless as the hapless passengers.<br><br>A surefire way of solving this is to increase fares all round, which would immediately dampen demand for cabs across the island.<br><br>But in Singapore, where taxis are - in my view - quite wrongly considered as part of the public transport system for the masses, this would be an unpalatable option.<br><br>This is unlike the situation in Tokyo and London, where passengers pay a premium for what is essentially a chauffeur-driven car. Not surprisingly, taxi woes in those places are not of the same magnitude.<br><br>A smaller demand for cabs also means drivers are not going to pick and choose and can offer a premium service that corresponds to the premium fares they earn.<br><br>The only way to break this stalemate, then, is to adopt a targeted approach in shrinking demand for cabs when and where they are most in short supply.<br><br>Put plainly, this means increasing the city area surcharge and extending the hours when it applies, to lure taxi drivers downtown.<br><br>The surcharge now stands at $1, payable between 5pm and 8pm from Mondays to Thursdays and between 5pm and 11.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays.<br><br>When the surcharge was raised from 50 cents to $1 in 1999, cab operators had said that the increased surcharge would encourage cabbies to drive into the city area and shorten waiting times.<br><br>Well, that has not happened.<br><br>For the bait to really work, the surcharge will have to be somewhat higher. The hours when it applies from Monday to Thursday nights should also be extended to address the after-work crowd.<br><br>The exact amount is something for the taxi operators to figure out. A survey could reveal if Singaporeans can stomach yet another rise, and if so, how much. But a useful benchmark could be the $5 levied on all trips departing from Changi Airport. It is no coincidence that getting a cab there is rarely a problem even though its location could not be more remote.<br><br>Raising the city-area surcharge would have a dual effect: It weeds out the marginal users who are not prepared to stump up more for fares and draws more cabbies into the area.<br><br>This should bring about some kind of equilibrium between taxi supply and demand in the city.<br><br>And hopefully, as some Singaporeans get accustomed to paying more for taxis, it will pave the way for higher fares to be implemented across the board.<br><br>For sure, a fare hike of any kind is never a popular move. Cab companies themselves baulk at the idea. But for any real change to happen, it is a route worth taking.<br><br>Raising the city-area surcharge would have a dual effect: It weeds out the marginal users who are not prepared to stump up more for fares and draws more cabbies into the area.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2006 Singapore Press Holdings.
