Will you complain?  Its not the money issue, more like a matter of principle and the feeling like being robbed.<br><br>Likewise, you wait for taxi and they are passing by without passenger and refuse to pick up passenger and wait until someone to call.  The more empty taxi pass by us the more we feel angry toward the drivers.  When frustrated, I often cursed the these kind of drivers when they passed by... and I am sure i am not the only one cursing them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I think that why so many taxi drivers involved in the accidents, so many people cursed at them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">A ride away from the problem</span></strong><br><br>Create taxi hubs at MRT stations just outside CBD and Orchard areas<br><br>Tuesday Â• August 1, 2006<br><br>Letter from Ramachandran Anand<br><br>Most solutions to the taxi problem suggested seem focused on micro analysis of the economics of surcharges and incentives, when clearly, most observers point out that it does not lead to any dramatic improvements.<br><br>That said, the unavailability of taxis does not seem like an islandwide problem; rather it seems concentrated in the CBD and shopping district, areas well-connected by other forms of public transport, especially the MRT.<br><br>So what prevents the Land Transport Authority (LTA) from promoting an integrated solution involving people using MRT out of these crowded places and picking up taxis outside the city?<br><br>The most common reason taxi drivers give for not venturing into the CBD or Orchard Road include getting stuck in heavy traffic. Any solution that is to succeed must address this.<br><br>What if LTA can devise a hub-spoke system which ensures ease of taxi availability at all times outside the CBD area, within a 5-10 minute MRT ride?<br><br>Many commuters would not mind taking a 10-minute train ride out if they are guaranteed availability of a taxi at another MRT station, rather than wait up to 30 minutes for one. This will also partially help decongest the CBD/Orchard area, with fewer taxis passing through.<br><br>The solution is similar to the park-and-ride scheme in many countries where commuters drive their cars to a nearby train station and take public transport into the city and back. This integration is what helps make the London transport system efficient and the roads less congested.<br><br>In Singapore, why not integrate our cheap and efficient taxi system with other public transportation?<br><br>I suggest forming taxi hubs at places such as Kallang, Paya Lebar, Farrer Park, Outram Park and Novena MRT stations. Other taxi hubs could be at bus/MRT interchanges at Bedok, Jurong and Toa Payoh. Perhaps LTA, with its studies of traffic and demand, can suggest better hubs.<br><br>As an incentive, taxi drivers could be allowed to levy a 50-cent or $1 surcharge at these hubs. If these hubs are reasonably close to where taxis dropped off their previous passengers, the assurance of new passengers should attract a continuous availability of taxis.<br><br>For commuters, paying $1 for a train ride plus a 50-cent surcharge will still be lower than the additional amount they pay for calling a taxi and adding on the CBD surcharge ($4 to $6 in total).<br><br>Living at Meyer Road which is not close to any MRT or bus stop, I have thought, while waiting at Orchard or Raffles Place, of catching a train to a nearby station and taking a taxi from there Â— but it is not easy to find taxis near MRT stations.<br><br>The solution lies in an integrated mass transport system Â— and not a cost-based solution that ensures availability only to a select customer segment that is ready to pay more.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/pda/133839ag.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/pda/133839ag.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But it will be different if this hub has a surcharge of $1 extra .....<br><br>It will be the best if all Taxi stands in Singapore has a dollar surcharge , meaning most people Q-ing for taxi @ taxi stnads will sure get a cab , instead of getting hijack from street customers , waiting to hijack taxi just 50 metres away from taxi stand .<br><br>It so common people doing it outside taxi stand if the Q is long inside .</div>
