            <div class='col-md body'>not much difference to fare since meter moves mainly by distance... the driver may have different driving habit or have pick up appointments made or just preoccupied... But all things being equal, driver definitely earn less if he takes more time for same trip. Time is money.. Remember, when there is a jam, the pax pays more and the driver earns less for the day</div>
