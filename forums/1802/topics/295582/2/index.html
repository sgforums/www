Its always about "how can I milk the current customer more NOW".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by boy20:<br><strong>Thank ALN &amp; Poolman for your reply<br><br>But, there is something which I don't understand is that both of you have wrote that [b]<span style="font-style: italic;">the driver will definitely earn less if he takes more time for same trip and it will make a massive difference for that particualr cabby </span></strong><br><br>How come?? In what way they will earn less???<br><br>Then ALN also wrote <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>when there is a jam, the pax pays more and the driver </strong><strong>earns less for the day</strong></span>. Will the driver earn less when there is a jam because the pax will have to pay more when there is a jam and therefore the driver will earn more.<br><br>I think i shall clear your doubts. A taxi fare is charged by the distance , not speed or time , you can take a cab from Changi Airport to Tuas , one driver can travel at 160km/h and another can travel at 60/70 km/h , in the end when you reach your destination , your price is going to be the same , taxi fares are charged by its distance , not speeed , if speed that means every taxi driver will drive at 40km/h to earn more money!<br><br>When the driver travels slowly , he will earn less as he is wasting his time , for example , a passenger is now waiting for cab at the destination where you're alighting , then there are 2 taxis , A and B , taxi B travels faster then Taxi A , obviously taxi B will overtake Taxi A and got the passenger. This is why if a taxi driver is travelling slowly , not only he is wasting his time , but he is earning less , in the above example , if Taxi A will to travel faster than B , he would have got that passenger and definitely he is going to earn more.<br><br>I've taken cab from Toa Payoh to Choa Chu Kang t least 4 times , there was once , good weather , travelled via Bt Panjang , BKE , PIE , he drive fast , reach there $10. Then when i come back , it was raining , the driver took the same route but drove slower as its raining the roads is slippery , reach home also $10. So most of the time itg is the distance that matters , although traffic jam may make the passenger pay more , as when there is traffic jam , the vehicle is stopped &amp; every 25s of waiting time cost $0.10. So surely traffic jam you pay more , other then that , speed doesn't matters.<br><br></div>
