              <p>There are many times...after end of the shift. </p>
              <p>Most of those uncles at washing bay...wow...wow.. today not heng collection very low, all routes run alway no pax very quiet.</p>
              <p>But some uncles said ...wow ...today seebei heng. all long and chiong and good connection.</p>
              <p>So, my question. Luck or Experience count.</p>
              <p>For me i think....Luck is important...Experience is another.</p>
              <p>Just like Poolie so heng got Red Wish near his house, and now here he ...go again taxi driving.  So is this heng (Luck) involved the whole senerio that he wanted and the new hirer and the taxi waited for him.</p>
              <p>Just like last sunday... at about 10.30am a Tank Road indian temple this family of four, brother...Choa Chu Kang Cresent.</p>
              <p>So upon reaching the fare about $21.80 at the block below and completed.... another connection trip  family of four chinese waited just below the block , uncle Tampines Mall...end up $23.50 all within 1 hours.</p>
              <p>So Mentor Poolie, the above is Luck or Experience can share your opinion about.</p>

              <p>As you told started at 4.30pm... on your friday night shift.... Now 4.35am , i think he still on the road .</p>
              <p>so how many hours actually you need to hit those $310 as mentioned.</p>
              <p>with those 35% and  50% midnight charges and those CBD charges.</p>
              <p>normal day shift just example like me $240 or $250 only morning peak hours surcharge. Why? only 50 to 60 dollars extra...can explain to us about this...and during night not so much taxis competition like day. so you should get more than us.</p>
              <p>what about your two days morning that bonus added given by you hirer how much is your collection, no obligation just wanted to know more,  with no on-call.</p>

              <p>yes tactically all spot on . If u don't wake up your idea by heading to town from Sin Ming , u will not get this Wisma pax . If u go cruising onto Wlands direction , u will get someone heading to Wlands .</p>
              <p>I'll never say Luck for your case , it's quite normal to get short distance in town .</p>

              <p><br>Luck , i dunno , my daily collection except Friday , 12am , alwasy $180 . Lucky , no luck , got paxes , no paxes , same .</p>
              <p>Even if this Wisma customer sent me to Wlands , i will still have that $180 , why ? Cos i'll sent myself down to CBD again ....</p>
              <p>Even if i have no customer , from Sin Ming , i'll still have that $180 , why ?</p>
              <p>1 hour i just need $25 .</p>
              <p>I dun need luck , i need my meter running ....</p>
              <p>One pax can sent me to Ulu place , one pax can sent me within town , as long as all paxes contribute $25 an hour for me , i'll be contented .</p>
              <p>Well , i never tell myself i am lucky driving a taxi , cos i'll be upset if i haven't got one . And i'll be not happy if i got luck , cos i deserve to have paxes , cos i am a taxi driver .</p>

              <p><br>it's common to go into a taxi stand without taxis ... u are clever . U gave the Maldives different options . U are strategically , using the correct method , or dillema for the Maldives , cos u know , many Estima drivers might not want to take them , maybe this Estima is going to airport , cos u dunno , u had experience it before , and it is  a possibility that this Estima guy has got a booking to airport , they are on group booking . Possible ... if u got luck , u certainly won't hit town . Cos u r a taxi driver , u go anywhere .</p>
