              <p>but first , i think kin should , start to have more self-belief in himself , instead of achieving good results by sheer hardwork , and summed up his achievements by the word luck .</p>
              <p>Either kin is modest , about what he had achieved , or .... he has no self beliefs that he can achieve that amount each day , and had to depend on luck to achieve that .</p>
              <p>I start work , everyday , and i say to myself : " Today can !!! "</p>
              <p>In fact everyday can , but end day , cannot !!! Hhahahahahah</p>

              <p>i am not arguing , i want future taxi drivers , to put their perspective in place , what is right , what is wrong , start to analyse things etc ....</p>
              <p>I think my proposition is , it's wrong to put luck infront of sheer hardwork inorder to survive in taxi driving .</p>
              <p>I hope up to here , today it's the 31st July , everyone do read up the whole thread , it's little bit meaningful . A small guide in building up stronger mentallity between luck , hardwork with modern metallity .</p>
              <p>In football , hahahah , U try telling Ian Rush he was lucky to score a few hundred goals for liverpool .</p>
              <p>Yes Liverpool were lucky to have Ian Rush , and Ian Rush is lucky to be playing for Liverpool .</p>
              <p>Ian Rush was just a genius in scoring goals , he don't need luck .</p>
              <p>A genius don't need luck . Luck will go to him , hahahahaha .</p>

              <p>I like analysing ...</p>
              <p>Maybe i am wrong ...</p>
              <p>Perhaps if one is more experience in the trade , he might not need luck afterall .</p>
              <p>Eg , driving pattern .</p>
              <p>U cultivate a driving pattern , u are at which area , u hit your next target in the quickest way , but of course u must have experience to know which time which area , at which spot , got the next quickest pax .</p>
              <p>At AMK , i surely hit St.65 , tech point , motorola or NCS , from 6pm onwards , just Q outside , within 10 minutes , u are off !!! Until 10pm , Tech Point &amp; NCS boleh jalan .</p>
              <p>At Tampines , at 10pm , no need to think , Terminal 3 . Pax Tampines or Pasir Ris also nevermind , even better , 10.30pm i can shoot back terminal 3 . That sort of experiences .</p>
              <p>If Friday , if Expo got lobang  chop chop even better at 9pm onwards til 10pm .</p>
              <p>At Jurong , like near Jurong East , dun tell me IMM no people , i guarantee 5 minutes off from IMM !!!</p>
              <p>U are @ Hougang , dun think , go Serangoon North Ave 5 / 6 , or Seagate , or even go back AMK St 65 also can , dun think , 10 minutes u are off from AMK .</p>
              <p>Go where later than say , meter running more important !!!! U hit the destination , then go to the next quickest target according to your driving pattern .</p>
              <p>Remember i said taxi for me is a routine , tat's what i am saying . Quite standard routine .</p>
              <p>That spot that time got people means got people , and it's will be a surprise for me if on the way i got no paxes .</p>
              <p>Singapore all places , after 11pm , all town !!! Dun think .</p>
              <p>Do you think luck is needed ? I certainly dun need , cos my time and spaces all occupied , hahahah , where got time ?</p>

              <p><br>Hi to all bros and sis in this forum. I just passed my TDVL last
                      month. Am now waiting to get my Licence. Got a few quests to ask all
                      seniors here.<br> Currently, i am still working full time. If i want to try to drive part time as a relief during weekends, How shd i go about it?<br> <br> <br> Many like this alway coming into this forum... home of taxi drivers.</p>

              <p>thank...your patronising making it a hot.</p>
              <p>anyway without our reown Taxi God Poolie present, thing will not be the same cause his input keep coming  as many as possible and with fine detail, on each and every question on him.</p>
              <p>so what is wrong? by doing it...to whom it may concern. yo.</p>
              <p>we are doing all on taxi related matters...not what To -ma- sick, how sick is the establishment now, inside the small cabin like in the taxi fequent this subject is being brought out discusssion with us everday or the modern monk or any others</p>

              <p>Teolk, at least you never give up... if you think "suay" and pack up to go home, then you never enjoy that sweet moment.  never say die to try....again i also don't know it it is luck or determination and perseverance.. but i know one decisions lead to another results and the chain keeps going......</p>

              <p>Many , including me , had already sent packing in . Lazy people like me will never Q up at T1 , here u go , lazy , afterall , is lazy , u'll get bad luck all the time . Hahahahah</p>

              <p>I did farely well today , a vast improvement compared to last week , which i still adjusting to life using CNG at Mandai , at least for the time being . if not , if on diesel , i could have break the $400 barriers , i just nearly clocked it , damn !!!!</p>
              <p>Well i had to say , today it does broke my 8 years all time Friday evening record , never , if i can remember , anything near $400 . Only a holiday eve can provide me with this kind of figures .</p>
              <p>I was surprised a toyota wish , one from transcab , one that does not provide me with any booking support , can break my all time comfort record , so it somehow proven , the new fare structure , to pick and go , can be as good as taking bookings , if not better .</p>
              <p>Considering first pax 4.58pm , last pax 3.45am , and it's on CNG , refill twice , without bookings , without cashless payment , i can collect exceeding my Comfort's 8 time record , just funny .</p>
              <p>Since returning to the biz , my lowest collection is $178 , average about $180  , all maximum 8 hours job . 2 Fridays are well above my very own expectations of over $300 .</p>

              <p>aln, still alive, still alive. dayshift drivers very busy, cos consistency usually means consistent work, holiday eve for us usually makes little difference. i don't like holidays cos usually, early mornings are "waste bullet". on holidays, no point to start work early, sometimes average $5 or $10 per hour. knn.</p>
              <p>pool, my records usually happen when i have fewer bookings and connections are very good. cos don't have to waste time and diesel rushing to the pickup point and then wait another few minutes for pax. 6 or 7 bookings easily 1 hour lost. pick and go is much better. for me i target efficiency as well ie. collection against mileage. as close to 100% as possible, more than 100% means fantastic day. only twice happened before, collection higher than mileage. (something like $250 collection for 230km, 8 hours) works for me cos i don't queue much, i like to cruise around rather than wait.</p>

              <p>it's about each and anyone's comfort to think what they want , like what my friend always say : " I song ma " .</p>
              <p>U must be happy at what u want to do , dun worry about what others say .....</p>
              <p>I being a taxi driver for the last 8 years , would never tell my fellow juniors that luck is the most important thing u need to drive a cab .</p>
              <p>Whichever angle u see , in whichever job , job is not a gamble , u need brain storming , need changes , need no luck .</p>
              <p>Eg , like a coffee shop , the business no good , cos it's old and requires rennovations .</p>
              <p>Do u think with a massive facelift , or rennovation , the business will gets better ? It will , cos people like changes , like new environment , and it's pretty clear , needs changes , not luck to pursue a better business opportunity .</p>
              <p>Eg 2 , a handphone shop , business and display same for the last 5m years , customer are so stale about the shop , business drop .</p>
              <p>But , by changing the merchandised display , make some changes in the sale personel , improve sales promotion , do u think the business will go up a bit , then current status ? yes it will .</p>
              <p>In business , i always motivate my salesman , remember the 3 letters , A-S-K , to succceed , for better comm and pay .</p>
              <p>A = Aggressiveness , in sales approach , sales talks and sales technics .</p>
              <p>S = Skills . Customer service skills , convincing skills , closing skills .</p>
              <p>K = Knowlegde , Knowledge of products , knowledge of market demand and supply , knowledge of price differences .</p>
              <p>In sales , we never emphasis luck to our salesman .</p>
              <p>No Management teams and directors will want their subordinates to wait for the rabbit to hit the tree all the time .</p>
              <p>There'll will be one careless rabbit to did that , not all rabbits .</p>
              <p>Hardwork is the key to successful salesmanship .</p>
