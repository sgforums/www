              <p>Cos back from your base where u started .... KPE Kallang &gt; PIE will be the last i would do , a few reasons , city erp surcharge , i am not going to pay garmen some of my profits or before i profit .</p>
              <p>Also u have a few other options , Airport Road Spore Technologies , another option , Kaki Bukit Tech Link and Tech Place also good , Ubi also can , Serangoon North Ave 5 ave can , AMK St 65 , good .</p>
              <p>Like woodlands , i would have Q at Kraniji or try Chartered at Park D .</p>
              <p>If 6pm , Woodlands i would try Singapore American School too . Ang Mo Kia go back Grange Road one , hahahahah</p>
              <p>If near Wlands Ave 7 , i can try Senoko , Sembawang Shipyard , or Wland Loop .</p>
              <p>Instead of only city and hdb area , do open up urself to these places . Serangoon North Ave 5 especially , looked like alot of taxis , but not really , S.Microelectronics , SM , lots of ang mo going town .</p>
              <p>If i can Pick and Go at Serangoon North Ave 5 , it's something good there .</p>
              <p>Got heard people say black cat more curse ? Hahahahah</p>

              <p>you are not hardworking...that why?</p>
              <p>Now knn no surchrages cabbies are like beggars.</p>
              <p>Like this kind of task...let our taxi god...sub sub the water.</p>

              <p>so... no surcharge you are blaming.</p>

              <p>I dun feel it , honestly , for night shift . For the last 2 weeks .</p>
              <p>Peak Hour still less people taking taxis . I felt a bit more than before i Quit last September , now the pace is back at 2006-2007 before Global Crisis .</p>
              <p>U Q longer than non-peak hour .</p>
              <p>Still if tactics is right , $80 for peak hour period is sub sub H20 like kin said ....</p>
              <p>After 8pm start , cabbies like beggars ? No leh , street start to have plenty of people taking taxis .... MRT also , shopping centres also , offices also .... can be quite busy , long or short . U alight one pax , u cruise slowly , might connect one , long or short .</p>
              <p>10pm , it's all town , just Q ...... surely have , at least those places I Q , sub sub h2o really .....all $3 extra .</p>
              <p>Don't understand why got people saying no surcharge cabbies like beggar ? Peak Hour less pax , yeah some looked like beggar .</p>
              <p>But after peak , what's the fuss ?</p>

              <p>Again , it's those changes once again .....</p>
              <p>Many had turn OMO .... did they inform u they trun OMO ?</p>
              <p>Like those of Transcab Wish eg .... then how do we know ?</p>
              <p>We have to anticipate the benefits thier company paid them , and CNG usage , it's best for them going OMO .</p>
              <p>And did u observe the population overall ? U need that extra knowledge .</p>
              <p>Like my existing hirere and former relief , all started at 5.15am , why ? 6am they also start before , they changed , why ?</p>
              <p>Cos they anticipate , for 3 hours it will be slow , to try out one hour early , will benefit an extra hour . To cover up those lost time from 6am to 9am .</p>
              <p>In taxi , if u dun changed , both timing and driving method , u'll be lacking behind , very fast .</p>
              <p>U changed accordingly to the changing environment .</p>
              <p>Others don't change , it's their problem , i changed , have to ..... I no longer ply my trade into those on-call zones , why ? If i do , i surel die !!!! TranSCab no call ma , i changed my plying method .</p>

              <p>tat is my very own analysis .... it's may not be the exact situation . I also like to know why ?</p>
              <p>Sometimes , i think back .....  if one company not so good business , will they still work 5.5days per week ? or they have switch to 5 days and pay-cut accordingly ?</p>
              <p>Wasn't it happier for both employers and employees that way , instead of retrenchments ?</p>
              <p>So if they work 5 days ..... that is one reason why Saturday lesser working pax .</p>

              <p>SQ the first example...cut...cut.</p>
              <p>sunday morning...at  changi road mobil petrol kiosk, toilet break.</p>
              <p>yellow top cabby was talking to me.</p>
              <p>Hey how your business? ok ...lah normal.</p>
              <p>How about you.</p>
              <p>you never see my windscreen with SQ sticker on it. Old toyota crown.</p>
              <p>My cab...only contract SQ crews on regular basis, seldom go round for street pax.</p>
              <p>So...how many crews do you have, round the island, any flight SQ flying me also flying.</p>
              <p>How many years are you in this line,....reply... 6 years...no bad.</p>
              <p>So recently SQ cancelled many flights and grounded so many planes in US desert, your business still not affected...No at all.</p>

              <p><br>if this yellow top cabby is the SQ contractor .... he's good , that's all . Simple answer .</p>
              <p>And efficient .</p>
              <p>And hardworking .</p>
              <p>if u strsight away say he lucky , he will kena answer from him , like : " Lucky ? U come la ?"</p>
              <p>He no need luck la , ready-cook food ready for him .... no need cook himself . We must go market , chop vegies , cut meat , fried , then got food to eat . He cooked the food six years ago , laid the foundation six years ago , and enjoy six years down the road , can't u see ?</p>
              <p>He got those lobangs , saw the potential , which many cabbies decline to do it , and grap with both hands , and enjoy the food .</p>
              <p>If u want SQ contract also can ma ... whether u want or not .</p>
              <p>I will not contradict myself saying he is lucky .</p>
              <p>He is capable , entrepreneurship , shrew ... all u can say , he is good that's all .</p>
              <p>Got good got bad ....</p>
              <p>Days like Holiday eve , where everywhere got people , he cannot fulfill those trips , have to rush to Changi again . Not even Changing Shift sign to make use of , cos his timing is tight . Within 30 minutes must be waiting for his customer , not customesr waiting for him .</p>

              <p>During those years ..... say 2007-2008 .</p>
              <p>Whenever i hit town , inside CBD , Capital Sq ( Church Street Citibank ) surely , i guarantee got call for me .</p>
              <p>Suntec Tower 5 , and Centennial Towers , Millenium towers , all ang mo , and foreigners taking taxis , now ???</p>
              <p>Now where's those ang mo and Japanese , Aussies ?</p>
              <p>So i asked those left over professionals working at Shenton Ways ...</p>
              <p>The answer : " Many left , one issue is becos of office rental &amp; housing issues , rental rocket high . "</p>
              <p>Many firms left for China too , that caused CBD offices and buidlings to be vacant .</p>
              <p>Many Expats left , lesser came in , to balance up the foreign work force quotas , and S-pass holders , we saw more indians and chinese ... even vietnamese and burmese .</p>
              <p>Even the likes of Philipino nurses have left Sgp for UK , so we saw more Chinese nurses and Burmese nurses .... tat's a just a few examples .</p>
              <p>This are soft fundamentals we , in daily life , not aware of ..... that are slowly affecting the whole of public transport .</p>
              <p>So by talking to these people , i learnt .... and changed for my own good .</p>
