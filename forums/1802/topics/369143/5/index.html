              <p>Fortune teller told me to avoid red , i at first believe , but
              later on , i emphasis , many Transcab drivers will be like me ,
              their life might not be suitable for red , but they still live
              their life on , why should like avoid red ?</p>
              <p>So i place a gamble ..... instead of putting luck in front
              .</p>
              <p>perhap...now you can tell.</p>
              <p>cos you already go back on your normal pace on taxi driving like
              as before.</p>
              <p>so... fortune teller could be wrong or right the first
              place?</p>
              <p>Why? you need.</p>
              <p>you already consulted him, so somehow or rather, you are
              checking whether you are lucky before you can go for the taxi
              driving...issit.</p>
              <p>just curiosity...alway you are very sure, in you believes.</p>
              <p>so why?</p>

              <p>It's depending what perspective you look on poolie comments. Either you tried to avoid red and affirmation of the fortune teller is right or you go against it and prove it otherwise. If you do it and go with the Red and be successful, then you are not following the book of destiny. If you destine to be lousy in certain areas, then do it again and again to improve it or turn it around. There's a time when red is no good and there's a time it is up to the sky..  Going against something of unwritten rule is not even considered luck.  It's because you and your own decision.</p>

              <p>mentor poolie, quite true, as a pax myself i have also met countless mid-oldies or oldies. They are either too smoked screen with their favorite words "luck". The new generation positive minded type will say either today he is doing well or today fares is lousy and i will cruise more to patch up. Of course not all "New generation drive" are positive and you will still find many behaves like the "oldies". Perhaps the 4 D and toto mentality.</p>

              Well, it seems that you are trying to nitpick or " trying to pick bones from eggs" whereas everyone can accept that on the greater scheme of things, luck or the lack of is only a matter of opinion. Whether you choose to believe it or not ultimately lies in you yourself only. I believe there are already numerous exchanges on this to know how everyone views it, so it's getting a bit meaningless.
              
              Nobody's begruding you in your belief that luck overules everything but to keep on harping on the matter gives the impression that you are trying to force down your views on others, or at worse, using it as a pawn in a game of superiority. Honestly i hope not, because it's just childish.
              
              I wonder if its gotta do with luck here. Nevermind.

              <p><br>4.30pm changing shift time , u need luck on this ? Com'on u need to buck up your timing skill .</p>
              <p>Experience telling me this time slot , u can even chose where u want to go .... to top up diesel at Bt Merah , taxi drivers there are so certainly dun stay anywhere near Yishun , so this poor pax have to thank God u pick him . Or he has to pay for peak hour surcharge later on .</p>
              <p>Furthermore , i would say even an OMO would even<span style="color: #339966;"> Change Shift</span> just in case he kena ulu places , technically Yishun would be last place , cos hi-chances , Yishun low demand , one of the lowest demand for taxis in Sgp ( after 5pm ) .</p>
              <p>Oso even if i am a taxi driver staying at Bt Panjang eg , to handover at 5pm , i will still chose not to pick him , cos by the direction he standing , this uncle would certainly want u to go by Up Thomson , hey waste a lot of time travelling by there u know .</p>
              <p>So if this pax , say : " Uncle , Tampines ." So no luck la , miss one good trip ?</p>
              <p>4.30pm , try put <span style="color: #339966;">CHANGE SHIFT </span><span style="color: #000000;">, u'll get where u want to go , just cruise down your base . Direction just head to where u want to go . 4.30pm plenty of kia su pax , to avoid peak hour , would want to rush before 5pm . </span></p>
