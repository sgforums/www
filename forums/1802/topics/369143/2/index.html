              <p>i hope u guys don't confused "co-incidence" with "luck" .</p>

              <p>So it's not those lucky factor if u come down ECP and got a pax , it's always a possiblity if u hit town , and u get one . Coincidently , they met u , and u met them .</p>
              <p>At the first place , It's your tactical strength that u chose to go by ECP and down Rochor . Many would chose to go by Nicholl Highway .</p>
              <p>U have to ask yourself this : " Do i selelct ECP for a specific reason ? "</p>

              <p>Many of my old friends also have this luck stuff , i always tell them it's better to built up a certain level of driving skill , plus what they call luck .</p>
              <p>Ok back to the books , strength as in doing extra homework for Airport terminals arrival timing , Tenah Merah arrival timing , Marina South arrival timing , which time to go , which time not to go , it's  a skill . If u cultivate those skills , plus extar updates , u don't need luck to get your salalry , luck will give you extra a few dollars , not the salary for the whole month .</p>
              <p>Priority is strength .</p>
              <p>Without so call luck , if u have a certain level of strength , awareness , experience , tactical , your wages will not be too far away when u are lucky .</p>

              <p><br>Strength as in mental strength , to fight the war upfront , or to give up and go home sleep ? Taxi drivers are all fighters .</p>
              <p>Awareness ? Awaress of traffic condition , aware of what's going on at Suntec eg , Sgp Expo eg , Singapore F1 at September , road closures , eg , this is all awarenss .</p>
              <p>Experience ? What time got what lobangs , what place got what people , what pax how they dress , one looked u know where they head to . Experience .</p>
              <p>Tactically ..... Like for night shift , a crtain time , u don't go cruising blindly at that place , so it's best to plan for the next move if u hit there , and fast .</p>
              <p>Eg , if u tends to stick at Tekka Area at10pm , u will expect the next pax to want to go to road-end destination like Sengkang , Hougang and Punggol , Yishun or woodlands , bt btk or bt pj , this few places are dead end , u can hardly connect another pax .</p>
              <p>Tactically what's the move ? I go places where there's a large " possibilty " u can get ang mo paxes , where they largely ' probable ' staying near town . Not Tekka .</p>

              <p>i would say luck factor is about 50% nowadays. in the old days

                                      maybe 70%, luck 30%. like mahjong. nowadays no more. last time
                                      morning peak in tuas, i never hesitate, straight head to cck. exit
                                      kje straight away got call, even at 7am+, or airport straight away
                                      chiong to bayshore, exit bedok straight away got booking or pple
                                      queuing at the taxi stand. now 7-8am many many empty cabs cruising
                                      at cck. bayshore taxi stand sometimes more than 15 taxis queuing.
                                      white mice come, siao liao all disappear...go where? headache. cos
                                      east side morning b4 8am dullsville. and there are simply too many
                                      empty cabs cruising around. my 0.5sec rule.</p>
              <p>So time change, i should say.</p>
              <p> On day you are facing  as me, the same probelm... where there is abundant paxs there is for sure plenty of taxis queuing. parkway parade, taka, paragon, lucky plaza, singapura plaza, vivo city.</p>
              <p>my question...like bayshore taxi stand, you know i know protential in the morning. so like this kind what experience and hardwork need. Just go there, if lucky or luck those 15 taxis on Q within half an hour 15 paxs can cleared fast than you are lucky, some told not alway can clear fast, some q for 10 to 20 minutes headed out the q toward amber road or katong, easy pick and go, more chances... peak hours can easily end.</p>

              <p>kinwashi, you are right....i have made careful observation myself.  Most lull time period..taxis stands is full of cabby waiting there and no pax.... what to say...more than 20 minutes or worse..... in many areas...</p>
              <p>ha...ha...ha... i've too much time riding bicyles and sitting anywhere i saw taxi stand and observe.... Tooo FREEEEE  but forgive me as i am also a hobbyist bicylist.</p>
              <p>Again... sorry to say that... i will not wait there....i will keep on going even if there is no Pax because i rather listen to music and enjoy looking around beautiful babes and sceneries then waiting....</p>
              <p>Time is changing...you are right... but it is the up and the down...This is not Lucky or not heng at all....or not si bei heng.....</p>
              <p>I don't believe in 70% with 30%....or 40% with 60%....</p>
              <p>It will come today you are damn happy with your work or you don't.....Live With it.</p>

              <p><br>Nobody seduce you, because you everyday surf internet and watch 1950s movies, then cook your own rice/porridge with salted veggie and salted egg. Everyday like that, so boring hor? So have to turn to flaming people to get some satisfaction, so sad.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>

              <p>Ok...this portion, i still need to learn from you the secret, can share with us no obligation your experience. how one looked u know where they head to.</p>
              <p>Just happen this afternoon, at about 3.50pm, this pax dressed very sexy standing along guillemard road at lorong 18 toward city plaza. from far approaching looked like a lady, but once flag the tazi upon picking up...a man voice. so like this where he heading to.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Yeah , u need experience on this .... well , day shift all office workers , but night shifts like us .... one look on what he carry , how he dressed , which taxi stand he gets on board , and their accents , we can roughly tell which area he heading to , which is very important to us . Our next destination is very crucial .</p>
              <p>Eg , like an Indian auntie from Tekka , typical local indian , carry lots of plastic bags , vegies , do you think she is going to Cineleisure for a movie ?</p>
              <p>To head to any HDB after 10pm , it's the last move we can have . No choice then take .</p>
              <p>Another example , Race Course Road , after some Muthu curry , at 10pm , whole stretch of mixed race , chinese , indians , Americans , Africans etc , and 2 japanese carrying a map ? Who u think i will chose to pick ? Of course the Japanese with map ! He can't be going to Sengkang or Hougang for sure .</p>
              <p>I know a certain time , at certain places , where to pick my next pax , to benefit my next move , next connection .</p>
              <p>and at 12am , u need a good 50% midnight trip , u must recognised which area the pax is " possibility " of going home .... the last place i need to go , is clubs areas , one might switch from Zouk to Mohd Sultan .</p>
              <p>Experience tells me 12am , seldom clubbers go home , most " probably " , change clubs !!!</p>
              <p>And experience of recognising hazard , like gansters of 4 , flagging for you cab , u can chose to ignore , for your own safety .</p>
              <p>And experience of recognising drunkard , could be a hazard of vomitting inside your cab .</p>
              <p>Anyway , day shift drivers the people they meet , has got less variety like those of night shifts ....</p>

              <p><br>well sometimes one expressway accident , might link to various jam as well .</p>
              <p>Again , those roads u mentions are strictly day shift roads , night shift seldom hit with severe jams along the roads u mentioned , cos we have variosu options .</p>
              <p>Day shift and night shift is reverse one ....</p>
              <p>AYE towards ECP 6pm onwards to 7pm , surely jam .</p>
              <p>PIE Jurong Town Hall &gt; Clementi Ave 6 , also will jam .</p>
