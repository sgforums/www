              <p>I dun plan where i want to go after i start my engine , first trip cruising yes , next trip will plan after the current pax .... but i do make a point of heading either East or West , seldom i head into dead zones like Sembawang , Wlands , Yishun , Sengkang or Hougang ...</p>
              <p>I seldom head towards AMK Ave 6 twds Yishun , u are very likely to get a pax to Yishun . At Up Thomson also towards Sembawang Road ...</p>
              <p>Same scenario , YIO CK MRT , u picked , very likely they sent you into Lentor Loop , or Cactus Road off Yio Chu Kang .</p>
              <p>Or at Beauty World , if u pick a pax , most likely the pax would ask to go Bt Pj .... By Batok , Wlands or Marsiling , which if can , i try not to go , dead end .</p>
              <p>Again , if inside CBD , if no choice , got $3 , pick and go at Taxi stand , go wlands i also dun mind , $3 extra .... then see how at Wlands , also if can , i try to hunt for Ang mo , instead of local .</p>
              <p>Go blindly it's not my style , i am not a charity cabby .... to help them home , i end up being cruising down to town , at my expense of the cng , no way .</p>
              <p>That's my personal preferences ... nobody would agree with me 100% , but i am happy with this method , or formula , that's it .</p>

              <p>when i drive , i am always in control ... the routes , which way to way , i would recommend them ....</p>
              <p>Something i dun like about Indians from Tekka , if go Bt Batok , they die die will use Bt Timah Road , like using PIE will kill them ... so at Tekka , i chose where i want to go , not where they want to go .</p>
              <p>if u blindly take them , they tell you Punggol , indians will tell u all the way up to Upper Serangoon Road , if u waat to go by KPE , it's like killing them .</p>
              <p>Also Indians going to AMK , they'll also die die go by Thomson , to go by CTE also like going to kill them hard .</p>
              <p>So at Tekka , unless good trip , like Bay Shore , i dun mind , after Bay Shore , Airport , Simei i also like .... Bedok ok la ......</p>
              <p>Indians are for me to plan my next destination , not help them . But they will pay me for my service .</p>
              <p>Peak Hour i seldom hit Tekka .... only 10pm and 9pm sometimes .</p>

              <p>Taxi God...after going thru on those inputs you just submitted.</p>
              <p>just like this pattern 1.</p>
              <p>I tell u my route ....</p>
              <p>4pm start , Lot-1 ....</p>

                                      pax , surely go down , seldom go to MRT station .</p>
              <p>so this kind of driving pattern. ( just try)</p>
              <p>sorry...  question to raise . mentor.....like the above kind, are we not going there.  just .... to look see look see, if there is nothing than we will use the next pattern...is that so.</p>
              <p>that why? no experience need  at all....just put a litter effort and wasted a bit of diesel and time just (hope) to catch any pax if available.</p>
              <p>that why? are we just like fortune teller only forecast alway, hehee</p>
              <p>so basically we only just hope (not Luck) that there is pax over there... should I say.</p>

              <p>the above list many taxi drivers...understand this are all taxi hubs.. once you are there we will just go one or two rounds... just try, </p>
              <p>even we northern eastern taxi drivers ...no harm trying. this are all open lobangs...but those hidden lobangs... than that is not easy to reveal only people like you only know.</p>
              <p>even the best chef on the cooking show...he also  kept some hidden skills not showing to the audiences...if you follow  those steps as he taught... the taste  may not be the same.</p>

              <p>NTU .... not many drivers like go inside recce , in fact inside , if peak hour like 5.30pm to 6pm , many pax hoping to get a cab . And many ang mo stay at river valley town area .</p>
              <p>I love going inside .</p>
              <p>Many drivers to go by Pioneer Road North , to get them to find NIE , they lost !!!</p>
              <p>Many drivers from Jalan Bahar , to get them to Nanyang Administration Bldg , they also lost .</p>
              <p>Even if they can find these places , many might not even can find their way out .</p>
              <p>Students &amp; lecturers working inside sometimes they dun even know the way out .</p>
              <p>For me can say little bit finger tips .</p>
              <p>I love it if they shunned going inside . They shunned , i got more chances .</p>
              <p>So far , so good , if i can get a pax into town from NTU , that night most probably will be a good night out for me .</p>
