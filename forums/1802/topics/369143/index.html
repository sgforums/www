              <p>There are many times...after end of the shift. </p>
              <p>Most of those uncles at washing bay...wow...wow.. today not heng collection very low, all routes run alway no pax very quiet.</p>
              <p>But some uncles said ...wow ...today seebei heng. all long and chiong and good connection.</p>
              <p>So, my question. Luck or Experience count.</p>
              <p>For me i think....Luck is important...Experience is another.</p>
              <p>Just like Poolie so heng got Red Wish near his house, and now here he ...go again taxi driving.  So is this heng (Luck) involved the whole senerio that he wanted and the new hirer and the taxi waited for him.</p>
              <p>Just like last sunday... at about 10.30am a Tank Road indian temple this family of four, brother...Choa Chu Kang Cresent.</p>
              <p>So upon reaching the fare about $21.80 at the block below and completed.... another connection trip  family of four chinese waited just below the block , uncle Tampines Mall...end up $23.50 all within 1 hours.</p>
              <p>So Mentor Poolie, the above is Luck or Experience can share your opinion about.</p>

              <p>Neither of luck and experience. It's mere coincidence. Once in a blue moon. Not everyday is a Sunday. Of course you should give yourself a little treat for that good connection in an hour.</p>

              <p>nope, it's pure luck. another 0.5sec later probably another taxi will come along. like today, abnn standing on my side of the road waiting for taxi, so happens he was looking at the opposite side, oncoming merc got the business even though i would have reached him first. just 1 turn of the head. not luck then what? after that cruise empty for 40mins. yes 40mins. knn.</p>
              <p>that said, we'll all have our ups and downs, so at the end of the month (or even the year) things will balance out and we end up with more or less the same amount of earnings. so long term view, not luck but consistency. short term - 0.5sec luck. lol. imho</p>

              <p>kin mentioned experience and luck .... what about hardwork ?</p>
              <p>U create your own luck by being hardworking , sitting at the coffee shop can get lucky ?</p>
              <p>Hardwork &gt; Experience &gt; Luck ...</p>
              <p>in % ...70% hardwork , 20% experience , 10 luck .</p>
              <p>U surely know that Wish u don't get it from the sky .... i had to hunt for it , going around in my bicycle , around those car parks , @10pm , hunting for those OMO to go home , got what i mean ?</p>
              <p>Luck is about hitting the 4D , hitting the ToTo jackpot etc .... in gambling , luck not really in my philosophy .</p>
              <p>I emphasis hardwork , tactics , foresights , experience , luck will be my last excuse if i don't do well that night .</p>
              <p>Fortune teller told me to avoid red , i at first believe , but later on , i emphasis , many Transcab drivers will be like me , their life might not be suitable for red , but they still live their life on , why should like avoid red ?</p>
              <p>So i place a gamble ..... instead of putting luck in front .</p>

              <p>One moment i might missed , or lost to him a pax , from Ulu Pandan to T3 maybe ..... one good long distance , i cannot curse myself of being ill luck , cos the next pax , if i go on hunting , might connect one by one ... short distance .</p>
              <p>What about that Ulu Pandan to Tampines that driver ? He might end up Q-ing at Airport for one hour .</p>

              <p>Okie agreed...70% hardwork.</p>
              <p>like KTCK said,</p>
              <p>nope, it's pure luck. another 0.5sec later probably another taxi
                                      will come along. like today, abnn standing on my side of the road

                                      oncoming merc got the business even though i would have reached him

                                      cruise empty for 40mins. yes 40mins. knn.</p>
              <p>What KTCK...those 40mins and those 40mins,  are this not rear hardwork sitting inside the taxi cruise empty...but result still zero.</p>
              <p>I,  think Luck really must come...than those 40mins not wasted cruising around....like this hardwork all wasted.</p>

              <p>Taxi...early the morning or early evening...me and you and others.</p>
              <p>Same is just like gambling...first you need to pay upfront of $51 for sonata. than start your taxi the jackpot rolled round and round for 12 hours on road.  At the end of the shift than you know how much you make the prize rewarded,   you invested and the hardwork and time and experience.</p>
              <p>So finally Luck plays... i, think... the result the collection of the day.</p>
              <p>Each and every outing  and pattern may not be the same.</p>
              <p>Sometime the same hours the same routes like yesterday, result may not be the same.</p>
              <p>Why? cause not the same pax waiting at the same spot and the same route and timing...collection 100% may not be the same, so Luck is important.</p>

              <p>In fact , if that cabby experience enuf , he should expect abit more locals , a bit more  Paris Ris and Tampines trips for SQ flights , he can chose to go to British Airways or Qantas to avoid those Pasir Ris Hassles .</p>

              <p>In fact , if that cabby experience enuf , he should
                                      expect abit more locals , a bit more  Paris Ris and
                                      Tampines trips for SQ flights , he can chose to go to British
                                      Airways or Qantas to avoid those Pasir Ris
                                      Hassles .</p>
              <p>If i am to chose to go SQ lanes at T3 , i
                                      should expect this sort of things to happen .</p>
              <p>But i do believe in destiny more than luck .</p>
              <p>So you mean, Qantas and British Airways less pasir ris residents on board, only SQ.</p>
              <p>I, think this can never happen sure somehow or rather good mixtures sure have a few in this fight, Qantas... local resident from australia coming back, or British airway do got some local. transit or direct from london.. you can never said less from resident of pasir ris,  this housing estate with hdb more and private than condos over there.</p>
              <p>So...i think...heading T3 could be the same.</p>

              <p> Fri nite…. haha…. usually i drive 480km to 550km.</p>
              <p>Just what Guru Alvin told 480km to 550km...for night one full sonata fuel tank gone.</p>
              <p>So, my question how much jobs he completed...could it be 25 jobs for that night.</p>
              <p>Just some night on friday,  he is buring less fuel and running less km...could be 25 jobs again.</p>
              <p>So my question?...is this Luck or hardwork or experience...during the night.</p>

              <p><br>This is purely hardwork for ALN !! 100% is , no doubt , i will never say ALN is lucky in that sense .</p>
              <p>To get a pax is the job of a taxi driver . It's how he got it . It's common to get a pax , long or short .</p>
              <p>25 jobs , less km and fuel , it's depends . If he stick around the CBD area or inside , or achieve tremendously during peak hour , he can achievement that " possiblity " .</p>
              <p>The "Probability" is - more paxes surrounding city , the "possibility" of HDB area pax getting into town , is low .</p>
              <p>If u mentioned midnight , eg ..... ALN got a trip to wlands  from Mohd Sultan , $26 .</p>
              <p>Is it lucky for him ? I would say not really . Becos the "possibility" to connect another is low .</p>
              <p>Luck play a part for him ? Then how he achieve such amount each Friday night ? Harwork by charging down CTE into town again .</p>
              <p>If i got a pax from same location , to Stevens Road , am i lucky ? Yes to say it , becos i am ready for another connection at Far East Plaza perhaps . The "probability" is there to get a pax , a ready tailor one .</p>
              <p>Lucky is a short cut word to say one that is hardworking .</p>

              <p>now after analysing all ... i realized that day driver's mentallity , was the luck issue .</p>

              wow since we are hot at this topic.... i like to think this way.... For a fixed 10 hrs of hardworking driving, experience accounts for $180 to $220 collection.... Luck accounts for another $0 to $80 collection....
              
              so minimum u get $180 + $0 (for new cabby on a unlucky nite)
              
              so max u get $220 + $80 (for experienced plus lucky nite)
              
              and experience cabby will get $220 on very unlucky day.... 
              
              like that loh.... 
              
              got luck factor lah, Pool... just how much of it... e.g. 3am tue pax from wood to town... no amount of experience can get you that trip.... only luck can...

              <p>this morning heavy rain at east coast road. bus stop opp. katong shopping centre..young lady hailed my cab. unker, just opposite only..katong shopping centre. the moment she closed the door..ting..current booking..the makena meyer road. start meter, turn right haig rd, turn right again and into katong shopping centre taxi stand..$4.05. $4 ok. =&gt; you have rejected 1 job =&gt; 5 mins no booking. peak hour somemore. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/greggman.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> suspended 1 hour somemore cos earlier already kena 2 rejected jobs, 1 go pee time ("dun expect call" type of ulu place), 2nd time bedok reservoir booking at lengkong tiga, how to take? if not luck then call it an unhappy combination of unusual circumstances.</p>
              <p>i would say luck factor is about 50% nowadays. in the old days when poolie was a hirer yah experience, hard work &amp; strategy maybe 70%, luck 30%. like mahjong. nowadays no more. last time morning peak in tuas, i never hesitate, straight head to cck. exit kje straight away got call, even at 7am+, or airport straight away chiong to bayshore, exit bedok straight away got booking or pple queuing at the taxi stand. now 7-8am many many empty cabs cruising at cck. bayshore taxi stand sometimes more than 15 taxis queuing. white mice come, siao liao all disappear...go where? headache. cos east side morning b4 8am dullsville. and there are simply too many empty cabs cruising around. my 0.5sec rule.</p>

              <p>ktck, i am not qualified to comment as i am not driving yet.. I think it is true i am aware that recent time, i saw many cab crusing at wilderness with no pax, and most of them lost.... More queues at taxi stands.... and i observe no taker..... this is not luck....</p>
              <p>This is facts.... i am facing now in whatever i do.... same thing....NOT LUCK.. but face it and one must realize that so long we are not hunger to unrealistic level as long as we work hard.  Don't over commit and most important is NO DEBT...</p>
              <p>You ask me are you sure you still want to drive.....YES... I will drive taxi as i have said before umpteem time that i will do it but never.  This is the time i will be a taxi driver...and hopefully i pass the test...</p>
