              I think hor it's abit simplistic to justisfy luck alone as the contributing factor in a cabbie's earnings. No doubt luck plays a part when you get a generous tip, or you curse at yourself when someone does a no-show. At the end of the day,you make your own luck as well by putting in the hours. That's how taxi-driving is, i figured.
              
              It is no longer just luck at work when you knowingly choose to go airport or Clarke Quay over other places. To insist it's still all just luck when you get a fare to Tuas from Airport at midnight is to belittle your own effort. To grumble against it when you pick a fare heading to Simei is only detrimental to your own mental well-being, if not being calculating and lacking the balls to accept life by pinning the blame on this thing called Luck.

              <p>Need opinions from gurus and mentors on "advance booking". Is it good or bad? This morning around 7:15 a.m. i tried to flag down a cab at the main road in queenstown with my son. Most cab crusises by without hiewing me. There is one blue sonata was flag down by 3 indians with luggage 100 metre in front of me.  The sonata stop and reject that job. Move forward to me. Ask where to? I told him NUS high school near clementi.  Okay and i get on.</p>
              <p>On the way i ask him why he never take the pax that first flag him down. He say those going to airport and he cannot make it. Show me an Advance booking at 7:45 am - Spanish Village to Airport.</p>
              <p>I get on at 7:15 and arrive at around 7:25 for a $5 fares.  Is it worth taking up an Advance booking job like this if for example in between 7: 25 to 7:45 am is difficult to pick and choose pax.  Moreover he was reminded by the operator for that job while in Clementi.  The young "chinese" driver even said: how come the operator know where i am?  I assume he used to be a foregin talent turn taxi driver.. I told him because you are track by the satellite system. Don't you know?</p>
              <p>So - my point is : if he don't have this advance booking, he could have pick up those 3 indians to airport and minus my trip or taking on those idle time that he cannot pick and choose.  Also he could have reach airport by 7:40 or 7:45 a.m.</p>
              <p>Is ADVANCE BOOKING that good?  Or is it being tied down with time and probably lost time.</p>

              <p>guru Aln, kin said you are specialist for Night shift advance booking. Love to hear from you the superb 500 Km a night driver on weekend - you must be lightning fast to tikam with those 15 to 20 or 30 mins left over for Advance booking.</p>
              <p>I think late night and midnight is easier than compare to Day shift Peak hour type.</p>

              oh advance booking... timing and pick up point very important....  will mean extra stress... 
              
              me like those before 530am from west type.... usually to airport... big money... 
              
              pick up point of advance job usually is near where u are at bidding time.... that's the only consolation when u kena pax to cck (pool's home ground) or jur after 10pm.... prepare your fastest finger for advance bidding.... haha
              
              good thing about advance job in early morning is u can almost zoom anyway from anyway within 15-20min.... 8am advance? jam until you pee.... haha
              
              advance jobs are at least 45min apart.... so if i cant get one before 545 i also wont bid for one 6am type... cos it means no chance to get those 515 to 545 type liao... 6am advance? I wont stress myself if got no midnite surcharge...
              
              i wont take those:
              a) those from east to airport type (not worth the stress)
              
              b) those after 545am type (cos pax dilly dally and midnite surcharge gone liao... haha)
              
              c) pick up point from road side (high chance no show)
              
              Good luck!

            <div class='col-md body'>
              actually 4am onwards advance to airport is for those morning shift pple.... coincide with their start time and place...
              
              nite shift cabby seldom take advance.... me only take on Fri cos I drive round the clock.... tue me end early to koon so wont take....
              
              if me next day day job take leave, then me drive taxi split shift... e.g. 630pm to 12am... then koon... then take advance say at 445am and at 540am....these 2 jobs can be up to $45 to $70 liao.... not enough for millionaire but good enough for me... haha

              <p>very tight down .... a real burden .</p>
              <p>Even for night shift , i never really fancy , only one fellow fancy advance , ALN !!!</p>
              <p>But i used top bid for AJ around CCK / Jurong area to AP .... that's is good money .</p>
              <p>But once i kena a AJ at Jurong West St 42 at 4.30am , but i was free at 3am already , washing my car , take my own sweet time , coffee , it's a waste of my bloody time , that was a few years back .</p>
              <p>Also once i got a job at Clementi , but an hour before picking him , i actually got a pax to Simei , so rush back vacant , then shoot back AP again .  </p>
              <p>Even at Simei , i had to forgo any pax ... what a waste .</p>
              <p>No point la , my opinion , i can earn advance booking $$$ , by street hire also .</p>

              <p>I had my own beliefs .... i love challenges , like in a badminton game , leisure or competition , i am all out for a win .</p>
              <p>My badminton mate always told me : " Com on , don't be so serious , we are here to sweat nia ."</p>
              <p>My answers to them : " I love to sweat as well as thrills of a badminton game . Not just sweat , sweat can get anywhere if u are under the sun . "</p>
              <p>Different people has got different views &amp; ways of how they chose to get on with their life .</p>
              <p>If we have the potential to do something beyond our limit , i just do it .</p>
              <p>My point to new drivers or drivers-to-be , whatever work we are in , take it as a challenge , not kiasu , i don't mean that , and i hate that , do challenge yourself , challenge your limit , test your endurance , occasionally upgrade yourself with something new . Do explore new things when we can while driving .</p>
              <p>Be realistic , never say never .</p>
              <p>I always say , after i start my engine , i am a warrior fighting war , mind you , the war is within myself .</p>
              <p>A war so as to satisfy your family , ur needs , the customer service , your safety , both inside the car and also on the road .</p>
              <p>I have been thru many holiday eves , what i had achieved , the numbers is always up , seldom goes down , at least on par with last occasion . That is my challenge .</p>
              <p>If last monday i did $180 , by 12am , so i had to remind myself this coming monday , i am to fight so just a $1 more . Anything more , it's always just a bonus .</p>
              <p>In this way , u'll see , within yourself , u have built up a even stronger mentallity each day , to live your life for the next day .</p>
              <p>I'll never compromised luck with my mentallity .</p>
