              <p>So sorry, just  came across this article from this blog ( www.cablog.com au.) copy and paste.</p>
              <p>Another taxi driver from Aussie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>August 19, 2009</h2>
              <h3>Luck</h3>
              <p>Like most jobs taxi driving has its moments of luck, usually the
              result of preparation and perserverance rather than simply slacking
              around.</p>
              <p>At midnight last night I stopped for dinner reasonably happy with
              the shift till then. As you can imagine Tuesdays in winter are usually
              the quietest nights of the year but I’d jagged a meaty fare to the
              North Shore just after 10pm, the start of the night rate.</p>
              <p>The passenger, a young office woman sat up front and talked like a
              threshing machine. She’d been out celebrating a business deal and
              launched into a tale involving sex, drugs, affairs and betrayal.</p>
              <p>At regular intervals she grabbed my forearm to emphasise a point,
              but I didn’t worry about it, she was a demonstrative girl. When a phone
              call to her married lover failed to entice him out, I was ordered on to
              her house. There, a bloke stood on the verandah smoking. “That’s my
              boyfriend,” she squealed, “wave to him. Want to come in for a drink,
              other drivers do.” Pass.</p>
              <p>After dinner I camped on a favourite rank waiting for the evening
              shift. During the late afternoon I’d spotted an employee who lived in
              the Shire and figured there was an outside chance of scoring a $60
              fare. This would make my night and allow for an early mark home. As
              luck would have it, I got him.</p>
              <p>However rather than turn for home after dropping him, I decided to
              head back to the city for another hour or so. Maybe it was the sight of
              empty cabs leaving the city which inspired me but I just felt lucky.</p>
              <p>Sure enough, arriving in Redfern around 1:30am I was offered a radio
              job to Fairfield, out in the western suburbs. The only trouble being
              the pick-up on Bourke Street, Waterloo was questionable. It would be
              either heaven or hell and after nearly rejecting it as too risky my
              intuition took over and I accepted the job.</p>
              <p>When the details showed two passengers in a male name I started to
              panic until arriving at the address to find two businessmen in suits
              hailing a passing cab. I quickly put a stop to that, they were mine!</p>
              <p>Two lamb kebabs and $100 later I rolled into Fairfield well pleased,
              especially after doing a hard speed limit past a concealed police car
              on Parramatta Road.</p>
              <p>Call me lucky, it was that sort of night.</p>
