              <p>I dun rush to Serangoon North from CCK , are u crazy ?. OIC .... me start at 4.45pm sometime , Tengah Airbase sometime they knock off 4.30pm , so their friend tompang them to Blk 304 taxi stand or CCK ave 5 area near Brickland take a cab , from there usually they go very long distance .</p>
              <p>I kena a few times liao ....CCK to Hougang , CCK to Punggol , CCK to Sengkang , very kia su people , to avoid paying more during peak hours , they rush to take a cab 15 minutes before peak hour start .</p>
              <p>So i surely if at Hougang , Yio Chu Kang , Punggol , Sengkang , end zone , i'll try Serangoon North Ave 5 area , good chance ang mo pax head town .</p>
              <p>I dun do that crazy thing go from CCK to Serangoon , unless got pax , never vacant .</p>

              <p><br>From wland's side ,  to go bukit batok west ave 5 , via BKE , also can go by Bt Panjang , but the best is BKE &gt; KJE &gt; Brickland Road &gt; Bt Btk West Ave 5 .</p>
              <p>But i never believe there's such pax from PIE towards Jurong , to go to Bt Batok West 5 , they would want to go by BKE &gt; Bt Panjang .... 8 years , not once i encounter by this way .</p>
              <p>I would say , 80% go by Bukit Batok East Ave 2 , or 20% PIE exit Jalan Jurong Kechil . Not Bt Panjang . Dun do that for all pax , surely invite complaint .</p>

              <p>that's right la , go interview what should she wear ? Jeans ? or sports wear ?</p>
              <p>So u reckon she's heading to some office area , is she going to some fish market ? cannot be , right ?</p>
              <p>So u are right , anyway , both going to offcei area definitely , Parkway la that guy ..... Parkway in top also office .</p>
              <p>Or some sports wear like me , going to CCK Sport Complex for sure ?</p>
              <p>I am saying , if u need some good trip ....</p>
              <p>And running out of time , u have 2 choices , a stretch of road , 2 paxes , one wearing sports wear like me , the other wearing Formal wear , u better chose the latter ..... no matter who beacon u first .</p>
              <p>Also , like i say , sometimes some drivers if chose to stick at housing area , they usually judge , they think this auntie dun go town , they stop and ask , if one good they are going town , they asked also dun wan cases .</p>

              <p>NUS , for me , dead zone in the morning ..... if for me la, i dunno when is my next pax .</p>
              <p>No doubt one trip $27 .... if i stick at Hougang or Tampines area , maybe 3 aunties trip , to and fro from Tampines&gt;Bedok or Hougang &gt;AMK , maybe 45 minutes also can get $27 . Althought 3 x $9 looked small .</p>
              <p>The problem is , i am still in housing area , not stuck in dead town like those in NUS .</p>
              <p>Kin certainly loves long trips , but he forgotten 4 shorts trips = 1 long trip .</p>
              <p>he must give credit for those short trips as well .</p>
              <p>I chose all shorts trips if got many paxes .... if can connect well . One long trip , if cannot connect , damn du lan one .</p>
              <p>If many taxis , no pax , the longer the better mentallity . </p>
              <p>Now u know why after 1pm , some drivers put Changing Shift inside housing area ?</p>
              <p>Yishun was a few years back , long long before MRT starts , cabbies there only changing shift YISHUN .</p>

              <p>Like what kin had exampled ...</p>
              <p>Now my example ...</p>
              <p>Peak hour ....</p>
              <p>Cabby A : He took a pax at Pasir Ris to Hougang , how much ? Peak hour $15 , can ? Hougang good chance to connect another , right ?</p>
              <p>Then he connect another to say to Yishun from Hougang ? Peak Hour $15 , how long does he take ?</p>
              <p>Cabby B : Pasir Ris to NUS , $27 total . 0 connection expected , cos NUS ma .</p>
              <p>Which would u chose or claim to be a lucky ?</p>
              <p>Who would u want to be in that position , yeah 2 shorts trips nia nia .... Pasir Ris to Hougang short short , Hougang to Yishun ????</p>
              <p>I almost forgotten , Yishun u guarantee can connect pax to anywhere !!!!!!</p>
              <p>So long distance , good lucky trip ?</p>
              <p>For me , not really ...tactically i be cursing myself for getting this dead zone trip , unlike KIn , he is happy for that $27 , i'll be very sad , cos i cannot find my next pax , i would be more happy to get $6 , $10 , $8 , regular trips .</p>
