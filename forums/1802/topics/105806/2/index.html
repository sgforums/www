            <div class='col-md body'>You tried the W210/211 series, or both ??<br>I notice in the later W211 E 220, they got rid of the resonance which comes 'off &amp; on' on the W210 E 220 so the 4-cylinder is now even more smoother running &amp; quieter than before.<br><br>If buying for private car use (ignoring the effect of the stupid tax disincentives against private diesel cars here !) i'll select the E 220 or the latest 3-litre V6 diesels over even the petrol E 320. The E 240 is to me an 'inefficient' E 260 model re-labelled 'lower' so as not to make it appear too 'inferior' compared to the latest diesel models ! The E 200 Kompressor is hardly worth considering after having 'tasted' any of these new diesels !! I find the new diesel engines become quieter &amp; smoother running when revved while the Kompressor petrol engine noisier &amp; more harsh when revved ! The days when a diesel 'have to' be inferior to a petrol model are long gone. Diesel technology have advanced very significantly in recent years while petrol technology to me seems to be 'stagnating' !<br><br>When you say test driven, have you driven it on a test road in Tuas before ?<br>I've been told that some taxi drivers here did comparation tests of the various taxi models here on that road &amp; the W210 E 250 could reach ~ 200 km/h.<br>Appears to me there still many people here who still think the performance of the newer generation diesel taxis here have not changed much compared to the Toyotas, Nissans or those 30 year old W115 M-B taxis in Malaysia.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll agree.<br><br>Maybe the model better than E 220 would be the new E 300, with 3-litre V6 cDi Euro-4, which i believe is a modular developed engine based on the outgoing 4-litre V8 Euro-3 cDi as used on the S 400. In the M-B world of diesel cars nowadays, one's tends to be looking @ 0-100 km/h in the range of 6 to 9 seconds only even for a car weighing 1.5 to 2 tons !<br><br>In such company, i'll forsee both the Cedric &amp; Crown screaming their ancient engines out till the whole neighbourhood knows they're on the roads, but still trailing quite far behind !!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SBS9818A:</div><div class="quote_body">Don't like both.
