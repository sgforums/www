              I still hold fort on my hypothesis of Adminstration issues. Today, taxi drivers in Singapore are not employed, so they are in a relation of hirer cum customer of taxi companies, the line is very clear.
              If TD become employed, it is not just for the timing, month pay and set quotas for nos of pax so simple, it become an Employment Relationship. ER cover lots of aspect, and companies become the sole liability, they hve to provide
              Uniform
              Regulations
              Progressive wage model
              Upgrading model
              NWC wage increases
              13 month bonuses
              Retirement at 62 3 month EAP payout
              Reemployment contract
              medical benefit
              annual leaves
              paternal and maternal leaves
              compassionate leaves
              night allowances
              Overtime payout
              Promotion 
              and so on....so do you think it is wise??

              Moreover, if you are employed to drive taxis, you expect a wage increment year by year to counter inflation and cost of living and also base on performance and company profitability. 
              Then when you are highly paid, but still doing the same job driving, the newbies who come in at a lower pay may not want to join, if you give newbie same paid as the senior, the senior will also not be happy...so it will be a mess, and I believe whoever do the HR, his or her table might need to change often if people like me and my bro hammer visit them

              <p>If taxi driver gets same pay as lawyer, there will not be enough lawyers. Then demand for lawyers go up, and law firms will have to pay more to hire them. Becoming a lawyer takes considerable intellect and time. Cabbies will always earn less than lawyers due to the natural law of supply and demand. Every year got how many new law graduates? And every year got how many new TDVLs being issued? TDVL can get in 4 months if u r good. Law degree takes 3-4 years. So it is impossible for cabbies to get same pay as lawyers.</p>
              <p>But cabby still get more pay than cleaner becoz a cabby requires more training and skill and is a harder job than to be a cleaner. A cleaners job is so basic that almost anyone can do. No need license and training. So by law of nature, cleaner will always be the lowest paid job without government intervention.</p>
              <p>But here and there, we get a super cabby like TY pullin in 5-digit fares monthly and staying in margoliouth bungalow. Or a super garang guni who can lose a few million in MBS. There will always be superheros around, but most people are just like u and me struggling everyday.</p>
