              <p>Singapore has created a fast-charging electric taxi that works 
              well in tropical cities and could help the country to combat climate 
              change.</p>
              <p>Conventional electric vehicles take six to eight hours to charge and usually cover up to 160km on a full charge.</p>
              <p>But EVA, the taxi designed and built here by TUM Create - a 
              collaboration between Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and 
              Germany's Technische Universitat Munchen - has a 200km range and a 
              charging time of just 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>"Drivers can go for a toilet or meal break, come back, and their taxi
               will be recharged," said Mr Raymond Khoo, 29, an NTU researcher on the 
              project.</p>
              <div id="newsletter-popup" style="margin-top: 10px;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/straitstimes.com/themes/straitstimes/images/get_news_on_the_go.jpg" alt=""><img class="close" style="cursor: pointer; position: relative; right: 29px; bottom: 90px;" src="http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/straitstimes.com/themes/straitstimes/images/get_news_on_the_go_close.jpg" alt="">
              
              
              </p>
              </div>
              <p>The taxi's specially designed features - such as an overhead 
              air-conditioning system that cools individual seats, and fans in the 
              seats that wick away heat and moisture - also help to reduce the energy 
              needed to keep passengers comfortable in tropical cities.</p>
              <p>The researchers said they decided to focus on electric taxis as taxis
               "have a far greater impact on the environment compared with private 
              passenger cars".</p>
              <p>In Singapore, taxis make up about 3 per cent of the vehicle 
              population, but travel 15 per cent of the total distance covered by all 
              vehicles here, according to the researchers' calculations.</p>
              <p>Many two-shift taxis here travel for up to 24 hours every day, covering an average of 520km, they said.</p>
              <p>The researchers added that by replacing vehicles that use fossil 
              fuels with electric-powered ones, carbon emissions as well as noise and 
              exhaust pollution can be reduced.</p>
              <p>The team is now looking to work with industrial partners to conduct 
              safety tests on the taxi, and to find ways to mass manufacture it for 
              commercial use.</p>
              <p>But they acknowledged that there are several obstacles, such as the need for specially designed charging stations for the taxi.</p>
              <p>This means that Singapore's more than 70 existing charging stations may need to be retrofitted.</p>
              <p>Some people, such as bank analyst Rachel Ng, 25, were also concerned 
              about possible higher fares, if the electric taxis cost more.</p>
              <p>Addressing this concern, TUM Create scientific adviser director 
              Markus Lienkamp said: "Electric taxis cost less in the long run compared
               with petrol-run taxis, as electricity is much cheaper than petrol, and 
              electric engines do not experience wear and tear.</p>
              <p>"So there's really no question about it. Electric vehicles are the future."</p>

              Charge fast also mean meter charge very fast...tio bo? then rental also charge Driver very fast up and up lor. 
              Electric car is not new, in the 70s, there are already invention on it, just that those oil producing companies including russia and USA paid all these scientists and inventors very high to keep their mouth shut so that they can sell oil and make huge profit.
              
              Now, here in singapore..they come out with a electric car again , the purpose is not to make the road full of electric car, the purpose is to look for sponsor to pay them handsomely for the rest of their life just to keep their mouth shut and enjoy their rich life quietly

The latest mercedes, bmw, porsche, ferrari designs are all aiming for plugin hybrids and fuel cell tech. People are racing to implement practical and reliable designs and leave crude oil for aerospace, military and the chemical industries. It is no longer business as usual. CDG will have to retire their diesel pumps in 20 years time and prepare for the switch to electric cars, maybe even driverless taxis. Tesla batteries for household solar panel backup for night time use are receiving intense interest based on what i read in bloomberg. We are at the apex of change from crude oil to alternative fuels.

              Global warming is unstoppable unless human become extinct. 
              
              And in fact, the countries that preach the most on the global warming are the ones producing the most carbon and waste in the world. The like of USA and many others, and of course in Singapore, Jurong island is expanding...with chemical that can destroy the ozone layers and earth atmosphere at thrice the speed of  carbon monoxide emission by vehicle, you can talk about euro 4 or euro 6 standard, but the emission is still there, all these standard are merely there to make more money and tax.
              
              We might come into a time, where crude oil is not needed, in fact, only the last century till now, is crude oil become a main source of our energy need, whatever we use to produce energy to churn the wheels and machineries, there will be waste that hurt the world, battery disposal with chemical is also a detriment to the world.
              
              As i said before, the money that put into petrol industrial, from Iraq to middle east war, from building of Jurong island, from america sending troop to protect oil field and so on, is not going to be let go as simple as it is, if electric car is to go into normal car on the road, what will be the impact to the world, or to a country like singapore, the economy will come into a standstill. Of course we will see a change, but not now, because greed and craving of human know no limits. So, in my opinon, until the last drop of fossil oil is being used up, human will likely to make themselve powerful and rich thru oil

              <p>Electric taxis is nothing new.  Only Singapore think it is new and other countries are laughing at us for being so suaku.</p>
              <p>Other cities such as Shenzhen already have them for a few years.  It is whether our taxi companies want to implement their model which is to employ the taxi drivers directly instead of hiring the taxis out.</p>

              <p>Alamak if CDG were to hire taxi drivers instead of renting out taxis - guaranteed plus chop the cabbies will fetch the minimum number of pax just to satisfy the daily minimum fare collection and then use as private car. End up they have to tweak the rules and give incentives for cabbies to fetch extra pax. The result could be less profits and even less commuter satisfaction since taxi company now must pay CPF, staff insurance, annual leave, sick leave.</p>
              <p>Only in PRC can taxi companies hire taxi driver directly. They got millions of hungry people who are ready to do anything for money. Singaporeans are equally hungry but do not appear so because we got way more rules and restrictions than China. There is a Chinese saying, when the emperor is far away, the peasants do as they please. We are in a tiny country where the emperor is only a few bus stops away. How to luan luan lai?</p>
              <p>So dont waste time comparing Singapore and China. It is like comparing ikan bilis with a whale.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE - Two universities have worked together to develop an 
              electric taxi that works well in tropical cities and could help the 
              country to combat climate change. It was designed and built by TUM 
              Create, a collaboration between Nanyang Technological University and 
              Germany's Technische Universitat Munchen.</p>
              <p>Here are five unique features of the vehicle known as EVA.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Fast charging</strong></p>
              <p>Conventional electric vehicles take six to eight hours to charge and 
              usually cover up to 160km on a full charge. But EVA has a 200km range 
              and takes just 15 minutes to charge.</p>
              <div id="newsletter-popup" style="margin-top: 10px;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/straitstimes.com/themes/straitstimes/images/get_news_on_the_go.jpg" alt=""><img class="close" style="cursor: pointer; position: relative; right: 29px; bottom: 90px;" src="http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/straitstimes.com/themes/straitstimes/images/get_news_on_the_go_close.jpg" alt="">
              
              
              </p>
              </div>
              <p>For a Toyota Corolla Altis with a full tank of petrol, it can cover about 550km.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Energy-efficient</strong></p>
              <p>The taxi has an overhead air-conditioning system that cools 
              individual seats, so air-conditioning for unoccupied zones can be 
              switched off to reduce energy wastage. It also has fans in the seats 
              that wick away heat and moisture, thus reducing the reliance on 
              air-conditioning.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Top speed</strong></p>
              <p>It can travel at up to 111 km/h. The speed limit on Singapore's 
              highways is 90km/h. So these small babies can move pretty quickly.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Lightweight car body</strong></p>
              <p>The taxi's skeleton is made entirely of carbon fibre, which is five 
              times as strong as steel, two times as stiff, yet weighs about 
              two-thirds less. It is also used on planes and other vehicles such as 
              Formula One sports cars.</p>
              <p>By using the lightweight but super strong material, the electric taxi
               could weigh 150kg lighter than other vehicles of the same size. But the
               design means that it will not compromise on strength or durability.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Child seats</strong></p>
              <p>Most parents do not bring their own child seats when travelling in 
              taxis with their young ones. In EVA, the back of the front seat can be 
              folded down to act as a child seat, thus allowing children aged nine 
              months to three years to travel more safely.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Low carbon footprint</strong></p>
              <p>Studies have shown that electric vehicles have half the carbon 
              footprint of conventional vehicles. Taxis, in particular, have a greater
               impact on the environment than private cars.</p>
              <p>Close to 30,000 taxis ply the roads, making up just 3 per cent of all
               vehicles here. But researchers estimate that they travel 15 per cent of
               the total distance covered by the vehicles.</p>
              <p><strong>7. There isn't much detail on how much such a taxi will cost but chances are until technology is well adopted, it will be high.</strong></p>
              <p>Batteries make up a huge chunk of the final cost of an electric car, 
              but they are getting cheaper. They now cost around US$500 a 
              kilowatt-hour, a 60 per cent drop from 2010. That could plunge further 
              to US$175 within five years.</p>
              <p>Apart from cost, having enough charging stations is another key 
              factor. That has been an obstacle to electric-car adoption in the United
               States, Germany and China. For EVA, Singapore's more than 70 existing 
              charging stations may need to be retrofitted.</p>
              <p>These two factors, cost and accessibility, will probably be the most 
              crucial elements. If mass adoption takes off, this technology will enter
               a virtuous cycle that could lead to lower prices and a lower carbon 
              footprint. But if batteries do not get cheaper and have few stations to 
              recharge, and people do not move into the technology, this could well be
               another missed opportunity.</p>

              Singapore govt or LTA will not allow taxi employment, why? because of many issue, but the major one will be, collective bargaining. In getting employed by a taxi company to drive for them base on full employment benefits and regulation, a Collective Agreement must be in place, otherwise, taxi companies will do hanky panky stuff as and when they like.
              
              Collective bargaining leading to Agreement is a collective effort by all Drivers, in another words, a UNION. And when agreement is breached, drivers will all protest and stop driving until issue is solved or justice is re installed. So, do you think our govt can afford to let the taxi drivers to go on strike even when they are on the right of the laws??
              
              Therefore, there are thing beyong our understanding, you might think, aiya, it will not happen one lah, but anything can be a risk to the govt and taxi companies, as Hirer, you all are independent, the most you can form is a Pirus group or limo durian head group, but if you put drivers as Staff of company, the togetherness is even stronger, they will not accept an individual contract but rather a collective one.

              <p>Collective bargaining leading to Agreement is a collective effort by all Drivers, in another words, a <span>UNION</span>. And when agreement is breached, drivers will all protest and stop driving until issue is solved or justice is re installed. So, do you think our govt can afford to let the taxi drivers to go on strike even when they are on the right of the laws??</p>
              <p>Therefore, there are thing beyong our understanding, you might think, aiya, it will not happen one lah, but anything can be a risk to the govt and taxi companies, as Hirer, you all are independent, the most you can form is a Pirus group or limo durian head group, but if you put drivers as Staff of company, the togetherness is even stronger, they will not accept an individual contract but rather a collective one.</p>

              <p>Aiyoh unker, based on what you say, then how come got bus drivers Union (NTWU) arh? You mean bus drivers won't go on strike ar? Bus and train drivers go on strike, whole Singapore can holiday liao..more power than taxi drivers. I am not referring to the illegal one by SMRT Tiong drivers hor.  And NTWU is one of the largest unions in Singapore hor.</p>
              <p>If the taxi drivers are on contract (1,2 or 3 year contract) basis, it is not a legal requirement to include them as bargainable staff under the CA (Collective Agreement).</p>
              <p>In any case, even if they are included, they will be asked to join NTWU lah.  And look who are the advisors and chiefs of all the Unions. So, govt afraid of what?</p>
              <p>But knowing most taxi drivers who have big ego and trust no one, nobody will join Union one lah...maybe only those harmless newbies blur blur ones like me lor..</p>

              Bus, MRT are consider as essential transport of Singapore. Meaning die die must be running, but taxis is not an essential transport, it is a consumer transport, meaning, got money can take, not a necessities even if dun have. 
              
              Just like rice is an essential food item of singapore, but not bread or char kuay teow..UNDERSTAND BO!
              
              As such, the recent SMRT bus strikes by China drivers had led to many heads in SMRT and even in the NTWU leaders rolled. 
              
              Singapore Unions hold a symbolic relationship with the govt aka PAP, the purpose of the Unions is not only to protect the interest of working class peoples in Singapore, but many other aspects, and one of the most important is to ensure that the Unions are well in control of the worker so that any strikes, protest n riot can be addressed before it happen, and of course the other major aspect is for PAP to gather vote thru NTUC memberships.
              
              Therefore, bus drivers must be controlled, and to control, it must be make employed with regulations and policies in place and a Union to look after it.
              
              If Taxi drivers get employed, they will be no different from truck or container driver who are employed, paid a standard salary + nos of trip make incentives. But to a taxi company, to make driver becoming their staff is costly in term of adminstration, grievence settlement and wage cost

              <p>In Singapore, even those private bus, private limo, or pirate taxi also know how to behave themselves. I hardly smell or hear or see even a shadow on youtube, other than the recent fake n costly grabcar trip. Their daily drama and tcss is all confined to walkie talkie.</p>
              <p>But our normal taxi scene is quite colorful. Alot of drama from either crazy pax or aggressive cabbies. Better leave things as it is.</p>

              To be frank, actually, Singapore taxi drivers and residents living here are better than most other countries, just across the strait of both north and south, ie Malaysia and Indonesia, you see a total different kind of taxis, no control, no system, all pirate one.
              
              So, we, other then like to make noises and complaints, we are orderly and follow the rules peoples, very few countries in these world where you can walk (even as a girl) on a street at 3 am, and still nobody bother you.
              
              We should bless ourselves for being here

              To put you on payroll is a most stupid thing taxi companies will do, and for a cabby to join a cab company as a staff, you will hv to follow all their regulation and rules, so might as well work as papasan at cuppage centre better.
              
              Why would a company take responsible for your pay, yet hv to employ HR, staffs, supervisors and many other cost to control and admin you, buy medical insurance, co pay your CPF, pay for 14 days annual leaves, pay you 13th month + bonuses, pay you salary increment year by year, then hv to motivate you, send you for courses, promote you from Taxi driver to again, taxi driver with higher pay...why do all these??? it will be a stupidity at it very best if a taxi company is to go on and employ drivers instead of giving contractual to lure Hirer.
