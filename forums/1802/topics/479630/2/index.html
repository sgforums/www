              <p>arya, to be neutral also. Some TD also cb one la. drive on the
                  road, can see that when they want to overtake you but dont
                  signal. Good, face me 1 to 1, unless you signal i sure give
                  you, else wait long long. You signal, meaning good driving habits i
                  sure close 2 eyes and let you overtake me as i know you are in
                  a hurry.</p>
              <p>I ever come across 1st lane, one TD from 2nd lane signal speed
                  up to close 100km/hr, one to overtake me. i tot he in the hurry
                  so i slow down and let him through....best part is? after he
                  overtake, he slows down maintain at 90km/hr and there are not even
                  any cars infront of him.</p>

              Not being racist here, but I believe we met all kind of lousy pax
              from all kind of races including locals, but the differences is
              that locals at least treat us with respect, argue only, but
              foreigners, I mean those lousy ones, tends to disrespect us, mostly
              our notice such kind of act are from countries whereby their TD are
              consider the lowest class of the society, and that is why they
              think or thot that we are the same..but knnccb, limpek more rich

              Generally, from my one year experience as part time TD , 95% of the paxs whether locals or foreigners are nice.
