              The revenue of Cdg is not from singapore taxis alone, it is the global market demand on transportation that propelled cdg income.
                      
              ComfortDelGro is one of largest land transport companies in the world with a global workforce, a global shareholder base and a global outlook.
                      
              The Group was formed on 29 March 2003 through the merger of two land transport companies - Comfort Group and DelGro Corporation. Both had started out in the 1970s and had, by the time of the merger, grown to become successful listed land transport companies. Following the merger, ComfortDelGro has expanded significantly and now operates in seven countries and has a global fleet of about 46,000 vehicles.
                      
              ComfortDelGroâ€™s businesses include bus, taxi, rail, car rental &amp; leasing, automotive engineering services, testing services, driving centre, insurance broking services, outdoor advertising and car dealership. 
                      
              Apart from being the market leader in Singapore, ComfortDelGro has a significant overseas presence. The Groupâ€™s operations currently extend from the United Kingdom and Ireland to Australia, Vietnam, Malaysia, as well as across 12 cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and Chengdu.
                      
              Moreover the recent announcement is not the net income or profit, its still hv to factor off the cost of operating and earning taxation.

              <p>Many say u start with CDG, u can't be wrong. Easier platform to start. Cost maybe slightly higher, but with high bookings, aka extra $, still worthwhile.</p>

              <p>till u are sacked by them, u go other coy. From there u are seasoned enough to be on your own in the real world.</p>

              <p>hearsay also an unfair statement , other colors are usually rejects from CDG, or prefer a no government coy to work with.. Esp to the reds, most are "rough people"... I was confused and wondering how true is this statement </p>

              <p>Many say u start with CDG, u can't be wrong. Easier platform to
              start. Cost maybe slightly higher, but with high bookings, aka
              extra $, still worthwhile.</p>

              <p>till u are sacked by them, u go other coy. From there u are

              <p>hearsay also an unfair statement , other colors are usually
              rejects from CDG, or prefer a no government coy to work with.. Esp
              to the reds, most are "rough people"... I was confused and

              That is why, so many Fallen Talents in Singapore who actually believe that Singaporeans are poor, stupid and work like slave, believe me, there are thousands of Anston's characters out there, just that too bad Anston went public and get caught pant down.
              
              In their own community, they will all talk about locals, our behavorial and attitude and characteristics, and then, they will critise this and that, they will never admit that Singaporeans are the one who fed them.

              Not being racist here, but I believe we met all kind of lousy pax from all kind of races including locals, but the differences is that locals at least treat us with respect, argue only, but foreigners, I mean those lousy ones, tends to disrespect us, mostly our notice such kind of act are from countries whereby their TD are consider the lowest class of the society, and that is why they think or thot that we are the same..but knnccb, limpek more rich then them hor

              <p>arya, to be neutral also. Some TD also cb one la. drive on the road, can see that when they want to overtake you but dont signal. Good, face me 1 to 1, unless you signal i sure give you, else wait long long. You signal, meaning good driving habits i sure close 2 eyes and let you overtake me as i know you are in a hurry.</p>
              <p>I ever come across 1st lane, one TD from 2nd lane signal speed up to close 100km/hr, one to overtake me. i tot he in the hurry so i slow down and let him through....best part is? after he overtake, he slows down maintain at 90km/hr and there are not even any cars infront of him.</p>
              <p>Angry, i overtake and look at him lo.</p>
