              <p>It is indeed insulting for him to say that. If I were you, I would ask him where did he study. If he said he studied in a better institution that you, then you can say "Study so much for what? end up still be Taxi Driver". If he said he study in a worst institution than you, then you can say "You're no better than me".</p>
              <p>Sorry if any Taxi Drivers feel insulted but this is really too much. Although I'm not from normal or from ITE, I have many friends there I don't see them as any way more stupid then I am. They might be just slower or maybe during their exams, something happened which cause them to not be able to perform better. I despise people who look down on people in normal stream or ITE.</p>

              <p>Er, u mean good students go to ITE? Interesting..</p>
              <p>It is a FACT that lousy students, albeit not all, go to ITE, but
                  i did not say the students produced are lousy. So maybe, you should
                  get your thoughts straightened out?</p>
              <p>Subconsciously, you agree that lousy students go to ITE. We all
                  know that.</p>
              <p>Lecturers and facilities quality wise, i think its definitely
                  comparable, but thats beside the point.</p>
