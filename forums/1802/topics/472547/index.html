              <p>1) Couple of time pick up pax from Airport Asking what can have WiFi for them to check Email etc.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2) I Had Singtel 3G Mobile data SIM for my Samsung Galaxy Tab, Later used on my iPad Mini.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Think of ç‹¬ä¹�ä¹�ä¸�å¦‚ä¼—ä¹�ä¹�ï¼Œ Start search around for a 3G Mobile Router.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Currently Singtel carry number of China Brand Huawei E5776 Mobile WiFi modem, ZhongXing ZTE MF60 etc.</span></p>
              <p>If you get the (<span style="line-height: 1.231;">Huawei or </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">ZTE</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> )3G wireless from Sim Lim is about $120~$150</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://info.singtel.com/personal/communication/internet/broadband-on-the-go/broadband-on-mobile/laptop/devices">http://info.singtel.com/personal/communication/internet/broadband-on-the-go/broadband-on-mobile/laptop/devices</a></p>
              <p>But finally I decided to get a Ang Mo Brand : Sierra (Ang Mo Tua Ki).</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">And This month, my Ex Boss is coming to SG to meet up with me, So get him help me to get a AT &amp; T Sierra Wireless AirCard 754S 4G Mobile LTE Router.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2822/9372315641_7d9333f5ca.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="394"></p>
              <p>(This round I smarter Liao, get him to unlocked in USA before bring to SG. Last round he bring to me two Motorola Talkie without unlocked it and end with two white Elephant.)</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">After insert my Singtel 3G Mobile data SIM,and some techincal configuration,  the AirCard 754S 4G Mobile LTE Router working well, most of the area in SG, the download is about 6.5Mbs toi 7Mbs.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2859/9372398993_e7e0082310.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="500"></p>
              <p>So if you also have a 3G Mobile Data SIM for your Tab or iPad Maybe can consider to get a Huawei E5776 or ZTE MF60 and installed a Mini WiFi network in your cab so can share with your Pax. </p>

              <p>Photo handsome or ugly doesnt matter. Short or tall fat or thin also nothing. Its the heart that matters. If really want me to comment on photo, I'll say looks decent and how td should appear and present himself. I got nothing personal about this, but if his heart good, he will be appreciated and respected, no need to post like this.</p>
              <p>Look at Ct, the way he carry and post himslef, that's the way. Even hammer, he will tekan you, but you tekan back, he accept and move on, although I disagree with his vigilante behaviour (video taking). Lets not take real life and Net behaviour together. Knn if I wanted long ago, could have made a report against him. But I never, internet behaviour doesnt come under my portfolio and I like freedom of the net.</p>

              <p>Maybe only 1 person here I didnt like - BJ. But still did I go and notify his wife or family? Did I paste his photos? Did I set a trap for him? All is no. It's only Net behaviour, just for fun basically, no need to take into another level and get personal.</p>
              <p>Even I say just now, cari tak mau jumpa tak lepas, I got no real desire to bother. Knn you want to call me names call me lor. Police time, we are used to kena call names, heck I was a football referee once, kena tekan from players and fans. Did it affect me or my judgment? So go ahead, call me names, wish me die, curse my ancestory etc, words will not harm me, only actions that would require a response.</p>

              <p>I have check with chief. The member was not authorised by him to post the photo. We will look into this matter. But I understand why he does it because he's proud of chief. And chief is well known everywhere he goes. Like our army song - everywhere we go people want to know! We have seen at kopi and makan times many other tds also come and talk to chief and ask him advises etc etc. His face is very familiar everyone knows our KC Lee. But posting the photo was not a good idea maybe because we know here got some people with bad agenda. But I ask you guys to respect our chief and not to condemn his face or paste his photo anyhow in other forums without asking for permission. You can ask me as I will check with him for you. For the member we want him to delete the photo but cannot because your forum boss has ban him, If she unban him, I will intrsuct him to delete it. If not we just leave this matter as closed here while we decide what advises to give our member for his action.</p>

              <p>I think there's more than 1, like rbs said, we are observant enough to spot certain things and styles. And I'm quite sure 1 of them is the chief himself - like the wrong ID sign in suggests.</p>
              <p>But it's ok, whatever rocks their boat. They are providing quality enetertainment not seen since the BJ 'sexpose' days. I remember as a kid playing soldiers, police and thief. It seems some of them even in adult life cannot forget these games or maybe young time, didn't play or parents never allow, so now must make up for lost time.</p>
