              Yes, when the time come, and that is when PRs are allow into cab driving, the govt and taxi companies also treat taxi as a commerical profit churning piece of equipment, and not one that be use at one own usage, of course for taxi companies, at first they heckcare as long as rental are paid.
              
              But now with the govt intervention, u will slowing see how the system evolve. The key to our govt is alway control, they want to take control rather than allowing individual to have the flexibliity and control.
              
              And I hv to agree to yr perspectives of many will fall out, but let take it from here, if they dun change, nothing will change, and they will dare to change and test the ground, but what is stopping them now is only one reason...the 2016 election

              The ever aging of Singaporeans is showing, and an afluent  (educated)  population young singaporean is also showing, so no matter how you look at it, thru workshops and seminar, group discussion and planning, taxi driving for locals is now near sunset position. 
              
              We will take it as not that we want foreigners to drive taxis because we simply want foreigners but because of the demograhpic changes and the environment, the choices to hold on to locals is look bleaker by the years. 
              
              Just like road repairs, constructions and marine, whereby our aging population are catching up, today nearly 80% of the workforce in these industrial are foreigners. And we simply cannot write taxis trade off, it is a matter of sooner or later. It could be during our times, or it could simply be till we are gone.
