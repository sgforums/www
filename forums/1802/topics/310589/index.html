              <p><strong>Marcel Lee Pereira <br>Tue, Mar 11, 2008<br>my paper  </strong></p>
              <p><br><strong>Taxi rule upsets hotels</strong>  <br> <br>&gt;TAXI drivers are not happy. Hotels are not happy.</p>
              <p>The new ruling requiring cabs to drop and pick up commuters at designated stands in the Central Business District has been causing some tempers to flare.</p>
              <p>The dilemma they face: Can taxis drop off or pick up hotel guests when the hotels neither have taxi stands nor private driveways?</p>
              <p>The new rule troubles budget and boutique hotels in Chinatown as it may affect their businesses.</p>
              <p>The rule, which took effect on Mar 1, applies between 7am-10pm from Mondays to Saturdays, except on public holidays.</p>
              <p>Chinatown has several small hotels located in shophouses along roads such as Mosque Street, Temple Street and Smith Street.</p>
              <p>These hotels are concerned that if the rule is strictly enforced, their guests will have to walk from a taxi stand at either Eu Tong Sen Street or South Bridge Road with their luggage upon arrival in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Since cabbies will not stop outside their entrances, these guests will have to walk out to the designated stands to hail taxis for sightseeing.</p>
              <p>At the moment, however, hotels are still continuing to receive and send their guests off in cabs which stop at their main entrances.</p>
              <p>Five out of seven hotels my paper approached said they are still booking cabs for them.</p>
              <p>One hotel, however, said that its taxi booking system was disrupted when the rules kicked in.</p>
              <p>At the Inn at Temple Street, front desk officer P. Bascaran, 42, said that when he entered the hotel's code to the automated taxi booking system, it was rejected.</p>
              <p>"Guests have to walk out and find their own cabs. They have complained every single day. It's spoiling the hotel's image," he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Leslie Chua, 38, hotel manager of Berjaya Hotel Singapore on Duxton Road, said cabs are still stopping outside for bookings, but the pick-up is done in a matter of minutes.</p>
              <p>If the pick-up takes longer, the drivers stop at empty carpark lots at the roadside, so as not to hold up traffic.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Chua: "We can't possibly tell hotel guests to walk to the main road, 30 metres away. We would not be providing a very basic level of service."<br>Cabbies could be fined $100 and given three demerit points if they flouted the new rule.</p>
              <p>In spite of this, when my paper visited Chinatown last week, at least five taxis were spotted dropping off passengers along the side roads in Chinatown.</p>
              <p>Some taxi drivers say they will continue to drop off their guests in front of their hotels, especially if they have heavy luggage.</p>
              <p>Said cabby Amir Hamzah, 33: "I know it's a risk, but what if they have trouble walking? I can't bear to watch my passengers in difficulty."</p>
              <p>At press time, the Land Transport Authority was unable to say if it would exercise flexibility when it comes to hotels, or take action against them.</p>
