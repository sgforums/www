            <div class='col-md body'>An article in Straits Times today. Enforcement officers in plain clothes are out to catch errant drivers:<br><br>"ONE in 10 cabbies has been caught picking and choosing customers in the past six months and the problem has increased slightly, said Singapore's largest taxi operator, ComfortDelGro, without giving any figures, since it raised fares on Monday.<br>But they could be fined and even fired, it warned.<br><br>And so could cabbies who vanish minutes before the peak hours, wanting to pick up passengers only when the peak hour surcharges kick in, which have just been raised from $1 to $2.<br><br>ComfortDelGro said yesterday it will be stepping up spot checks to ensure its cabbies do not pick and choose customers or disappear minutes before the peak hour surcharges kick in.<br><br>Plainclothes enforcement officers will look out for errant cabbies, especially during the peak hours, between 7am and 9.30am on weekdays and 5pm and 8pm from Mondays to Saturdays.<br><br>First-time offenders will be warned. Further offences may result in demerit points or termination of hiring contracts.<br><br>ComfortDelGro spokesman Tammy Tan said the company's enforcement team of eight full-time staff had spot-checked some 1,700 cabbies in popular locations like Shenton Way or Suntec City in the past six months.<br><br>Ten per cent of the cabbies checked had tried to choose their customers and were immediately warned."<br><br>(Straits Times, 13 July)<br></div>
