                  No education type should go and specialise in something..take the plunge, car mechanics or even cooking at hawker is a good specialise job, as I said, you need to find the niche in yourself..i believe everyone of us have at least a good in us, not to mention those skill in chasing girl or drinking..we sure got some technical skill born in us.

              <p>Just like i feel the new rental of $130+ is mission impossible, but those "hero" helps to make it possible and created a waiting list for the rental, there will only be $140+ rental or more waiting to come.</p>
              <p>As of me, taking it as mission impossible, will only be projected as.....negative lar, lazy lar, can't catch up lar............... whatever bad you can think of.</p>

              Well, there are alway goons and heros on the society, that is why cab companies dare to raise rental prices, because they know there will be many Hammer out there, rich boy driving taxis, no care what rental, as long as new, can chiong, can overtake, can pick up,,can liao. 
              
              That is the true in this society..what about new merc..160++, long before, all said..si, bao si one..but still ah goons go take and ply without problem, or maybe have problem, but keep to themselves.
              
              Failure in TD is define as self destruction, trade like TD is a very much self creation, how you go and measure failure is very much up to individual, there are nearly 27,000 cabbies plying singapore road day in and out, and some even to JB, are they all failure??
              
              How you measure failure in life? no money means failure? earning less mean failure?? or that doing an honest living is also a failure?? or that you are not a MD or CEO or some big bosses is consider a failure??? think about it...and decide on how you want to measure it,..the way you compare, the way you envy others, the way you self hate yourself, the way you self denial yourself, the way you seek happiness in life play a major role in your definition of failure...it is not about grade A or B which we are so use to it since school day..it is about how to live happily and free
