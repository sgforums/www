              <p>Bro, actually u can counter the cpf portion.... That is to put a certain amount of $$ to buy some form of investment insurance... take it then as cpf contribution or saving lor...</p>
              <p>No prospect??? It really depends on how you look at it lor... R u telling me that those dipolma or degree holder have better prospect in working life.. I can tell you that it's not nescessary... Take me for an example, I'm a degree holder and holding an slightly above average salary job... but my prospect is actually waitning for someone "cheaper" taking over my job... FYI, I'm only mid 30s....</p>
              <p>Bro bowah had explain the health and social issue....</p>
              <p>My thoughts on this topic is that nobody owe anyone a living and that you do your best in whatever you choose... You may chose the unsuitable one, but at least you can tell yourself that you had tried your best and no regrets....</p>
              <p>I actually find TD quite interesting and had thoughts to convert to be fulltime TD when my car COE expires....</p>

              If you are a short term thinker, then TD is for you, if you are long term thinker, kindly refrain from driving taxis, because by 40s, you might look back with regret, your buddies would had become manager or enginneer earning 6k with all kind of benefits including medical claim for his or her family member. It is up to individual, however, what matter most  is, in life, there is a choice, everyone of us are in debt from the day we are born, to our parents and to our bills

              There is no right or wrong to drive taxis at whatever age, because taxis driving is one of the most honest way of making a living, if you are comfortable with TD, so be it, because one of the key to happiness is contention, once you are contented with what you are doing, that is fine.
              
              But when you start to compare and complain, discontent arises, and that is the period of unhappiness which you must overcome. Therefore, for taxi drivers, dun compare, dun complain too much, just do and forget, got money and time, go for some happy hours, no money and no time, drive along happily

              TD if discipline enough also can have cpf.
              ppl earn 1.2K and take home $960 with cpf contribution $432 as example.
              TD is monthly income says FOR EXAMPLE 2K, self auto lah put $432 into cpf monthly.
              
              Medical benefits ... I am now having a full time job with all the medical benefits...but I seldom see doctor. One year maybe see 1 or 2 times only.
              So how often you will claim this benefits ???
              
              As for annual leave, yes I have. As TD, if you are a hirer then be resourceful and go find a few super relief driver. You can then take vacation or take leave and rest.
              
              Everything is up to individual.

              <p>Ya lah no CPF no big deal. Just dump $20 everyday into a Milo tin one month $600 liao. No need put into CPF account. Use that to pay for your house.

              <p>Annual leave also no problem for me. My incentives every month covers 5 rental days and still have 4 free rental days. So one year I got 64 free rental days. Not enough? Lol</p>

              <p>So we just talking about 30s nia hor.....</p>
              <p>For male, 20s-30s is our prime time in life, in fact during the 30s, mostly will decide your fate and many things in life.....</p>
              <p>To be fair, I look it at 2 kind of situation.....</p>
              <p>1, single group, this group of people, knn don't need to care smlj la, "ho jiak ho koon".....</p>
              <p>2, married group, this group of people than headache lor, even they want to just think about themselves, but also cannot  ignored the feeling of their family members lor.....</p>
              <p>Some lowly educated TD like me, my family consider a å°�åº·å®¶åº­, my lau char bor also a si ah lian, we jiak si mi, my children jiak si mi lor.....</p>
              <p>So whether I becum a TD in 30s or becum a CEO in 30s, really don't make a lot of different lor.....</p>
              <p>As for those high educated TD, I can't speak on behalf for them, becos I never been in their shoe before, so really can't understand their feeling and thinking.....</p>
              <p>But in term of education, we definitely in different league, they are the cream crop, in Premier League, playing with top notch players, than suddenly ask them cum play 4th division, you think they can think a like like us? I don't think so.....</p>

              <p>If you are a diploma holder, go do what your diploma trained you to do.  Work hard and try to reach the top. Upgrade yourself along the way. Drive taxi part time if you like. If at 40 years old, you become tired liao or sick of corporate hypocrisy, then you can always become a TD. You lose nothing. </p>
              <p>But it can never be the other way around i.e. Start off as TD and then try to join corporate world to be CEO at 40 years old. You have lost that opportunity.</p>
              <p>That's the reality of life and there is an opportunity cost that cannot be recovered. But, if you are happy as a TD, then it's your choice and your life.  But, never regret that choice 20 years down the road.</p>
