              <p>Bro, you are brave to go back to hotel line. Many TDs after driving get stuck in the job. Agree that the learning curve is steep, especially for those not familiar with the roads.  That's why those who get the TDVL should drive part time, at least once a week. Then take opportunity to gain experience, take current and advance bookings, CBD, go queue at airport T1, T2, T3, gardens by the bay, marina cruise centre, Expo etc. Go anywhere pax wants to go. You have the comfort of a full time job to cushion any loss. </p>
              <p>If you get retrenched, you are more prepared to become a full time TD.  But if kena retrenched during a general economic downturn, everything including TD also tough lah...</p>

              I choose not to believe because of our past situation tell us not to believe. But the way of employment is mandatorily, going to change, that will push the employers to further, because it is going to be mandatory, 
              Last time, govt tell employers to employ locals first, prove that you cannot employ, then we allow you permit to employ foreigners, so the employers play around with the interviews and claim that they had advertised, but no singaporean came, and those who came, asked for very high pay.
              
              Coming july, govt is saying, if you prove that you cannot get singaporean, I get it for you.

              <p>Bro bowah, I believe you are mistaken.</p>
              <p>1. The national job bank starts Aug 2014.</p>
              <p>2. It is only for EP holders up to a monthly salary of $12,000.  It does not apply to WP and S pass holders and those positions paying more than $12,000. In the longer term, perhaps it will open to all work categories.</p>
              <p>3. Most TDs educational qualifications belong to the WP and S pass categories, so there will not be a sudden mass exodus of TDs from the profession for now.</p>
              <p>4.  It is true that employers must advertise in MOM's website for 14 days.  But, there is no way the government can arm twist and force employers into accepting Singaporeans if they cannot find one.  That is discriminatory and against the fair employment practice that they are advocating.</p>

              Good! there is never a lost in taking one skill more, it just like an extra tool. 
              
              Many TDs had in a way too long in taxi driving which in a way, had refrained them from joining back the workforce and learn new skill. 
              
              As such, as time passed, they prefer to stick on to their comfort zone. We can alway step out of TD and be someone, whether we make it or not, we can alway return to taxi driving, what important is that we gain experience and knowledge and at the same time, new skill that can come to good use in future.
              
              Just like a tool box, add in on more allen key is good, if needed, it become gold.

              back your pardon bowah..slight error there..the quay crane operator or yard operator is not 24hrs job...its either 8hrs or 12hrs on 3 or 2 rotating shifts work...they also have container rate incentives. You are right though about doing your own private business while operating the crane and nature calls..not all water drops from above in the PSA terminals are air-con water or rain water...lols. Most of them go behind the crane above and do it. The tower crane in the construction sites...what I heard is almost a 24hrs job.

              <p><br>STA now shifted to Kim Yan road liao..Queue so long arh?  Either because COE so high, many ppl want to use taxi as private vehicle or the perception of TD is changing...</p>
              <p>Crane operators (tower cranes/crawler cranes) can earn $3k to $5k every month easy easy.  Good months, some can hit $7K or more. Average age of crane operators now around 55+.</p>
              <p>As long as the gahmen don't substitute blue collar work with cheap FT, you will see the salary increasing for these people, more than many white collar work. </p>
