              <p>Yes, why coy sent them for crane operator course? Becos to lease a team of mobile crane operators (they work in team) is not cheap.....</p>
              <p>From 50ton-500ton or more, it cum with different prices.....</p>
              <p>And this team of mobile crane operators work separately within the job site, they still fall under the charge of mobile crane suppliers becos this mobile crane suppliers are their pay master.....</p>
              <p>So in the job site, very frequent you will see crane operators only sit inside the crane, if don't required them to lift things, they will just sit inside the cabin and read newspaper, they won't help up others in the job site 1, si beh ya ya 1.....</p>
              <p>So if possible, the main con will sent their staff to attend those courses, but also provided they have the crane hor......</p>
              <p>Some big main con got the abilitity to purchase crane and move from site to site becos they got many project in hand, but they can't probably purchase cranes from 50ton to 500ton.....</p>
              <p>So most time, even they have qualify crane operators, they still lan lan must lease from those crane supplier, becos they don't have enough cranes mah.....</p>
              <p>And these suppliers si beh smart, they only lease out cranes cum with a team, so even you just want to lease a crane alone, sorry, bo kang dao.....</p>

                  Cheap manager mah, bangala and india managers are earning much less than a typical taxi driver, because company exploited them in to working more for less, we called them cheap manager/labour.  Company knows all these people like names and position over money, unlike locals and PRC, we are more down to earth, money more important, dun give me the shit on bogus title.

              It is a cut throat business out there, tiong woon also got rent out their space for building oil rig platform, I use to go there as contractor, quotation wise for crane, tiong woon, like our cdg, is the big brother, their quote is reasonable, safety record and quality of work is good, a typical crane 1/2 day (4hrs) minimum, already can cost you 5 to 8k.

              NOt only hotel industrial lah, all industrial also got at least 70% foreigners, locals are mostly outcasted to become TD, Casket driver, lorry driver, private limo driver and so on, like it or not, we cannot change the situation unless something dramatic change in 2016.
              
              So, in the meantime, dun go and curse and swear on it, it only deeper yr sorrow and morale with no ending, think what you can gain from it, how to find a niche in a majority foreigner workforce, then wait for 2016, by then, you should know what to do?
              
              The truth is most of us are in our middle age, and as govt said, they are not going to close the door for foreigners, they are still coming, but lesser only, there are still new PRs, new S pass, new E passes and so on, and the worry part is our childrens, they migh suffer more than us.
