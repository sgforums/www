A sign there says: 'No touting, 24-hour camera surveillance...'. Right in front of the taxi stand were two limousine taxis whose drivers stood outside smoking. Farther down were several other taxis with their drivers standing outside.<br><br>I was wondering why they did not pick up passengers from the taxi stand. A few minutes later, a taxi driver came to ask a Bangladeshi man where he was headed. The taxi driver then yelled to another driver in Hokkien: '$12 to Mustafa, want or not?' The second taxi driver agreed and the man followed him to the taxi and was driven away.<br><br>I tried calling Premier Taxi to book a cab but to no avail. Ironically, I saw many vacant Premier taxis passing by. No driver turned into the taxi stand. Those passengers who managed to get a taxi at the taxi stand did so only because the taxis came in to drop off passengers.<br><br>What is touting? What is the 24-hour camera surveillance for? What is a taxi stand for?<br><br>Most of the people at the taxi stand were foreigners. What will they think of our country?<br><br>Lee En (Ms)</div>

STOMPer Jack thinks so.<br><br>He was at Clarke Quay on Sunday (24 June) at 10.30pm when he came across some Mercedes taxi drivers who appeared to be showing they have favourites.<br><br>According to him, there was a long queue of people waiting at the taxi stand, but just one or two taxis came in to pick up passengers.<br><br>What peeved him was that there were some empty white and silver Mercedes taxis waiting down the road beyond the taxi stand. Jack is convinced they were waiting for tourists.<br><br>He suggested that taxi companies conduct spot checks on the Clarke Quay taxi stand regularly to stop these cab drivers from choosing their customers.<br><br>"This is giving Singapore a BAD reputation in TAXI services!" he warns.</div>

Instead, they target the foreigners and this leaves such a bad impression of Singapore for tourists!"<br><br>Alvin says that he has seen these touts around before and while this group of taxi touts seemed to be merely Â‘looking and waitingÂ’, the taxi touts that Alvin has encountered previously on several occasions were more aggressive.<br><br>"The taxis did not have 'hired' or 'on-call' signs, the touts were approaching any group of foreigners they saw!"<br><br>Alvin wonders why these taxi touts continue to exist even when "everyone knows about them."<br><br>"Why is it that the relevant authorities, such as the LTA and Traffic Police as well as taxi companies do not take steps or a preventive measure against such taxi touts?"<br></div>
