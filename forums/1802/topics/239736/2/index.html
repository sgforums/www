A sign there says: 'No touting, 24-hour camera surveillance...'. Right in front of the taxi stand were two limousine taxis whose drivers stood outside smoking. Farther down were several other taxis with their drivers standing outside.<br><br>I was wondering why they did not pick up passengers from the taxi stand. A few minutes later, a taxi driver came to ask a Bangladeshi man where he was headed. The taxi driver then yelled to another driver in Hokkien: '$12 to Mustafa, want or not?' The second taxi driver agreed and the man followed him to the taxi and was driven away.<br><br>I tried calling Premier Taxi to book a cab but to no avail. Ironically, I saw many vacant Premier taxis passing by. No driver turned into the taxi stand. Those passengers who managed to get a taxi at the taxi stand did so only because the taxis came in to drop off passengers.<br><br>What is touting? What is the 24-hour camera surveillance for? What is a taxi stand for?<br><br>Most of the people at the taxi stand were foreigners. What will they think of our country?<br><br>Lee En (Ms)</div>

STOMPer Jack thinks so.<br><br>He was at Clarke Quay on Sunday (24 June) at 10.30pm when he came across some Mercedes taxi drivers who appeared to be showing they have favourites.<br><br>According to him, there was a long queue of people waiting at the taxi stand, but just one or two taxis came in to pick up passengers.<br><br>What peeved him was that there were some empty white and silver Mercedes taxis waiting down the road beyond the taxi stand. Jack is convinced they were waiting for tourists.<br><br>He suggested that taxi companies conduct spot checks on the Clarke Quay taxi stand regularly to stop these cab drivers from choosing their customers.<br><br>"This is giving Singapore a BAD reputation in TAXI services!" he warns.</div>

Instead, they target the foreigners and this leaves such a bad impression of Singapore for tourists!"<br><br>Alvin says that he has seen these touts around before and while this group of taxi touts seemed to be merely Ã‚â€˜looking and waitingÃ‚â€™, the taxi touts that Alvin has encountered previously on several occasions were more aggressive.<br><br>"The taxis did not have 'hired' or 'on-call' signs, the touts were approaching any group of foreigners they saw!"<br><br>Alvin wonders why these taxi touts continue to exist even when "everyone knows about them."<br><br>"Why is it that the relevant authorities, such as the LTA and Traffic Police as well as taxi companies do not take steps or a preventive measure against such taxi touts?"<br></div>
