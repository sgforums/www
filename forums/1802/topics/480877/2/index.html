              aiya, singapore TD not big cannon fairy type, cannot qualify himself as singapore TD leh.
              
              today with cam, facebook and many other social media, want to expose someone is damn easy lah, just a matter of want or not, even if you said, I will not do it, who knows? tio bo?
              
              So dun give the crab and peppers about whether to expose, report or complain, its all in each individual mind.
              
              With it, whatever you do outside, drive carefully, even want to find bak bak, also must be careful, now even watches also got camera and video..knn. Limpek must wear caps on both heads liao. 
              
              And as we all know such are the consequences, we must therefore learn to adapt, becareful and wary. The public, especially private car/bus/truck and many other drivers are actually damn tulan TD one leh, then gum gum this taxi driver go and do the wrong, you think all this car owner is going to let you go??? blackvure not cheap leh

              <p>I dunno but I find it hypocritical. On the 1 hand you wanna complain him and teach him a lesson, yet on the other you give $10 and keep the change. </p>
              <p>Why keep the change? After all you're upset with his method of cheating.</p>
              <p>I'm saying right or wrong, but I think this would hv been better&gt;</p>
              <p>1) Fuck him and tell him hello $1 also you want to cheat? I gonna rept you</p>
              <p>2) Take your correct change back after getting the receipt, get that $1 back, f him again say I always give tips but don't like to be cheated into giving tips. Inform him you will report.</p>
              <p>3) Just pay the stipulated fare and complain, you can inform him if want to or f him, or if dont want also can.</p>
              <p>4) Just f him upside down and rept to SMRT in writing.</p>
              <p>I kena 1x before, just pointed out the error - he typed loc surcharge $1. He returned it back. Had he made some issue or deny, I would rept, but in that case I gv him the benefit of the doubt.</p>
              <p>I dunno but my personal observation is this:</p>
              <p>I think you've been trained in such a way by someone that consider themselves some kind of taxi superior or supervisor on the road. Any mistake or wrong by another TD must be reported and made an issue out.</p>
              <p>Dont mistake me, I am not saying this TD doesn't deserve some kind of punishment, be it a farking, a complaint to his company or an LTA rept. But what I'm saying is the public doesn't have a high regard for TD and are quick to complain and curse TD. The last thing another TD should do is shame a TD publicly. If wanna rept report quietly. This kind of thing doesn't make the taxi driver reputation better in the public eyes.</p>
              <p>And I also don't buy into a policy of the need to educate other TDs by highlighting it. There will always be a tiny minority that will flout the rules and even overcharge, not just now but also in future. Even some future rule breakers haven't yet started driving, but they will break when they join later. It's nothing to do with being a TD but human behaviour. If a person is dishonest, he'll be dishonest whether a TD or not.</p>
              <p>Dishonesty doesn't have to be directly overcharging, it could be going a longer route, pick and choosing during busy time in the hope you'll get someone who's desperate and will offer more. The last is not directly dishonest or even a rule break, but it shows the attitude or moral compass of the receipient.</p>
              <p>I am not saying you did wrong in reporting, but I think the manner you went about it, gives me the impression that you seem to take some pleasure in doing so. But that's my view and I'm not here to force my view on yours.</p>

              Lanjiao lah, most locals pax like to keep quiet, then slowly go complain companies and LTA, because the rules allow them these channel to voice their displeasure, and that on the other hand, you also cannot blame them, most pax see TD like me or hammer face and sizes, all also scare liao, dun want to create a scene, scare later TD qi siao whack them.
              
              So they keep it in their mind, then later complain lor, but some paxs will straighten it out on the spot, and when TD raise their voice, pax might whack TD, like one case happened not long ago..lols

              As for pax waving and before boarding, TD already pressed the meter, we got complaints from pax, but not much. 
              
              The penalty is 1st warning follow by sacking if happen again. 
              
              However, there is one kind of immediate sacking whereby, TD pressed meter, pax then come on board, taxi driver reject the destination, pax said TD already press meter, meaning accepted, so TD lan lan gets terminated.

              I am referring to TD that press meter when pax have not board the taxi.
              If I listen correctly to my lecturer during taxi course in redhill, it is illegal for TD to press meter "BEFORE" pax says destination. It is in a rule from LTA guidelines.
              
              As an example, if you say TD will get terminated if after pressing meter n then refused pax.
              How about this situation when TD already press meter before pax says destination and can pax says destination is JB...:p Can TD reject since that taxi is not licenced to travel to Malaysia.

              I am referring to TD that press meter when pax have not board the
              taxi. If I listen correctly to my lecturer during taxi course in
              redhill, it is illegal for TD to press meter "BEFORE" pax says
              destination. It is in a rule from LTA guidelines. As an example, if
              you say TD will get terminated if after pressing meter n then
              refused pax. How about this situation when TD already press meter
              before pax says destination and can pax says destination is JB...:p
              Can TD reject since that taxi is not licenced to travel to
              Malaysia.</p>
