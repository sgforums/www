              <p>Not true lah....I often go without taking calls for 5 times also continued getting calls....</p>
              <p>Maybe would be placed on lower priority when there are many cabbies in the vicinity (say got 3 taxis in the area but you have not be taking the past few calls, then the other 2 taxis would be offered even though you are nearer).</p>
              <p>I don't usually take calls that are too far away as I have experienced before customers cancelling the call before I could arrive there.  I often also avoid areas that are in the opposite direction or have a very unknown address to me.</p>
              <p>If they penalize taxi drivers based on the priority scheme, then the overall response time is longer.</p>
              <p>The system is that way such that it is win-win situation.  If the taxi driver does not make the additional call booking money (only $2.30 or $3.30, not the taxi trip money), the call center also does not make.  When they make enough for the year, they would give cabbies some levy-free calls.</p>
              <p>Very often we could receive more than 3 calls while waiting at the taxi stand so it is stupid to penalize taxi drivers for that.   We pay $35,000 to $65,000 (including rental GST) for rental every year and have the full rights to attend to street hail customers if we think it is in our best interests.</p>

              <p>Yes we all know it is computerised....but the program algorithms could be changed anytime.</p>
              <p>What I am saying is street hail customers are also customers.  The only difference is they do not pay the additional $2.30 or $3.30 surcharge.</p>
              <p>The current situation is such that taxi drivers are Comfort's customers.   Taxi customers are taxi drivers customers.   But call-book customers are also Comfort's customers.</p>
              <p>From a money politics stand-point, a call-book customer only provides comfort with a max of $0.80 per day wheras we pay Comfort at least $100 per day for rental (and additional at least $7 to government for GST).  If you look at Comfort's annual reports, you would find that the most lucrative division of Comfort is the taxi business and the bulk of it comes from taxi renting to self-employed taxi drivers (and not from the call-booking division unlike that of Grab organization).  It works out because most of the business-minded taxi drivers work super-long hours every week (a lot more than the 44 hours per week that employees work) and all the taxi-drivers continue to pay rents even on Sunday, public holidays and other days like sick days and holidays (even when we go on holidays, we have to reduce the rents to find super-reliefs and effectively making a loss while Comfort continues to make in full amount).</p>
              <p>As per agreement, we only have to take 2-3 call-booking customers per day to support the call-booking division.  Many night-shift drivers do not even take a single call-booking as there are hardly any calls at night.  So when some taxi drivers do not take the calls, other taxi drivers benefit more.  So at the end of the year, the 30 million objective is met so no one in the call center gets retrenched, the company also makes from call-booking business and therefore offers levy-free call-books to taxi drivers.</p>

              <p>Bro NT, your theory sound right and also sound wrong to me.......</p>
              <p>Cablink survive by its own, nothing to do with the rental you pay. So if you are a prompt rental drivers or a chow kar drivers, the call volume to each driver still the same......</p>

              Cdg under their financial report always reflect a provision of bad debt of 5millions, therefore 3 millions is actually within a good budget for them.
                  
              Meaning, every year, cdg, in anticipating the bad debt, they provide a write off of 5 millions off their profits.

              If we focus on the chow kar, which is always there in any organization, not only Cdg, we might be losing out on the ho kar. With a net profit declaration of $300++ millions in 2015, why not reward  the ho kar who are loyal and discipline to Cdg, this will encourage pple to join them and built a better business environment.

              <p>By right should be TD no problem paying rental promptly one except for newbie OMO type and just lost at casino type.   So a few days grace should be reasonable.   </p>
              <p>Even CNY time they third day then started collecting.  Most Chinese TDs that I had spoken too all also worked on CNY to collect just enough for rental and fuel so most cash flow also no problem.</p>
              <p>Even if so suay went casino and lost (capped at amount of cash on hand and $2000 in bank account) also would be up by at least 2 digits before reaching home.</p>
              <p>So where is the problem?</p>

              <p>Ai Ya, most taxi drivers even if got go casino also do not play so big until must settle at East Coast.   If play until so big must sell HDB flat then should visit <span style="color: #545454; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 14.56px;">National Council for </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6a6a6a; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 14.56px;">Problem Gambling .</span></p>
              <p>So if feel must have some excitment since taxi driving is so boring then only should bring in only cash that one can afford to lose (or call it max one willing to pay for casino thrill for one day), make sure taxi closed to full tank before entering, cash card got at least $26+maybe $10 and leave some small change in the taxi so that come if lose all at casino at least can immediately make.  Best is ATM card also leave at home (to ensure one would not lose additional $2000 if one's luck is really that bad that day).</p>
              <p>Are you sure many TDs living on day to day fares collection only?  I can only think of having to pay high medical bills (for ownself or folks) as cannot manage expenditure.  Food and drinks max at $10 per 12 hours session.   Slightly more than 1 year ago, many days I only spend $3 for food per 12-hour session.  I already hit slightly more than $100 per day on day 2 (when fuel prices were much higher) and did not even depend on GPS.  One personnel from Comfort also told TDs to be when they were attending the taxi course anyone who could not hit $100 per day could go and see him for help.</p>

              To be frank, people who come into taxi driving are mostly cannot make it outside, or just like me, lazy time, easily contended and simple type or those high pride and ego type, earn $100 per day declare $300 net. 
              
              So, most of them have a simple mind, easily get conned into gambling, womanizing and drinking, the 3 evils of human. To the public, TDs are part of a cannot make in life people, and I accept that, at least it is more and better than those earning millions with an dishonest mind and a cheating mouth that exploit others for the purpose of his gain.
