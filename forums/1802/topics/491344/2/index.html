              <p>Got cover entire range .... I also said it is for those who could not get a better job.</p>
              <p>The fact remains, 80% of taxi drivers are 50 or above.   I below 50 also got promoted to "uncle" status ( even Ah So calls me uncle ) as customers are so used to addressing taxi drivers as uncles.</p>
              <p>Comfort, Transcab and SMRT still got a lot of unrented taxis and many hirers are also looking for reliefs so do not worry about not enough jobs for you guys.   A lot of companies also looking for Class-4 and Class-5 drivers and it is relatively cheap to get a Class-4/5 license compared to what it cost to get a Class-3 license.   Many companies also willing to employ below 45 drivers especially those who were MT Line drivers when serving National Service.   Those young type who got to supervisor or manager levels do not like older employees because it is like ordering their father or uncles to do this and that and therefore like to employ younger employees.   It is like in SAF 2LTs don't like to ask WOs to do things but like to ask CPLs or below to do things and WOs do not like to go under 2LTs or LTAs but prefer to go under older CPTs, MAJs and LTCs.</p>

              could not get a better job.</p>
              <p>The fact remains, 80% of taxi drivers are 50 or above.   I
              below 50 also got promoted to "uncle" status ( even Ah So calls me
              uncle ) as customers are so used to addressing taxi drivers as
              uncles.</p>
              <p>Comfort, Transcab and SMRT still got a lot of unrented taxis and
              many hirers are also looking for reliefs so do not worry about not
              enough jobs for you guys.   A lot of companies also looking
              for Class-4 and Class-5 drivers and it is relatively cheap to get a
              Class-4/5 license compared to what it cost to get a Class-3
              license.   Many companies also willing to employ below 45
              drivers especially those who were MT Line drivers when serving
              National Service.   Those young type who got to supervisor or
              manager levels do not like older employees because it is like
              ordering their father or uncles to do this and that and therefore
              like to employ younger employees.   It is like in SAF 2LTs
              don't like to ask WOs to do things but like to ask CPLs or below to
              do things and WOs do not like to go under 2LTs or LTAs but prefer
              to go under older CPTs, MAJs and LTCs.</p>

              <p>TD not capped at O Levels.... Requirements if I believe is at least D7 at O levels English (same as Poly entry requirements except Poly at lease 3 O levels passes and at least D7 in English, there are very successful people who used to fail English at O-levels in the old days [then whole Singapore O-Level English passing rate below 40%]).</p>
              <p>At least O levels requirements jobs many including SAF Officiers (old days SSGs can crossover to CPT position), Singapore Presidential Candidate, CEO of organization with assets higher than 10 billion.</p>
              <p>Like pilot position says at least A levels but higher than A levels also can do.</p>
              <p>Like air stewardess's position at least O levels but A levels and degree holders also can apply.</p>
              <p>Like Manager's position at least O levels but A levels, poly and degree holders also can apply.</p>
              <p>So TD not only for O levels people but also for above O levels.</p>

              Aiyo...taxi driving is for interim purpose.
              In sg u need $$$ if you suddenly lost income n drive taxi can fill the interim gap.

              Reserved for o levels n below is a saying in the past.
              Times bad a lot of car owners now moonlight as uber driver. If got no pte car then moonlight as TD. I hope govt can ensure TD reserve 4 Singaporeans. The current climate force many educated Singaporeans to drive for a living. No choice lah...u used to earn 5k as an executive but now being offered a 2.5k salary. So taxi driving fill the gap...4k a month is sup sup water.

              <p>Aiya we actually do not received 4 a month salary if you pro-rate to employee salaries.   After factoring in loss of 17% CPF, loss of 1 months holiday, loss of 3 months bonus and longer than 8.8 hours per day, we are more or less like people earning $2.5K too.   Only difference is we have better cash-flow since less money goes into CPF accounts (only medisave).</p>

              Hello smlj 17% CPF loss? 17% is employer's contribution lah, lan Jiao taxi companies got contribute for taxi drivers or not??? Every month, employee contribution 20% up to 55 yo, companies 17%, total 37%, so let said your paid is 4k, $800+$680=$1480 goes into your CPF account and then spread out to Medisave, SA and OA. 
              
              All being constant, in a year, you get  $17760 with 13 month AWS and agar agar 2 month bonus if it is roughly around 20k per year, in 10 years, it will be $200,000..the rest you go figure it out, and CPF saving is at 2.5 to 4% interest. 
              
              So many who reached 55yo and get money to cash out, still opts for staying put till 62 or 65yo, and some even want to put money inside, but reached limitation.
              
              And it is because TD hv a better cash flow, many end up with no saving, therefore, self discipline in taxi driving is very important, not to mention employer's contribution of 17% of your paid. So, if you are earning 4k per month as a taxi driver, and if you can save $1480, that will be fine for you. But I cannot leh.

              <p>TD not capped at O Levels.... Requirements if I believe is at
              least D7 at O levels English (same as Poly entry requirements
              except Poly at lease 3 O levels passes and at least D7 in English,
              there are very successful people who used to fail English at
              O-levels in the old days [then whole Singapore O-Level English
              passing rate below 40%]).</p>
              <p>At least O levels requirements jobs many including SAF Officiers
              (old days SSGs can crossover to CPT position), Singapore
              Presidential Candidate, CEO of organization with assets higher than
              10 billion.</p>
              <p>Like pilot position says at least A levels but higher than A
              levels also can do.</p>
              <p>Like air stewardess's position at least O levels but A levels
              and degree holders also can apply.</p>
              <p>Like Manager's position at least O levels but A levels, poly and
              degree holders also can apply.</p>
              <p>So TD not only for O levels people but also for above O
              levels.</p>

              <p>This is way beside my point.......</p>
              <p>At least in Air Stewardess position, if you are there, they face the same problem as our TD and maybe worst than us, still got competition from foreign influential also.......</p>

              I agree with bowah.
              4k as TD is definitely better than a 2.5k job.
              But TD needs to make the effort to save.
              I would suggest putting money into cpf monthly due to the higher interest.
