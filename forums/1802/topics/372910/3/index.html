              <p>The Fact is Singapore government think they can solved problems by throwing money at external talent.  Singapore is <strong>basically everywhere in bio genetics research but not exactly anywhere.</strong></p>
              <p>They rely excessively on FT and un willing to invest and cultivate locals for long term research.  They import a few Big names to do marketing and call it a research Hub....and <strong>import the rest of researchers base on academic credential and nationalities because they were CHEAP..... Without fully comprehend the scope of their research.   </strong></p>
              <p>A Geninue stem cell Talent researcher would not end up doing Taxi driving.....They would find research posting globally or Teaching jobs. The reality, it is possible that our researcher became a TAXI driver he is probably ended his biology research field.</p>

              <p>Singapore, with its well-educated, English-speaking population, has long been thought of as a potential Asian hub of biotech research and business. Up till now, many of the top tier scientists leading the biotech effort in the country have been recruited from overseas, including British scientist Alan Colman who was a member of the team that cloned Dolly the sheep.</p>
              <p>Now <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSIN110794"><span style="color: #005ebf;">Alan Colman is leaving Singapore</span></a> for King’s College London following the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSIN110794"><span style="color: #005ebf;">departure of molecular and cell biologists David and Birgitte Lane</span></a> for Scotland’s University of Dundee. Dr. Colman was executive director of the Singapore Stem Cell Consortium. Last year, the World Bank gave Singapore a 50-50 chance of success in the biomedical arena because of an overreliance on “footloose” star researchers rather than local scientists</p>

              <p>I try my best to avoid targetting the poster and focus more on the content. I regard that as common courtesy, and i appreciate if the same courtesy can be returned.</p>
              <p>Yes, my use of rejects is harsh. But i got that opinion from my time working in the gaming industry and my friends in the animation industry. The government drags its feet on giving funding and sponsorship to local companies and yet are so eager to toss big money to Lucas and Ubisoft.   </p>
              <p>It's just like Nickson Fong being constantly promoted by the government that he could lead the animation industry in Singapore because he "worked on the Matrix Trilogy", then it was discovered his name wasn't even in the credits.</p>
              <p>And yes, my comments were emotional rather than being objective but i would explain my reasoning. Major scientific researches and discoveries these days are rarely conducted on an individual basis, hiring a member from a team that made a major discovery does not mean that person is capable of leading a team to make another major discovery.</p>
              <p> Reject was a poor choice of words, but i don't feel i'm wrong if i said they were rejects for leadership positions in their own country.</p>

              <p>While it is true the margin for error is rather narrow in Singapore. But to say that after attaining a PHD and research experiences not able to take up a post in other university needs to read between the line.  </p>

              <p>4 points to make...</p>
              <p>Who knows what Singapore govt promise to these 3 pioneer cloning researchers. But we know embryonic stem cell research were controvsal at that time. Including the fear of cloning human. But Singapore took the position and hire these folks. I don't think they were rejected for their leadership in their own country but because it was a controvesal research. But they were recognized for their result. Singapore would not hire someone who have not shown result prior hand.  </p>
              <p>To note: The US has ban Stem cell embryonic research until recently the ban was repealed by current President. Stem cell researcher could not do what they wanted.</p>
              <p>Research is a risky investment...Korean Epsiode has further demonstrated that you can't really put competition and expectation into it. Because as the term "Re-search" You are Seeking for Answer. So ultimately do you really know what you get...Not Really.  So is it a structure methological research for answer? The pretext culture of understanding research and its expectation before judging base on organization structure. It takes an average of 8 years to mold a microbiology PHD Researcher U think it is easy to come by with MBA skill?  </p>
              <p>thought you should know Govt was willing to toss out 30K to 40K for anybody to proposed animation Industry in Singapore. with no precondition so long as the idea was feasible. I assume they were hopping that amount of money to start from someone bedroom. Have no idea how successful that idea were?  </p>
              <p>I once post that question to "your"  Communication minister about cultivating research in Singapore all he said was simply giving incentives.........like many other problems in SG. Throwing money. Expect result. Problems solved.</p>
