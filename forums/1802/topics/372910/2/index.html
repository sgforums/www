              </h2>
              <p>Singapore, with its well-educated, English-speaking population, has long been thought of as a potential Asian hub of biotech research and business. Up till now, many of the top tier scientists leading the biotech effort in the country have been recruited from overseas, including British scientist Alan Colman who was a member of the team that cloned Dolly the sheep.</p>
              <p>Now <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSIN110794"><span style="color: #005ebf;">Alan Colman is leaving Singapore</span></a> for King’s College London following the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSIN110794"><span style="color: #005ebf;">departure of molecular and cell biologists David and Birgitte Lane</span></a> for Scotland’s University of Dundee. Dr. Colman was executive director of the Singapore Stem Cell Consortium. Last year, the World Bank gave Singapore a 50-50 chance of success in the biomedical arena because of an overreliance on “footloose” star researchers rather than local scientists.</p>

              <p>The Fact is Singapore government think they can solved problems by throwing money at external talent.  Singapore is<strong> basically everywhere in bio genetics research but not exactly anywhere. </strong></p>
              <p>They rely excessively on FT and un willing to invest and cultivate locals for long term research.  They import a few Big names to do marketing and call it a research Hub....and <strong>import the rest of researchers base on academic credential and nationalities because they were CHEAP..... Without fully comprehend the scope of their research.   </strong></p>
              <p>A Geninue stem cell Talent researcher would not end up doing Taxi driving.....They would find research posting globally or Teaching jobs. The reality, it is possible that our researcher became a TAXI driver he is probably ended his biology research field.</p>

              <p>China open is gate in the 90s, just about 20 years ago, you dun expect them to produce quality and trusworthy stuff just yet, but slowly they will learn and slowly they will excel, all in a fast pace..just in another 20 years times, we may have to go china and find jobs. Afterall, we took 50 years to be here, they are just a teenager, we are already a old man ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The korean cars and electronic firms was the worst in the 70, 80s and early 90s, those who bought it will be laughed at,,..but look at it now. Hyundai, LG, Samsung etc etc and even their drama and movies are making more than the japanese. The Chinese had the same kind of entreprenuerships as the korean and jap, all have ambitious and greed to gain, however, the chinese are just doing it the wrong and unethical way, they should get punished, it is a huge country to control all, but as times goes by, the peoples there get more afluent and educated, you will see the differences.</p>
