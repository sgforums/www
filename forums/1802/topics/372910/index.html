              <p>Dr Cai Ming Jie became an SMRT cabby last November after spending 16 years as a researcher at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star).<br><br>His career switch has become a talking point online after he started a blog earlier this year. Alongside his experiences as a cabby, he takes issue with the circumstances of his departure from IMCB last May.<br><br>An SMRT spokesman confirmed that the former researcher is a driver with SMRT Taxis, but Dr Cai declined to add more beyond this: 'All that needs to be said is on the blog online...It should be IMCB that needs to be asked questions, if any.'<br><br>The China-born Dr Cai, who became a Singapore citizen, obtained a PhD in molecular biology from Stanford University in 1990. The Straits Times learnt that he did a two-year postdoctoral fellowship after leaving Stanford at the University of Washington, under famed genetist Professor Lee Hartwell, who won a 2001 Nobel Prize in physiology.<br><br>He joined IMCB two years later and worked as a principal investigator in the field of cell genetics up till his departure.<br><br>A spokesman for A*Star, meanwhile, said renewal of all its researchers' contracts is based on a number of factors, including the time taken to train PhD students, their performance and their contributions to the research institutes and the agency in general.<br><br>Dr Cai's work, like that of all A*Star researchers, was assessed by an external Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), which recommended his contract be terminated. <br><br>Still, in spite of the submission of countless curriculum vitaes and applications to universities, government agencies and companies since he was told he would be let go in 2007, Dr Cai failed to get a successful response.<br><br>The former researcher now drives a four-year -old Toyota Crown. 'At a time like this, the taxi business is probably the only business in Singapore that still actively recruits people,' he said.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Read about his interesting blog here:   <a href="http://taxidiary.blogspot.com/">http://taxidiary.blogspot.com/</a></p>

              <p>Calling all China Chinese in Singapore, do not become Singapore citizens, earn your money in sg and go back.   YOur China govt take better care of the nation compare to our PAP govt in singapore.   Your china govt give pension, our PAP govt refuse givee pension but force us to buy our own  "pension".    YOur china govt does not impose GST on purchase, our PAP govt implemented GST and keep increasing the rate.   Our govt does not provide free travel on public transport for the senior, but in China the govt provide free travel on public transport for senior citizens age 70 and above.</p>
              <p>So China Chinese, please be wise!  </p>

              <p>China born turned singapore citizen.   Mr Cai, you made the wrong move to become singapore citizen, this is the consequence you face.</p>
              <p>Calling all China Chinese in Singapore, do not become Singapore citizens, earn your money in sg and go back.   YOur China govt take better care of the nation compare to our PAP govt in singapore.   Your china govt give pension, our PAP govt refuse givee pension but force us to buy our own  "pension".    YOur china govt does not impose GST on purchase, our PAP govt implemented GST and keep increasing the rate.   Our govt does not provide free travel on public transport for the senior, but in China the govt provide free travel on public transport for senior citizens age 70 and above.</p>
              <p>So China Chinese, please be wise!  </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>From an extract from the link I posted:-<br><br><span>"So why is Dr. Cai having trouble finding another R&amp;D job? The R&amp;D market isn’t so hot these days. The bad economy means not many firms are hiring professional scientists. <strong>Academia isn’t much of a help – there’s a long history of too many PhDs chasing too few jobs.</strong> It doesn’t help that many people get a feeling for rampant ageism in the R&amp;D job market too. Dr. Cai, having received his PhD in 1990 or so, is probably in his mid-forties by now, which in any industry is a particularly challenging time to find work."<br><br>In my line of work, people like Dr Cai is one of many I have encountered. With influx of PHDs, MBBS, Master from India, China and the region coming here to do research, the term of employment is always in favour of A*star.  </span></p></div>
