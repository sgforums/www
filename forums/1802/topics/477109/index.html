              <p>Kudos to you Bro, you went to help a TD in distressed..just that is false alarm.</p>
              <p>Actually why can all taxi companies MDT be linked on the distressed call? Wouldn't it be more effective than to have only respective companies TD helping only own company TD?</p>
              <p>Imagine if 1 (any company) TD press button and within mins all different companies of TD came to his aid.. confirmed better than waiting for S?F, right?</p>

              True, I got a few, but only once in sengkang I personally called the ambalance, the driver completely cannot move, like a mummy, stroke...then later white foam also come out, I only lower the seat in lying position, MDT on advance call.
              
              Then my phone rang, cdg called me, I told them to cancel advance and look for others, then tell them the situation, cdg will tell all others cabbies whom they paged to stand down once they know the situation.

              That was also raised when they wanted for a one call centres, but it will be messy in term of who is going to take the most cost, who is responsible, who provide the MDT, who provide the operator, which companies will be allocated more calls and so on...knn, talk until want to fight..transcab executives are the first one to walk away yelling not fair.
              
              So, I think the best, in term of safety and health, we ourselve be the catalyst of it instead of waiting for these farkers to decide, because whatever they decide on, $$ will be more in concern than life. We therefore must take care of our health, be alert to any changes, before and after driving conditon, rest enough, drink enough, shit enough, sex enough, exercise, take care of our diet, better not to smoke, but if smoking, try to smoke less, eat moderately, and most important, be happy

              <p>call centre is for the companies leh... this type is for the safety of TDs leh... see if they still want to raise up the points that you mentioned...</p>
              <p>Of course in terms of health, we are still the one to take care of ourselves.. but in terms of safety leh... So NTAss cannot advocate this? or like I hinted, they only think for themselves only.... So the life/safety of all TDs is worth lesser than the maintaince and cost of of the stupid reasons?</p>

              Problem is that there are lots of shy and egostic TD in singapore, got health problem, also keep to themselves, here pain also think later will be ok, then in front of brothers, want to act hero, like he very strong type, and then when really pain, go to remote area to rest instead of going into crowded places.
              
              If feel uncomfortable, drive to a place where there is people and not to a park or remote area, at least you can call for help anytime, singaporean all got handphones, I got my nokia 8610, most will help the cabby in distress on the spot. 
              
              Statistic in my board show that 80% of taxis drivers in Singapore who get stroke or heart attack died or end up in serious condition are mostly found in remote area, that is wrong. Taxi companies should educate their drivers to move into town area where there are peoples who can help or at least get attention.
