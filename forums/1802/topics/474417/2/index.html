              <p>If a TD work everyday 12 hrs without off and earn s$150 per day, it works up to about $4500 per month. It's realistic considering you have no off day, no CPF, no medical benefits, no insurance coverage. I think it is reasonable.</p>
              <p>now, a salaried employee as mention in singapore statistics, the average monthly salary is about $3500, if plus CPF, etc, holiday, bonus, annual leave etc, it also works out that the average salary of an salaried employee is $150 per day. He is not boasting or whatever. </p>
              <p>I think you guys know, for a family of 4 to live comfortably in SG, the combined income must be at least 5k per month, if a couple earn less than 5 k per month, then their life will not be so comfortable, must really plan and spend prudently.</p>
              <p>there are some TD who will earn more, some will earn less, some are very lucky, some not so, some are very hardworking and those lucky and hardworking will earn more. Moreover, for TD, some months u earn more, some month u sick, or anything, u earn less. Such is life for a TD.</p>
              <p>Y u guys think TD is a low status job? Very simple, in SG, these SGporeans think that taking taxi is a premium service (they think they very saad ki to take taxi) because they think it's expensive. Ppl who take taxis are usually in a hurry for time, or maybe they bad mood and most of the time, these ppl who take taxis have been waiting for some time maybe 10-20 mins for an available taxi, maybe they have been rejected by many TDs before you. Then they feel frustrated living in Singapore, train and buses not reliable, HDB expensive, food expensive, no money, kena stress by Boss, felt play out by the Gahmen, felt these ah tiong and FT coming to steal their lunch. </p>
              <p>Maybe their only avenue to let off stress is to tekan TDs, that's y some TD kena these pax also unlucky. </p>
              <p>Anyway, being a TD is an honest job, we must take pride in our work, forgive these pax who treat us like dirt, with any pax, the maximum time they are in your taxi is only 30-45 mins, after you unload them, u might not get to see them again, so, forgive and relax... Dun think too much about the low status.</p>

              <p>Whether you earn $2k or 10k, telling people yr income is absolutely nonsensical, not relevant and serve no purpose other than allowing the public to benchmark your trade income.</p>
              <p>So, Mr Peter, you drive taxis, yes, you are taxis driver, a decent job, remarried and have a child, so be it, life goes on. And how much do you earn? Normal as any taxi drivers in Singapore. That is all.</p>
              <p>And to be frank, for me, being kaypoh,  his ex wife is a curse to him, why? after married, acting career went down, business go bust, then divorce set in, cannot even visit his own daughter, and now become a TD, and now all of us should know why his ex wife like to scold and beat taxi drivers....lols</p>
              <p>And if he still insist to be in the news and get gel up with his ex wife tussle and issues, more bad luck will waiting for him.</p>
