              <p><br> Long ago, in part of ancient china, the emperor had 13 sons, and
              peoples call them the 13 tai po, all very macho, brave and good
              warriors. At first, commoners all respect them, they help those
              poor, old and sick, all are good princes.</p>
              <p>However like all humans, they fell to greed and lust, and not
              long, they only take care of the City (CBD), and careless of the
              poors farmer and commoners outside the city.</p>
              <p>And those city lackeys started to provide them with wealth,
              girls and power. Not long, their father, the old emperor came to
              know all these, he gets angried. He renewed his will and deed to
              give it to his 14th prince, which was born by a concubine instead
              of a Queens.</p>
              <p>This angered the 13 tai po, and like all ancient way of settling
              issue, the emperor call for a fight, the last one standing will be
              the crowned prince. And that is how the 14th prince went on to
              defeat the 13 tai po and make himself the king of CBD.</p>

              <p>I think this request will fail. If their chief only a cpl, then his S3 (whatever that is, but should be junior rank to him right?) I think maybe condemned private. All this requests will be too difficult for him to decipher. Their chief was a transport cpl, maybe thats why he think he can be td chief. This S3 maybe was a sentry because the way he stands by his chief!</p>

              <p>Laugh if you become happy. We not bothered by laughter of those
              against us group. We shall continue with our program and
              deployments as ordered. We shall be disciplined at all times and
              engage enemies if need comes. However for a moment we have extended
              you a chance to behave positively with us. Do not make the big
              mistake of throwing such a chance away okay? Btw the choice of
              Hitler was not a bad idea. We are not talking about his bad things
              but his leadership quality that even as a Cpl he can rise to the
              top, just like our chief a Cpl has rised to the top of the taxi
              trade. Anybody can do it and our next group of members and juniors
              are being trained to take over and do a good job like the chief.
              Anyway this shall end my last post. Its up for you and your guys to
              decide to take our generous offer. If its taken tomorrow night I
              shall return and may be say a few words, if not then you guys and
              your boss must suffer the consequences. Thnk you.</p>
