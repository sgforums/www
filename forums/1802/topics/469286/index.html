              <p><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/taxi-talk/top-10-accident-hotspots-singapore-122432875.html">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/taxi-talk/top-10-accident-hotspots-singapore-122432875.html</a></p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>1</strong><strong>. Cross junction at Bugis Junction/ Rochor road</strong><br>This has been the site of three major accidents within the past year – first with the <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/video-of-ferrari-crash-shows-speed-of-high-impact-collision-.html">Ferrari</a>, then <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/four-car-accident-at-rochor-ferrari-crash-site.html">the Lexus</a> and, last week, the <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/video--mercedes-beats-red-light-at-bugis-junction--crashes-headlong-into-bus-040910367.html">black Mercedes</a>. In all these cases, the drivers of the private cars were known to have exceeded the normal speed limit and beat the red light.<strong></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>2. PIE near Clementi Ave 6 exit</strong><br>Look out for the area from the city at the slip road exit to Clementi Ave 6, heading to the tunnel and filter exit to the Commonwealth West road. This stretch of road is regularly congested due in part to the narrow and short turns and exit along the stretch. Many heavy vehicles like to use this part of road. It was here where I witnessed a nasty accident in which a white BMW car hit the divider between the filter lane and the tunnel. That happened several months ago.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>3. PIE near Simei Road exit</strong><br>Heading to PIE, the stretch of two lanes merging into one is too short and near, which may cause drivers to misjudge the distance and therefore run into accidents. The stretch of PIE roads from Bedok – Eunos – Paya Lebar – Kallang to CTE is also notorious for being dangerous during morning/evening peak hours. Many accidents are known to have occurred there. The same is true for the reverse route in the evening peak hours (ie: Toa Payoh – Kallang – Paya Lebar – Eunos). Just a few months ago, my buddy had related to me that he had seen a pile up of multiple crashed vehicles at Eunos fly over, causing major traffic jams tailing all the way back to Thomson fly over area. It was really horrific and he was caught in it for more than 1 hour.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>4. PIE near exit to BKE Woodlands </strong><br>Heavy jams happen along this stretch, especially during peak hours. Many frequent accidents occur when filtering to either BKE or heading to Jurong. During one raining evening, an accident involving a motor-cycle, lorry, van and car caused traffic to tail back to Toa Payoh - Kallang area. Traffic was nearly at a stand-still for at least 1.5 hrs.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>5. Lornie Road</strong><br>Be careful on the stretch of road leading from Braddell, Lornie, Adam and Farrer Road. Heavy jams beset it during morning peak hours and same is also true for the reverse route during the evening peak hours. The roads are widely used by motorists to bypass ERPs along the CTEs during both morning and evening peak hours. Motorists also use the stretch of road leading to PIE/ AYE during the morning peak as well.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>6. ECP/ KPE exits near Sheares Bridge</strong><br>Watch out for the area from the City going up to Benjamin Sheares’ Bridge and down to KPE (Kallang – Paya Lebar Expressway). I have seen many accidents in the evening peak hours, as many motorists head home. Traffic jams can easily tail all the way back to the AYE – Keppel area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>7. ECP along Rochor Road</strong><br>Especially heavy during morning peak hours heading from Marine Parade to Rochor exit, this stretch can become really jammed whenever there is an accident or road works along it. There have been times when traffic tailed back from Keppel to Bedok when major accidents occurred.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>8. PIE/ KJE</strong> <strong>at Chua Chu Kang</strong><br>The stretch which leads from Bukit Timah/ Bt Panjang/ Chua Chu Kang has its fair share of accidents, usually involving heavy vehicles (especially morning and evening peak hours).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>9. Yishun Ave and Lentor Avenue</strong><br>The roads are heavily used by residents in Yishun/ Sembawang, especially morning peak hours. The reverse is true in the evening peak hours.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><strong>10. Orchard Turn leading to Takashima/ Paragon</strong><br>This road is heavily used in the late afternoon/ evening peak hours, and it can turn nasty when accidents have occurred. I can vividly recall that during Christmas time last year, an accident involving two vehicles caused traffic to slow to a near stand-still. It took me more than 30 minutes to go from 313 Mall to Paragon Mall (whereby the distance between the Mall was less than 1 km).</p>

              <p>uncle ct..welcome back.</p>
              <p>Sometimes the design of the roads also play a part.  Some cannot make it one.</p>
              <p>Like along Benjamin Sheares bridge leading to East Coast before KPE tunnel.  You got traffic turning from Ophir Rd going up the bridge trying to filter right into ECP. At the same time, you got traffic along the bridge trying to filter left to go into KPE tunnel. Plus a lot of slow heavy vehicles moving along the left lane.  And only one lane from the bridge leads into KPE...WTF.</p>
