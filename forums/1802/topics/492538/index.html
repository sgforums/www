              And the final truth is, whether there will be a man handling driverless or not, govt is putting billions into it.
              
              Gentlemen, please be remind that driverless does not imply unman or no man. Driverless imply that there is no driver, the man sitting beside act as a controller, security and safety officer, and as time goes by, when the both the system and the public get use to it function and trust, that will go into a truly unman stage.
              
              And at the end of the day, whether it got man handling it or not, we must be prepare that it will certainly and absolute affect any transportation trade including taxi drivers and apps drivers...that is the most important thing to be aware, especially so for those younger drivers, your taxi driving or apps driving job maybe short lived.
              
              For most of us, like me, ah pek liao, careless smlj driverless or not?

              Long ago in the 70s, when I was about to start driving cedric Nissan taxi, I remember one of my old friend laughed over the building of MRT in Singapore, he do not believe it will go well and function well, he had since gone to join his God.
              And building MRT lines today is like a piece of Cake.
              
              Therefore today, we might have all the impossible scenario of driverless technology, but I guess in 30 years time, which most of us are no more around, it will be also be a piece of cake that might include bus, trailers and all other transport.
              
              And if driverless is going to face any hiccup or trouble, it is easy to settle, like MRT, they will just post out to all other drivers (taxi+apps)
              
              Drivers, income opportunity driverless breakdown at NUS, if nearby, can try. For apps drivers, price guarantee surge

              <p>When Spore decided to build the MRT, other countries have already had theirs for more than 50 years. So it is a tried and tested system. But driverless taxis meaning those completely free to roam type have yet to evolve. </p>
              <p>When that technology exists that can completely replace the human driver, the same technology will be adopted for many other things like a human robot, able to think and act on its own. If that time comes, not only taxi drivers will be out of jobs, many ppl too including waiters, shop assistants, office workers, production workers, technicians etc. So those not in the taxi industry don't be too happy yet with this driverless taxis. When you are out of a job next time, you will not even have a taxi to drive.</p>

              We can all discuss and Talk lanjiao until the cow come home, but the truth is, driverless is here to stay, and our digital druggie govt is not going to let it go.
              
              We can all still continue to drive taxis, make the best out of it as far as we can, and at the same time, take note of the changes, that is all.
              
              For older uncles like me or so called ah pek, by the time driverless is fully operational, most of us will be out of the money economy cycle of this country
              
              For those in their middle ages, it is better, if free, go pick up a skill, be it casket license, crane license, bus or security licence..just act as a back up called Contingent plan.
              
              For those in their thirties, you hv to seriously reconsider taxi driving, and you must at least take up a skill course or academy courses (using yr skilfuture funds) to upgrade yourself, can be a waiter, restaurant captain, 7 tons PSA forklift driver and so on.

              Dun worry about pay lah, our govt is nick named as Pay and Pay govt, you think they cannot figure this out???? at the moment, their priority is to get the driver less going, and for trial, they may give pax free ride...better than Uber/grab

              <p>When Spore decided to build the MRT, other countries have
              already had theirs for more than 50 years. So it is a tried and
              tested system. But driverless taxis meaning those completely free
              to roam type have yet to evolve. </p>
              <p>When that technology exists that can completely replace the
              human driver, the same technology will be adopted for many other
              things like a human robot, able to think and act on its own. If
              that time comes, not only taxi drivers will be out of jobs, many
              ppl too including waiters, shop assistants, office workers,
              production workers, technicians etc. So those not in the taxi
              industry don't be too happy yet with this driverless taxis. When
              you are out of a job next time, you will not even have a taxi to
              drive.</p>

              <p>If technology can evolve into doing complex jobs, like driving, by itself, then technology will have the capacity to do more jobs of the same complexities and lower complexities very easily in future. Job redundancies will exponentially increase in the near future. </p>
              <p>So ask yourself, do you need such technology to replace you or you rather have technologies that helps you? </p>
              <p>The future is bleak. Still want more people in this small country? </p>
