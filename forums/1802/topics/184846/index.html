Their rental is low when you convert it to sg dollor and compare with sg rental. How about their earnings? you convert their earnings and convert it to sg dollor, then compare with sg drivers earnings.<br><br>No2 Same for No.1, thier cost of living low, same for their paid, it's low too.<br><br>No3 I dont know what you mean, you mean singaporeans can afford, so they have to pay extra for calling? or you mean sg taxis business very good, it's hard to flag a taxi in peak hours, which means they already got lot of customers, they dun need ppl to call, so those who call must pay extra? Nanjing taxis business is bad, they beg for customers, so customers dont have to pay?<br><br>No4 Same as No1. and No.2. Low petrol/diesel cost but also low earnings.<br><br>No5 I have to say again, you cant compare like this. If you want to compare, do this: Take the price of a normal 3rm flat in Singapore and divide it by the average monthly income of a normal worker in Singapore, so that you get the answer of how many months of income is needed to buy a flat. Then you do the same for Nanjing and see how many months of income is needed to buy a flat in Nanjing. Then you can compare, the city that needs more months of income to buy a flat is actually the one with more expensive housing.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I am sure we cant compare like the way you did.</span><br><br>tokyo has very high cost of living, so the transportation fees are very high too, it's nothing strange.<br><br>of cos being cab driver is not charity work, it's not the driver's fault. It's the company, is it reasonable to charge extra for calling?<br><br>The problem is who is the "begger", if you can easily flag a cab anywhere, who would bother to pay extra to call a cab? Such case the cab company is the "begger" begging for customer.  If it's real hard to find a cab anytime anywhere, even extra $10 we still have to pay when we really need a cab. bcos customers are begging for a taxi.<br><br>So we really dun need to compare, it's only about the cab company, are they nice enough to give the free service? or they want to earn more cos they understand that singaporeans are begging for thier service.<br><br>In HK, thier are ppl who gather a big group of taxi drivers, then when someone call for cab thru the "boss"(the call is free except normal phone bill), they give a 20-30%discount on the meter(tolls no discount). This ensure them good business, better than roaming around without customers. When times are bad, they give all the offers.<br><br>Maybe one day when only few singaporeans want to take cab, all these offers will come too.<br><br></div>

In Singapore , drivers drove without taking bookings , most suffers in income , it's not a secret .<br><br>If .... only if one day .... Comfort and the rest of the taxi companies , re-adjust the taxi rental to Nanjing's rate of S$16 , and the diesel prices at $0.45cents per litres , then we don't need bookings for extra money .<br><br>Singaporean will be a happy lot of commuters .<br><br>The caused of this is all due to the blood-sucking taxi company , if they can forgo booking revenues , and lucrative taxi rental revenue , then taxi drivers life will be much easier .<br><br>They jacked up the rental , and force cabbies to take bookings if cabbies want a higher pay .<br></div>

We spent four days there and stayed in a four-star hotel. We visited recommended places of interest, and no one would want to miss the Memorial Hall to the victims in the Nanking massacre.<br><br>Nanjing has a population of about five million. As senior citizens, we avoided public transport like underground trains or buses. Our only means of transport was by taxi.<br><br>I was surprised that this Third World city has a First World taxi service. We could get a taxi even at peak rush hour less than 10 minutes from our hotel. It was easier to get one on the road than in Singapore. There is no on-call sign and there is no need to book taxis. Moving around is easy.<br><br>There are about 12,000 taxis in the city area. The flag-down charge is 2.40 yuan (50 Singapore cents) and 2 yuan per kilometre thereafter. The cabs are not brand new but most are comfortable and clean enough for a Third World country.<br><br>What impressed me most was the level of service requirements and the details on the print-out receipt. The information allows easy tracking of abuse. A closer look showed the following items:<br><br>City authority stamp<br><br>Name of taxi company<br><br>Company telephone number<br><br>Code number of tax invoice<br><br>Tax invoice number<br><br>Taxpayer's ID number<br><br>Taxi plate number<br><br>Vehicle registration number<br><br>Date - year, month and day<br><br>Board time - exact hour and minute<br><br>Disembark time - exact hour and minute<br><br>Flag-down charge - 2.40 yuan<br><br>Distance travelled - down to 0.1km<br><br>Grand total<br><br>When we travelled to the outskirts, the driver asked if we wanted to go by highway (and pay toll) or congested city road. He did not ask us which way or how to go. He just gave us a choice - longer travel time or shorter time at a slightly higher price.<br><br>I asked some drivers why their company does not provide phone booking service. They said, with so many taxis around the city chasing customers, why waste money on a service that is not required?<br><br>Cabbies pay 150 yuan for day shift and 80 yuan for night shift. Some told us that working an honest 12-hour shift gave them fairly good returns.<br><br>I wonder why we need to call cabs and pay $3.50 when there are more than 40,000 taxis in our small city of four million. Can Singapore take a leaf from Nanjing and do away with all the frills so commuters, taxi drivers and taxi operators all benefit?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Paul Chan Poh Hoi</span><br></div>

When times are bad, they give all the offers.<br><br>Maybe one day when only few singaporeans want to take cab, all these offers will come too.<br><br></div></blockquote>hey, I will admit it, to be a taxi driver both in S'pore and hk now, i would rather be a hk driver.  When the economy was good in the 90's, callers usually will offer up to $HK20 dollars for trips to airport from locations like mid-level, and when times are bad like couple years ago, we gave discounts (illegally) to frequent riders, what we do here is building relationships with the customer.  Which I believe, that most Singapore cab company "claimed" they do, but infact, they don't...one funny thing is that, Hong Kong people are keen on making complains to media about everything, but I seldomly seeing them make complains about cabbies, this is because we all try to survive and work together at hard time to ensure all of us can feed our families...as of now, when we don't have much problem in the econ, everything return to normal.</div>
