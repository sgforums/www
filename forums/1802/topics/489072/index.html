              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Train services disrupted across North-South and East-West lines, LTA to investigate</strong></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/train-services-disrupted-across-north-south-and-east-west-lines-lta-to">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/train-services-disrupted-across-north-south-and-east-west-lines-lta-to</a></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Train services across the entire North-South and East-West lines were disrupted by a power fault during the Tuesday evening peak hour, just days after a track fault disrupted service on the North-South MRT line that affected thousands during the morning rush.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Operator SMRT Corp,  which first tweeted about the disruption at about 7.15pm, said the latest disruption was due to a power track fault. Free bus services were made available at all stations on both lines, to serve the thousands of commuters caught in the massive disruption.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">SMRT, in an update on its Facebook page, said train services on the East-West line from Pasir Ris to Joo Koon MRT stations resumed at 9.20pm. "We are proceeding with caution and trains are moving at a slower speed," it said, adding: "We are still investigating the cause of the power fault and are doing our best to restore service on the North-South and East-West lines."</span></p>

              <p>SINGAPORE - Train service resumed at 5.30am on Wednesday (June 8) 
              morning on the North-South and East-West lines but service on the 
              North-South line will be suspended from 11am, said operator SMRT in its 
              latest update on Facebook at 5.19am. </p>
              <p>Trains are also operating at reduced speed this morning and commuters
               were told to expect an average wait time of between five and seven 
              minutes on both lines, while they were also warned to expect 
              intermittent short delays throughout the day. </p>
              <p>SMRT said that travel is free for all who are using both lines on Wednesday, until normal service resumes. </p>

              <p>A faulty train could have triggered a power surge which led to a shut
               down of power across the entire North-South East-West Line MRT network 
              during the evening rush hour on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The disruption, which occurred after 7pm on Tuesday evening, had caused an unprecedented delay on the two lines.</p>
              <p><span>It is the first time that services on both the North-South and 
              East-West Lines were affected at the same time, in what is possibly the 
              worst MRT breakdown Singapore has experienced. Going by the scale of the
               breakdown and the time it occured, it is estimated that more than 
              250,000 commuters may have been affected.</span></p>
              <p>Service on the two crowded lines was disrupted for more than two 
              hours, affecting thousands of commuters heading home. Many had 
              difficulty finding alternative transport as the crowd swelled, even 
              though free bus services were activated at the affected stations.</p>
              <p>Service on the North-South line resumed at 10.35pm, more than three 
              hours after the disruption which occurred after 7pm. Service on 
              East-West line resumed at slower speed after 9.30pm.</p>
              <p><span>The disruption came just days after a track fault disrupted 
              service on the North-South MRT line that affected thousands during the 
              morning rush. </span></p>

              <p><span>"</span>A faulty train could have caused the power to trip; 
              arcing was observed on the underside of this train. The power surge 
              caused the protective relays across the entire North South East West 
              Lines network to be activated, leading to a shut-down of power across 
              the two lines," the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in a statement 
              at 11.08pm.</p>
              <p> "We will continue to comb through the system through the night to 
              see if there could be other faulty trains or other causes," it said, 
              adding that <span>LTA engineers will be working through the night with 
              operator SMRT to recover train services and ensure that services run 
              properly on Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p>All passengers who were on board trains during the disruption were 
              safely detrained at station platforms. "All available bus assets were 
              activated across the whole island to provide free bus service for 
              affected commuters, with the police helping with crowd control," said 
              LTA.</p>
              <p>LTA’s crisis management team, led by chief executive Chew Men Leong, 
              was at the Land Transport Operations Centre to lead the recovery 
              efforts, it said, adding that LTA engineers were also at the incident 
              site to assist SMRT’s recovery efforts.  </p>
              <p><span> LTA said it will launch a full investigation into the cause of
               the incident. "We apologise for the inconvenience caused to commuters."</span></p>

              <p>SMRT, in a statement issued past midnight, said power trips along the two MRT lines were detected from 6pm.</p>
              <p>"These power trips were linked to the voltage protection circuit of 
              traction power, which is designed to safeguard the safety of commuters 
              at station platforms. Our engineers initially managed to reset these 
              power trips.” said Mr Lee Ling Wee, managing director, SMRT Trains.</p>
              <p>“But as we tried to identify the cause of the power fault, the 
              frequency and impact of power trips intensified. At 1915 hours, we 
              decided to detrain all passengers and suspend NSEWL train services for 
              safety reasons in order to isolate the cause of the network-wide power 
              trips," he added.</p>
              <p>"Our preliminary assessment points to a possible power-related 
              equipment failure at substations or along the track, or the 
              undercarriage of a potential defective train which we are investigating 
              tonight. But we are not ruling out other possibilities."</p>
              <p>SMRT President and CEO Desmond Kuek said: "SMRT has mobilised all 
              engineering and technical staff to comprehensively check the entire 
              network and train fleet. SMRT and LTA engineers are working round the 
              clock to conduct tests, and sections of the network are being isolated 
              to pin point the fault.</p>
              <p>"While it is still early to conclude the cause of the fault, we are 
              doing our utmost to recover the system with the view to resume full 
              train services as soon as possible. We deeply apologise for the 
              inconvenience caused to all our commuters.” </p>
              <p>Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said in a Facebook post: "I am 
              extremely concerned with today’s incident. This is the first time that 
              services on both the North-South and East-West Lines were affected at 
              the same time. I am sorry that so many commuters experienced massive 
              disruptions to their journeys during the evening peak hours."</p>

              <p><span>In an earlier update, SMRT said it was running tests on the 
              North-South line to systematically isolate the source of the power 
              fault. On the East-West line, </span><span>SMRT engineers were 
              "conducting tests involving 10 trains at a time to check the entire 
              line" after all affected trains have reached the nearest MRT station and
               passengers have been safely transferred to the platforms.</span></p>
              <p>SMRT <span>first tweeted about the disruption at about 7.15pm</span>. <span>Free
               bus services were made available at all stations on both lines to serve
               the thousands of commuters caught in the massive disruption. </span></p>
              <p><span>But some commuters were still trying to find alternative 
              transport to get them home two hours after the service disruption, with 
              some bus stops and taxi stands packed with the waiting crowd.</span></p>

              <p>Banker Jon Yeo, 46, was on an East-West train headed west from 
              Tanjong Pagar when it ground to a halt at around 7.10pm. It was stuck 
              for close to 15 minutes with partial cabin lights and 
              air-conditioning. The lights and aircon came fully back after that, but 
              the train was still stationary.</p>
              <p>"It moved for a bit, and then stopped again. "They finally gave up 
              and got us off at Redhill," he said. "All stations are affected. They 
              actually pulled the shutters down," an agitated Mr Yeo added. Asked if 
              he was going to wait for the free bus services, he said: "No way, I'm 
              not going to wait anymore."</p>

              <p>Another banker, Prashanth Shankar 32, said he was at City Hall 
              station when the incident unfolded. "The announcement came only after 15
               minutes. A long line built up for the fare refund."</p>
              <p>Seeing the chaos and sudden crowd build-up, Mr Shankar called for his
               uncle to pick him up in his car. "The taxi lines were very long too," 
              he added. "There're a lot of frustrated people."</p>
              <p>Stockbroker B C Cheong, 48, boarded the train at Outram, but it 
              started to act up soon. "The train blacked out, and stalled," he said. 
              "We got off at Buona Vista, then we waited for more than half hour for 
              the free bus but still no bus." He said: "So I got on to a normal plying
               bus to Clementi and I am still waiting for a bus to go back to Boon 
              Lay." Mr Cheong added that SMRT's recovery process was "poor" .</p>
              <p>Communications personnal Eugene Mok, 30, took the North-East line to 
              Outram. When he got off, he walked right into the mayhem.  "There was no
               staff at Outram," he said. "We (commuters) were like lost sheep."</p>
              <p>He made his way to the nearest bus stop near Singapore General 
              Hospital, and found the bus and taxi lines were "so long". "So I decided
               to walk to Bukit Merah side of SGH about 1.5km away to try and get a 
              bus. I'm still waiting at 8.30pm."</p>
              <p>SMRT first tweeted about a traction power fault at about 7.15pm, 
              telling commuters to expect an additional 20 minutes of travelling time 
              between Clementi and Joo Koon stations, as well as between Marina Bay 
              and Yishun. But the fault later extended to all stations along both 
              lines.</p>

              <p>Large crowds formed at bus stops outside the affected stations, as commuters spilled out to find another way home.</p>
              <p>Marketing communications manager Philip Pang, 43, waited for about an
               hour outside Novena MRT for a taxi. At close to 10pm, he was still 
              waiting. </p>
              <p>Ms Eunice Chiong, 22, said she was switching from the Circle Line to 
              North-South Line at the Bishan MRT station. A train stopped at the 
              Bishan MRT platform with its doors open from around 7pm to 7.20pm while 
              commuters waited, the digital marketing executive said. Then the lights 
              in the train went dark just as they heard an announcement that the MRT 
              Line was down, and commuters should take other transport.</p>
              <p>The train passengers streamed out of the train onto the platform. 
              There was also an announcement that there will be free shuttle buses, 
              but no directions as to where they were.</p>
              <p>At the bus stop near Bishan MRT, a woman told her that all bus 
              services were free, but she could not get on the buses as they were too 
              crowded. "The buses could not even close their doors as there were too 
              many people," Ms Chiong said.</p>
              <p>Four buses came and went before she decided to walk to a friend's 
              house in Ang Mo Kio where she is waiting to get a lift home to 
              Woodlands.</p>
              <p>Another commuter, who wants to be known only as Michelle, reached Raffles Place MRT station at about 7.15pm.</p>
              <p>She noticed that the queue for the train on the East-West platform 
              was "very very long". After a while, there was an announcement that 
              there was a power fault, and commuters were requested to leave the 
              station. </p>
              <p>"People kept entering the station, because there was no one managing 
              the situation on the ground," said Michelle, 28, who is in the banking 
              industry. She estimated that there were about 300 people who were 
              looking for alternative transport.</p>

              <p>In terms of indigenous talent and technology, we will always be a few steps behind Japan, Taiwan and China. I suspect this is what pap wants. Their game is to ensure continual flow of FT into singapore to displace locals who will vote against them.</p>

              Brother brother, at the end of the day, aren't we knocking our head with our own lanjiao.
              
              Firstly, who govern and education us and our youngs, the PAP govt..tio bo?
              
              Govt of Singapore is alway deem a perfect, no mistakes and die die must get it done working culture, and must be fast too. So naturally, this created a culture of kiasee, kiasu and kia bo bian (scare lose face). 
              
              Every society is cultured by the system of the country, and system/policies are created by govt, and people will tends to follow that culture, so if you have a govt that seek perfection at all cost, you will also have citizens that seek the perfection, as they are educated and cultivated in that way.
              
              Therefore, any mistakes in the society is deem failure, and thus, when MRT breakdown, there will be lots of comments and critics because pples here are cultivated in a way that it should not breakdown and if so, WHY??? And such culture is a creation of PAP govt on it citizens, so if you said locals like to complain, so are our govt

              Well, if opposition run MRT, there can be lots of changes, firstly, opposition might reduce foreigners in Singapore, and that is why some said, if PAP lost in the coming election, foreigners would worry the most.
              
              And when there are less foreigner, do you think our MRT will breakdown?? In many countries I been to, there is a positive discrimination in their MRT system, like in swiss, the oldies n handicap are allow in first follow by childrens, pregnant women and so on, in fact if you take train in Malaysia, you see they allow the malay malaysian to board first. 
              And in India, the rich board first, the poor seat on top of the train.
              
              Base on this, opposition can reduce the load of MRT, provide a more compassionate culture by giving way to the old, childrens and the handicap on first. That will be nice and win win for all.
              
              But today, smlj also chiong in first...so now you know why all these 3rd world foreigners like to come to Singapore, because there is no different with citizens, you almost enjoy what the locals are having. Try that on malaysia or australia,..
