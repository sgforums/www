If the amount exceeds S$20, a S$500 fine will be slapped on the driver and 21 points will be deducted.<br><br>Once the demerit points add up to 21, the offenderÂ’s vocational licence will be revoked.<br><br>For refusing to convey passengers, the penalty is S$100 and three demerit points.<br><br>A taxi driver who accumulates six or more demerit points within 24 hours after his first offence will have his licence suspended between two and eight weeks.<br><br>LTA said it will be stepping up enforcement operations throughout the week. The hotline for feedback or to report errant taxi drivers is 1Â—800Â—225Â—5582. Â— CNA/ac</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>LTA Nabs Another 39 Errant Taxi Drivers</strong><br><br>1)     The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has nabbed another 39 taxi drivers in its continued crackdown on errant taxi drivers who solicit, overcharge or refuse to convey passengers.<br><br>2)     Over a five day period from 30 October - 3 November 2007, 26 taxi drivers were found overcharging, seven were found touting while the rest were caught for refusing to convey passengers, in enforcement operations conducted at several spots such as Sentosa, Clarke Quay, Orchard Towers and Boat Quay.<br><br>3)     Several of the errant taxi drivers are likely to have their vocational licences suspended or revoked on completion of LTA's investigations. The suspension could be for a period of two weeks, four weeks or eight weeks depending on the demerit points accumulated by the taxi drivers for the offences. The vocational licence will be revoked if the taxi drivers accumulate 21 or more demerit points within a period of 24 months.<br><br>4)     The LTA is stepping up enforcement operations on weekdays and weekends. Members of the public are encouraged to call LTA's hotline at 1800-CALL LTA (1800-225 5582) should they wish to give feedback or report errant taxi drivers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>something i totally disagree with the authorities - penalise the taxi drivers for refusing to pick up pax.<br><br>who would want to pickup drunks whos likely to vomit inside the taxis? and then the remaining day/night is spoilt and driver cannot earn money anymore and still got to pay their overheads. I spoke to several taxi drivers who picked up drunkards before and majority of them vomitted inside the taxis. even when these pax compensated the taxi drivers (average $20), its not enough to cover up the losses as they got to drive to the petrol kiosk for washing. even after washing still got terrible odour. then which pax want to board this taxi?<br><br>or pick up pax with undesirable characters? and risk being robbed, refuse to pay fare or risk assault, etc.<br><br>but the most du lan thing is when i flag the taxi, the driver stop, wind down the front window and ask me where I'm going. if destination is not to his liking, he fcuk off without saying a word just like that! still dare pick and choose destination! if they want to pick and choose, i rather they don't stop their taxi at all! i think these are the bunch of drivers that need to be penalised.</div>
