              <p>Reason is, taxi industry is the only industry where the customer calls the shots. You take all the other businesses. It is their various associations that decide on the prices and terms and conditions. Look at our Taxi Association. Do they have the rights to determine taxi fares? Who decides? It is those who are taking taxis and they don't want to pay market rate, so they try to keep the fares cheapo by bringing in all these cheapo drivers. No need licence also can drive. The taxi driver who pull the pax out of the taxi already know he no need to worry. His VL kena gantung he got "alternatives"</p>

              <p>I think it is a good idea to join this firm, but first must go see the terms and conditions. They may say if you don't meet TA standards then you only get the minimum salary. If that is the condition then better to do taxi OMO than to be"employed"</p>

              <p>Talking about tour guide. How come the Taxi Tour Guide course got 
                  scraapped? With TTG license, at least even if taxi become driverless we 
                  still can use these taxis to guide small groups of tourists. How come 
                  govt don't want to "level" this "playing field" for taxi drivers? I 
                  remember when MBCC newly opened, there were 2 huge passenger liners 
                  landed, and there was a shortage of tour guides. I am sure STB kept this
                   information under wraps, because if MIW know about it, they would see 
                  the need to revive the TTG to ensure this is not repeated. Moreover, 
                  taxis doing tours will not affect the rice bowl of those full fledged 
                  tour guides, because I am sure they already were all fully booked way 
                  before the ships landed. But those small groups. like couples or 
                  families, they would prefer to come here and tour on their owm,</p>
              <p>So
                   why did STB get their way in refusing the Singapore Taxi Academy to 
                  conduct a revised  tour guide course that was suitable for taxi drivers,
                   but can allow UG to have a revised vocational  taxi license course? 
                  That day the demand for taxis were really high. There was the case of a 
                  TD who picked up an angmo couple, and they requested that he take them 
                  around to see Singapore. He obliged and took them to Mt Faber. There at 
                  the top where there are arrows pointing to different landmarks and 
                  countries, he showed them the way to Bird Park. One tour guide saw this 
                  and reported to an enforcement officer who was at the parking area.</p>
              <p>When
                   the TD came back to his vehicle the officer approached the TD and asked
                   him who are the passengers. The TD told him the truth. He asked the TD 
                  if he has a tour guide license and the TD replied negative. He then told
                   the TD that this is a grey area and that STB is looking at ways to 
                  address the issue. He told te TD to go to the Tourism building at 
                  Orchard Spring Lane to" discuss the matter with his colleague" and see 
                  how they can "work things out together". The TD accepted the appointment
                   letter and thought nothing of it.</p>
              <p>Guess what! The letter was an apppointment to attend Tourism Court for TOUTING!</p>
              <p>If
                   the TD was touting, how come the officer didn't say it on the spot but 
                  had to goreng another story to the TD? Was he afraid the TD would not 
                  accept the letter if he told the truth? What is touting? According to 
                  dictionary it means:</p>
              <p><span>attempt to sell (something), typically by a direct or persistent approach.</span></p>
              <p>Was
                   this a case of "direct or persistent approach"? Also, there were 2 
                  passengers in the taxi. If the TD had committed an offence, shouldn't 
                  these be treated as witnesses, and their statements taken to support the
                   case? So why did the officer neglect to take statements from the 
                  witnesses? Was it because he knew these "witnesses" would not help to 
                  strengthen his case but weaken it instead, because he knew the TD was 
                  telling te truth? Was this guy just trying to trump up a case to frame 
                  the TD to make TDs look bad, so that STB can have a strong case to 
                  disapprove of the TTG? So, how about "levelling" the TTG 'playing field"
                   as well, so TDs can make up for the lost income they are encountering 
                  with the introduction of PH taxis?</p>
              <p>When the TD went to meet the 
                  officer's "colleague". he just produced some documents and pointed to a 
                  section  about touting and that it has been decided that it is an 
                  offence, and gave the TD a warning not to repeat the "offence". One of the
                   reasons he gave was that unlicensed tour guides tend to give "wrong 
                  Information" to the tourists and this is bad for Singapore's image.</p>
              <p>Talking
                   about giving "wrong Information". Are TDs the real culprits? Or is it 
                  the FTs who come here, spend a few months, and then think they 
                  are"qualified" to take their friends/relatives  around? I had encountered a number 
                  of instances where these "giude" were feeding the wrong information to 
                  their visitong friends/relatives. One classic case is of this guy who 
                  picked his parents up from the airport, and was talking about our 
                  transport system and mentioned the MRT. When his father asked him what 
                  MRT stands for, he replied "Metro Railway Transport"!</p>
              <p>So, are TDs
                   the real culprits? We were born in this country and we know the 
                  landmarks and transport systems and other information far better than 
                  these FTs. So if the STB is really concerned about "wrong information" 
                  being given to visitors, shouldn't they also be arresting these "touts" as well?
                   Or s the real reason they are afraid their own tour guides would also 
                  experience what we are experiencing now, which is, a loss of earnings?</p>
              <p>What
                   if we have another occasion where we have a similar situation of 
                  shortage of tour guides? Are we going to have these people going into the
                   city, meet a fellow countryman who volunteers to take them around, and 
                  then have these people returning home and telling all their friends and 
                  neighbours about how efficient our "Metro Railway Transport" is?Or 
                  better still, even find this information printed on their tourist 
                  magazines when they write about Singapore?  It would be interesting to 
                  hear what the minister or STB has to say about this.</p>

              <p>Salaried taxi drivers in Singapore would not work out as well as our current independent taxi drivers.... if it would work out, all 5 taxi companies would have adopted this business model.</p>
              <p>Salaried also means max of 44 hours per week per week or company must pay OT (at 1.5 to 2 times the normal rate).   Also must pay for holidays and sick days + other benefits.   Most taxi drivers in Singapore drive at least 60-72 hrs per week; the OMOs drive longer hours.</p>

              <p>The only possible "promotion" is got chance to become Academy Instructor when one reaches 60+.   Maybe some also got chance to work as employees in Comfort (eg, Complains Department got ex-taxi drivers working there....maybe other departments also got).</p>

              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE - A new taxi company with an all-electric fleet is set to hit the road in two months' time.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>HDT Singapore Taxi said on Monday (July 25) that it plans to roll out operations in the first week of September, after getting approval from the Land Transport Authority (LTA).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The firm is expected to start with more than 10 vehicles, before progressively ramping up its fleet to 100 by the first quarter of 2017.</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>Its managing director James Ng told The Straits Times that fares will be be "competitive and tagged to the market rate", adding that more details will be announced when the Public Transport Council has approved its pricing structure.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Registered as a company here in April, HDT Singapore Taxi will join a market with five other taxi companies which run a total of more than 28,000 cabs here.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The e-taxi trial ties in with the Government's plans to widen the testing of the viability of electric vehicles (EV), from individual corporate usage to fleet-based, shared-car operations.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>A LTA spokesman said: "HDT will run a fleet of 100 EVs commercially as part of an eight-year trial, so that the relevant agencies can collect the necessary data under real-life conditions to study the feasibility of EV fleet business models."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>HDT Singapore Taxi will use electric vehicles from BYD (Build Your Dreams), a Shenzhen-based auto and battery manufacturer that has United States investment guru Warren Buffett as a shareholder.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>It will use BYD's e6 model, which has a range of about 350km, and a battery that requires only 90 minutes to be fully charged.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>While other taxi operators lease out their taxis to hirers, HDT Singapore Taxi will be the first to employ their cabbies full-time.</div>

              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>Ding made the comments to a group of academic and technology industry figures from Hong Kong during a speech in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>In 2013, BYD chairman Wang Chuanfu said he expected the company to launch dozens of e6 electric car taxis in Hong Kong by the end of that year.</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>He predicted the number would grow to 1,000 by 2014 and 3,000 this year.</p>

              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>Ding insisted that the firm has proved to the local government that electric cabs can greatly benefit the city by saving energy costs and better protecting the environment</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>“I’m calling it a failure because we lost so much money from this project,” he said.</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>The automaker has made a series of investments to support this programme, for example covering the cost of charging stations and vehicle maintenance, he added.</p>

              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>“The Hong Kong government already knows [all] the figures and results, like the energy cost savings. But it really depends on the government [to see] how far it will go in moving forward this e-taxi plan,” he said.</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>It is normal for new policies from the government to inspire a backlash until doubts are cleared up, he said.</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>In another part of its electric push, BYD has also made slow progress in pressing ahead with electric buses in Hong Kong, Ding said.</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>The company has so far received orders for 14 of these in Hong Kong, but the number of orders pales compared to other traffic-heavy markets in which it operates, he added.</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>BYD said last week it plans to sell 15,000 electric taxis and 6,000 electric buses this year.</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>Analysts say 95 per cent of these are likely destined for China.</p>
              <p class="v2-processed" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: #333333; font-family: "PT Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px;'>In April, the company won an order from the state of California to deliver 60 electric buses.</p>
