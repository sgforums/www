              Aiya renting of house is a very personal perogatives, meaning his rights, because he or she is going to live with them, so it is alright for people to state it clearly their preferred race.
              
              This will erase the issue of those races filter out calling them and get negative result.
              
              However, in term of employment, with is a more general issue in term of social economy and politic, you simply cannot post out a preferred race, however, you can alway reject those races that you do not intent to employ within yr office thru famous courtesy gesture of "Thank you Mr Pool, we will call you"

              Due to multi races in Singapore, and getting more multiple as our govt still open up the immigration policies, a racist or not racist remark must be taken care of, because most pple will take anything to be racist as long as it is about race and fail to anal...lyse that it is merely a choice and words of convienences.
              
              Our govt, being capitalist, and recent promotion of some young ministers from the 3rd gen, might fail to visualise the impact of multi races getting more multiples. The like of bangala and india's indian fight over a cricket game is a typical example of our govt failure to forseen that the mulitple races they created might not be as well behave as our own locals chinese, indian, malay and singh/baba.
              
              During the 60s to 90s, locals Singaporean actually fight and side over ourselves when there was no foreigners invasion. But today, be it Singapore malay, indian, chinese or others, we seem to forget about our struggling in the past with each other, and we are now more cohesive and label ourselves as true blue Singaporeans. This is all due to an invasion of pinoy,bangala, india's indian, chao ang mo, PRC, yangon kids and so on..
              
              And I beg to be different when govt said that foreigners here do help our economy, but from the 70s to early 90s before the asia financial crisis, our GDP was alway at double digits..11% to even 13%, and today, a pathetic 2 to 4%. So, the sentiment here is that statistically speaking, increase in population reduce productivity, happiness, opportunity for locals and earning in term of super high increment in cost of living including taxi rental fees
