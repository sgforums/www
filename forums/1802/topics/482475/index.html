              Look bro, in taxi driving, by right, Hirer is the king, he can decide what he wants and who he wants, but, by left, he also need to be justifiable and understanding, otherwise, he can hardly get a permanent relief or even a relief, for that matter.
              
              Many hirers can complain to me of their inability to hold on to a permanent relief, not that they cannot get a relief, the reason is alway relief lau lan, relief sia lan, relief cb kia..but they alway forget to ask themselves, are they doing the same?
              
              As a hirer, as long as your are righteous, mature, justifiable, and understanding, by left or by right, you most likely will end up with a good relief with a long time partnership

              Super relief is not a permanent one, if you got a sunday relief in consistent, that is sunday relief, not super relief, super relief is one who just drive for you one week or few days or simply one sunday, and the rental is much lower.
              
              And if you get a blower hirer who charge high, super relief will ask him go fly kite at west coast or east coast. Super relief are mostly experience drivers, who somehow work in a way of getting lower rental at the expense of different cabs and hirers, be it crown or lady lau kay bu driver, we also will drive, but if got a blower hirer, we rather eat maggi mee than drive for him

              Taxi driving, all can drive, those want to mix with those knnccb driver, can make money, but never last long, either they will throw or change companies, for those who more down to earth TD, most will drive very long, with the same taxi and the same partner.
                      
              But to give respect to these knnccb drivers, I have to admit that they really do their homework, and that make them gain skill, experience and nimble, they know the timming, the places to go and not to go, where to Q and when to rest, what is good dispoal and what is bad one..or cheapo pax and so on..that one, if a normal down to earth cabby can learn, that will be a much credit to them.
                    
              But to learn, firstly, the farking skin must be thick, and most of these knnccb usually are OMO types

              <p>No I dont think you racist. But even own race got difficult type also.</p>
              <p>I think it's more personality - you get an Indian and Malay who has many Chinese friends or vice-versa, chn mix with other races, then it becomes easier.</p>
              <p>For me I work with all 3 races, but I found the Chn hirers the one I could click the best with, mainly because they not calculative. And everything auto one, no need to open mouth, they will minus and cut rental accordingly for off days, holidays etc.</p>
              <p>So if you find a hirer or relief that is chin chye, then everything should be well. Plus there's also another advantage for each own 'big day or NY' easy to take off. They cover for you and you cover for them.</p>
              <p>The only real issues are washing and topping up. I let them to do everything and they used to charge me or I counter offer. In the end no dispute. But of course cannot hand over vehicle dirty in the inside, that one must clean lah. Gotta be fair. For outside, I just pay, whether they washed or not, I didnt care unless really I make the vehicle very dirty outside, then I will do the washing. If not just wipe the windows and clean the inside and pay $2 for washing daily. Or I just quote a reasonable fuel price. That time he quote me something like 11ct or so, I offer 13ct. then when price go up, I offer 14ct which includes the washing fee. I drove for both of them 2 years, very happy working relationship.</p>
              <p>Maybe when I return to Tdriving, if they still available, I sure want to rejoin them. Knn that time I kena chicken pox, my hirer can go buy chinese herbs and his wife make some cooling drinks for me.</p>
              <p>It's the character, if a person is good hearted, everything he does will also be fair and good.</p>
              <p>If a person is calculative, everything will also be a problem.</p>
