              ya, first qn i wd ask is how many hours can the particular cabby drives on a consistent basis?.... 
              
              if the answer is 10 hours, then get a relief for remaining 12 hours is optimal
              
              if more than 15hours, then go ahead and do a one-man-operation....
              
              your dad driving pattern now (omo) is more suited for young driver.... very hard to sustain for long term.... let alone for older driver...
              
              anyway if i owe big money, i will drive 5am to 2pm full, then 4 to 11pm full.... sunday rest full day.... not much social life left....

              <p>I once had a conversation with a taxi driver... He told me something like how he work. Firstly your dad needs to know where is the best place to pick up customers. When you know this.. Keep it to himself and do not share with others.</p>
              <p>Secondly, during night time, especially those early and late mornings.. Ask ya father no point joining the taxi queue in order to pick up the people that just finish chiong... Especially at the liang court that side where you can see a whole stretch of taxi queuing up for customers. This is because sometimes you queue for maybe up to 1 hour... and then ya customers say tiong bahru.. From liang court to tiong bahru how much can ya earn?? Nothing much.</p>
              <p>Dont spent too much time to chit chat with other drivers is also a good way to earn more money. just driving during peak hours is not enough, your dad needs to know where to pick up the most customers. If he goes town, he can pick up customers from town easily, but if he goes to neighbourhood during the day then he might have difficulty picking up customers then..</p>

              <p>If your dad is like slow mover , $20 per hour , fundamentally he must be on the road for 12.25 hours daily !</p>
              <p>Me fast mover , about $25 per hour relax one .... so me on the road like 10 hours only .</p>
              <p>10 hours is like 6am to 4pm like that lor .....</p>
              <p>if he dun like 6am shift , then 8am to 6pm also can ...</p>

              <p>I enjoy most was the Monday to Friday's pace , exciting and interesting ...</p>
              <p>I quit OMO becos i hated Saturday and Sunday ... damn low demand for taxis except only those rush 2 hours ( 10am to 12am ) period .</p>
              <p>And Saturday and Sunday , most customers i took , largely to Orchard and Bugis area , town . Always massive jam inside or near Orchard area that time .</p>

              <p>But most if my friends say tat starting its best to drive full shift, till u are familiar den go for relief... they say the rent will cut half... which is good. Am i right? so now i just ask my father to go around SG and look out for good place to go, so next time when he familiar with it, he can have relief, and earn roughlky 2k per month right?</p>

              wow........more omo cabbies revealing their tricks here....haha
              
              personally i still say omo is for those who want to drive many hours at least 12 hrs full full.... anything less than that, half day shift makes more sense...
              
              to nett $120 to $150, an experience cabby driving 5pm to 2am can liao...9 hrs non stop.... omo can pick the best hours to drive but still have to drive more hrs to earn the same profit or less.... 
              
              but then everyone has own habit and preference lah.... some cabbies omo cos they cant tahan relief....so they dun mind drive 3 hours more than 12 shift cabby just to pay 12hr rental... 
              
              me will only omo when either i owe big money or retirement and drive for fun.... 
              
              if me driving for fun, i just drive 5am to 10am then 8pm to 11pm.... me hate jam type....
              
              if me owe big money, 5am to 2pm full, then 4 to 11pm... very unhealthy but no choice.... haha...

              <p><br>on a good month , $2k is about 2 weeks work . That was what it was before , not now .the current situation .</p>
              <p>Still if i am to go back as a cabby , $2k .... divided by 26 days , to me , i can do it with 20 days , easily . No sweat . Effort : 60% of my capability .</p>
              <p>I can do better than that .</p>
              <p>Start as Full Shift ? Not a good idea actually , as far as phobia is concern .</p>
              <p>I had reached a level that i am really scared of driving . Scared of touching the sterring wheel even ....  so .</p>
