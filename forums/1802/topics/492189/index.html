              <p>Â </p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>The embattled taxi industry, which has been reeling from disruptors such as Uber and Grab, has taken another blow - sharply higher government fees.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has told operators that their operating licence fee will rise from 0.1 per cent of gross revenue to 0.2 per cent this year, and then to 0.3 per cent next year.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>This is the first such increase in more than 10 years. For a mid-sized operator such as SMRT, the fee hike translates to more than $100,000 in additional costs per year.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>Based on its taxi revenue for the past two financial years, its fee would go up from an estimated $140,000 to $420,000 next year, assuming revenue remains constant.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>Operators contacted were furious but resigned. "What can we do?" the manager of a small firm said. "It's not as if the rate is negotiable."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>Another said: "That's a doubling and trebling of fees in just two years. We're going to appeal. It may be useless but we have to register our protest."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>The LTA was not available for comment but The Straits Times understands that the fee hike has to do with higher costs associated with monitoring taxi service standards.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>Currently, private-hire operators such as Uber and Grab do not pay this fee. Their service standards are also not monitored by the LTA.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>National Taxi Association executive adviser Ang Hin Kee said operators may pass the cost on to drivers by raising rental fees. "Higher cost may trickle downwards," he said.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>For cabby S.C. Wong, it is already starting to trickle down. Mr Wong, 64, said ComfortDelGro has been trying to persuade him to swop his Hyundai Sonata for a costlier Hyundai i40 cab.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>"I refused because it costs 30 per cent more. The market is very bad now," he said. "My takings have fallen by 20 per cent to 30 per cent from last year, when Uber and Grab started full swing. My call bookings have dropped too."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>Mr Wong, who has been driving a taxi for 15 years, said the i40's higher flag-down fare of $3.70 - 50 cents higher than the Sonata's $3.20 - "cannot cover the $30 increase in rental".</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>"If I get 20 passengers a day, that's only $10 more," he said.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>Asked what he will do when his Sonata is deregistered in March, he sighed. "I don't know. Maybe by then, I would have stopped driving."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>ComfortDelGro said the higher rental reflects the higher purchase price of the i40.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>A spokesman said the i40 - which is slightly smaller than the Sonata - costs more because it complies with Euro 5 emission standards.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>The i40's rental is $130 a day, while the Sonata's is as low as $100. The $30 hike means ComfortDelGro rakes in nearly $88,000 more in rental per cab over its eight-year lifespan. The group has about 17,000 taxis.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>But even as it is piling higher rentals on drivers, Singapore's biggest cab operator is trying to woo cabbies who have quit with a two-month 50 per cent rental discount.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>"The scheme is a promotion to attract drivers who have left and wish to rejoin the company," the spokesman said. "This is part of our ongoing efforts to recruit drivers."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>Industry players said the percentage of unhired cabs has risen - from single digits before 2013 to more than 10 per cent now for some operators.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>For commuters, the days of $3.20 flag-downs are numbered. Sonata taxis will all be replaced by i40s in the next couple of years.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;'>Â </p>

              It is contradicting that a taxi association adviser is also a member of parliament  who supported the ruling govt policies and voted those bills for increasing. And then, tell companies not to put cost on drivers?
              
              I am not speaking on behalf of any companies, but in the current state of diminishing hirers and more throwing keys, you think companies is going to push those cost down the driver's throat?? which will ultimately, bring about more throwing keys and also, lesser and lesser new hirers.

              Even free textbooks at CC, you can see parents driving BM, mercs and audi parking there rushing in the Q to get the free textbook for their kids. That is fundamental human behavorial regardless of what status and position you have in the society. 
              
              And as a TDs, I do see many living in 3 storeys bungalow going to Australia tour by tigerairway. I was asking them...Sir, SIA First Class?...end up, T2, tiger air...somemore can tell me ntuc member take tigerair very cheap, somemore got priorty Q and seat..
              
              
              So it is naturally for people to seek the cheapest as long as it can go from A to B and B to C. I guess as a taxi driver, during our off day, we might also call grab and uber and find the fare is so much cheaper than cab.
              
              Support is one thing, but you also need to support with sense, not end up becoming a die hard fan.

              I created a new thread to highlight the grab car fare vs taxi fare during peak hour in cbd. Immediately my thread was removed. This is a taxi forum. I suspect that ccb lau char bo is bias towards taxi . How to contribute in this forum with her around as moderator.

              OK post here.
              Cbd evening peak around 7.30pm on weekday.
              China Sq  taxi stand cross st to cove way sensa. 
              My cdg sonata  $14.70 taxi stand pick up with no booking
              Grab car quoted her $15.
              Took my taxi because she waited too long for grab car.
              With booking my taxi for the same trip would cost $18.
              Grab car around 17% lower in Cbd evening peak.
              Cabbies...take note of the lower fare from grab car.
