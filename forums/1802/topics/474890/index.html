              <p>i used to browse around when i was driving on and off last time. recently i was thinking of coming back to drive again so i come here more frequent to see if any news or updates. i was thinking if take car, but i went to check around, not only the queue super long, now i also understand most of the rental outside is like 130 140 easily, no more &lt;100, then somemore next year the lta ruling is 300km i think. i think of all these, i already sian half. i think, taxi trade is becoming more and more controlled. eventually there is almost no way a singleu person can drive, must 2 person share. and further the rental will be 
              in such a way that its almost like one man vehicle today but only half 
              day shift timing, meaning almost 100 every shift next time. including fuel, i think costs easily 140 150. which is actually not far from what is said above even if believe or no believe.
               the only way to make sure every driver work hard is to make every one 
              of them, even relief who use to share rental, drive like they are OMO 
              even in 1 shift only, so in the end the public get 2 OMO drive 1 taxi all the time 24x7, fantastic right! taxi might become one of those exclusive career paths, only for those who either really can dong tahan, or those desperate no other path, which is the way taxi was viewed in the past, not like today suka suka got early 30s in newspapers say earn how many how many kkks, then siam tax.  i know it might be a joke to think taxi as career path for some, but i think that is like inevitable in a few years time. so my thinking is if want to earn a living thru taxi, better think twice if really can sustain for the long long term, like 10 years, 15 years. but my guess is there will be a big change in this industry within the next 2-3 years, so far everything seems to point like that. but then i admit i am not as laojiao as some of the members here, so please take me with a grain of salt la. i am just sharing my own thinking, does not mean right or wrong. just sharing for kopi talk online thats all la.</p>
