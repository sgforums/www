            <div class='col-md body'>CABBIES! I've been wondering for very long already!<br><br>Take, for instance, you drive the newer type of taxi, those spacious ones like the dark blue ones from Comfort.<br><br>One day, you are driving without a passenger. In front of your taxi, is another taxi, except that it's the old model that's still using the neon blue light on top and the taxi is not as spacious.<br><br>Suddenly, you see a customer! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> But there is that cab in front of you, also empty. You prepare to drive past the cab in front, thinking it will have to stop for the customer.<br><br>Aha. But the customer decides not to flag the lousy cab in front and waits for it to pass slightly before flagging down YOUR cab.<br><br>1) Will you take that customer?<br>2) Assuming you will take that customer, will you feel disgruntled because the customer did not follow the order and take the cab in front of you? Or will you actually be happy because you got a customer after all?<br><br>Because at the moment, SMART is the only taxi company that has yet to raise its fares right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
