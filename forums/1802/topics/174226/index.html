There has always been discrimination against foreigners in almost all developed countries. No country worth its salt can afford to have a free for all policy towards foreigners working in the country.<br><br>Now I am not sure about how easy it is to get PR status in Sg, but I suspect it is comparatively easy. In the UK, to obtain indefinite leave to remain (PR equivalent), you need to have worked and lived in the UK for 4 years. Not an easy feat given that under EU law, before a company can hire a foreigner, it must  show that another EU citizen cannot do the same job and hiriring you is good for the coy's business.<br><br>Now, taxi driving is not exactly something that requires special or exceptional talents. Not saying that it is easy, but that it is certainly no rocket science. How can you justify hiring foreign talents when there is an abundance of local candidates?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the situation in hongkong where jobs held by hongkies are lost to PRC is prevalent in the world. take spore for eg, our low end manufacturing industries started to shift to low cost countries for the past decade. so it is not the hongkong government's fault for the influx of cheap PRC workers but rather, the fault lies in their inability to move up the ladder of the job industry. although spore has seen many retrenchments when companies shift to china, thai, vietnam, our government on one hand tries to deep cost down (but they know it is impossible to compete with these countries head on with cost), thus they pursue high end jobs for us, this is the major reason why our unemployment rate is lower than hongkong. hence, there is no way to stop the production of a good or service being snatched away from someone who is at least as capable but cheaper. this is globalisation!!!<br><br>ok back to PRC cabbies in spore. when i was in london and new york city, most of the cabbies are foreign talent and mind you, they do know the way around and what i am most impressed about is that they know the historical and cultural aspects of the cities too. this is akin to spore cabbies who knows a lot about our history from the time Raffles set foot here till LKY took power till our 1st world economy status. i have a neighbour who is a cabbie for many years and i love to talk to him becos he knows all this stuff and he is a gentleman driver. however i think not all spore cabbies are equal so there will be those who are more knowledgeable than others. having said that, i think it is reasonable to expect that there are some PRCs who know at least as much as spore cabbies, especially those who have stayed here for quite a while. and it has to be noted that even for a freshie spore cabbie, he/she can't know 95% of the roads in spore rite, it is the experience on the road that is needed. as long as a new cabbie has the motivation to serve their customers and keep up with the road directories, who cares whether it is a spore or PRC cabbies. if spore transport system is to move forward, this should be our mindset.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some countries.. nobody want to be cabbies! so no choice have to get foreign talent. Theres indian cabbies in London so i heard<br><br>In Singapore, its the opposite, therefore, with our Government only givin g cabby licence to Singaporeans, its like a sign of protection for the industry and the cabbies!<br><br>Yeah, some cabbies may not know the way, but they may be newly- employed cabbies..<br><br>I been to Thailand. Their cabbies all recruited from some far away place. No training. route familiarisation needed for them. Thats why u go funny places, gota ask 10 taxis before some1 knows the way.<br><br>Singapore, at least have training, but then, Singapore has so many places people wanna go  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
