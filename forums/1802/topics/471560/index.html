              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; list-style: none;">There are also the workaholics who leave little time for anything else and party-animals who let their hair down a tad too much.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; list-style: none;">And these habits have translated into drivers' behaviours on the road. AsiaOne Ride has come up with 10 types of Singaporean drivers and their habits which you should avoid on local roads.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; list-style: none;">First, there is the drunkard driver, which you can identify by his/her swerving in and out of the driving lanes near popular clubs, while stomping on the brakes randomly.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; list-style: none;">Then, there is the angry driver with a serious case of road rage. The mere sounding of a horn, or cutting of lane, will send him stomping up to your car and unleashing a torrent of vulgarities on you.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; list-style: none;">Next, there is the workaholic glutton, who puts his dietary needs way behind his job requirements. You see him stuffing a McDonald's meal down his throat while driving to the next business meeting with a client.</p>

Hence, if you spot a speed maniac with a 'taxi' sign gaining on you at 120km/h, it's better to filter left and give way</span></p>

              <p>3 ways to tackle this</p>
              <p>1. At the 2nd lane flash your high beam</p>
              <p>2. If flashing doesn't work, use your horn</p>
              <p>3. If he also can't hear, just pull over to his left, maintaining within your 2nd lane, that would force his wheel back to where it rightfully belongs <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p><br>No lah, why avoid them, lan jiao lah..can horn and high beam back mah, then if the driver jio you to pull over, you signal left, slow down, then when he pull over liao, you zoom pass him lor..lols. Using of horns and highbeam is merely because it is seldom use, paid so much for a car, sure must use abit mah, and the best people to use on are Taxi drivers lor.</p>

              <p>i've noticed this along almost all the time along from where the ECP starts after the Sheares Bridge all the way to airport.. straight also wheel on the line... curve worse, the whole car is on the line taking up two lanes..</p>

              <p><br>These method are those old lau gui people practice one, like my former chief lor.</p>
              <p>Here are some reasons why they go cover the 2nd lane white lines while driving on the fast first lane.</p>
              <p>First, on 1st lane travelling at 110km/hr and above, the right side is kerb and bushes or a partial wall or a drain, so no way out if suddenly the driver need to do a quick turn to avoid those breakdown car, road planting or whatever fark prunting or accident on 1st lane, by occupying second lane abit, the driver will have the leeway to move out, and if the back car is to hit him, it will mostly hit his back or the rear door, and that in insurance term mean, the back car is at fault.</p>
              <p>Secondly, at 110km and above, any spotting of TP or TP volvo on the road, the driver can quickly swift to middle lane, and most season taxi driver will tell you, TP alway book 3 kinds of vehicles, one travelling at 1st lane, mostly cars and motorcycle, and second one..mostly those truck and pick up and so on.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, by occupying 1 and a half lane, cornering will have a widen space, and we are talking about speeding at 110km and above.</p>
              <p>However, during raining days, TD will not go into the lane marking, because, lane markings during day is very dangerous and slippery for TD lousy tyres.</p>
