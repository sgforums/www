              <p>I think the beads not so helpful but a seat rest with back rest protuded. I dont know how to describe it, but just get one that makes you feel comfortable.</p>
              <p>I once took a cab with a Malay driver, the guy bougt a magnetic bracelet around $100 says it helps with blood circulation. Maybe you guys can recce this out and see if it really helps and if so, get it.</p>
              <p>Or just simply like my former hirer, drink a lot of chinese herbs, there's a good store in Ghim Moh that sells these kind of stuffs. You Chinese guys might know this better than me, what to buy and consume.</p>

              <p><br>Income wise is much depend on the driver, question is then, are you cut to be a limo driver? driving limo is not about promotion from normal cab to higher rank, in TD, there is no rank, if you think you drive fit and can earn better than merc, then by all mean carry on.</p>
              <p>Many have the wrong concept that drive merc and make more money, if so, then why so many went back to drive normal cabs?</p>
              <p>I will take normal TD getting bored with his normal days of driving that he switched to at least make his driving more colorful or get some experiences,</p>
              <p>some get stuck up there, and some manage to break their egostic mind and went back to drive normal cab having experienced limo driving.</p>
              <p>of course some can really make a  better living out of driving limo because he or she is cut to be, but some who lose more than driving a normal cab still insist that they are making and better are just taking their pride too high and unable to let go.</p>
