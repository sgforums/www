              Dear DRO
              
              
              
              
              Below please find my personal detail:
              
              Name : XXX
              
              IC : XXX
              
              Taxi : SHDXXXX
              
              
              
              
              Today 1st May 2015 at around 11.30pm I accepted a call booking to pick up a passenger from Marina Bay Financial Center Tower 3 to Jurong Point taxi stand.
              
              
              
              
              Upon reaching the destination, my MDT hang.
              
              Passenger wanted to pay by ezlink and also required a receipt to claim from his company the taxi fare.
              
              
              
              
              Due to failure of the MDT, I am unable to issue a receipt to the passenger.
              
              Despite trying the following attempts :
              
              1) Pressing K1 on the meter 
              
              2) resetting the MDT
              
              
              
              
              As a result the passenger refused to make payment for the trip.
              
              
              
              
              Therefore I did not receive any payment from the passenger.
              
              
              
              
              The taxi fare is around $20 inclusive of the call booking fee.
              
              
              
              
              Since CDG has stopped issuing manual receipt, I am also unable to issue a manual receipt to the passenger.
              
              
              
              
              I have lost my time, effort, diesel consumption cost and taxi rental cost due to the MDT failure in lieu of non-payment from the passenger. In addition, I am required to make a levy payment to CDG for the call booking.
              
              
              
              
              Could you look into my case and I hope to get a favourable reply from you.
              
              
              
              
              Your reply could also determine how I handle a non-paying passenger in future circumstances with similar occurrence.
              
              
              
              
              Yours regard

I have met CDG limocabs who got a puctured tyre along ECP after waiting 45mins for their arrival job. Guess what? They had to call their kaki to faster come and take over the job. The E-class cabby lost his fare and had to pay for tow truck. You lost only $20. He lost more than that and lost even more time. Hope this makes u feel better.</p></div>

              to pick up a passenger from Marina Bay Financial Center Tower 3 to
              Jurong Point taxi stand.</p>
              <p>Upon reaching the destination, my <span>MDT</span> hang.</p>
              <p>Passenger wanted to pay by ezlink and also required a receipt to
              claim from his company the taxi fare.</p>
              <p>Due to failure of the <span>MDT</span>, I am unable to
              issue a receipt to the passenger.</p>
              <p>Despite trying the following attempts :</p>
              <p>1) Pressing K1 on the meter</p>
              <p>2) resetting the <span>MDT</span></p>
              <p>As a result the passenger refused to make payment for the
              trip.</p>
              <p>Therefore I did not receive any payment from the passenger.</p>
              <p>The taxi fare is around $20 inclusive of the call booking
              fee.</p>
              <p>Since <span>CDG</span> has stopped issuing manual
              receipt, I am also unable to issue a manual receipt to the
              passenger.</p>
              <p>I have lost my time, effort, diesel consumption cost and taxi
              rental cost due to the <span>MDT</span> failure in lieu of
              non-payment from the passenger. In addition, I am required to make
              a levy payment to <span>CDG</span> for the call
              booking.</p>
              <p>Could you look into my case and I hope to get a favourable reply
              from you.</p>
              <p>Your reply could also determine how I handle a non-paying
              passenger in future circumstances with similar occurrence.</p>
              <p>Yours regard</p>
