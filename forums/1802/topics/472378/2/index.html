              <p>4A is public bus driver. Never listen when Rsm explain all this? Rsm all public service he experienced, that is why he and chief click so well. both are natural leaders. when rsm look for new relief got so many people want to join with him, why? chief partner also so good to him, why because he know how lucky to have chief. I heard you say LV got people problem with chief, siao liao lor lu. Bob dunno how many time ask chief take over because he know chief will be best boss and make LV very profitable but chief dont want to overtake Bob, let Bob do first until he retire then maybe he take over, my chief never crazy for power one. His respect automatic.</p>

              <p>mantou89, ...you are referrin to clutch? Taking manual driving course? 1st of all, what type of car are you learning to drive? Different manual car have different biting points, usually you can hear the sound of it or ...usually when you see the speedometer, each gear change is roughly around 5-10kmph difference....</p>
              <p>The trick is simple. Start off, usually 1st gear in the HDB carpark....or 2nd gear but for new learners, know the basics 1st.</p>
              <p>2nd gear is very smooth driving in hdb, usually for season drivers. For me, i hit 3rd gear in hdb blocks...haha..Oops.Most important is you must f know the speed limit in hdb blocks. Once you turn and drive out to main road is 40 to 50 kmph. Usually this speed hits 3rd gear already. Control your accelerator lo.... and always look infront of the cars, the distance of the cars between u and the car infront of you...and also observe the switching of the traffic lights. From far, you can also see the 3 white arrows when approaching the traffic light zone. If still scared, no worries. Always view your speedometer, at times...the road and the speedometer..This i dont need to teach u right? 2nd level is hear the engine sound, if you drive long enough you can hear the car engine on when to switch gear or not to switch....and also the road condition also. 3rd level is dont need hear, your eyes already adjusted to the speed of your car movement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This technique i think is only used when you are used / accustomed to your car ONLY. Unless you are well-versed with different cars, but it needs alot of time to adapt.</p>

              <p>Hi Elginang, yup, i was referring to the control of the clutch. I was taught not to look at the speedometer, but to rely on engine sound. In fact I found this to be more effective.  I am learning driving on a Honda now, not driving out on the roads yet but soon. Been driving around a rural area of singapore near the driving centre but there are still lorries and cars in that area, mostly L plate cars.</p>

              <p>To share with you, jap cars are much more noiser as compared to continental cars. They usually 'fly' when they hit more than 100km/hr.</p>
              <p>hmm from what you say, you are learning driving from school right? Usually u will learn the circuit faster as compared to the private students. once you grasp hold of the gears, or play well with gears...you will start to find the rest of the cars are VERY slow haha.</p>
              <p>Slowly...u been through the parallel parking and also the 90 degree reverse parking? that one really tok-gong one. Different cars have different biting points so be careful eh. especially reversing... XD</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Mantou89, hmm if i am not wrong, ever try cherryQQ manual car with full load ( 5 ppl plus driver) and waiting at the traffic light on the ascending slope...hee. Try half clutch, grasp the biting point. Feel it, feel the pain of your left leg....haha. Still you have your right leg to stamp brake. and left hand either on the gear shifter or hand brake if your left leg on the clutch is giving way....my only wish is to try the porsche manual car... Wooh. havent try yet.</p></div>
