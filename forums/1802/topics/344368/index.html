              <p>Wow SBS3688Y, thanks for understanding! But I doubt the taxi driver u are horning will understand your good intentions.</p>
              <p>In any case always drive defensively when following a taxi. After all a taxi is considered public transport in SG so of course taxis will stop to pickup pax (legally I hope) along roads. Surely one would expect a bus to stop at bus-stops, the same applies to taxis just that outside the CBD, the stops can be practically anywhere. Most taxis will give advance warning by turning on their hazard lights when picking-up or alighting pax, unless the pax suddenly wants to alight as 3688 mentioned. But I do acknowledge that there will always be the occasional black sheep. Baaaa..</p>
              <p>Simple logic : expect a taxi to stop anytime if you are following behind. So keeping a proper distance is important</p>
              <p>Common sense : if possible, don't drive behind a taxi or take the leftmost lane.</p>

              <p>If a women bends down and offers her cunt to you , does it mean you have to take it ..</p>
              <p>From my years of driving and riding bike and the occasional taxi ride , i came to tis conculsion that most SINGAPOREAN TAXI DRIVERS are farking cunts who disregard the safety of others for $$$$$</p>
              <p>it doesnt mean if someone is flagging your taxi down you have to stop right there and then to pick him up .</p>
              <p>For goodness sake taxi drivers , we all know you have to earn money to feed your family and yourself , everyone has to do that as well , but not in the expense of other road users , eSp bikers !!! Dont forget bikers has 2 wheels and 2 brakes only .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly i have lost counts of the no. of time i have f a taxi driver up for doing dangerous stunts like cutting across lanes to pick up passegers or just stop immediatly or some clowns even more funny , they will on their hazard just 1 sec before stopping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I took my class 3 &amp; 2b  license 6yrs ago but i still rememeber this , ALWAYS SIGNAL IN GOOD TIMES!!!</p>

              <p>AN accident occured on Thursday morning at 12.10am.</p>
              <p>The motorcyclist, in his early 20s, was travelling along
                          Rivervale Drive towards Sengkang East Way when his mototcycle skidded
                          whilst negotiating a right bend.</p>
              <p>He mounted a grass verge and was flung a distance of 20 to 30 metres.</p>
              <p>He sustained severe injuries and was taken to Changi General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1am.</p>
              <p><strong>Eyewitnesses should call the Traffic Police hotline at 1800-547-1818</strong></p>
              <p>So like this kind of  motorcyclist accident as like you,can it be avoided.</p>
              <p>Are this not dangerous stunts of performance and cause a  precious young life. ya. So what  precaution  you must take for this happening. Training already given before you get you licence on safety lesson from the training school instrutor. So there are many other kind of road users, not all are on taxi  What ...happenning to this only the dead victim know. who to point middle finger  or cunt now. ya. and  as today happen on Straits Times Latest. stay clear alway from taxi path if they are so dangerous. there are alway two lanes and some four lanes on ant routes, there are still many room to play with your tiny two wheelers keep your distance.ya..friend. i love coffee i love tea this song....so go for your coffee and not the tea is your choice, nobody is stopping you. go.</p>

              <p>Your answer.</p>
              <p>Why are you so unhappy with all the SINGAPOREAN TAXI DRIVERS.</p>
              <p>So  in this Taxi industry more than 25000 taxis or more from those various
                              Taxi companies.</p>
              <p>That included  both shifts, total more than 50000 taxis 
                              hirer or relief drivers male and female in total or more.  Are they not all Singaporeans?, And most SINGAPOREAN TAXI DRIVERS are farking cunts who disregard the safety of others for $$$$$ as you quote.</p>
              <p>Just wondering the father and mother of you, for just the few minutes of pleasure of enjoyment on bed both of them. And you also came out from the same hole that  happen produced you their sibling from your mum,  without any upbringing from them,  is this the way you talk in public. Where is your brain are they not working. YA..</p>

              <p>Would they rather stop safely &amp; explained to passengers why they cannot follow their sudden &amp; dangerous instructions? There may be unreasonable passengers though but will cabbies still get penalised even when they regard safety issues?</p>

              <p><br>point is, try not to ask the cabbie to drop you off at your convenience at places where the traffic is really heavy. yes, i understand that we pay a premium price to take a cab, even though it's classified as public transport, basically because we want to get there quickly, and comfortably. boarding and alighting points are also at our convenience, because cabs can stop along the roads at many areas in singapore. but even if it's to the passenger's convenience to specifically drop him/her off at a certain point, we must use common sense to judge whether by doing this will it risk a collision or confrontation with other angry road users that get annoyed by cabs suddenly stopping without ample warning.</p>
              <p>and let the cabbies know in advance specifically where you want to stop, so he's prepared to switch on the blinkers and gently stop, instead of just stomping the brakes and risking a rear end collision.</p>

              erm, I'm NOT a taxi driver! I'm just another motorist frequently driving on the roads. I always try to be gracious on the roads and put myself in the shoes of public transport drivers. I always give way to public buses on the roads where possible even without having rules to tell me to do so.
              
              A pointer on defensive driving is to maintain sufficient distance from the venicle in front of you. That's what I noticed are common accident prone problems among motorists.

              In fact, I noticed all types of motorists (not only taxi drivers) drive in the manner you've mentioned. Even in HDB driveways, sevaral motorists can't even turn properly and protrude 1.5 times onto the oncoming lane. Same on the roads, esp at bends. 
              
              However, I noticed majority of public bus captains managed to control their giant vehicles well in these aspects! But not so for private bus drivers.
