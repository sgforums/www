              <p>Lianamaster, i disagree with you.</p>
              <p>If the cab dun stop, how do we board &amp; alight? We want to anyhow board &amp; alight also need the cabbies to step on the brake.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The cab, of course, has to stop then we can board but sometimes if the traffic is heavy and the driver sees you and stop, without looking behind, to pick you up, who knows if it will cause an accident?</p>
              <p>But anyway, the LTA has drawn those red &amp; yellow on the lines on certain busy roads to denote no waiting, no parking etc to faciliate smooth traffic flow on the roads...</p>
              <p>Proper taxi stands are set-up in the CBD area for proper boarding of taxis too... so it doesn't harm if we all exercise some caution, be it drivers or passengers.</p>

              <p>SOMETIMES . LOL .</p>
              <p>i rmb a few weeks ago , a stupid cabbie just scolded me and my fren for crossin th T junction during <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GREEN</strong></span> light .</p>
              <p>whad happens was :</p>
              <p>me and my 2 frens , A &amp; B , was walkin home from th bus stop after school at around 5PM ,</p>
              <p>we had to cross th T junction to send A home before going home .</p>
              <p>we walked from th bus stop to 1 , and we waited for green light to cross .</p>
              <p>when green light was on , we walked . We DID NOT jaywalk nor anything ,</p>
              <p>just crossed th roads .</p>
              <p>th TAXI was at 2 , then was trying to swerve to 3 ,</p>
              <p>and he was supposed to wait till ALL pedestrians to cross 1st right ?</p>
              <p>he just swerved , then an oncoming car from 4 , was going on really fast.</p>
              <p>th car didn't have enough time to stop , so he just horned loudly .</p>
              <p>th taxi , i duno whether th driver was doing , and he just swerved to 3 .</p>
              <p>He was LUCKILY 2 seconds later , if not me and my fren was sent flying .</p>
              <p>then we didn't went to find th taxi driver , he should be feelin lucky alr ,</p>
              <p>he stopped at 5 , and horned repeatedly at us .</p>
              <p>We turned to look , he came out , and told us off .</p>
              <p>he scold us " ehh , cross road cross properly ! You almost caused ppl their life !</p>
              <p>Its always <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECONDARY</strong></span> students like <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOUR</span></strong> who caused people who died !"</p>
              <p>then we was like WTH !? we let u off u come back scold me !?</p>
              <p>then we dun care him , and just walked away .</p>
              <p>So from that week on , i especially went out of my way to avoid taxis .</p>
              <p>th stupid driver was ... He should be lucky that me &amp; my fren was too shocked from th near death that we didn't note his plate number .</p>
              <p>If not , im 100% sure , i'll go to his company and complain .</p>
              <p>stupid drivers like this then cost US our lives.</p>
              <p>because , who will be th one injured ?</p>
              <p>US .</p>
              <p>he will at most have his license taken away.</p>
              <p>But we may just die from th impact lor !</p>
              <p>P.S. i know my drawin skills not v. good .</p>
