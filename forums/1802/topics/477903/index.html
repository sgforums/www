              <p>Rich but thru unscrupulous means or poor but making a honest living and able to feed a small family and send kids thru university??</p>
              <p>Not easy to be a TD and no doubts most became TD because of no better choice, but they still made the difficult decision to be one TD..  If not, there are still choices to be security guards or bus driver where if put in more hours (i.e OT), these jobs can bring in enough $$ to the family use..</p>

              If u want to be successful in life, dont be TD.</p>
              <p>TD is pure hard earn money with high risk, high hazard, many
              uncontrol factors on the roads and long hours driving that is
              not good for health. Little money but penalty is extreme
              high on mistake  made.  LTA, TP, taxi companies
              and paxs are always at upper hand when there is dispute. Dont think
              that got FT convert citizen become TD, then think that TD is also
              talent.</p>
              <p>Most of ppl become TD because no better choice.</p>

              Not really, it all depend on how you want to measure successful, but of cos most people will measure it with wealth, but there are people like me and many other TDs in Singapore who measure successful with happiness and peacefulness as the primary needs to be successful, money then become secondary but still a need.
              
              I would say that, people trade off their corporate or working life to become a TD have many reasons, from egostic personality to unable to find a decent paid job after 40s to simply like me, wanted a own time own target kind of life...a wandering monk mentality, might find it very successful and meaningful in life rather than working 8 to 5 behind some guarded gates, fenced perimeter and have to look up at faces to earn a living.
              
              So, the trade off can be a worthly one depending on how peoples want to look at it, more or less meaning, how open are you can determine how successful life you are, you can be rich, but never see open, day in and out killing others careers, mistresses, family problem, business problem,...money making problem..and so on, I find that wasting life.

              The buying part is refer to the past, no matter how much you hv, you cannot buy back your babyhood, youthhood and so on, every sec and minutes went by, it is the past. 
              
              If CK tang knew that he will be having a kidney problem, he will prefer to use his money to buy back the time than going for transplant, what he bought is the future, which will be suffering due to transplant, full medical attention, this cannot eat, that cannot sex...and so on.
              
              If he can go back to his teenage time, he will take care of his kidney, and maybe trade off his Tang group to be just a TD
