              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">SINGAPORE — SMRT will be revamping its training programme for its taxi drivers, bringing “renewed focus” to three key areas, namely, customer service, safe driving, and proficiency in the use of new technology to maximise opportunities, the transport operator said today (Dec 11).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The enhanced training will feature a more robust syllabus with practical training sessions. The two-day programme, which will be launched early next year, will be organised along two main sessions — Operational Excellence and Safe Driving. Currently, SMRT taxi drivers are required to attend a one-day customer service and road safety course.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">As part of the operational excellence session, taxi drivers will learn about taxi operations such as the use of taxi equipment and how they can tap onto new technologies including web portals and third party applications. This will be complemented by a customer service module.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The safe driving session will focus on road safety theory and practical lessons, as well as practical, safe and defensive driving skills.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">“A newer, more comprehensive training package brings greater value to our partners, as they will be better equipped to address the demands of an extremely dynamic industry,” said Mr Benny Lim, managing director of SMRT Roads.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">SMRT also said it is working closely with partners and the authorities to ensure efforts like the two-hirer and relief-driver schemes will help enhance operational standards.</p>

              Provide smlj service?? u provide or not, flag down also the same, surcharges also the same, and if kenna those lj paxs who do not respect taxi driver, smlj service also no use. 
              
              In every education or training, there must be a carrot dangling infront, dun tell me you go take a degree for fun, you go take a degree because you hope to get a higher paid job, you go training and add on skill inorder to get a higher return or promotion.
              
              But Taxi driver training got what certification from training, you go wrong way only and tell the pax you got this and that training certificate, you think pax is going to tell you, it is ok to go wrong way...they will fark you upside down,..and tell you that you can use those certificate to wipe your ass. Smlj training.
              
              Unless you tell me those go for training and get certified can reduce rental by 10%, I think it will be full house, otherwise smlj perk also dun have, train for fark?? for the image of the company? for the taxi companies' mgt? for the govt image?
              
              In the end you provide better service are just free service, more time wasted, and worst, not even get acknowledged by the public.
              
              Even those bak bak I call who provide better service are better paid than those lousy service, but knn taxi driver service good or not, also same, no perk, no extra, no appreciation

              After 10 to 30 years of driving servicing the public, attitude of TD are naturally cultured and carved out by paxs in Singapore, so dun blame the TDs, same goes to many other countries. If pax have a good attitude, naturally TD will provide good services.
              
              Services is never an ending game, you give some, they want more, end up, maybe have to carry pax to the checking in counter. There is a different between how to serve and when to serve. 
              
              How to serve, you can go on teaching those taxi drivers, maybe as newbie, they will practice it, but after a while, why TD become dumb and careless, not even willing to upload baggages, because TD find no perk in servicing coupled with a pathetic fares that alway bring TD income into the lower rung of the society.

              It is because govt sponsored 90%+ for the course fees, totally about 2.5million for taxi operators to spent on training, if not taxi companies will not be so good to ask you to train they will bother more if you dun pay yr rental on time.
