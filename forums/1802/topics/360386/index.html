              <p>ic
              ic. this guide is maybe for taxi driving newbies like me so that I will
              know where to eat and what good food to go for when I'm out there
              earning my daily intake as in where to look for healthy &amp; affordable pricing of food.<br> <br> Nowadays, everywhere is expensive and I agree with what u say, 5-star ratings might not be the best yet costly!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>hmmm, the black vinegar if u want got to let the uncle or Tom know cos normally vinegar will not be added unless requested. As for noodle, only the Fish Noodle is damn Q, the rest of the noodles are normal noodles and tasty only. Sorry for the misunderstanding from my previous post.</p>

              <p>Cos I often see alot of taxi drivers having their breakfast at 10am+ at this coffeeshop. Probably due to the fish cakes and fishton and fishball given which is reasonable for the price ba, so recommend lor. Anyway, it's healthy food ma, not oily type which isn't healthy.</p>
              <p>It is not 24 hours but $2.50 price is quite normal now la.<br><br>Other food sites aren't meant for cabbies I'm not too sure, seldom surf those sites maybe u wanna list some so to share with all cabbies?</p>
