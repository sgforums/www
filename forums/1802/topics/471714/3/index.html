              <p>Knn I think 10 years from now, we will still be talking about your chief and his trusted followers or sheep.</p>
              <p>Everytime the issue dies down, some clown will come and bring it back to life. Or maybe he's so lonely at his forum that he needs to send his commandos here to get us interested in him again! The last time I looked at it, it seemed like a monologue, he talking to himself mainly with his self appointed declared RSM sometimes entertaining him. Knn like that open forum for fark, might as well go on chat.</p>
