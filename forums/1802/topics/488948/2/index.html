              <p>For seasoned TDs, this slowdown is nothing because they already have more than they can handle. So they won't feel it - think because of calls they take. Also they know the roads and lobangs very well so a little slowdown no effect on them one.</p>
              <p>But for newbies, surely affected unless you take more calls and work longer hours &amp; know where to find pax by sweeping. If just blindly sweep and take few calls, confirmed earnings affected. Reason is not just uberx &amp; grabcar competition but also more &amp; more taxis on the road!</p>
              <p>If you drive night, you will know. After 11pm, so many green latterns fighting for so few pax on the road. Long long queues at taxi stands,  lesser calls. Luckily I drive for CDG, still got some calls (but lesser now) and got advantage because can take cabcharge. Also need to turn on all apps - GT, Hailo, Uber for me. Must try to earn as much as possible during the golden period 5pm to 11pm then hope for the best after that.</p>
              <p>So many PMETs jumping in (I am one) right noe. Can't find job after retrenchment due to age or irrelevant skills. More competition for pax. If economy slows and FTs stop coming, even worse.</p>

              When taxi business is down, it does not imply just taxi, it means, the economy is no good, and everyone in many other trades are also not earning as good as before.
              
              Economy is Cyclical, there will be up and down, and today, it is slowing down and the prediction is that it will be down flat for quite some time.
              
              In heyday, 3 affordable paxs looking for 1 cab, in bad times, 3 cabs chiong for 1 pax who can still afford to take cab. That is the truth of our business, as times are no that good, not to the extend of bad, if yr belt can tighten one more hole, please do so, but I guess many local cabbies are so well fed till no hole left
              
              Therefore, as I said during the heydays, TDs need to save, not only for raining day, but also for yr future retirement and any economy big recession

              <p>I have worked in MNCs. Seen it all.  The FT boss finds stupid reasons to sack the local. Then employ his own kind who have zero experience in the field.  If he Aussie, he will employ Aussies.  If French, will employ French.  If Indians, employ Indians.</p>
              <p>Are they better than locals? Bullshit.  All enjoying life here. Free education, free housing, cars.  Milk as much as they can whilst here and after a few years, F**k off.</p>
              <p>The MNC is American.  Why must employ French, Indians with expensive perks and not locals who are equally qualified and experienced without the perks? You tell me.....</p>

              eh...how come my lanjiao lah trademark is seen here.
              
              Brother brother...at times, inner self actualisation is important.so we have to honestly ask ourselves, do we have enough youngs to drive bus or truck / to do mannual labour job / to do servicing jobs? remember we are facing an aging population and low birthrate syndrome that the govt is also unable to solve.
              
              And with a govt policies of Economy first, foreign investment headed by EDB at Raffles City will, at all cost, bring in FI so as to make the economy flambuoyant and more so, a higher GDP, which is an indicator of Civil Servant pays rise and bonuses.
              
              As such, govt have long forgo or even forget about the social needs, pples like you and me, true blue Singaporeans are cast aside and pick whatever breadcrumbers that is left behind. 
              
              And indirectly, our education train labourers, not entrepreneur, because govt know, they need to train our youngs to be the workforce so as to compliment these foreign investor. End up everyday your seeing chio bu, yandao, aunties and uncles of locals struggling for cab, bus and MRT. As govt put it in most of their speeches, we got nothing, human the only resources we have, so do you think they will make you a businessman or in another word, give you own yr own taxi??
              
              As govt chiong for economy at all cost, and forgo social needs, bring in foreign investment and foreign Trash, who are we to blame... the ah nehs, the pinoys, the chao ang mo, the yangon, the vietcongs or the bang kala etc etc? No. As one indian national once correct told me, Uncle, it is your govt asking and welcoming us to come here. Then he said, who vote the govt in yr country?

              Can, but kukujiao abit awkward...use CB lah, a solely better trademark for you..with copyrights too.
              
              The facts is that FTs are not new, it is in the last decades, the influx is too much and the standard of FTs falling, in the 70s, 80s and 90s, we also have FTs, they are the real talented ones who helped us. And they will come only when necessary and need arises, and will go back once contract ended.
              
              However, today, the agendas of FTs is different, with or without job, Govt attracted them in thousands, and mostly from 3rd world countries that do not have well structured and recognized education system. Because the other agenda of is hoping to increase the population.
              
              I believe the intention of our govt is attract as many as we can, then have more variety and choices to pick and choose who be the new citizens, but first, give them PR status first, this is like having loans of durian and hope to find the best Maoshan wang within.
              
              As such, all of a sudden..our streets and towns are filled with FTs, and the basic infrastructure like transportation, hospitals , roads, housing start to give problem, this lead to building of more hospital, more or widening of road, more houses, more buses, mrt, taxis...
              
              And after the watershed election in 2011, govt start to realise their mistakes, and promised to claw back on all these issues, how much they claw back or have clawed back and solve the problem...I dunno, let the next election decide, for election is their report card.

              <p>Why I laugh, do you know in the 70s, my next door neighbours in boon lay garden were construction workers from Blangadesh? They are a friendly bunch of people. Back then, those 3 room HDBs have both citizens and foreign workers. I lived in the highest level. In storey 2, we got chinese and malay boys - glue sniffers, sniffing glue openly in the playground. Then got the BMX gang. BMX from ET movie. I played with those kids - good and bad. So I already know about FT keleng kia when I was young. I already knew in primary school that my HDB was built by indians from india. Life in the 70s was good. Much much better than now. I love the SBS buses with aluminium floor and loud rattling engines in front. The bus drivers go very fast - bus 335 and 196 sent me to school very fast. Nowadays so many cars and traffic jams. I also never hear of bus hitting or running over people. Our local bus drivers must be paid well and got a lot of rest. Not like now - overworked and little pay. PAP go eat shit.</p>

              The PM said, we will slow down and control more tighly on foreign immigration into Singapore. 
              
              He never said, reduce and stop foreigner coming in. He said, foreigner is still a need, we will slow down the influx.

              Brother, brother,...cool down, there are many thing we cannot influence much, all you hv is a vote every 4 to 5 years. All I can said is that, up to now, the govt still fail to understand the ground inspiration and synergy. From your perspectives, it is not merely a job taken by foreigner, it include the sight of them only, makes one boil. And that is serious if everyone start to have the same perspectives

              Well, he is retiring soon, why he needs to worry, he got group of advisors reporting to him 24hrs, no need to worry this and that one lah, he sick also got 12 doctors attending to him, he fly, also got special flight for him, but I just felt that he still fail to touch and understand the heart of SIngaporeans, especially those on ground, and whenever he tried, it looks fake, unlike his father, who really go to the ground and mingle with the peoples to fully understand them which allowed him to set policies accordingly.
              
              As for freedom, he only got Ho Ching at night, that's a bit sad.

              <p>I sometimes also pity lhl. He was born into the job. Dun like also bo pian. Someone got to carry on his father's legacy. If his family totally quit, then all the skeletons in CPF, Temasek and GIC will be exposed. Die liao. If he dont quit and continue this pap nonsense, he will also die one day. Either way LHL got no easy way out. Can he surf porn and pcc? Cannot because his computer got many eyes watching. Can he call chicken? We know its not possible. That is why Tharman also say he dont want the job as pm if he got chance. Dont know real or not. But this is what he say. How many cabbies envy his job? I dont think got many.</p>
              <p>Its better to be a president here. This one really is jiak liao bee job. I am sure any cabby will kee chiu if got chance.</p>

              <p>Bro, your strategy could be wrong lah, don't mind my saying.</p>
              <p>Sweeping is still very good for me. Calls although drop a bit, still good. You must have all the available apps on, sometimes Uber or Hailo or GT or even Easy can help in ulu places and ulu times. In ulu places or past peak, just grab any calls lah, cannot choose.</p>
              <p>For me sweeping at night, need to be alert. Sometimes can miss street pax because too dark so need to look out like a hawk. Like last night, spotted a girl under the shadows waving along Yio Chu Kang rd near Upper Thomson. Almost cannot see. Go to Simei, good fare mah.</p>
              <p>So you need to be alert, know where to sweep, know what and when to grab calls. Still quite good takings lah.</p>
