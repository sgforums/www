              <p>Hey bro, u r not alone . Like foolish-2000I'm 1.5 years and still blur in the west area. I still use GPS for certain areas too. And nowhere near $7k too.  Sometimes if GPS says turn right, I will confirm with pax first. If pax says "yeah, turn right" then I turn. Else follow pax directions. </p>
              <p>It takes time. U will slowly discover the shorter way to certain destinations. Some taught by nice pax, others self discovered. When i first started, i have to think for a while which route to take. Now almost auto. If really cannot think or not sure ask pax.</p>
              <p>Dun think about how much more u can earn doing other jobs. Can be quite depressing and will affect your morale to drive. Just drive and sweep. If got call and confident to take, take it. End of day, if collection hit target, good. If more consider as bonus. Never hit, well theres always tomorrow.</p>

              <p>Hey bro, u r not alone . Like foolish-2000I'm 1.5 years and
              still blur in the west area. I still use GPS for certain areas too.
              And nowhere near $7k too.  Sometimes if GPS says turn right, I
              will confirm with pax first. If pax says "yeah, turn right" then I
              turn. Else follow pax directions. </p>
              <p>It takes time. U will slowly discover the shorter way to certain
              destinations. Some taught by nice pax, others self discovered. When
              i first started, i have to think for a while which route to take.
              Now almost auto. If really cannot think or not sure ask pax.</p>
              <p>Dun think about how much more u can earn doing other jobs. Can
              be quite depressing and will affect your morale to drive. Just
              drive and sweep. If got call and confident to take, take it. End of
              day, if collection hit target, good. If more consider as bonus.
              Never hit, well theres always tomorrow.</p>
