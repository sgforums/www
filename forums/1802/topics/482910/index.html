              Funeral companies make you PAY and PAY for EVERYTHING, to take advantage of family's grief and also the greedier need to impress relatives. There are virtually NO REGULATIONS ON FUNERAL BUSINESSES in Singapore, only the basic health and safety ones. The attitude is that 'if you don't pay a lot of $$$ when your relative dies, it shows you don't love them as much.' My belief is that so long as you don't do anything that obviously dishonours the dead person, then a funeral should be more catered to ease the grief of people still alive...
               
              I will break down what happens in steps, since people are not usually very familiar with funeral arrangements.
               
              1. After the funeral company is called, they arrive and take the body for storage. Not much happened here. But I'm a little annoyed that they tried to remove my grandmother's jade ring to pass to my mother and ended up cutting her finger...
               Still, an accident is an accident....I ignored this.
               
              2. You go to the funeral parlour to arrange the funeral. My mother booked everything in my name because I was the only one carrying an IC at the time. 
              
              3. You choose what room, what coffin, how many days, what sort of food, what flower arrangement etc...Choosing the room was straightforward, we knew relatives would travel during the weekend so the room was fairly small since they would not stay around for a long time.  
              Cost of room was almost eight hundred dollars for the first night, and almost $500 for each night afterward! I asked what were provided with the rooms. Aircon, a fridge, a stand to put the coffin, a wall-hanging themed with the deceased's religion, a posterphoto to say who she was, a cleaner who would sweep it once a day. The only really special thing that it had was a ventilation system to suck away candle smoke and insense burnings.
               
              If you think about it, you can use a room in someone's house for a lot cheaper....&gt;_&gt; ....btw do you know that setting up a Buddhist or Taoist funeral in a void deck or field is at least THREE TIMES as expensive?
               
              The staff talk to you like they are selling a handphone plan...it was usually me who negotiated as politely as possible for a reasonable price; but my mother insisted on making the final choices. I knew she was stressed and instead of going to the trouble of arranging a home funeral, she wanted the Pearl Room. Okay. Fine.
               
              4. Choose the coffin.
               Selling coffin like selling cars....the staff will bring you to a back room and ALWAYS show the most expensive coffin first and then go all the way down to the 'cardboard coffin'. the most expensive ones easily cost SEVERAL thousands of dollars, the cheapest one around $350. The most expensive ones are made of solid hardwood (think of the trees!) with real brass handles (which is going into a cremator) are lined with real satin (again, going to be cremated) and are HUGE 
              
              The salesperson will go on and on about how the coffin is 'your most precious, last gift to your deceased'. From what I know about my grandmother, she wouldn't give a damn as long as rites were followed; and like i said before, i see a funeral as a time to care for the living. My preference was for the second cheapest model which was a bit small, but had a glass window for people to see my grandmother's face, and was made of recycled wood which was painted over and polished...about another $850. the handles were plastic but painted metallic. 
              
              At least I spending another $1500 on the coffin she was looking at. If you could buy a coffin at IKEA, it would probably only cost as much as the cardboard one....I don't believe a big cardboard box should cost $350, a recycled wood box $850 and a new wood box $XXXX...especially since its going to be cremated!
               
              Even when I picked the $850 coffin, the saleswoman still kept going..."are you sure", "Its your LAST GIFT" etc...I only shut her up when a brilliant idea popped in my head. I asked her:
               
              "What colour is the floor of the Room?"
               
              "Erm..."
               
              "I don't want the coffin to be the same colour as the floor. A lot of the old relatives have poor eyesight and I don't want them to bump into the coffin..."
               
              "Let me check for you..."
               
              As I suspected, the cheaper coffins were actually LEAST similar in colour to the floor, you can a cheap coffin at $280 only, so dun get cheated.!!

              You asking about casket rental or taxis?? for casket, no rental.
                      
              For taxi, rental is subject to each companies' commanded prices, and it is up to individual to weight the differences and decide to rent it or not, if he or she decided to rent it out to earn a living, he or she will decide on the sublet prices he or she wish to sublet out to get relief. Whatever the cost of vehicle including COE is of no concern to the Hirer nor his or her relief as the property of it remain with the companies.

              <p>Even when I picked the $850 coffin, the saleswoman still kept going…”are you sure”, “Its your <span>LAST GIFT</span>” etc…I only shut her up when a brilliant idea popped in my head. I asked her:</p>
              <p>“What colour is the floor of the Room?”</p>
              <p>“Erm…”</p>
              <p>“I don’t want the coffin to be the same colour as the floor. A lot of the old relatives have poor eyesight and I don’t want them to bump into the coffin…”</p>
              <p>“Let me check for you…”</p>
              <p>As I suspected, the cheaper coffins were actually <span>LEAST</span> similar in colour to the floor, you can a cheap coffin at $280 only, so dun get cheated.!!</p>

              Yandao Elginang, at least you are a little bit englightened, what I trying to let TDs here know is that, as a TD, especially those full timer, do not keep living in the cocoon of your taxi and everything is about taxi, there are many other thing in you life that you can go for beside taxi driving.
              
              Taxi driving is the least worry of all trade, because it is the most easier entry as long as you hold a TVDL&lt; today register, today can drive already. But after years and months of driving, most forget that there is a outside world full of other colorful thing to do and see, go for it, try it, even if cannot, at least learned something, and as said, can alway come back as a TD. 
              
              I have buddies who had been driving for 20 over years as taxi drivers still behaving like the  80s time, totally lost contact with the actual world which had changed tremendously, perhap that is their comfort zone, and that result in their ever complain about higher and higher rental, newer and newer gadgets like MDT to learn. But that is minor in comparing to the real world, the changes are much much faster than your 4 wheels cart.
              
              So if one wish to get out of the comfort zone of driving TAxi, go for it, because taxi driving is not a long service job, there is nothing between a 20years driver and a 3 years driving experience driver, and for a driver who had left and come back, it is the same shit, but different assholes only

              In regard to checking vehicle datas, it is only for info, as said, Hirer is the one who sign out the vehicle, he is responsible for it, and he command what prices he wants to charge the relief, relief can choose to not to take it or take it, for all we know, a relief can just drive one day and throw key liao.
              
              Hirer charge too high, nao chee nao lan, he also cannot get relief, not to mention holding on to a permanent one
              
              Hirer charge too low, chin chai chin chai, he lose out and relief start to take advantage of him
              
              Hirer follow market pricing, discuss with relief nicely and set rules that both agree upon, relief might drive long for him, because at the end of the day, human needs a system to function, for that system to work, hirer must ensure he discuss with relief, then set a system and work on it, and if one violate it, one is to answer for it.
              
              Just like a mere junction, because human cannot let go of each other or give way, govt have to set up traffic light system, and then got human go and beat the red light, govt put up the cam system, and then you see human began to behave and get civilised.
