              <p><img src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/sites/default/files/public/article/images/featured/2012/07/1221180.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">SINGAPORE: While waiting in line for passengers late one night, cabbie Han Poh Guan witnessed a taxi in front slide and hit a wall as its driver had fallen asleep without pulling up the handbrake.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is common for taxi drivers to doze off on the job because of prolonged driving without a good rest, said the 57-year-old.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Long hours and sedentary conditions are perennial complaints among taxi drivers here, many of whom work beyond the 12-hours-per-day guideline suggested by the Manpower Ministry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A recent study among 231 cabbies here also found that one in three of them experience driver fatigue, with those who work longer hours - more than 10 hours a day - reporting a higher chance of dozing off inadvertently.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>More than half (55 per cent) of taxi drivers surveyed said they do not take any day off.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The study - the first to look at risk factors of fatigue driving among taxi drivers here - was conducted by the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health and published in this month’s issue of the Singapore Medical Journal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">There was also a higher proportion of cabbies, relative to the adult population in Singapore, who reported chronic ailments such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and high cholesterol.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">While there are currently no official guidelines on taxi drivers’ work hours and rest periods, the researchers said their findings give cause to review existing policies and implement measures to address sleep-deprived driving, such as educating drivers to recognise when weariness creeps in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">National Taxi Association (NTA) executive adviser Ang Hin Kee said cabbies drive for long hours to cover high overheads.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The Land Transport Authority’s regulations requiring a minimum percentage of taxis to undertake a daily mileage of at least 250km also contribute to cabbies’ daily grind, he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Taxi drivers whom TODAY spoke to said they have to work long hours to make ends meet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“Rent and fuel costs can go up to S$190 a day and I have to take up to 30 trips to see net income growth,” said Mr Han, who drives from 6pm to 6am every day.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">While he tries to get at least eight hours of sleep daily, this is often affected by the time he reserves for his family. “I have no time and money to exercise or go for check-ups,” said the ComfortDelGro driver.</span></p>

              High rental is only a factor, but not necessary can lead to fatigue and sleeping. And for that matter, lowering of rental might not lower accident rates due to fatigue, it might increase as driver will want more.
                          
              There are many other factors that led one to get tired and sleep while driving.
                          
              I look at it at 2 conditions, 1st, the enviromental factor, 2nd, the human factor (self)
                          
              Environmental factor include weather, road Jam, pax behavorial problem, high rental, high cost of living, govt and companies change of policies, aging, hit too many no shows, too many traffic camera and so on.
                          
              Human factor is more of self inflicted factors such as gambling, kiam ah long, relationship and family problem, mistresses, too much sex, PCC, eat and eat.. sleep too less, set to high target, and one of the most common, never learn on how to let go and go home.
                          
              As for enviromental, there is not much you can change, as it is more of a nature, like naturally, you will grow old and weak, but many still think they are in their 20s. That is a major problem. The other human factor need lot of self discipline, otherwise,
                          
              EVEN IF TOMORROW companies will to lower their rental, there will still be accident, because lowering of rental might instead encourage the driver to drive longer to make more..like with lower diesel cdg, most cdg driver dun mind chiong to AP or go woodland and then empty chiong back to town.. like my CT bro akaæ­¦æ�¾...pirus, because of lower fuel prices, he can chiong empty to AP so as to give lau Uncle me a chance to play in CBD 13 paxs
