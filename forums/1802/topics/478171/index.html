              <p>I don't think so. Those days old camera can only shoot 1 lane at a time. I escaped because I was in the wrong lane along Lornie (doing 110kmh). That camera can only capture 1 lane at a time. Then my friend in TP said they have changed to widescope camera, can capture all 3 lanes.</p>
              <p>But TS no need worry if going 100kmh at Tg Katong, that one is 90kmh if I'm not wrong, so plus minus 10-15kmh, they usually let go. Plus your speedo not very accurate if show 100kmh might actually be somethng like 97-98kmh, still quite safe. Just be careful where the signs say 80kmh, that one you drive 97-98, high chance will kena.</p>

              No lah, unless, it is a case of civil offences, like hit and run, killed someone, or get sued by someone, there you go court, otherwise for individual traffic offence, it will settle at TP office unless you want to get a lawyer to pursue a $200 fines cum 6 points, whcih all I can said is appeal, if fail, see MP, if fail again, just pay and learn from it lah.
              
              On the road, if a driver never get a traffic offence in his driving time, he is not an experience driver...or drive very little bit, I also got my fair share of offences, got once even argue at maxwell, the old TP HQ, end up, the commissioner told me, if either you paid $150 (last time lesser) - 6 pts or you get a lawyer to fight your case, and if you lose, you hv to pay $7000 on top of that $150 to our police lawyer and the judge time. Now is 10k if you loose.
