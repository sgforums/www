              <p style="line-height: 12pt; margin: 0.25in 0in 11.25pt;"><span>Taxis in Singapore have a very colourful history. Back in the old days, you could negotiate with the cabbie on the taxi fare, unlike the current meter system, whose systematic calculation leaves no room for error.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12pt; margin: 0.25in 0in 11.25pt;"><span><strong>And not just anyone can become a taxi driver back then. In 1971, Singapore's taxi drivers were picked out by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew during a ballot to select taxi drivers.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12pt; margin: 0.25in 0in 11.25pt;"><span>Taking a taxi from Bukit Panjang to Lim Chu Kang cost just 40 cents per person. Now, a similar journey will probably cost you at least $8 or more.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12pt; margin: 0.25in 0in 11.25pt;"><span>There were also 'pirate taxis' back then. Some people used their cars as unlicensed public-services vehicles to serve the public's tranportation needs. They used private houses as contact points and issued call cards to publicise their transport services.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 12pt; margin: 0.25in 0in 11.25pt;"><span>Not forgetting these historical facts, local taxi drivers are pretty much an indelible part of the public transportation network, with their own views and colourful languages to entertain their passengers.</span></p>

              <p>Cut the crap lah! Don't try to gain sympathy votes for your so called bro Pool here.</p>
              <p>@benqeperson, you got slapped in one face, you give your other side to get slapped too? @Hpgin, no offence to you, but you are not a regular contributor to the taxi driver forum also what.  The same people here have also contributed to the taxi driver forum.  Why are they troublemakers only now?</p>
              <p>Make no mistake.  That taxi driver forum was shut down by the owner on his own accord and without any regard to the regular contributors there.  He and he alone caused the demise of that forum. Don't expect sympathy from me.  If you sympathise with that, then you are just a blind follower and easily manipulated.</p>
              <p>Post in threads where you find interesting not because some guy or gal owned it.  By all means, you are free to join any group, Palringo or otherwise.  But, you don't have to put down others as troublemakers or what not.</p>
              <p>And I believe this word "troublemakers" came from Pool himself when you guys were talking to him.  Tio bo?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> Poolman regulate the site own by him cos as forum owner,
                                            does he have the right to decide what direction he want his site to be? But
                                            JDIL one one side accuse people of abusing his right and on the other side, did
                                            just right. Who is more wrong?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">This guy is not even a taxi driver. Bless with such good
                                            luck as to strike a big sum of money, he is certainly not appreciating what his
                                            good karma has got him and enjoy life but now has got nothing better to do than
                                            go around creating bad karma.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> Read properly, he just have a personal grudge to settle.
                                            Especially when he said those words that sent chill out of my spine – <span style="color: #ff0000;">cutting
                                            grass must destroy the roots</span>. Destroy his roots? Really need that? As if Poolman kills his whole family!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As some guys here said it right, he is just out
                                            to destroy the taxi forum and he is not even fit to offer an alternative and
                                            certainly do not have the standing and the charisma to do that. Then what
                                            happen after that?</p>

                                            me during my down period, I regret that I let in a demon in you in your return.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Just because people here give you some praises, you took it
                                            like suddenly u become a few level up and think your self even fit enough to go
                                            around acting like a big chief.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Your action here reminds me of my daughter, daddy dun give u
                                            sweet, go ask mummy, mummy said no, go ask ah gong and then ah ma.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Just because your “chief advisor” thread got censor, you got
                                            to go other sub forum and bad mouth here, bad mouth there. My respect for u all
                                            gone la. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You obvious never learn the art of being a modern day Father. The secret of being a great modern day Father is to learn to keep your mouth shut instead of going around trying ways and means and different channels to get yourself and yr great opinion heard. One of this day, your kid u will you - Lame la Uncle.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I already told Poolman, what he did was right and the best
                                            move.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">U guys really make me think of the Singapore political
                                            situation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">U want the brain and leadership of the PAP but you dun want
                                            to pay them what there deserve.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> You want them to do what is needed for a fraction of their
                                            salary and expect them to have a spirit to serve which u talk cock only but if
                                            you are in their place, you won’t do it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You want peace and stability and yet, you want freedom.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You yourself don’t want to shit of owning the website and do
                                            all the shit job but you expect others to do it, and you just want the freedom
                                            to come in an fark as u wish and go off.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In this world, in this Singapore, got so good deal meh?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Poolman, if u got chance to read this, you did the right
                                            thing man!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> There is life after taxi forum, not like in here, no life,
                                            doing so much shit for ppl and they not only dun appreciate but still want
                                            more, more on their term.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Does that remind you of PAP, lose a few seats, still go
                                            around giving freebie, but people not only dun appreciate, still asking for
                                            more but still losing another seat.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">These are all real unappreciative. You spent your time
                                            masturbating at least can have a moment of self gratification.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If I am PAP’s LSL, come 2016, I allow myself to lose control
                                            of the government, like what poolman did. Suddenly LTK (JDIL) will find himself
                                            in the position that he got to be PM, wtf, balls shrink. Who? Me? See how much
                                            Singapore lose, see how much this forum lose.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now for the celebration. Let’s see how long u can last.
                                            Continue the bashing. You guys need them to boost up your readership. Without
                                            this, u be a dead forum like the limo group.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I am offering myself now, this kiam pak face, for u to bash,
                                            Continue to bash, see how long you can bash.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The moment I wrote this post, I know and is prepared for what to expect and I owe it to Poolman, someone who give me a hand in my worst moment of my life.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After all that basjing, what will happen? any better alternative for our forummers?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">No substance means no substance.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">We need a leader who can do more things than showing nice
                                            photos and graphics. We need people who can do more than carry balls.</p>
