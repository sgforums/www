              <p>So I'll keep him busy with his moderator duties. He wants to delete, delete lor, delete 100x also for me nothing much. Just cut and paste, cut and paste.</p>
              <p>Plus 1 got a new policy 1 deletion or edit = 1x stupidity, childishness and immaturity. So if delete 5x = 5x that la.</p>

              <p>I will accept criticism and blame for my actions. Yes it was not nice, I freely admit it.</p>
              <p>But what I did was reactionary - like Newton's Law of Physics -for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
              <p>The problem did not start yesterday but months ago maybe earlier, when Poolman decided that the TD forum was his personal forum to push whatever agenda he deemed to his and his kakis benefit. He forgot that it was a public one.</p>
              <p>He started insulting races, accusing the juduciary of bias, the police of ineptitude, started making wild claims and allegations witout facts, Then when ppl started pointing this out, he began deleting and editing threads, refusing to take in criticism in an adult way.</p>
              <p>He wanted to be a child, so the only way was to behave like a child to him in return, so he got a taste of his own medicine. Which he couldn't take and in a petty huff closed the TD forum down.</p>
              <p>The TD forum which he had hijacked from this forum because he wanted the power and glory to himself. He wanted to be the Mentor and Chief to all taxi drivers, but he forgets he's still very junior and taxi driving is a personal thing, no need for seniors and mentors, just plain hard work, with the occasional point of view and advise.</p>
              <p>I may be a poor example as a taxi driver but I can safely in my taxi driving years I did not</p>
              <p>1) Cheat a pax of $150 for a fare</p>
              <p>2) Did not hit a woman</p>
              <p>3) Did not encourage my fellow drivers to break the law.</p>
              <p>All this he did and many more.</p>
              <p>So if you guys want a mentor like that, please feel free, it's none of my concern.</p>
              <p>The whole problem was very simple, my actions was a reaction to his, all he needed to do, is change, promise to stop posting rubbish and respect the views of all forummers.</p>
              <p>He couldn't bring himself to do that, his ego didn't allow it. It was left to Uncle Joe to take a stand and say enough is enough.</p>
              <p>I didn't have a problem with anybody else did I? Why only him? If he backed down, I surely would have followed suit.</p>
              <p>If Fireice had her way many of the things he started would not have been allowed, but he wanted the power to himself and ultimately abused it.</p>

              <p>Joeraj, when fireice unlock and shifted your thread to singapore taxis i see it as a good chance for forum members to share their opinion on how the mod and owner taxi driver forum should be running it.</p>
              <p>I was also expecting the same from you since you are the threadstarter, instead you spend your time spamming taxi driver forum every thread on pg1.</p>
              <p>I could only conclude one agenda that you have in your differences with poolman, you are going all out just to destroy taxi driver forum.</p>
              <p>JR, your sparring with poolman isnt the first and also wont be the last. Let me give you 2 past examples.</p>
              <p>JDIL vs Poolman - i have seens many arguments between them mostly like wat you always highlight deleting and edit of posts and thread even to the extend of asking JDIL to leave forum. Eventually JDIL did..and went on to limo forum as a mod, but did JDIL behave like wat you did to taxi driver forum. No he didnt.</p>
              <p>BCL vs Poolman - Everytime the bashing topics on CDG comes up you will see both of them wacking each other cialat, sometimes to certain extend forumners might even think that both of them are bitter enemies online. But do BCL goes around spamming like you eventho he isnt happy. No he didnt.</p>
              <p>To all forums moderators and subforum owner, lets hear your opinion.</p>
              <p>How would you react to such spamming from a forumner when he/she doesnt agree to how you run your sub-forum in SGForum?</p>
              <p>Do you encourage such spamming act?</p>
              <p>Poolman,</p>
              <p>Unlock all thread la, if JR wanna spam just let it be...wats the point of locking,deleting and editing. Nowsdays one screenshot everything capture liao.</p>
              <p>JR, taxi drivers forum isnt just about poolman, its more than that.</p>

              <p>we are all adults, no kids on school holidays here, to be a taxi driver must 30 years old, somehow this issue degenerated into name calling and post deleting</p>
              <p>i figure the split is too deep, the argument has escalted to a point where probably nothing can be done to appease each party.</p>
              <p>this taxi forum, the limo forum, and the taxi drivers forum has become too public, with too much exposure, and ultimately has proven to be detrimental to taxi driving...</p>
              <p>i have made many good friends through the forum, from total strangers to becoming friends who support each other, share info about driving and take our nite time breaks together. joking supporting and keeping each other awake through the nite. since the palringo group started, i noticed i drive more motivated, longer hours, happier and much better takings. </p>
              <p>Seeing the forum destruct in such a way because of individual ego trips is sad in a way, but i think ultimately for the best. i think the taxi drivers will form our own grouping/palringo and forum and info sharing will continue abeit behind closed doors and in not such a public forum as sgforum.</p>
              <p>there are many things we encounter and perhaps ways in which we need to defend ourselves as taxi drivers that are best just shared within our profession, and should not be exposed to the public. perhaps in a more restricted environment, such an argument wouldnt have escalated into having to close down the forum. after all if there isnt the need to defend ones ego so vigoriously then the need to esclate it and start name calling and shit stirring also lessens.</p>
              <p>i figure that perhaps its time to start on a clean slate, delete all the past discussions in the taxi drivers forum, erase all the eniminities, info in the limo forum and in this forum can remain,after all that isnt under our control. We will still continue to share info in the palringo platform and we will evolve to suit our needs, the needs of the taxi driver. time to move on</p>
              <p>just my twenty two cents worth.</p>
