              <p>Ditch all surcharges, impose all-day levies at far-flung places or introduce even more surcharges to solve the longstanding problem of disappearing taxis just before the peak period.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">These are some of the solutions that experts, industry players and taxi drivers have suggested, after the issue resurfaced recently.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The Straits Times reported on Sept 8 that cabs at Changi Airport seemed to have gone missing just before peak-hour surcharges kicked in, leaving travellers waiting for more than 30 minutes for a cab.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The Straits Times received more than 10 forum letters on the issue of how best to solve this problem.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Surcharges were meant to better match supply and demand. But many, like cabby Colin Wong, have called for peak-hour and location levies to be axed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Their rationale? Cabbies already know where and when passengers need cabs most, so there is no need to incentivise them. "We know where and when passengers need cabs... We will still go to where there will be demand and business," said Mr Wong, 53.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Removing all surcharges will placate commuters unhappy about the current fare structure, which they say is confusing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There are close to 10 different flag-down fares, three metered-fare structures, more than 10 kinds of surcharges and eight types of phone-booking fees.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Senior Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo said last November that the Government is looking at simplifying the current taxi-fare structure to make it less confusing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But earlier this year, she said this might lead to higher taxi rentals and fares - a possible result of covering the shortfall that drivers face when the surcharges are removed, experts explained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When contacted, the Transport Ministry said it is still "studying this carefully to ensure that taxi commuters and drivers are not worse off if any changes are made".</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">SIM University urban transport management expert Park Byung Joon backed the idea of simplifying the fare structure but keeping the airport levy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"Unlike shopping centres in the middle of city, the airport is away from the city centre... There must be an incentive for taxi drivers to go to the airport."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Dr Park said the airport surcharge could be tiered according to plane-arrival schedules to give cabbies more incentive to go when cabs are needed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Transport economist Michael Li from Nanyang Business School said the difficulty is deciding on a surcharge amount that does not result in a cab crunch elsewhere.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"It's a basic service standard, but it should not make it a disincentive for those plying in the city," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Experts noted that removing surcharges would be a massive exercise. In the interim, companies could add more surcharges to fix the current problem.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, Ang Hin Kee (MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC), who is also an adviser to the National Taxi Association, said this was a multi-faceted problem.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"Cab operators and taxi drivers are operating within the tight parameters of a competitive fare and revenue environment, and<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> there is not much room for adjustment,"</strong></span> he said.</span></p>

              1.6millions verus 27 thousand taxis, 
              Given one way trip
                      
              each taxi = 59 trips per day. Again divided by 2 shifts approx 30 trips per driver.
                      
              This was what I present to the board, given that there is no surcharges but compensated thru fares increment, each driver taking 30 trips per day to some is normal, to others can be a death threat to up lorry fast.

            <div class='col-md body'>Therefore if each driver take only 20 trip max per shift, each taxi would had took 40 trips per day instead of 60 trips, a shortage of 20 trips, and with 27,000 thousands taxi, there will be 540,000 trip in a group of 4 paxs not serve or unable to get a cab</div>

              However, not to worry lah, of the 1.6millions in group of 4 paxs, nearly 600,000 do not take public transport (pte car owners), 200,000 never take taxi or will not take taxi other than MRT and buses. Remember all these figures are in group of 4 (a family nuclear)
                  
              So in total, we got only 800,000 in group of 4 taking cab, therefore the trip would had reduced further to 15 trips per shift only.  And that each taxi per day can get 30 trips if equally shares, so when my ah Fool today take 25 trips per shift, someone will be OBK

              Of course talking so much still cannot solve the above problem, what I am trying to preach is that we got enough taxis on the road, so taxi companies, plse do not increase anymore taxis, because more and more current taxi drivers will go OBK with people like my ah fool and many others chiongsters who die die target $200 net per shift type.
              
              This problem started and get noticed because of Airport issues, AP being the forefront of Singapore, must be presentable, otherwise given a world Nos 1 Airport status but no taxis is totally a laughing stock.
              
              So, to solve this problem, concentrating on where you want a smoother taxis availiability, my suggestion is AP on weekends be given full day $5 surcharges starting from friday 5pm all way to Monday 6am.

              <p>Of course talking so much still cannot solve the above problem,
              what I am trying to preach is that we got enough taxis on the road,
              so taxi companies, plse do not increase anymore taxis, because more
              and more current taxi drivers will go <span>OBK</span> with people like my ah fool and many others chiongsters who die die
              target $200 net per shift type.</p>
              <p>This problem started and get noticed because of Airport issues,
              AP being the forefront of Singapore, must be presentable, otherwise
              given a world Nos 1 Airport status but no taxis is totally a
              laughing stock.</p>
              <p>So, to solve this problem, concentrating on where you want a
              smoother taxis availiability, my suggestion is AP on weekends be
              given full day $5 surcharges starting from friday 5pm all way to
              Monday 6am.</p>

              <p>Write until I don't know what you are saying???</p>
              <p>In short, it's not that we do not have enough taxis to cater for the demands...just that at certain time, taxis will be at a location where the demand is not high as they need to ferry paxs to that destination....</p>
              <p>Bowah, after writing so long... you only touch on AP. How about the rest???</p>

              To be frank, one of the most competency of our govt is speaking and writing but no solution, because writing and speaking long long will tire many people out..and once you get tired listeneing to them, blur blur in reading their writing..you give up, and they won.
              
              Taxis shortage at certain period of time is not something new, and it is also not something TD wish or purposely let it happen.
              
              When I talk about the AP flock of birds flying here and there, people must know that Taxi drivers are also small time businessmen, and in the context of business, if you are not cunning and skrew, you either lost or earn lesser, therefore, authority and public must look from this perspectives before making any accusation and changes

              <p>Peak hour surcharges apply to everywhere not only airport.  It should happen to everywhere no only airport. Hence, it is not correct to use peak hour surcharges as the excuse that airport no taxi.  If no pax going to airport, of course, no taxi lah. If airport no surcharge, u tink TD will queue there. Wait long long.</p>
