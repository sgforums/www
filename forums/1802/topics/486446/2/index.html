              Cannot, in the eyes of respective govt insitutions, Taxi driving in Singapore is a private entity, it is no more a state own entity.
              
              Therefore to create a centralise system is beyong any open market concept, by which, in Singapore, whereby we embrace free trade, should not be so centralise and allow no flexibility, it should be diverse and allow flexibility inorder to consider as an open market economy.
              
              The authority must therefore encourage more taxi players into the market to create a competitive and yao society, incentives such as surcharges are critical in any business so as to align itself to the demand and supply chain. eg, like resturant charging high on weekends and dinner.
              
              As our economy move up the value chain, we, as shown recently, lost our manufacturing effectiveness, but gain on our Service sector especally on Data and financial sectors, this alone had bought in more wealth to locals and also more rich flocking to our land including facebook owner. Therefore, we see a change in our demographic in way of highter disparity in income, from poor locals to super rich ones who can even buy europe football club.
              
              Thus, taxi industrial player including TD must know who are their pax today..and truly ask yourself, is surcharges going to effect them, or that our Taxi fare in singapore is a 3rd world standard plying on a 1st world land. If you do not know your customers, you dunno nothing of your business.

              <p>Dun talk about Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal cos that one for Prime Taxis only. lol.</p>
              <p>1,2 and 3 are the main locations that taxis go to.  Remove 4 to 7 also make no difference to taxi driver lah...Let the pax there go and rot lah...</p>

                              <p>Basic thing is currently taxi drivers more enough to cover their
              rental &amp; other taxi related expences due to high peak hour
              surcharges and etc perks. Thats why they don't have hungry and they
              choose their time to drive &amp; choose the passenger too &amp; on
              the manual operating busy indications frequently too. Also they do
              change system &amp; made $ from it too. You can see many taxis
              sleeping at HDB carparks nowadays. So the govt to interfere and set
              the centralise system. PAP has full majority at parliment &amp; can
              do any in a day or two when they decide. </p>
