              <p>A man was pronounced dead by paramedics while two male drivers were 
              conveyed conscious to hospital in the aftermath of a horrific three-car 
              accident along the East Coast Parkway in the wee hours of Saturday 
              morning (Jul 13).<br><br>A STOMPer had sent in a report of the accident,
               coupled with photos that showed two of the cars which were now reduced 
              to a mangled heap of metal after the accident.<br><br>In response to a query from STOMP about the matter, <strong>a spokesperson for the police</strong> said:<br><br>"The police received a call at 12.01am (Jul 13) requesting for assistance near the 18km mark along the ECP heading towards AYE.<br><br>"Upon arrival, it was established that an accident involving 3 cars had occurred.<br><br>"A man in his 30s was pronounced dead by paramedics on the scene.<br><br>"Two male drivers were conveyed conscious to hospital.<br><br>"Police investigations are ongoing"<br><br>Speaking to STOMP in a phone conversation, the STOMPer said:<br><br>"I
               came across an accident that took place along the ECP near Prince 
              Edward Road, in the direction heading towards AYE at around 2.30am to 
              3.30am earlier today (Jul 13).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Apparently, I heard that a red 
              Lotus car was travelling in the direction towards Changi Airport, before
               it skidded and flung towards traffic heading in the other direction.</span><br><br>"It then hit another car. If I'm not wrong, a few other cars were involved in the accident as well.<br><br>"I can't be exactly sure about this but I think the male driver of the red Lotus died on the scene.<br><br>"I'm not really sure what happened to the other drivers, but I think he or she was conveyed to hospital.<br><br>"The accident caused a jam on the ECP as it took up about three lanes, which then had to blocked off."</p>

              <p>I already said many times liao, that stretch of road after keppel into rocher at ECP is not mend for normal vehicle user, it is mend for F1 training. So, be careful.</p>
              <p>First, lanes marking on that stretch were done by Indian Road worker direct import from Gujarat, and all these gujaratis are good in marking buffalo lane in their town only.</p>
              <p>Secondly, along the curvy road, come the filtering from prince edward which also can filter into Marina financial centre and bayfront side, then from bay front another filtering out into ECP again.</p>
              <p>Third, after keppel, the ECP go into a down slop, and all vehicles tend to accelerate on the downslope. If you are at 120km/hr and making a curve, that is more than F1 maclaren turning at only 80km/hr</p>
              <p>Fourth, many like to change lanes suddenly, because some blur king see sign only, just turn in, slip road into marina FC is dammit, very dangerous.</p>
              <p>Fifth, to evade road block/ spot check for drink at victoria and bugis, these drinking drivers go whack ECP from prince edward, knowing that ECP sure got no road block, and with drink driver driving on a turbo 2.0 and above engine, God bless all of us.</p>
              <p>Lastly, if a crown taxi driver like me can think of all these, what the fark is TP doing? still at victoria street catching ferrais??</p>

              <p>And this morning 4 am just saw a van accident there again, I was travelling toward changi from taman jurong, and the van on the road is facing on coming traffic, must have turned dunno how many 360 deg, see the driver gong gong blur blur liao.</p>
              <p>And it is of luck that the traffic was less, if in mid day, sure tua ki liao, that time, can jam until tuas.</p>
              <p>I know that many of my TD brother drivers are very hyperactive or suffered from hypertension, I am also one of them, when got a call at taman jurong to go changi at midnite, yet the pax is a bak bak chio bu...my adrenaline shoot up, but no matter what, at that stretch of the road, I must loon, want to come out or chiong also must loon.</p>
              <p>So brothers, the case of OBK or HUAT is secondary to safety on the road, our family do not want us to go out in a car and come back in a box, nor do they wish to see your bank deposit box money grow but body in a casket box.</p>
              <p>Make safety your uptmost priorty, otherwise someone would say, another less idiot on the road.</p>

              <p>The driver of a Lotus, which was involved in a fatal three-car accident in ECP on last Saturday morning, was the award-winning CEO of an integrated sub-sea services company called Noeldive.</p>
              <p>Mr Joseph Melvin David, 30, had won several accolades for his business acumen, which allowed his company from a one-man show in 2007 to one which had 30 staff and clinched $11.4 million worth of contracts, reported The New Paper.</p>
              <p>He was pronounced dead by paramedics who arrived on the scene of the accident, which left all three vehicles involved badly damaged. The Lotus had reportedly skidded and got flung against oncoming vehicles in the opposite side of traffic.</p>
              <p>The drivers of the other two cars involved were conveyed conscious to the hospital.</p>
              <p>Mr David is survived wife, a five-year-old son and a seven-year-old daughter. He was a car enthusiast who owned not just a Lotus, but also a Mercedes S-class, and had not been involved in any previous accidents.</p>
              <p>There was a large turnout for his wake at Ophir Road, as more than 200 people showed up to pay their final respects. Mr David's body will be cremated at the Mandai Crematorium today. Police investigations on the accident are ongoing.</p>
