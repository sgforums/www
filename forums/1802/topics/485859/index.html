              <p>Whether local or FT crews, most got chance, will definitely want to stay closer to Airport.....</p>
              <p>Why?.....</p>
              <p>Every month, once their schedule cum out, minimum will be roasted to fly chow chow 8 times, mixture of long haul and short flight......</p>
              <p>So 8 times, meaning taking taxi thru and flo, will be 16 times.....</p>
              <p>Imagine staying at Jurong area, 16 times of cab fare you know.....</p>
              <p>Taxi allowances form part of their pay structure, so if can save from taxi, meaning, take home pay will be higher lor......</p>
              <p>These day, their flight allowance not as lucrative as long time anymore.....</p>
              <p>For eg, Sin-London flight is pay in pound, it use to be stop over 5-7 days, so they get 5-7 days of flight allowance in pound, nowadays, stop over might be 2-3 days only, some even straight turn around......</p>
              <p>So it actually indirectly cut down their pay......</p>

              Not really some kopi cum wine mei also look old and fat, no more last time standard.
              
              Recently took one nice Minah fm ap to my ex chief home, chua chu kang, I asked her if her company paid for her, the answer is yes, only for those who do non stop go and return trip, like those budget airlines to BKK, go come back, go again come, one day fly twice, no stay at other country, can claim Taxi fare, no matter how much. She said that if without taxifare, not much stewardess would want to fly for the airline.
              
              Built in taxi fare are not visible anymore, most airline staff including pilots are now on contract basis with better terms and conditions, most prefer directly claim, and company are willing to pay, otherwise also hard to get locals to join in.
              
              The problem with built in fare is very vague in long run, like eg, giving $500 on taxi fare allowances including oversea taxis, so staffs hv to team up to take cab, on the other hand, taxi fares goes up, the built in fare can hardly go up unless someone fight for them.
              
              So, to save all trouble, most prefer direct claim
