              <p>Sorry about all those things undone .....</p>
              <p>Cash Card better top-up $50 , very fast dry one . It's an investment la , not on our own spending , so worth it to top-up more . Save trouble .</p>
              <p>Fuel issue also investment concept , u must remember what level of your fuel  when TransCab gave it to u , so when u return , return the aga-aga amount they initial gave to you . So u dun lu-ghee so much .</p>
              <p>Mr Tan , when u free , if at CCK area , gimme a call , let me show you how to play with the metre . It's best at 4pm , CCK Ave 4 , Blk 429 coffee shop , i'll be there . The u treat me one Kopi .</p>
              <p>Meter is Money , must learn !!!!</p>
              <p>I was lucky Comfort gave me a booklet when i was a hirer .... now i dunno if they still give .</p>

              <p>First day , relax la .... go around familiarise Singapore . It's going to be a fantasy going around Sgp . U'll never believe Sgp can be that beautiful at a certain time of the day . Believe me .</p>
              <p>If tai-ko got a pax to Airport , do take the opportunity to see where's the taxi Q-ing park for the 3 Terminals and 1 mini Budget terminal , and familiarise where's the arrival and departure for all terminals .</p>
              <p>And also familiarise the lanes , do look out for the instructions on the road and signage .</p>
              <p>Always drive very carefully along ECP near Airport , u cannot believe how long the taxi Q can be . Sometimes it's just ridiculous , it's a hazard to all drivers .</p>

              <p>My First day - Saturday -- very happy.. me only stay in home base - CITY--- if trip to Hougang, Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio.  Me-die die die will prowl my way back to city.</p>
              <p>And many short trip within the CBD areas - so my mileage is very very low.</p>
              <p>In CBD - i monkey see monkey do. I observe most Crowns.  They are the hardies and the real lao jiao. Sometime i tail gate them.</p>
              <p>That's why Crown always find seclusive spot to get their pax because they cannot afford to keep on changing gears and step release clutch..</p>

              <p>1st night - Saturday night - test and tasted T3 queue with mid night charge - good solid one.</p>
              <p>2nd night - Sunday night - test and tasted T 1 - 4 time queue, and T2-1 time queue. Total   5 queue.</p>
              <p>In queue - alamak saw Camry, Chrysler and prestige also queue with us.  So shack and no lobang.  Chrysler C300 cab driver wear black sleeveless suit. Go into Slot at T1 - PAX doesn't want to board. Then Usher direct me into empty slot and pax come to my cab.</p>
              <p>So Pax reject expensive Flag down rate if Chrysler.  Me got in with solid 2 time woodland trips at T1 and T2.</p>

              <p>Sunday night. Why i drive very short hours?  Even my wife and childrens asked me this questions.</p>
              <p>Of course they are also interested in any stories i can tell.</p>
              <p>My reasons is that i don't want to create PHOBIA to Driving. I want to enjoy it and i learn from PAX many good routing that i never thought of.</p>
              <p>I felt that Sunday driving is very relaxing type so long you don't create pressure and stress for yourself.</p>
