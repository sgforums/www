              You jolly well know that especially ah moh, when drunk..they are the most evil, and of all place to stop and rest, you go stop at circular road whereby lots of them are there drinking. 
              
              Singapore is a safe haven, but for taxi driver, it is no more safe, other countries taxi drivers are worry about robbing and thieve, we here are more worry about drunkers.
              
              So, if you think you want to drive night, you must know your game, where to rest, where to operate and how to operate to avoid all these drunkers. 
              
              Such case for me, if I am goondo enuf to look for toilet there, I would have ask him to wait, I open my driver door, start engine and zoom off liao..then see his farking face on the rear mirror...sibei song

              Drunk people not only get violent but also their physical strength increased. As shaolin fighting alway aim at weak points of others, drunk people legs are their weakness, never attack or face them above their waist when engaging a fight with them, go for the wobbling legs. 
              
              Also because of their weak legs and high drunk brain, they are slowly, you can run around and let them chase you, once they run, they get more headache, and might vommit anytime, and once they bent down to vomit or cough for air..

              Aiya brothers, brothers, tua ki or suay ki not the issue, of cos I will not be like this yao gui driver going there for trouble, my thesis is that when you really got no choice, 
              
              or no way out, then may be can try lah...if failed..then the most go hospital and keep cursing..that knn Bowah...cb kia..smlj shoalin &amp;^%%$^^$^%&amp;**(go holland*&amp;&amp;^%&amp;GFF%$@Far0k.
                  
              As for my batman and robin tatoo..last time, seibei saki one, now sakit (malay for sick) liao, 
              
              batman look bald headed and flabby... robin look like a fat wondering kids..all ink smeared liao..how to show to other. Later give people laugh until die.
                  
              Anyway, serious, if you want to drive night, must learn to protect yourself, both day or night shift have their own hazards, 
              
              day shift got lots of traffic, hot, and morning paxs alway in urgent, nite hazards are the paxs and also initial jam but in return, you get smoother traffic, no sun, less control, and for me, can find bak bak let go half ball types

              TO prevent all fights at night, lock your cab doors, open only after interviewed and agreed to ferry the pax. Do not make yourself a target or a punching bags for the drunkers.
