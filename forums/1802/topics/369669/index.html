              I took 2 cabs during the day where the drivers couldn't be too different in their attitude and driving style. Hence this boring post..
              
              So, i was late in the morning and rushed out to the main road hoping to grab a cab fast enough to get me to Thompson. Bad things happen to bad people, so it starts to rain, then it pours and true to form, a couple of blue and yellow cabs drove pass and i became an invisible man. Someone finally took pity on me and i got on his yellow cab. Yeah.
              
              It turned out to be a horrible ride. He was slow and overly cautious in his driving although at this time, the rain has stopped and I had never seen anyone engaging gear play like him. He changed gear as fast as a racer but at fifth gear, we were just hitting 50km/h. You cannot imagine how uncomfortable it is with the vehicle vibrating because of this. 
              
              I bear with it all, granted there's nothing much i can do and my priority is to get to Thompson fast. Upon reaching the estate, he missed a turn and i quickly got him to make a U-turn and to just drop me at the roadside while casually saying that i am in a hurry. For some reason best known to him, he went even slower and when i handed him $10 for the $7.80 fare, he deliberated over giving me the change and showed me the "aren't you in a hurry?" look. 
              
              It really disgusts me how people could stoop so low to earn money in this manner. 
              
              But things kinda even out, so to speak, upon the return trip where i took a skoda cab whom the driver is assured, takes the initiative to suggest different routes and drives with a purpose (fast without being reckless). The fare came up to $8.80 and i happily put the fare to $10.
              
              I am not so much of trying to rant here but just to make a point that passengers are a discerning lot and we are able to differentiate a bad service and appreciate a good one.
              
              Sometimes you shortchange yourself more if you shortchange others.
