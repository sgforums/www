              <p>last time I took a cab to from simei to whoampoa travelling from PIE. at 8.30am. the cab driver said exit at CTE and I said no, exit before the thomson road there. you know why? cos if you travel by CTE at 8.30am, you need to pay $5 for ERP charges. He thinks I dunno sia lol. he even had the cheek to say, go whoampoa have to go by CTE, if not how to go there sia lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there are 2 ways to go to whoampoa by PIE, either exit at kallang area or before the thomson road area. if you want to go by CTE, fine, do so before 8am before the ERP charges of $5 kicks in.</p>

              <p>I hate taxis when I am driving cos they are reckless most of the time.</p>

              <p>But I have to also admit that we should cut them some slack. They are afterall just trying to earn a living. And Mind you, its not as if they are making a fortune out of driving a taxi. Before I drove, I was taking taxis very often and one taxi driver told me something that I always remember, taxi drivers are poor people making money from poor people. Its very true I think. thats why he says, why make things difficult for one another sometimes. If you not happy with the speed, let him know. If you not happy, with the aircon, let him know. etc... why need to make things difficult for them sometimes like complaining to the company for the slightest issues...</p>

              <p> The whole story, I carefully go though...the criteria that you wanted only fast to your destination. There are other solution just headed to the nearest MRT stations our world class transportation and only... according to the reports recently...  drop of public transport taking, people like you must support  the govt policy which they spended too many money for MRT and now the circle links, for who? people like you  source  answer your need.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> leave that taxi driver alone... don't flag the taxi next time, i teach you...leave he or she... alone and gave him a chance to take the other passenger not same like your criteria you wanted fast,  is there any rule that taxi must listen to you your instruction that you want fast...to your destination.... which not up to your expectation.  if you don't take taxi than this will never happened to you again....those (KNNBCCB)(what wrong withe the taxi mother, does she involved with this incident asking her son or daugther that you wanted fast asking them to drive fast to your destination with their taxi) !!!..what kind of upbringing you parents, really failure...this is a taxi forum.  Knn only kpkb who know are you telling us the right thing...from the same spot settle with the taxi driver...lah...How to classified you? under which category... for taxi driver point of view...how fast you want?... 90km is the maximum on all singapore roads...65km on lane 4 that is LTA regulation....24 demerit points for one year on VDL...how much did you pay him for your service...just for your wish he need to fulfil you?</p>
