              Now comfort can take up to 4 warning letters, bo bian...all thanks to SMRT pirus and TC renault and grab/uber calls.
                  
              The issue might not be where to put the things, it might be because my ah fool collected the 5.20 offered. 
                  
              What happen is sometime, cabby killing cabby. The pax might have called another cab after paying my ah fool off, and he wait very long to get another cab, get so frustrated, and this cab allow him to put it in the seat, 
                  
              Pax might had talk to cabby about the earlier incident, so the cabby will big mouth to pax, especially those SMRT or TC cabbies.."you can complaint Cdg, the cabby sure get it, and you can get free voucher too, moreover he collected fare without service being done, that is wrong" Pax happily complaint lor

              As said, some pax are good, but was taught by the next cabby he took, the cabby might had teased him. "Aiyo, Sir, you very stupid, why paid him, can complain him, you can get back yr fares and some vouchers too, all these cdg driver eat people want lah.. now here is the nos...655.... to call and complaint, and next time, use grabtaxis better"
              
              So, from the pax perspectives, what is there to loose, and in fact, more to gain.
              
              Everything we exchanged in our daily life is call Trading, I helped you, you spent me kopi, altho normal, a trading had occured, in older days, people never use money, they use cow, sheep, rice, veg, oil etc etc to exchange in open market. Then China first start to use gold and silver as money and from there, the western turn it into papers in value like our money now.
              
              What transpired here is no exchange had taken place and someone pay you that money, and when no service is rendered, how can you take the money? There is simply, no trading taken place.
              
              Warning letter is OK, at least not a fine, it will go off in a year. Take it as a lesson learnt and move on.
              
              When trading did not take place and you get the goods with no service or exchange given, it is call, LOAN. Like I keep asking my bro KTC for $50..until now, 10cts also dun have..nabey

              Aiya, ah fool, it like this one lah, life as a cdg TD is very cruel one, you hv to learn to take it, otherwise, you can change to SMRT or Silver, less cruel, no comment for TC, at times, can be more cruel than cdg.
              
              At some point in life, if you think you are not wrong, absolutely no wrong doing, you need to stand up to uphold your righteous and keep your dignity, be firm and argue to the point of the issue and not out of the issue, even if the world is cruel to us, we, as the slave and service of others will have to swallow our saliva and tell them off, throw your keys to them and walk out a man of honour.
              
              
              And oh...dun forget to spew the saliva out once outside the office, then take cab and act like a boss, tell the cabby...SMRT, TC or Silver taxi HQ..hurry...I am late
