              And you should know why China ban Google?? The US govt are google shareholder leh
                  
              Car service giant Uber Technologies told prospective investors it is generating $470 million in operating losses on $415 million in revenue, Bloomberg News reported late Monday, citing a company document. 
                  
              The document showing the large operating losses is being used to sell between $1 billion and $1.2 billion in convertible bonds but does not provide a specific timeframe for when the losses occurred, the report said. Nevertheless, it does tout a 300 percent year-over-year growth by the company. 
                  
                  
              Uber is currently operating in over 300 cities around the world and is valued at over $40 billion.

              Ah di ar? mai look down on TDs hor, you think still layman or laywomen ar??? bo liao lah, today taxi drivers O level standard hor, then hv to graduate from taxi academy thru the hard way, you think like my time...one bottle XO, everything settle liao ar??
              
              Many TDs today are ex professional hor, just that most get fed up with working for corporate kind of system + foreign trash invasion, so most choose a quite and more flexible life mah. 
              
              At any one time you pick 10 cabbies today, you can set up a company liao, because there will be ex Accountant, ex Managing directors, ex HR, ex line managers, ex supervisors and ex businessman, if all these can join up and contribute equally, they can set up to run a business, but sad to say, most dun see eye balls to eye balls.
              
              Limpek still an executives hor...Singapore Casket senior Executives, specialise in delivery and sending off. SFA certified, MBOS qualified under ICA authorisation hor.

              Taxi driver in fact, is not a job, it is a business, you hired a cab and base on regulations, you ply your business on the road. 
              
              The key that we want to argue about is given Singapore as the most expensive status and a 1st world society, why is taxi driver of Singapore earning the least out of all other 1st world societies.
              
              So, even if we call ourselves as blue or professional, aren't we the most underpaid taxi driver in a developed world
