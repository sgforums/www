ISIS is getting pursued by even bigger international gangsters aka US and PAP, who got better weapons and financing. Why worry so much?

              <p>Taxi drivers were pre-screened by LTA and attended a course thereby we were orientated about certain kinds of suspicious activities by potential terrorists.</p>
              <p>Also Comfort taxi drivers often receive messages on their MDTs to help police look out for suspicious cars (with specific number plate numbers) or missing people in Singapore.   Effectively, the police have the entire operational fleet of Comfort taxis (16000-17000) looking out for suspicious cars on top of their own patroling fleets.</p>
              <p>Jurong Island is probably the only place whereby terrorist attack could affect Singapore in a big way but security is so tight there such that only pre-screened escorted potential big investors, delivery drivers, taxi drivers, military personnels on duty, security guards and people working there could enter.  The moment the thumbprint record is not found in their database even if the passenger has an employee pass, the passenger is barred from entering.  They also perform random thumbprint checks on taxi drivers who have to temporarilly surrender an ID every we enter.   Every vehicle entering is throughtly checked to ensure that no big amount of explosives could be smuggled in.   Don't know whether they relaxed their policy to allow Uber and GrabCar vehicles to enter.</p>

              <p>You don't care who the passengers are, LTA's regulation is you cannot reject customers.   But if it is these scenarios, you could cover your ass and not lose your taxi license: change-shift period, don't know how to go there, did not understand where customer wants to go to, customers look as though going to rob or rape you, customers going to exceed seat capacity of 4 adults or they request to go to places like cemetery in the middle or the night or require you to wait at cemetery for long periods of time (more than just drop customer there), no money (local currency) to pay type, drunk person who could anytime vomit (and cause you to have to clean and lose money (time wasted) to get rid of smell) or want you to wait a long time type before starting meter (when not on call).</p>
              <p>Whether he/she is prostitute, gigalo, pimp, Ah Kua, Bangala, maid, old/handicapped , foreigner, from ruling party, from opposition party or gay, you still have to fetch them if you stopped to talk to him/her.</p>

              As for TDs, I do think taxis as a public transport, do pose a danger and be used by terrorists, not that they ask the taxi to drive, they might kill or knock off the Driver and drive themselve posing as TD. That will be very dangerous.
              
              And that is why the other day, my beautiful lau Goh...Dro called me to be wary of any suspicious people like terrorist...

              <p>Knock off TD still cannot smuggle a lot of explosives into Jurong Island, British High Comm or Marina Sands Bay Car Park. </p>
              <p>If really want to put lots of bombs into vehicle, they are better off getting a free covered up all the way van.</p>
              <p>Worry also not use, cannot prevent one if going to happy why worry and make yourself age faster.</p>
              <p>If going to happen, they tie you up and put you one place so that they could put in more explosives in.</p>
              <p>It is not like people robbing TD whereby you could put your excess money elsewhere so that you do not seem like carrying a lot of money (most TDs would have at least $150 at the end of their shifts).</p>

              yalor, actually explosion would bring or not bring down the market is one issue, the other issue is that when terrorist strike, it will bring lost of confident and instill fear into investor and public at large, just imaging a bomb set off at Raffles MRT at peak period, it is enuf to send shock wave and can bring fragile country like Singapore economy to it knee.
              
              So it is not a matter of how much the explosion can damage the surrounding but the sentiment that follow can be diseasterous. As a country like us without any natural resources, once investors lost confident in us, we only got HDB walls to face, no potatos nor even a cucumber.

              I think those taxis of Singapore and Malaysia that travels between Singapore and Johor Bahru must be more vigilant. The 1st and 2nd Links are so open to terror attack.
                          
              I'm going to create scenarios here.
                          
              1. If the terror attack happens on the Malaysia side, is the Singapore Authority able to do anything to help or just watch it happen? Likewise for Malaysia too, if the terror attack happens on the Singapore side, is the Malaysian Authority able to do anything to help or just watch it happen? Remember, when ISIS was trying to occupy border town of the Kurdish population, the Turkish Government didn't do anything to help the town from ISIS invasion though the Turkish troop were fully deployed at the border. They just watched and did nothing.
                          
              2. The 1st and 2nd link causeways between Singapore and Malaysia are very expose. Its an easy target. It can kill so many people there especially when both causeways are congested with vehicles from both countries. 
                          
              3. When this happens, Singapore economy will be affected. More than half a million Malaysians that work in Singapore would be afraid to go to work. Singapore's economy would collapse within days. Food supplies from Malaysia would be stop too.  
                          
              I've yet to see any solid joint co-operation of anti-terror exercises conducted by Singapore and Malaysia on the causeways since the day I live in JB.
