              <p>NOT only did a passenger allegedly not pay the fare, but he also punched the taxi driver repeatedly and pushed his head against a wall.
                      
                      The incident took place at around 5am on Sunday in the void deck of Block 658B, Jurong West Street 65,</p>
              <p>Chinese evening daily Shin Min Daily News reported yesterday.
                      
                      Mr Raymond Lee, 46, had picked up two passengers, both men in their 30s, at about 4.30am and was asked to drive to Jurong West Street 65.
                      
                      One of them appeared drunk while the other was sober.
                      
                      When they reached Block 658B about half an hour later, both men alighted, ignoring Mr Lee's request for payment of the $41 fare.</p>
              <p>Instead, they went to sit at the void deck.
                      
                      Mr Lee followed them to ask that they pay, which prompted the men to head for the lift.
                      
                      When he blocked them from going into the lift, they made for the stairs. The man who was drunk then took out his wallet, looking like he was about to pay, but was stopped by his companion.
                      
                      The duo then tried to enter the lift, and again Mr Lee blocked their way.</p>
              <p>The man who was sober then reportedly said: "If you want to play, let's play."
                      
                      Mr Lee said he was punched seven times by the man and had his head slammed against a wall.
                      
                      "I stretched out my hand to block but... someone grabbed my right hand. My body was thrown against the wall causing my head to hit the corner, which gave me a 10cm wound,"</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was quoted as saying. "Blood kept flowing and my right eye started to swell."
                      
                      Mr Lee was later taken to hospital, where he had more than 10 stitches for his head injury.
                      
                      The police have arrested a 30-year-old in connection with the incident and are investigating.</p>

              No lah, you see the situation, 2 young guys indicated they do not want to pay fare, fine, see where they live, report police, report to company (cdg can rebate half the fare first, but must hv police report).
              
              Do not need to get aggressive with them, because a drunk man is a uncivilised man that hold double his normal strength. Thereafter, drive on and pick other pax

              That's is the problem with 2 or 3 sober guys you ferried, experience will tell you to evade it, because when they act together, the gain outweight their logical brain and you. 
              
              In this case, by not paying, it is a gain for the team, if one suggested, the others is sure to follow, and at the end of the day, all will act as one to whack you or against you.
              
              Even I got six packs and the rock looks forearm, I  will alway stand to loose as a drunk man energy is equivalent to 3 men output, and with 2 men, that will be a normal 6 men strenght, so unless, I am Ip man or spiderman, I will stand to loose, moreover, I am lanjiao man with weak legs, how to win, I wouldn't want to end up with my bro CT driving me to mandai (next to LKY preferred)
              
              And when they get caught, the excuses they can give is that they are drunk and may paint a different stories altogether, so to me, it is not worth the body pain the driver is suffering, either you get whack or not, the police will caught up with them.

              Yah, I think not worth the risk also. If already take them home and they dont pay, try to follow them and see where they live. If not, just cut loss and move on.
              
              Life is not fair but the 2 a holes will get punished in other ways.

This is really one of worse parts of this job many rich kids dont realise. They are just trying to earn a living and go home in one piece. The more able ones may attack but most cabbies have neither time nor fitness nor aggression to take down even one guy. Fucking sit inside there for hours and suddenly become jet li?</p></div>
