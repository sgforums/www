                          What kind of car come with no radio? I ever saw the hole on the taxi without radio set. Is this the image that cdg going to project to the public?
                          Cdg come so low that they need to remove the radio to cut cost? How much saving they got?
                          Are they removing more important component to save cost? This is worrying.
                          For the sake of cdg image to the public you should insist the taxi come with radio set. Do they éš�éš�ä¾¿ä¾¿maintain their taxi or treat it seriously.
                          It is upto them, leave the taxi in their car park and collect dust or do a good job for their public image and can collect the rental.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Honestly I dun think the passengers really care if u have radio or not. I collected my taxi on the morning of CNY eve and drove around until the 6th day of CNY. No passengers complain or say anything.  But for me as driver it was very boring and time pass by so slow without music. So installing the radio is for taxi drivers comfort. My SMRT taxi had everything. Criuse control, Bluetooth stereo that link wt my phone, reverse camera..... CDG dun even have reverse parking sensor!! Must install urself if u want. </p></div>

                              <p>Honestly I dun think the passengers really care if u have radio
              or not. I collected my taxi on the morning of CNY eve and drove
              around until the 6th day of CNY. No passengers complain or say
              anything.  But for me as driver it was very boring and time
              pass by so slow without music. So installing the radio is for taxi
              drivers comfort. My SMRT taxi had everything. Criuse control,
              Bluetooth stereo that link wt my phone, reverse camera..... CDG dun
              even have reverse parking sensor!! Must install urself if u
              want. </p>

              Ppl dont complain about image. But it leave with ppl. Cdg want driver to wear long sleeves shirt to act professional but who care. Is cdg taxi service sub_standard compare to other? I believe so. Cause sonata $3.20 comfort i40 start fare $3.70 and smrt $3.90. Premier also $3.90. Transcab $3.90. Do you think pax really care about start fare, many even dont know there is different. If you got standard why charge less? Didnt they learn from government you want quality pay more.

              It is not about radio but u see a big hole there  wtf. If ppl dont care about maintaining the car with the basic. Do you think they really serious about maintain other part of the car?

              Then it is the taxi driver issue, not pax or public issue, you can get the best radio, sound system, but end up Q long long, OBK, green lantern Ching Ming festival on parade, what is the use.
              
              If there is a hole, put your namecard or bread there lah, why go bother, cab or car is not yours, if you want to put a radio,...go put lor, you want to put up subwoofer, soundproof door, LED screen MP4, go ahead, it is your prerogatives, but you think pax will give you extra??? pax will comment you and write to company to give you a super driver award?? You know who is Mr Tan Ku ku.

              Must Care and Share mah, sometime it is not about cdg, no body point a gun in our head to drive for cdg, tc or even Phv, but since we are doing it, just take care abit for our own comfort and good, all taxi are commercial asset, out to provide a trade and living, so are Phv, you rent out to do a job, other than that, all these radio, gps, led, sound system, in car entertainment are secondary. If have good, if dun have, no issue

              When people find new path, they will look down on their ex paths, that is normal, just like my ex chief, drive cdg, said all other fark type, then later throw key, said silver good, cdg fark type, then later, go drive for TC, said TC taxis very good, silver,..knn buay kan..then now, on U/G phv, said all taxi fark type, only gong kia will drive. But the fact remain that after 3 years of U/G, only 1,500 taxi drivers changed to PHV or give up driving, another 800 newbies on TDVL...
