              Speaking from my executive position, my take is, in Singapore, the way I look at it,  U/G is still unable to beat the taxi market, nor capitalize the market as they promised year ago,
                  
              And both U/G and taxis will both have to move together and end at driverless technology, which may not happen in our era. 
                  
              Although UG do compete with Taxis, however, because of a strong and solid taxi system that Singapore had created, it will takes more than just incentives and promotion to beat taxi off the road of Singapore, which I think UG are not prepare to go fareless.
                  
              On the other hand, all competition breed certain advantages, as for this case, because of UG, taxi rental get lowered, driver become more recognized by their companies, and also, lesser cheapo paxs, and also, taxi drivers are now more willing to serve with better services.

              That is why the basic need to insist. Which car got no radio? All the taxi car at home car park no radio. Why give in easily? No means no take up. Good for them to continue paying the home car park.

              Actually I am very glad that taxi population decreased, because I like to Q and play AP, now the Q are getting lesser and AP Q are moving faster. I think at the end of the day, it will reach an equilibrium, and in Singapore context, how far can UG and taxi population growth...the population is not big, even if you are talking about 7millions.
              
              Therefore, in a longer term aspect,  the decrease of taxi is also a gain from those who still hold on to drive, eventually, taxis will breed it own market and way of driving, imagine if left with 10,000 taxis...AP everyday P n g can liao

              Income for TD..typically...20% to 30% down, for oldies like me...$30net one...no issue, same shit, different days only, for those needed money and desperado who need to support their bad habits or just starting a young family with young kids, driving taxis today in my opinon...is a No No and No, or I make a pardon, No brainer.

              Night driving today in taxis is a killer, nearly 90% hirer looking for night reliefs, and most relieves had either go over to PHv whose rental can be less than a night relief rental prices, or some took up those taxi lower rental scheme, which is also about the same rental price as a 12 hour shift relief...why should I drive for a hirer?? And most relief are new hirer to company, thus can enjoy the discount rental for 6 months and so forth
              
              So, base on these background, going forward in taxi driving need critical consideration, as I keep emphasis, if you are still below 40s, 
              
              you still have a chance to get out of this driving circle, please do it, and maybe do partime Phv on weekends...but the concentration should be on you job careers, 
              
              upgrade, reskill, work hard and discipline, get promoted, so that later, in my age, 50 or 60s, you can be somebody like supervisor or even manager...otherwise, you will still be driving, be it taxis or phv, which is sad, because, the future will be very challenging for drivers, given that driverless technology is on the test, more buses and MRT lines coming up, and you just heard grab going for grabbus.,...vans

              <p>I just collected my taxi from CDG last week and am also on the
              new hirer scheme. First of all, some old taxi may already have
              radio installed if u are lucky. If not then there will be a yellow
              namecard inside the taxi. The company is located in Paya Lebar and
              I think it Sin Hoe Whatt. I got a second hand CD Radio player
              installed for $70. It took only 15 mins. There also many
