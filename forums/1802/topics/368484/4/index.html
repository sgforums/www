              many taxi companies are in same blue colour ... you need to look at the white portion on the taxi label on top... those blue bird ones have a logo like a blue....u can only see from 25 m away.... but the traffic in bali hardly ever go above 60km/h due to narrow road and jam.... so sure can see
              
              the newer ones are new model toyota vios... forgot to ask rental how much.... haha

              <p>To drive a CNG powered vehicle , one must adopt a different way of driving , cannot adopt the style of a diesel powered vehicle .</p>
              <p>And mentallity wise , also must think a bit more generously , mental strength cannot be let down by a few dollars of diff .  </p>

              <p>In anyway , everyone , for day shift , if u don't stay around Mandai area , or western part of Sgp ( near Toh Guan area in future ) , it's best u don't take up any CNG vehicle .</p>
              <p>Even currently , staying near Serangoon North area , u must take the shock of CNG refill station the CNG ran out of stocks . Cos Serangoon Nth only 8 pumps , very fast finished .</p>
              <p>Current trend , those opting CNG vehicles , i would say majority of them staying @ Yishun , wlands , cck , Bt pj , bt btk , .... those at Jurong side , was given a demoralised shock when Jln Buroh and Jurong island Kiosk was closed down due to safety reasons , now they still hanging there , praying hard Toh Guan stations gets ready for operations .</p>

              <p>yup, 2 hours. that's what he says anyway. i'm inclined to believe him cos sometimes i can see the queue myself at serangoon nth and jalan buroh. his abnn mathematics not as strong as yours mah. that's the way we should operate. ex. erp at 50 cents in the afternoon, i will go into lucky plaza etc. taxi stand empty. no uncertainty, sure got pax. $1 go to Shaw Towers taxi oso ok. only applicable to taxi stands at fringe of cbd cos most likely got pple waiting. shaw towers, lucky plaza, bugis junction. last time most cabbies won't go in empty. now i think about 4 in 10 will go in. times have changed and these are the ones who have adapted.</p>

              <p>today i tried ... i finished my cng for 270km nett .</p>
              <p>Then i used petrol , collected $53 extra , pumping extra $16.00 petrol .</p>
              <p>It's a trial , to justify the pattern of usage , intentionally going round to use up the cng .... worth a shot .</p>

              <p><br>i think he is trying to tell you , eg , at 1pm , he head to Mandai to refill , upon completion , until the next pax , is 1 hour in total , 2 times he pumped , so 2 hours .</p>

              <p>Ha ! Sunday morning after 9am the commuters then they slowly crawl out of bed , then take their own sweet time for everything .</p>
              <p>My xperience , 10.30am is the rush for taxis , most would head to Orchard . HBD slow down at 2.45pm onwards .</p>
              <p>Then in town , 1pm start , got consistent taxi-goers , up to 4pm , another rush home .</p>
              <p>Collection is okay la .... definitely not as good as working days i would say .</p>
              <p>Maybe @$160-$180 range</p>
              <p>Good luck .</p>
              <p>P/S : If Sunday is good , the hirer will not give it to you .</p>
