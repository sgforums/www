              <p>pool, once you get on transcab. let us know your thoughts and comments. tell you frankly, as a pax myself, i am phobia to sit on transcab.  I even once encounter a prc driver driving me from queenstown to tuas view circuit at around 9:00 a.m. in the morning.He don't know the road. even speak to me in chinese: "ni men xin jia bo ren, zhen xing ying, fa zhang de hen hao, zheng fu zuo de hen hao......".  take me on a long route and even i show him my directory and map. he cannot even read it.  I make a complaint to transcab and they call me back that they have verified with the driver and he is singaporean.  He don't even know how to get onto AYE and then "tiger brewery" into tuas avenue 3. That incidents was 2 years back. He looks 40's but then i spoke singlish and hokkien he don't seems to understand.  I suspect the hirer had being using a PRC relief illegally.  No cabby license was display inside.  Probably after my complaint, the hirer could have turn up to office and nothing happen.</p>

              <p>Pool, probably you get a right choice for cng. Petrol and Diesel price will go up again and i think it will not sustain at the current level. Besides Mandai, can you also top up at others like Jalan buroh?</p>

              <p>Illegally usage of taxi drivers ? It wouldn't happen in Sgp .</p>
              <p>regulation and penalty were severe . Any infringements against LTA standard regulations will be severly dealt with .</p>
              <p>Imagine , to achieve below LTA regulated booking service standard , one company can be fined up to $2,000 per cab , what do u think the penalty will be if one using illegal unlicense taxi drivers ?</p>
              <p>That PRC probably oready a Singapore , one that has been to Sgp for 10 years and above is already a pink nric holder , so he legally a Singapore Citizen .</p>
              <p>U are just thinking about personal experience , in the bigger picture , taxi companies dare not take the risk of employing unlicense taxi driver when Sgp has got ample drivers ! It just not worth it .</p>

              <p>Current ones both operated by Smart Energy .</p>
              <p>CNG was sold at per kg , not litres .</p>

In fact i have many friends of this localize group.  What pisses me off is that he go on a merry go round in that area and refuse to read the Street directory and cannot understand english or hokkien but only mandarin.</p>

              <p>teolk, you all can call me <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tan</strong></span> instead of Rotary. I just loved and missed the rotary engine technology. You are absolutely right.  However it's good to learn from you people all the nitty gritty or otherwise one will tend to "chiong" like a Blur King. I prefer work smart than work hard.</p>
              <p>I will pass the test.  Thanks Teolk.</p>

              <p>teolk, getting personal leh..... that's what most taxi unker typical question while driving a pax leh.... i encounter many....</p>
              <p>never mind tell you since i am also going to be taxi unker. Actually i deliberate since 1994 to take up part time taxi driving with many encouragement from my taxi circle friends those days.  Now i go into it with 1001 reasons.</p>
              <p>ONE main reason: FREEDOM -- freedom means you are not answerable to any boss except try to be nice to your PAX but don't kena complaint to LTA.</p>
              <p>Recently i am very very free everyday... self employed and every damn thing is so slow. I need to get out on the road. I like driving and can drive on the otherside of the road for many hours without problem.  I have always talk but no action to be a taxi driver.  NOW the Action !  I know everyone is talking about the difficult situation with bad economy, bad time, not enough PAX etc..... but i am looking forward to it and taste it myself.</p>
              <p>2nd Main Reason: Driving and enjoy the scenery and surroundings... discover new horizons......Take a breather......</p>

              <p><br>yes , it's meant for every single CNG cars and taxis . Only diff , TransCab getting special concession pumping in their very own refilling centre .</p>
              <p>Like normal non-transcab paid $1.43 per kg , TransCab Wish paid $0.10 cheaper , that's all .</p>
