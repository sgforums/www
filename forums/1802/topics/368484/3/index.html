              <p><br>My new hirer told me the benefit extended to another year , cos they would want to encourage new sign-up , they have 2000 piece of Wish commitment , that's why .</p>
              <p>I hope u counter check with the HQ itself , rather than listening from those Uncle . I dun listen much of their stories , i never like oldies , good one i listen , bad one , like this , i will go to the proper channel .</p>
              <p>Still CNG slightly cheaper . At least to compare to SMRT taxis .</p>

              <p>never mind tell you since i am also going to be taxi unker. Actually i deliberate since 1994 to take up part time taxi driving with many encouragement from my taxi circle friends those days.  Now i go into it with 1001 reasons.</p>
              <p>ONE main reason: FREEDOM -- freedom means you are not answerable to any boss except try to be nice to your PAX but don't kena complaint to LTA.</p>
              <p>Recently i am very very free everyday... self employed and every damn thing is so slow. I need to get out on the road. I like driving and can drive on the otherside of the road for many hours without problem.  I have always talk but no action to be a taxi driver.  NOW the Action !  I know everyone is talking about the difficult situation with bad economy, bad time, not enough PAX etc..... but i am looking forward to it and taste it myself.</p>
              <p>2nd Main Reason: Driving and enjoy the scenery and surroundings... discover new horizons......Take a breather......</p>

              <p>More -- during weekday, take 20 minutes break to enjoy labrador park, pasir panjang hill to take a view.  Admiring pretty babes on the road make you feel younger.</p>
              <p>If you enjoy all this - than less stress.   I am not a cabby yet but this applies in all walks of professions and business.   Take a break.</p>
              <p>Looks like i have to consider Transcab even i am phobia to be a pax. What about PRIME and Smart offer of the Cng taxi?  Any big deposits? Any term contracts?</p>
              <p>I saw Smart having the Toyota Camry.  Is this diesel or CNG? SMRT has the Azera.</p>
              <p>What about notice of terminations for Transcab, Prime, Smart and Premier?</p>

              <p>Prime their vehicles all CNG , ranging from Toyota Wish , Toyota Felder , Honda Airwave etc .... They are popular for giving their hirer $5000 upon completion of the 5-year-contract .</p>
              <p>Prime big deposit $5k .</p>
              <p>Smart Camry is CNG .... same 5 years contract like Prime .</p>
              <p>SMRT's Azera is a power-diesel vehicle , Comfort do have a few on trial during 2008 , to replace the aging Mercedes fleet , but they pull back the deal , as this Hyundai don't generate much interest in the market , unlike Sonata .</p>
              <p>Any termination of vehicle from Smart and prime , means u tends to lose $1k per year depreciation . Eg , u drove a Felder for 2 years , and want to surrender , u will have to sell the existing 3 years balance contract to someone else ., and that will cost your money .</p>
              <p>Like my friend , he "sold" his 2-years Felder for $1500 . The new hirer got his cab for another 3 years . My friend lost $1500 during the process .</p>

              <p>Wow, this prime and smart are car traders background. 5K upfront is already like paying bank interest upfront. The commitment for 5 years is too long and the 5 K is like downpayment and interest.  And will lose money if couldn't sell it out for your remainder book value. Of course you get it back after 5 years plus whatever bonus they promise you.  But then you will slut on if you are not happy.</p>

              f) cashless payment option

              <p>I understand long endurance driving and taxi driving is totally different.</p>
              <p>I agree that all your point (a) (b) &amp; (c) ... even better point (a) to (g)....</p>
              <p>that's why i say you are superb....driver.....</p>

              <p>ALN, how many hours you drive at nite for 500 km?</p>
              <p>My guess for 9 PRODUCTIVE HOURS?  And you knock off or finished at around 1:30 a.m to 2:00 a.m.</p>
              <p>Just curious to know.</p>

              <p>Prime their vehicles all CNG , ranging from Toyota Wish , Toyota Felder , Honda Airwave etc .... They are popular for giving their hirer $5000 upon completion of the 5-year-contract .</p>
              <p>Prime big deposit $5k .</p>
              <p>Smart Camry is CNG .... same 5 years contract like Prime .</p>
              <p>SMRT's Azera is a power-diesel vehicle , Comfort do have a few on trial during 2008 , to replace the aging Mercedes fleet , but they pull back the deal , as this Hyundai don't generate much interest in the market , unlike Sonata .</p>
              <p>Any termination of vehicle from Smart and prime , means u tends to lose $1k per year depreciation . Eg , u drove a Felder for 2 years , and want to surrender , u will have to sell the existing 3 years balance contract to someone else ., and that will cost your money .</p>
              <p>Like my friend , he "sold" his 2-years Felder for $1500 . The new hirer got his cab for another 3 years . My friend lost $1500 during the process .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>bro Prime having Petrol taxi as well. Toyota Premio,Wish in blue colour 7seater ,Honda Freed,Toyota Axio etc rental starts from $70.90 nett.deposit $2k when collect car then $10 add to rental daily till bal $3k cleared.complete 5 years bonus $5k</p>
              <p>SMRT Azera is CNG not diesel <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
