              No matter how you look at it, taxi companies will shrink, their changes and scheme do not really work to the satisfaction of drivers, who are facing a stiff competition.
              
              Why? because unlike Uber and Grab that have a young management with new thinking, hyperactive and always looking creating something, taxi companies, on the other hand, still hold on to their lau kok kok, ai koon koon, pui pui, dine and wine management, that alone is a failure, a failure to have a courage to change and adapt. 
              
              It is just like a old car, keep giving problem, and keep using the same solution to solve it, no other way...so why not sell and buy a new one.
              
              Taxi companies management are today, out of date, keep holding to the same old assholes that produce the same solution and same shit is not going to change thing, but instead, worsen the situation by providing shitty solution that still want to eat taxi drivers.
              
              Even they restructure, the same shit remain, only the soup changed.
              
              My suggestion is to re engineer the whole taxis management, meaning throw away the shit and soup and the bowl out...start from new blood again.

              Eh...suddenly this thread, all these kong wu kong bo TDs and Phv cum ex taxi drivers come out again...hmmm.
              
              A simple analogy is like this, Taxis will slowly diminish with Singapore older folks, as many thrown keys, those drivers left behind will have more chances to pick at the street and at the taxi Q, 
              
              the competition for calls/booking will be fierce and furious, leaving less call for taxis even if you have an apps like cdg, you still hv to compete at a cut throat low fares with Phv, not to mention cdg weak/or save cost on marketing on their apps and promotion.
              
              So, as Singapore move toward millennium (100 years of nation building) taxi will disappear together with our local older folks, the new gen, filled with the 2nd and 3rd generations of our current foreigners PR and new citizens will be on Phv...if not, it will be on driverless.
              
              So unlike taxis that had a long history in Singapore, Phv will he shortlived once higher technology take over.

              <p>1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Sometimes wait one hour oso no taxi come. It is not definite that you can get a taxi especially if you are in a rush. And you have to compete with other ppl sometimes.</p>
              <p>2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Some taxis green lantern oso dun stop. </p>
              <p>3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Some stop but want to conduct interview first.</p>
              <p>So, pax say PHUI! and go take grab and uber better.</p>
              <p>If you can have a car come right to your doorstep to pick you up and cost less than hailing a taxi on the street during peak hours, what will people choose? </p>
              <p>That's why night time hardly any call and any street pax nowadays. It's always the price and service.  Cheaper, more guaranteed and more convenient. That's what ppl want.</p>

              Pax not phui lah, pax see the pricing, now they have the luxury to check and compare, there are still alots of 50s years and above paxs who might not know Uber and Grab or choose to take taxi.. hailing on the street, these are our street paxs who supported us.
              
              Singapore is having an aging population, there are more old then youngs, Given the so called open economy, Phv had always wanted to remove taxis thru low fares competition, and after 3 years of aggressive low fares and promotion + incentives, have they remove the taxi on the road??? 
              
              Why?? because Singapore taxis system is good and well structured, driven by locals. And govt jolly well know that if taxis is off the road, Phv will surge like no body business, at present, taxi fares are taken as a bench marker to most paxs, especially the younger ones and FTs like foreign ABNN, once phv surge, they take taxis, once phv give promotion, no surge, they go for Phv, but if one day, no more taxi fares to compare....siao liao

              Today elderly are more open and modern than the past, past time elderly always think for their descendent, save here, save there keep money until gao gao, end up family unrest over her $$, sons fight over each other, daughters argue here and there. No peace till the end.
