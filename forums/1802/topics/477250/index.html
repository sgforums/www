              <div>Driver thought cyclist she hit was tree branch<br><br>By Chong Shin Yen<br><br>HER
               car rammed into a cyclist from the rear so hard that he flew and hit 
              the front windscreen, cracking part of it, before rolling onto the road.<br><br>But Cleopatra Wong Yuin Ping, 30, thought the body that smashed into the windscreen was a rotten tree branch that had fallen.<br><br>She
               did not bother to stop and continued driving her car along Holland 
              Road. Wong was also unaware that her victim's bicycle was stuck in the 
              undercarriage of the Lexus ES300 belonging to her father, despite the 
              noise of the bicycle scraping against the road.<br><br>The bicycle was dragged for about 2km before it was dislodged.<br><br>When Wong, who was a teacher then, reached home, she went to bed.<br><br>She
               realised something was wrong only when she woke up in the morning and 
              found out that the police had towed away the five-year-old Lexus.<br><br>Taken
               to court over the accident, Wong claimed that the soundproofing of the 
              Lexus was so good that she thought the "sounds" she heard were caused by
               the tree branch.<br><br>Last month, she was fined a total of $2,400 - $800 on each of three charges - and disqualified from driving for a year.<br><br>She
               had pleaded guilty to inconsiderate driving, failing to stop after an 
              accident and failing to render assistance after an accident.<br><br>The 
              court heard that Wong was driving home along Holland Road at about 
              5.15am on Oct 19, 2008, when she hit the rear of a bicycle ridden by Mr 
              Muhammad Asri Aris.</div>
