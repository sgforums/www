              draw a line. Give him more than $ 5.  From what you describe

              Of course as a paying pax you take advantage of the situation. If

              <p><br>If the TD you just took advantage of, his attitude is bad, yours is equally bad. As you know, 2 bad robbers don't equal 1 good samaritan. What you said reflects alot about you. And the logic you gave don't tally up, what has tattoos got to do with the issue? I certainly don't see the logic in this context.</p>
              <p>Then the other thing is, if the moderator moves thread and have to inform everyone, then I think they got no time to eat and sleep. Are you seriously sober?</p>
              <p>Personally, I think deep down you're unhappy about something and took vengence at the wrong people. It's not about the money, if they took the wrong way and you think they delibrately bring you sightseeing to make more money from you and you want justice, what you should do is to complain to CDG or LTA. If you don't, then others will fall victims to this driver, instead you give $5 to take advantage of the situation so only you benefit from it. That's not about justice, that's simply saving money and taking advantage of another person.</p>

              <p>Personally, I think deep down you're unhappy about something and
              took vengence at the wrong people. It's not about the money, if
              they took the wrong way and you think they delibrately bring you
              sightseeing to make more money from you and you want justice, what
              you should do is to complain to CDG or LTA. If you don't, then
              others will fall victims to this driver, instead you give $5 to
              take advantage of the situation so only you benefit from it. That's
              not about justice, that's simply saving money and taking advantage
              of another person.</p>

              <p>Exactly....I had also went wrong way before when I am new. End up I apologise to my pax and automatic tell pax pay whatever amount he/she deem fit. Never had I argue my way out. See the difference? If he tell me he is new and apologise I would have given him the full fare with tips. But that ah beng attitude is real bad. Do wrong still want to argue leh.....</p>

              <p>Well said. If CDG then ok. If Trans then driver will get away with it. The most the driver will get "punish" by deducting the difference from him. I seen how this type of complain being handled. One staff will submit a copy of the route taken via the GPS readout printed to Jasmine. Then she take a look and ask "opinion" from those TDs who always crowded around her. Then those KPO TDs will add salt and pepper say this say that...then she will handover the slip to the stuff and instruct her to give the pax some voucher. Then she will proceed to deduct the amount from the TD account. If the TD come down see her why money is deducted she will kpkb the driver...case close. So for Transcab I suggest send to LTA more effective....Although I am with Trans but I strongly encourage my pax to complain to LTA for any complain against my own company TD. I myself also damn piss with them cos they give us a bad name....</p>

              <p>Why you support hammer2? Just because of your own personal experience?</p>
              <p>As DFG said, 2 wrongs do not equal a right. Just because 1 or 2 bad drivers or experiences, doesn't mean all drivers are bad.</p>
              <p>I had the same incident happen to me twice, both times a pte car. 1 hit my tyre when he cut out of the lane and the other, similar to yours, the driver inch forward and bumped me. Both times, I let the drivers off, no damage or scratch. Best in your case go see your company DRO and try to resolve the matter.</p>
              <p>For hammer, yeah the driver was wrong but 5 bucks is extremely improper. That is taking advantage. Yeah I know some drivers act blur, purposely go wrong or longer way just make a few bucks, but you already f him, a figure of around $10-15 would be more fair. I think $15 is fair, today i sent a pax from CQ to Upp Thomson well before your place, it came to $15. So you have easily paid that amount.</p>

              <p>As for this booking thing, I learnt something this week, a pax told me, sometimes when she press send from her I-phone to do the booking, there is lag, and so press again, maybe 2 or 3 times. In the end, got 3 taxis despatched. One time got 7 despatched. But she was fair and cancel all the others. So accepting calls, is something drivers should be aware of.</p>
              <p>Don't steam one, MDT thing means shiok already. Choose your calls carefully and be prepared for cancellation. I don't blame hammer in that instance, the driver should know very well accepting calls at CQ at that time, high chance to cancel. If take have to be prepared to cancel.</p>
