              <p><br>Harmony or make money?</p>
              <p>SMRT bus strike? harmony?</p>
              <p>Who is NTUC, who created NTUC, who head NTUC? Govt right?</p>
              <p>So, when u talk about tripartitism, I said it is only a bipartitism.</p>
              <p>Within this bipartism, govt set the pollicies, that is laws, from Industrial act to employement act to trade union act and so on...so as to prevent strikes, stop work and disharmony. And to be frank all these act flavour employers more than employees, why? because when people want to invest in yr country, they will look at these act, and the first thing they see is...any strike must go thru a proper channel and be approval by the registrar and so on...all employers are given the rights to hire, fire, retrench, terminate and transfer...now you know why cdg can pok anyone as they like?? why NTA cannot intervene..and is this what you call harmony at the expense of workers and taxi drivers??</p>
              <p>NTUC is more of a watchdog of industrial peace, Singaporeans, given no resources in our land, need to work or drive for money, given such circumstances, govt realign their strategy to exploit our weakness, that is a need to make money to survive due to not even able to plant a chilli plant.</p>
              <p>Yes, agreed that for years we have industrial peace, not because the employers are good or better than any other country, all are wolves that crave for profit, not that our govt are good that give away their rights to support citizens, but instill strict laws and make us hunger for money.</p>
              <p>Now, if NTA cannot stop cdg from porking people without a reasonable reason, you think NTUC is still relevant other than those social benefits??</p>
              <p>Now, who said foreigner workers help us to stay in our job? NTUC chief said that many years ago,...and now??</p>

              <p>Let me give you a true example, a buddy get terminated because he quarrel with a unreasonable pax, he is a NTA member, I told him to seek NTA help, NTA said, termination is the perogative of taxis company. In another word, the rights of taxi company.</p>
              <p>So, you are telling me in a world of demorcracy whereby appeal and re appeal from sub court to court to high court in full represenation is allowed but NTA just use one sentence, and he for many years had been their member, end up walking away without even an appeal for rights, compassion and reasonable doubts?</p>
              <p>How you define quarrel in a confine space with no recording? a resonable doubts, meaning, nobody really knows what is going on, nobody can say who is right or who is wrong, in Court, such cases get throw out because of lack of evidence and too much doubts but at least there will be a proper hearing.</p>
              <p>So, you tell me, which side NTA stand on? </p>
