            <div class='col-md body'>Hi peeps.<br>Im sure many of you, who has been slugging it out in the concrete jungle for quite some time, has experienced Company Costs Cutting (or CCC for short) with your respective managements. How about sharing with the rest on what cost cutting measures were implemented by management and ultimately proved self-defeating?<br><br>I'll kick start with an experience of mine:<br>This MNC that im currently working in has a huge filing room filled with metal cabinets for various filing purposes.<br><br>Originally, tall hard-cover files were indented for filing the respective documents. The advantage is that the files, being hard-covered in nature, are able to stand firmly side-by-side in the cabinets but the disadvantage is that their slightly more costlier then their flimsy cardboard file counterparts.<br><br>Thus management, in all its wisdom, decided to stop indenting the hard cover files for the soft covered ones in order to cut costs. And lo and behold, as you guys might have guessed, the accumulated weight of the cardboard files caused rows of files to slant lope-sided, making file retrieval and storing difficult and extremely time-consuming.<br><br>Ultimately, management decided to indent boxes and boxes of book-ends to make the soft-cardboard files stack properly but as far as i can see, its only a temporary reprieve as the book ends are starting to bend over from the weight.<br><br>Total costs incurred, including both cheap soft covered files and metal book ends, turns out to be much more then simply indenting more hard covered files.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What are your experiences with the management's self-defeating "costs cutting" measures?<br></div>
