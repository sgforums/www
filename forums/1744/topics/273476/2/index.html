The funny thing is that it's often my own doing.  I'll be talking with my team and happily picking up extra tasks, to the extent that the rest of the guys have to stop me because I end up buying myself a 75-hour week.  On the other hand, when you're loaded with work, it's a case of being assertive (not aggressive).  In my case, if I ever do have to turn someone away, I'l just say, "I've got so-and-so to deliver by this time, so I can't get to this any time soon.  If you want to wait I might be able to help you later, but at the moment it's a no-go".  If you present the facts that show that you've got enough on your plate, it denies them the opportunity to dump something on you when they know they can't fit it into your schedule.  Note: if you don't have anything urgent you have to do, make sure you find something - this is where many NS men have learnt the principal of WALI: Walk Around Looking Important. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
