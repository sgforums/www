              <p>my ex-company has vacancy and asked if i want to go back.  i have 
                  been working as casual worker for almost 2 years due to the financial 
                  crisis, so this is an opportunity to regain my "original status". </p>
              <p>however,
                   i have some reservations.  the company had a change of management, so 
                  the culture is different now.  i am afraid of being rejected by my 
                  ex-company if i apply for the job.  i also feel embarrassed to let them 
                  know that i was merely a casual worker since i left the company years 
                  ago.  in addition, i have a "phobia" of burn-out.  i am afraid that if i
                   take up the job, i may quit again.  </p>
              <p>currently i am picking up new 
                  knowledge and skills.  if i go back, it would disrupt the new 
                  career development.  nevertheless, if i stay with the new career 
                  development, there is no guarantee that it will take off due to 
                  competition and age.  i was good at my last job, however as it's been a while since i was at it, i am not sure if i still have the passion to excel in it.</p>
              <p>i have gotten used to the freelance lifestyle of a casual worker.  i have a strong resistance against "losing my freedom" by taking up an office job.  the drawback of  casual work is the unstable income which a "proper" day job will be able to give.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what should i do ?  apply or not to ?  
                  how do i break my inhibition ?</p>

              <p>just apply</p>
              <p>if rejected, just treat as not successful and stay on in your freelance first lor</p>
              <p>if not rejected, and accepted, and since they accepted you on the basis that your resume had reflected you had been doing freelance, so if the HR allows you to pass through, then just accept the job lor</p>
