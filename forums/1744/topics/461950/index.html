              <p>i am currently in a section consisting of myself, a 1 year old new bird, my senior and my manager.</p>
              <p>my senior is a prc. she is very nice.<br>only 1 thing that i can't seem to appreciate of her is that she micromanages me.<br>and also we share 1 job scope (we have many other jobscopes in the section of course).<br>she does the calculation for the prices and such.<br>while i do the operations (like paperwork and liaising actually).</p>
              <p>many times when i have already sent an e-mail, she will come to me and tell me, oh please do not send your email in such a way. please recall your email.<br>she will be nice to teach me how to send though.<br>she explains that "you know your boss agrees to let you handle everything provided that you can really handle everything."</p>
              <p>and the environment is created in such a way that she becomes a bridge to the communication to me and my boss.</p>
              <p>i find this rather ridiculous because i need to communicate with my boss eventually.</p>
              <p>i even tell her directly, you need to let me and my boss learn to communicate with each other.</p>
              <p>this has nothing to do with whether she is trying to be fishy in her job or whatever.<br>i am just frustrated that why am i being spoonfed or micromanaged when i have already passed my probation period???</p>
              <p>i have tried to communicate to her about this before. that i would like to have a clear job scope. but she so kindly pushed my request aside with her nice excuses.</p>
              <p>anyone shares the same sentiment?</p>

              <p>alot of different possible angles to look at:</p>
              <p>1) She think her method is the "Correct" way and that you are not using the right format and blah blah blah. Some ppl have their own way of doing things and like to force down on other ppl. Usually the older staff will do this.</p>
              <p>2) You are doing things in the wrong format and she is telling you the correct way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Watever the reason, a solution would be to speak to your reporting officer about this. Different ppl have different defination of boss. It could be the reporting officer of your reporting officer etc.</p>
              <p>Basically, have a nice chat with you reporting officer. and if your reporting officer is your "senior" then go one level higher.</p>

              <p>what is your job title. let me knw so i can advise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>becausreful sometimes their mcromanage is actually landing you in hot soup, telling you to do 'wrong' things. this type is act 'senior'. too free nothing to do. a senior role can guide his junior whenever junior approach senior for advise, or escalate problem. otehrwie a senior should let junior do his her job. by micromaging, although senior will look like they very busy, in fact its creating more unneeded work for juniors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway senior title can anyhow get 1, like you stay in a cmpany for a few years with many juniors joining later, and if you can pork boss karchng and tok rot with other section colleagues well also can be senior.</p>
