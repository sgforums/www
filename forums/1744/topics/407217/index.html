              <p>I tell you some GManagers can be very childlish and they think they can blackmail you anything they want from you.</p>
              <p>Last 2 weeks, a quality audit was done at the company, and I was supposed to liase with the quality auditors. But the GM himself whisk them away from my attention and took them out to for lunch treat for the whole weekly duration. So what? I didn't care about any social treats, I got many friends outside, I don't really get myself involve in company social treats. Then when there was quality meeting, the GM neglected to call me in, so I don't know what happened head or tail. So after the quality auditors went back, I came to see the GM and asked him to include me in the next year quality meeting because I won't be able to do some of my work functions properly without knowing the results of the meeting. That time was 7pm, so I bid him goodbye but he rudely ignored me. Okay, now I know he has no courtesy and he is very lan see. Doesn't matter because he is not my friend.</p>
              <p>Then two days later, the GM tries to be funny, he goes into the office greets everyone and makes jokes with everyone but me. I just ignored him and did my work, I say fuck him lah, like I really care. Now I see his true colors, and I know he has ego that cannot stand it when a staff raise a matter of attention to him. He's been organising social outings excluding me, but I am happy to be excluded because at least I can go back home and spend time with my real friends and not having to attend company functions sit down there like a statue and listen to him and the senior managers talk, talk and talk. I am expecting to be excluded next year, CNY dinner, goodlah, I can go back to hometown and spend more quality time with my family. This GM think he is so great he can affect me socially meh?</p>
              <p>He wants to be childlish then so be it. I just do my own thing as if I am going to be affected by his actions.</p>

              <p><br>You don't get my meaning. I am happy to be excluded from office social functions because they are so darn boring. But when they exclude me from job functions and I don't know head or tail what is happening, then I have to say my concerns out.</p>
              <p>No, I am happy to be excluded from being free dinner and lunch treats by the GM and his circle of friends. Yes, I am concern but not unhappy at being excluded from co meetings that concerns my job function.</p>
              <p>But as you know big bosses lah, they have their ego wan, they don't like to be told what to do, so they go and show favourtism to others to see how much they can fluster me. So childlish wan, I just laugh off. When the GM went around and started greeting everyone except me, I just laugh in my heart, what is this ah? kindergarden meh....Ignore him lah, so silly wan.</p>
              <p>But my eyes will be on the watch, if the GM excludes me for another pertinent meeting, then I will raise up the issue again, I am not intimidated nor am I afraid of him (I am only doing my job and I have every right to seek meaningful job). Thank goodness, I don't need to do a lot of work for him as I report to other bosses.</p>

              <p>Wah I wonder how many job you have? Unhappy a bit oso resign meh? All job got problem wan you know. I am not a job hopper and I am willing to take challenges but sometimes it is good to pen things down as it gives you ideas how to rise up to the occassion.</p>
              <p>This GMwant to make me regret for not joining his elite circle of friends mah. But I got my own friends outside, so he can go and show off all he wants but I am not going to join his free social treats and dinners with the other office co-workers because it is boring. I mean not all the co-workers are boring, i eat with them in the canteen and we can talk constructively but when the GM and his elite circle is around, yawn, boring, I wanna go back home and sleep.</p>
              <p>Yesterday one of the GM's circle of friends was talking about watching movie in the cinema, oh thank goodness I wasn't invited, it would have been boring.</p>
              <p>So I never raise one bit of issue when I was left out on many many company farewell dinners for ex staff and birthdays, didn't bother me one bit. Hah, so what. So thats why the GM went and gave more favourtism to others because he wanted to make me feel more left out, socially, but who cares? Last week I just went hiking with a few of my friends and I went dinner with gf and pals. So I got my own social life.</p>
              <p>But when it came to the quality audit, I had to say something because it concerns work.</p>

              <p>I got two advantages, first I have to forke out money for a gathering i don't want to attend, because its so boring, wasting time. Even if it is covered by company money, I can at least lose some weight, because recently I have been having some weight problem and I am a diabetic, so it is good for my health not to go and eat rubbish outside food.

              <p>Aiyoh, what has interacttion with work mates got to do? If someone is genuine in their offer of friendship then it is fine lar. But if someone don't invite you, I am not going to go and push my invitation through, I got better things to do.</p>
              <p>There is a egoistical logistics manager who goes around backstabbing everybody and almost got himself sacked, but he still survive today. Work interaction if you can, but what for you force your way to have people interact with you?</p>
