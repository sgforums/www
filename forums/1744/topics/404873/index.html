              <p>hI Toot , as what you mention here and all the rest of the replys one thing for sure yes u can demand what u feel right but on the other side dont have such behaviour in the long run cause its only will be a lot of hurdles in the future i am a relief taxi dirver and my day job i am doing  sales only me local  the rest all are import staff meaning PRC and ETC i did ask my boss why not get local staff , but he just sigh and say me you still ask me how many times, cause our local expectation are different but at the same time we have part time students who earn $6 and hour during our sales and over the weekend and pc shows so i think learning things more at this  age give you experience  and when your sister finish her education she will know what to look for in the future , so asking high pay is one thing and its all ok if the boss agree so otherwise just <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>here's a simple breakdown:</p>
              <p>its a temp job</p>
              <p>not full time job</p>
              <p>u wanna fight for higher pay for full time job, go ahead</p>
              <p>u wanna fight for higher pay for temp job and u gonna go back to school in 2 months time?  dun waste ur breath.  really not happy, quit and find another one.  the time u spend arguing, u might as well go interview other locations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its about time u and ur sister understand what is happening in singapore now.</p>
              <p>most people are not getting the pay they want no matter how highly they rate themselves.</p>
              <p>the employer can just put a PRC fella in for half your price and u can carry on and quit.</p>
              <p>so like i said, its a temp job, no need to think so much. dun like just go find another location to pass time and earn money.</p>

              <p>i seriously wun bother negotiating with a kid who is going back to school in 2 months.</p>
              <p>as an employer, also wasting breath.  i might as well put a sign up for someone more willing to do it at the previous rate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>unless the employer very nice, bother to chit chat about dollars and cents to the employee.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the constructive suggestions by everyone (except for the freak louis888)... I'll share it with my sister....</p>
              <p>After reading through the posts.. I think i know what's the best way for my sis.. but ultimately she's the one deciding la...haha...</p>
              <p>To looney888,</p>
              <p>dunno what the hell is seriously wrong with you....</p>
              <p>my guess is that you are facing lots of problems in real life.. pity you.. you must have been badly treated in jobs like an idiot by your boss and there's no way your boss will persuade you to stay in the job should you quit... i think the employer will be happier without somebody so negative like you in the company.</p>
              <p>or are you simply jealous that my sis can continue her study while you don't even get a chance to go anywhere beyond a diploma? (saw some other posts by u..Loser)</p>
              <p>Just admit that you are jealous.. Through your various posts and I can see that you are abnormal psychologically and you should visit a shrink.</p>
