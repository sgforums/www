            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday I went for a job interview with a more established college, it is for the position of a Maths lecturer...<br><br>At first, met up with the admin head during which she bombarded me with lots and lots of questions, but all I managed to answer smoothly...at the end she also said she quite pleased with my performance...then she brought in the vice principal and both of them listened to my mock lecture. After that they told me I can go back liao, but have to come back on Sunday to meet the principal. He also said that they are offering the position to me already, but have to start on part time basis first before becoming a full-timer, which is fine with me cos I still wan to continue teaching in my workplace now until at least around June...but when I asked about the pay then he like very reluctant to confirm with me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> In the end he mentioned it might be around a few hundreds more I think...<br><br>After that the vice principal stopped me on my way out, then he said the principal is back liao, so she wanted to see me. The principal started to ask a lot of questions like how do I rate myself when it comes to loyalty for a company? So I said I will be very loyal to a company who treats me well, then she said sometimes the management is too busy to treat you well all the time. And you can't expect a pay increment everytime as a way for us to show recognition towards your work. So I said recognition no need to come in terms of pay increment all the time ma, can just tell me that I did well, etc. But she said we are not so free to recognize efforts all the time. So if I want to be with this company means I need to endure many months of "non-recognition" before they will finally take note of me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> On top of that she also said I have a bad attitude but she still wans me to go to another interview with her next Friday. This time need to give another mock lecture again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>So basically the problem is whether I shud go for the interview or not? I list out the pros and cons of working in this place:<br><br>Pros:<br>More established institution<br>Pay might be higher (but not much)<br>Less hours of teaching (dunno how true is this)<br>Half day only on Saturday, and no night classes<br><br>Cons:<br>Super far away from my house (nearly double the distance to my current workplace)<br>Workplace seems like a very rigid place, the kinda place where it is very big and a lot of ppl, but everyone doesn't know one another  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>More pressure to perform well<br><br>Should I go back for the second interview?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Or just forget about this altogether and stick with my current company in hope of a pay raise?</div>
