              <p>hey guys i need help regarding this issue that has caused me to be worried n restless</p>
              <p>i have just ORDed in May and got my 1st job at start of August. Was initially happy n excited about my 1st job since i would be getting a stable pay soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After a few weeks in this new cpy, i realised work there was terribly hectic. My female  colleaques were  one a malaysian degree holder, another a local with a degree holder too. I being a poly grad two yrs ago  find myself unable to cope especially since when i just orded and wad i learmt in poly has more or less been forgotten.</p>
              <p>Training was provied by my colleaques but it didnt help either especially when they start to show attittude and be cocky  when i make mistakes or forget a few steps and even when i ask qns. Even attachment students who have been there for mths are much efficient than me and get cocky when i ask qns. The work was so hectic that i have to multitask so much stuff  when i couldnt even have time to sit down n digest wad m i taught and demonstrated properly</p>
              <p>There are a few instances where i wana explode, shout n tell them off but i controlled myself since i understand i am new n there are lots of stuff i have to catch up. On my part i tried to self learn from websites, study my poly stuff after work , but aint working</p>
              <p>I am feeling terribly miserable n dread going to work. being looked down by female colleaque  isnt a good feeling. Any advices on wad should i do?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hey, you want me to tell you to stay on, deal with the unhappyness, go home cry it off, then stay. No company in the world dies because of one employee, if they are good to you, you wouldn't be in this page.</p>
              <p>Changing jobs is normal and ppls do that for many reasons as long as you do not burn the bridge cause you never know.</p>
              <p>Look for a job, when the time comes, just tell them you have a better offer and it is time for a change, sure they may try to keep you but would you be happy? It is you that matter to you and nobody else.</p>
              <p>Do what make you happy and that's the key (legally I hope)</p>

              <p>Also you need to understand where the problem is? Yourself? if yes, learn harder, work harder and remember that not everyone is nice to teach you all the time.</p>

              Treat it as a learning experience.
              
              Even if you leave the company, provided you leave behind a good impression for some character references in your resume, you may join other similiar jobs or companies with newly gained skills and abilities.

              <p>When work become hetic, it will always help if you list down the thing you have to do. You can then see the actual amount of task you have to do. Your mind tends to snowball the amount.</p>
              <p>When colleagues get cocky, get humourous with them, you are still a rookie remember. Later when you grasp your work they will treat you better.</p>
              <p>Watch out for dumping. A noob who do not know his job scope, will always be a victim to job dumping. Learn and "help out", but be wary that grey area jobs do not become your responsibility by default.</p>
              <p>You are still not used to the work enviroment and work flow, things will "normalise" when you get used to the job, and have settled into your place in the scheme of your workplace.</p>
              <p>Then when a newbie comes, guess what will you be doing.</p>
              <p>Just bear it for now.</p>

              <p>1.) First, do not give up. Your trainers are prob thinking you CMI (cannot make it) and you're only proving they're right if you left.</p>
              <p>2.) Prove it to them that you're keen to learn. Ignore their cocky attitude but rather, talk to them. Say "I'm new and may not be a fast learner, but I'm keen to learn if you're willing to teach." Demonstrating it through actions will make them feel guilty and change their perspective towards you. Maybe, your attitude will impress the girls too :D</p>
              <p>3.) If you feel very stressed, take a break. Making friends in the workplace motivate you, making it more enjoyable.</p>

              <p>well sort of  the technical aspects, skills n wadever.  i took biotechnology and m now in a laboraotory job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dono if its because my female coleaques are fresh funi grads who  came here to work after grad whereas i am just a rusty  poly grad. Its not only my colleaques who are mocking me even the attachment students whom i tried to learn from are giving me attitude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another issue is work there is so hectic than my colleaques couldnt afford the time to really properly guide n coach me. most of the time its just a fast demo n descirption n off they go to do their job while i m alone to digest</p>
