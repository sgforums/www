            <div class='col-md body'>There are two types of employee. One has a good idea of what they do, who they are and what position they play in the company. They are savvy. They know the score. They are under no delusions, and will no doubt leave for another job long before they are ever considered as cannon-fodder.<br><br>And then thereÂ’s the other kind. The guy who could get Gandhi to hate him. The woman who spends most of her day chatting on the phone to friends or doing online shopping. Or the nice chap in sales who is completely oblivious that the recent merger means his job is now obsolete. They all have Ostrich Syndrome. They couldnÂ’t see a pink slip coming if it was 8ft tall and glowing in the dark, screaming Â“youÂ’re fired!Â”<br><br>You want to avoid being in that 2nd category at all costs. So IÂ’ve compiled a handy list. If you can answer yes to THREE or more of these questions, you may want to think about sprucing up your resume and dry-cleaning your best interview attire.<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.wisebread.com/you-re-fired-20-signs-that-a-pink-slip-is-coming" rel="nofollow">Read more HERE</a></strong><br><br>1 Â– Are you no longer in the loop about, well, anything?<br><br>2 - Did you recently screw up big-time?<br><br>3 Â– Are people avoiding you at all costs?<br><br>4 Â– Did your last performance review read like a train wreck?<br><br>5 Â– Has your company recently been sold or merged?<br><br>6 Â– Are you being given impossible jobs with no chance of success?<br><br>7 Â– Do you now have less responsibility than the intern?<br><br>8 Â– Has your office, cubicle or working space recently been down-sized?<br><br>9 Â– Do people whisper more, or does the conversation change as you approach?<br><br>10 Â– Did your recently receive a pay freeze or, worse still, a pay cut?<br><br>11 Â– Have you seen a job posting for your company that matches your job description?<br><br>12 Â– Does everyone hate you?
