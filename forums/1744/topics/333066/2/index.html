              <p>4. Earning SGD$1k here is = MR$2.3k. And you could have a terrace or a bungalow  and  a nice car back home. But for a Singaporean SGD$1k means a 3rm flat will be a heaven but he/she would probably have to missed some meals, skipped the feader bus and walk to the MRT.</p>
              <p>5. Your job is not undoneable by any of the unemployed Singaporean. And you have just push one of them into the grave by asking a lower and no increment package.</p>
              <p>6. Go back to Malaysia and boost your own country if you think you are that good. If you can't do it home ground, what makes you think that you can here?</p>
              <p>7. My defination of foreign talent are people who could create opportunities and boost the economy to a greater height. To me....you are just a foreign pest.</p>
              <p>8. By kpkb-ing, your words shows that you are incapable and required special supervision even after 8 years on the job. What makes you think that you are so Special?</p>

              <p>15 years ago, Singaporeans used to complain that people from other countries were saying the above about Singapoream immigrants.  Back then it was a case of the big bad white man being a racist monster.</p>
              <p>Looks like Singapore finally caught up - way to go for beoming a first-world country.</p>
