              <h6 class="h s-5">I have been looking for good reasons why women are known to be better managers than men. And I found a very fair explanation from one of the blogs I read:<br></h6>
              <h6 class="h s-5"><br></h6>
              <h6 class="h s-5">The Better Manager - Women or Men</h6>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="entry">Women are not necessarily better managers than men; nor are 
              men necessarily better than women.  There are many reasons why women are
               capable of managing people better than a man can.  This doesn't mean 
              that women are better managers, though.  Many managers (men) are lazy, 
              complacent, and unaware.  If the implication from the article is that 
              women are better managers because more of them are attending college, it
               is sorely misguided.  Certainly, tools for managing more effectively 
              and efficiently are learned there; maybe even honed to some extent.  
              This is true for men and women though.  The notion and realization of 
              better managers is based upon many things, including perspective, and 
              there is much truth to this.<br><br>Women may be getting more 
              opportunities to lead and manage because many more are educated.  (Many 
              were already capable years ago.)  That isn't the real reason women are 
              better managers or even good managers though.  Women are finally being 
              appreciated for their abilities to manage and lead partly due to being 
              more educated, partly due to the appreciation (beneftis) of, demand for,
               and legal stipulations of diversification, and partly due to the fact 
              that they have been pretty solid managers in the past; the ones that 
              reared our children, kept our households (and us) organized, and had a 
              vision of our family's success in daily "operations" and future 
              preparedness for most challenges (as teachers and parents).  This is by 
              no means the limit to why they are good managers.  Any list would have 
              to be more personalized to the individual.<br><br>To say women are 
              better managers than men is a blanket statement.  I have learned much 
              from women - in many management positions (families to large 
              organizations).  I have compared my abilities to theirs to see how 
              effective I am in their regard.  Education, experience, self-actuality, 
              and appreciation of others abilities are assets that benefit every 
              manager.  Being an effective follower, remaining attentive to individual
               personality traits, and keeping the organization's vision in mind are 
              also endearing principles that should be used for every person who 
              desires to become a good manager.  This list is not inclusive, either.<br><br>The
               bottom line here is that women are and have always been good managers. 
               Are they better managers than men?  I am sure some are are and some can
               be.  Are men better managers than women?  I am sure some are and some 
              can be.  Either way, the paradigm has shifted and society is not 
              threatened by women managing or leading.  Diversity education, an 
              appreciation for individual ability, and a decreased feeling of being 
              passed over by women in management and leadership positions within the 
              workplace are important reasons why this is happening.  I think they are
               all good and will provide for a more promising future.</div>
