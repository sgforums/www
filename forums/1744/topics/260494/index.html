            <div class='col-md body'>Hi peeps,<br><br>I was wondering how many of you guys been offered more then 1 Interview opportunity within a space of a week? Let me give a scenario:<br><br>Job A: Interview on Monday, but you are pretty confident that you will get hired as the company lacks serious manpower. Cons are, you have to start work immediately the following day (Tuesday) and your not too keen on the job anyway.<br><br>Job B: Interview on Friday, but the chances of entering the firm is 50% at best.<br>You would very much prefer Job B then A.<br><br>So, its Sunday today, what are you gonna do? Go for the Job A Interview on Monday and "risk" loosing Job B's Interview as you need to start work immediately?<br><br>Or just ignore the Job A Interview? (You might not get Job B, y'know?)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Edit: Oh yeah, and I forgot to add: You had a real tough time narrowing down and securing both Interviews, so giving either of them up is no easy task.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>if i were you, i'd go for both interviews.<br><br>but i'd let interviewer A know about the other interview.<br>they'd give you a follow up call w regards to the results of the interview. you still can decline or tell them your notice date then. if they really need you, or find you a suitable candidate, they'd wait for you.<br><br>its important to find a job fit, or something that you enjoy to do..in this case interview B. even if you failed the interview, you know at least you tried.<br><br>there are so many jobs in the market..you can still always try others, if both fail. just need a lil patience, i'd take it as a training grd to handle interview sessions better, to build up more confidence, and to know what interviewers usually ask.</div>

Do you have any priorities (e.g family and siblings to feed? etc) that places a job on another position other than pure satisfaction?<br><br>I suggest going for the interview with A on Monday. If the job is not what you want you can refuse them downright. In my right mind a wise hirer will never sign you up immediately and ask you to start work the following day. There might be exceptions but few in cases. A wise HR or employer will still review the prospective candidates confirmed by the departmental managers before you are asked for a final interview or informed with the date to start work.<br><br>If for some golden luck you have A is the job you want you can sign up with them immediately but i doubt the situation might be so. If you still want to try your luck with interview B you can strike a bargain with A and tell them the truth that there's a B interview. If they need you so badly they will wait. Otherwise my opinion about A is that they cannot even wait an hour for another person to fill up the vacancy and its probably some jobs that pissed many employees off like the plague!<br><br>Otherwise if you know B is the painting you have always wanted to achieve in life i say fight for it even if its only 50/50. The final loser is not someone who lost, but someone who don't even try and go for what he or she believes in.</div>
