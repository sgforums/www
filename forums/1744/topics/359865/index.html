              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">The state of work in Singapore</span></span> <br> by Stephen Frost
              <br> <br> Work has been in the news in Singapore this week, with the release of a
              survey exposing some revealing trends. They survey covered numerous
              sectors, but one of the findings reported initially was that half of
              the finance professionals in the city-state would leave their jobs if
              the opportunity arose. And of those, 21 per cent said that they wanted
              a better work-life balance (35 per cent said they would jump ship if
              offered better pay).
              <br> <br> Recruitment firm Robert Half, which conducted the survey, said that <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">half
              of finance professionals in Singapore expressed dissatisfaction with
              their employment, even as concerns over job security and waning career
              prospects intensify in the downturn.</span> </span>The firm surveyed more than 3,500 finance professionals across 14 countries last October. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">The
              survey found that only 53 per cent of the 200 Singapore respondents
              were satisfied with their jobs - the second lowest globally after Japan</span>,</span> where 47 per cent of its financial workforce said they were satisfied with their jobs.
              <br> <br> Tim Hird, managing director of Robert Half Singapore, said the survey
              results show that “job satisfaction and company loyalty will continue
              to be tested as companies tackle the challenges posed by the economic
              downturn, including those related to their human capital”.
              <br> <br>Hird has it right when he says that to attract and retain staff,
              companies should include training and career advancement opportunities,
              having leaders and mentors, and other non-monetary incentives that go
              towards personal development and a healthy work-life balance.
              <br> <br> The implications of this survey for a country aiming to retain its position as a financial hub are significant. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">If
              half of all finance professionals are dissatisfied with their jobs, it
              will be tough for Singapore to attract the best people and keep them.
              This is particularly pertinent for a country that is spending a great
              deal of money to attract high-paid foreign professionals (many of them
              who will be employed in the finance sector)</span>.</span> <br> <br> Other findings in the Robert Half survey point to some disturbing trends in the workplace more generally.
              <br> <br> The first is that<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: blue;"> <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">employees
              here are turning up for work despite being sick. According to the
              survey, 61 per cent of Singaporean respondents still go to work when
              they are sick because they are scared of falling behind on their work;
              the highest rates of 6,000 polled across 20 countries including the
              United States and Japan
              <br> <br>52 per cent of Singaporeans fear that too many sick days could go
              against them, while 50 per cent did not want to be perceived by
              superiors and peers as not working, the highest rates among those
              surveyed.</span></span></span></span> <br> <br> Levels of stress are not surprisingly high; globally, Singapore ranks
              only second to Japan, with 69 per cent and 71 per cent of respondents,
              respectively, who expect workplace stress levels to rise this year. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
              main reasons cited for the expected increase in stress levels are
              worries about job security and excessive workloads due to
              under-staffing.</span></span></span></span> <br> <br> The survey also showed that the main impact of rising stress levels are
              lower staff morale (64 per cent) and lower quality of work or service
              (37 per cent). 32 per cent believed that decreased productivity due to
              stress-related issues would be the most significant cost to the
              company, followed by increased employee turnover (24 per cent) and a
              drop in the quality of work or service (19 per cent).
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">Singapore
              ranked highest globally again when it comes to employees checking
              company emails outside working hours, with 26 per cent spending on
              average 30 to 44 minutes a day doing this.</span> <br> </span> <br> The survey demonstrates, yet again, a point CSR Asia has been making
              for many years; the competitiveness of firms is dependent on the way
              employees are treated (beyond a decent salary). But in the Singapore
              context, the issue is even more important. If the city is to maintain
              its reputation as a financial hub, it needs a stable, professional
              workforce that is at the very least reasonably satisfied with workplace
              conditions. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">That
              Singapore ranks so highly on many levels of dissatisfaction in the
              workplace should serve as a warning for the government that its
              national competitiveness is at risk. If the government wants to attract
              the best people from abroad (as it is currently doing), then it might
              want to consider what role employers could play to assist that.</span></span> <br> <br> It doesn’t make sense for the Singapore government on the one hand to
              promote the country as an attractive destination for highly-paid
              professionals when on the other hand companies seem to be doing so
              poorly when it comes to workplace conditions and employee relations.
              Perhaps it is time for the government to play an active role in
              encouraging companies to improve their social responsibility as part of
              improving Singapore’s national competitiveness. â–

              <p>Well, I guess u can call it part of Singaporean culture. Number of MCs affect your pay rise, promotion, and ur likeability with ur bosses and collegues.</p>
              <p>My boss from my previous company received a call from an executive in a rival company.</p>
              <p>Caller: "Hi Bill, long time no see. Btw one new executive is joining my department next month. I heard she was previously from your company. You know her, name's HotBabe?"</p>
              <p>Boss:" Ya, heard of her, in different depts, hence no working relationship. But wait, let me check... Wow! She 5 days of MCs in her short 6 month stint with us."</p>
              <p>Caller:" Wow! That's almost 1 day per month. Damn..."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>** Disclaimer: Yaya, I know it's illegal and unethical for my former boss to give out information, and it's also unethical and rude for the Caller to check out a new employee this way, especially he's not even from HR. But this is the real world.</p>

              <p>Cos it won't make a good story, it may cause friction with labour ministry, employers and HR people. All these employers/HR people like to do things by convenience, for they're too also only getting a basic pay monthly. U do X amount of work, u get Y amount of pay. U do X + A amount of work, pay's still sama sama.</p>

              <p>Look at the employment law/act in singapore.    It is pretty obvious that the employees are not well protected.</p>
              <p>I was surprised to know from a friend who checked with MOM on termination - MOM said the employers no need to state the reason why employees are terminated.    No wonder I heard about a few cases of friends being terminated and bosses did not state the reasons.  </p>

              <p>Alll unions in the companies in Singapore are controlled by govt.  YOu are right.   and unions don't protect certain non executives.  My friend a secretary went to her union wanting to join as a member.   She was told Union will not protect her to fight for any case with employers even if she joins as a member.    Come on lah, not management staff also union cannot protect?    Bogus!     </p>
