And the most surprising thing is I thought my manager would understand my position and would side with me, but she decided to side with the backstabbing colleague.<br><br>And to think I treated him with kindness all this while. He joined a few months later than me and I taught him all that is needed to help him to fit into the environment. But ended up my hand got bitten by the tiger dat I fed instead.<br><br>So lesson to peeps here: don't be taken in by ppl who look innocent or pretend to look innocent.
