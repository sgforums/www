He has been here for nearly a year already, while I have been here for slightly more than a year. He and I are in different departments actually, but still there will be needs for us to cooperate sometimes when it comes to certain project.<br><br>I agree his workload is quite heavy, so is mine, so if he wants to ease his workload he doesn't need to push the shit to me ma.
