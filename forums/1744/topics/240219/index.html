            <div class='col-md body'>I am watching this Korean Drama and I like the facts of worklife portrayed in the story, although in a slightly, comical way at times.  The title of the drama is " Wu2 Bi4 Shen4 &amp; Feng1 Shoon4 Ying1 " - btw, anyone knows the English title?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Fact of worklife #1  Politiking side characters create discord in the office</span></strong><br><br>Scenario: the 2 main leading actors challenged each other in business - one wants to close the supermarket branch, and the other must increase sales by at least 10% to save it and save jobs.<br><br>Scheming act: The 3 power-hungry political scums would go to each man and proclaim their support and encouragement for both men - hoping that both men will fight and kill each other off the battlefield of the office.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Fact of worklife #2: People in power abuse their power of position/authority to get what they want</strong></span><br><br>Scenario: #2  Supermarket Supervisor ask Sales Asst to deliver a fancy gift to the new big boss<br><br>SA: Isn't this bribery?  To show more sincerity, you shd deliver it yourself? Or send a courier to deliver it  (because it's not really her job to do such deliveries).<br><br>Blackmailing supervisor: Haven't I told you that I am currently doing your performance appraisal?<br><br>SA (when out of earshot of supervisor): It's really not easy just to make a living...sigh....<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Fact of worklife #3  Salaried worker have no say at work - their fate is dictated by the whims and fancies of the big boss(es)</strong></span><br><br>Scenario: Woman was posted by the big boss to work for another boss (who replaced her fiance who died) in a rather tricky, uncomfortable situation.  Her guy friend (her dead fiance's best friend) asked how could she work under such circumstances and that she must have backbone and walk out of the job.<br><br>Woman said: I am just a salaried worker, what backbone can I speak of? An instruction is given to me, so I take action - that's my job (whether I like it or not). Walk out of the job and do what? Eat north-west wind (xi1 bei3 feng1, i.e. become jobless and incomeless)?<br><br>Sad but so true.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of slow worker... here's what my boss mass-emailed us a week ago.  I guess there's a point to the passage but somehow suspect boss wouldn't take kindly to me if I were to quote it back to him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>=== copy &amp; pasted from email ===<br><br>An interesting reflection  :   Slow Down Culture<br><br>It's been 18 years since I joined Volvo, a Swedish company. Working for them has proven to be an interesting experience. Any project here takes 2 years to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and brilliant. It's a rule.<br><br>Globalize processes have caused in us (all over the world) a general sense of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we have come to posses a need  to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly with the slow movements of the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate, debate, debate, hold x quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown scheme. At the end, this always yields better results.<br><br>Said in another words:<br>1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in Brazil.<br>2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants.<br>3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people.<br>4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are some of its renowned<br>companies. Volvo supplies the NASA.<br><br>The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues picked me up at the<br>hotel every morning. It was September, bit cold and snowy. We would arrive  early at the company and he would park far away from the entrance (2000 employees drive their car to work). The first day, I didn't say anything,  either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do you have a fixed parking space? I've noticed we park far from the entrance even when there are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied, "Since we're here early we'll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late will be late and need a place closer to the door. Don't you think? Imagine my face.<br><br>Nowadays, there's a movement in Europe name Slow Food.<br>This movement establishes that people should eat and drink slowly, with enough time to taste their food, spend time with the family, friends, without rushing.<br>Slow Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast Food and what it<br>stands for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a bigger movement<br>called Slow Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.<br><br>Basically, the movement questions the sense of "hurry" and "craziness"  generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of "having in quantity"<br>(life status) versus "having with quality", "life quality" or the "quality<br>of being". French people, even though they work 35 hours per week, are more  productive than Americans or British. Germans have established 28.8 hour workweeks and have seen their productivity been driven up by 20%. This slow attitude has brought forth the US's attention, pupils of the fast and the "do it now!".<br><br>This no-rush attitude doesn't represent doing less or having a lower<br>productivity. It means working and doing things with greater quality,<br>productivity, perfection, with attention to detail and less stress. It means<br>reestablishing family values, friends, free and leisure time. Taking the<br>"now", present and concrete, versus the "global", undefined and anonymous.<br>It means taking humans' essential values, the simplicity of living.<br><br>It stands for a less coercive work environment, more happy, lighter and more<br>productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to do.<br>It's time to stop and think on how companies need to develop serious quality<br>with no-rush that will increase productivity and the quality of products and<br>services, without losing the essence of spirit.<br><br>In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there's a scene where Al Pacino asks a girl to dance and she replies, "I can't, my boyfriend will be here any minute now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an instant". Then they dance to a tango.<br><br>Many of us live our lives running behind time, but we only reach it when we die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing to be on time. Others are so anxious of living the future that they forget to live the present, which is the only time that truly exists. We all have equal time throughout the world. No one has more or less. The difference lies in how each one of us does with our time. We need to live each moment. As John Lennon said, "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans".<br><br>Congratulations for reading till the end of this message. There are many who will have stopped in the middle so as not to waste time in this globalized world.<br></div>
