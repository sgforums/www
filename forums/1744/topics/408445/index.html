              <p>I applied for the job, and the interviewer told me what kind of exciting work experiences and learning experience I will get. I was promised that I get exposure and to work with many people.</p>
              <p>But after I joined this new company, I found that half the time I sat down in my place, no work at all. I ask my boss but came back with deaf answer. So months past by, I still sit there doing nothing, I was promised to have the opportunity to do "A-Function" job. But up until now, my boss still wants to take full charge of the A-Function job. He gives me little morsels of the part of A-Function job to do, really pathetic exposure. I learn nothing. The A-Function job has a few levels, after i helped my boss to finish the first level, he had meetings with the bigboss and the people from other department but he conveniently left me out. Then second and third levels, he left me out and didn't give me the opportunity to update the A-Function job, I am so disappointed. Broken promises.</p>
              <p>I know it is no use to tell him about me wanting more exposure, knowing that he is so laizze faire, the boss does everything last minute and he lacks coordination skills. So I pester him everyday, asking him irritating questions to tell him that I want a piece of the action. I know I am new to the A-Function job and I am not use to the format, but he could at least give me some guidance so I can do the work because this was what I was hired for in the first place. I know I can do it, but he just doesn't want to teach me. I have handles A-Function jobin my previous company but because my previous company is from an entirely different industry, I need some guidance for this current company.</p>
              <p>This boss neglects his staff, it has been 1 year, I am totally disatisfied. Most of the time I am free, swatting flies. He doesn't want to give me the opportunity to do the job.</p>
              <p>But I know some of you will surely advice me to quit. Quitting is really not the answer. Economy is not good and it is hard to find a job. I have changed 4 jobs in 8 years so I do not want to be branded as a job hopper. My longest was 2.5 years.</p>
              <p>I believe this is the chance for me to stand up against my boss, and to lobby more for my job role. I want to pester him everyday to give me more chance. What should I do? If the situation don't change after 2.5 years, I think I may have to seek aÂ new job. I am unhappy with the culture. It is so unsystematic, I am suppose to be in charge of the A-function job, but the boss have decided to go back against his words. And I really dislike a job whereby I am so free half the time. I want a meaning ful job, something that I can sit down and work from 8am to 5pm and not surf the internet as I have nothing to do. I have a bit of work, but it is nothing compared to my previous job. THe job is boring, it has some interesting job functions but my boss is hoarding them for himself.</p>
              <p>Very little point to have a word with him, I have told him before, but he just sits down there quietly. I have no choice but to continue to pester him and implicitly tell him I want more job exposure, but day by day I am receiving a small morcel.</p>
