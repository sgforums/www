At this period of time, anyone who is abt to leave the company for good will leave NO CHANCES for others to jepodize their plans de.<br><br>If u r worrying abt ur learning, u r probably worryin for nothing.  It's pretty usual for someone who is totally new in the line to rem nuts.  It's onli when u start doin it &amp; u wll remember.
