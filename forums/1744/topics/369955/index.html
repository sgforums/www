              <p>If you have work for long in your ex company you can say reasons like look for better prospects, want to learn new things etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What if you have only work a short period of time like say 2 or 3 months than you got sack or ask to resign on your own?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What reasons can you say during interview?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Say job not suitable and they will ask you why. Suppose you say your collegues don't want to teach you properly, office politics etc that is why you want to resign, than they will shoot you by asking you what if I employ you and you also find out that your collegues also don't want to teach you than will you resign..</p>

              <p>Friend, don't ever think of switching job, now market still haven't stable yet and you want resign? Alot of people is jobless outside and waiting for any job, if you left, there's plenty of people will replace your position, think about it:) If you really want switch job, i advise you after 2-3years time, let the time settle the crisis of downturn first.</p>
