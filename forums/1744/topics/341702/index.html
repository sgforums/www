              <p>I was on one day leave and the manager did said, if anything to cover have to let the other party knows but then there were nothing to follow-up during my absence.  It is true that nothing personal about work but then he's not supposed to search through my stuff.  If he were to search my stuff just to cover my duties well so next time I don't have to highlight outstanding matters, he can be a detective to find out by himself.</p>
              <p>Worse part, when my female colleague and I were talking and after my colleague went off, he can come to ask me, what did we talked about and that was during lunchtime.  He told me to share with him as he wanted to kaypo also..</p>
