              <p>From petty disagreements to all out rivalries, nearly all of us know
              how clashing personalities at work can affect us. But even in the most
              extreme cases, there's usually a way to deal with that co-worker who
              always gets under your skin.<br><br> If you have to interact with different "characters" in your workplace, follow these tips to deal with them successfully.</p>
              <p><br><br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The defensive guy</strong></span><strong><br></strong> We all know "Mr. Perfect" -- he's the guy who can never accept
              constructive criticism, no matter how you deliver it. He believes his
              way of doings things is always correct, and nothing you or anyone else
              can say will ever change his mind. <br><br> <strong></strong></p>
              <p><br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The constant arguer</strong></span><strong><br></strong> You know that guy who speaks up just to hear the sound of his own
              voice? Of course you do; we all do. This is the guy who will dispute
              even the most rational points, just to be heard. He loves to disagree,
              and always has a problem with what others say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The "me" guy</strong></span><strong><br></strong> This is the guy
              who epitomizes ego. He has an inflated sense of himself, and believes
              that everything always revolves around his needs. He takes credit for
              everything, regardless of whether or not he actually deserves it,
              especially when it comes to team projects. The ego-obsessed co-worker
              also believes his problems are always bigger and more important than
              everyone else's.<br><br> <br><br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The stubborn guy</strong></span><strong><br></strong> This is the guy who's anything but a team player. He's too committed to
              his own ways to ever be open to change and new ideas. And even when it
              seems obvious to everyone else that his methods are ineffective, he
              always believes that his way of doing things is the best one. The
              stubborn guy may not always put in the energy to argue with others, but
              he's generally an old-fashioned guy who is set in his ways.<br><br> <br><br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The backstabber</strong></span><strong><br></strong> This is the guy we all really hate -- <a href="http://www.askmen.com/money/professional/20_professional_life.html">he talks trash about you</a> and your work to others, and he typically does it behind your back. He
              characterizes you as someone who's incompetent, and does his very best
              to make you look bad in front of your co-workers and superiors.
              Regardless of whether or not it's true, the backstabber is effective in
              creating the perception that you're as bad as he makes you out to be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The blame game guy</strong></span><strong><br></strong> When it
              comes to playing the blame game, this guy's the champion. He never
              takes responsibility for his mistakes and shifts the blame onto others,
              often to an incredibly irrational extent. He fails to realize that the
              easiest way to impress your co-workers is to admit when you've done
              something wrong, and explore ways to avoid doing so in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The whiner </strong></span><strong><br></strong> The whiner is that guy who always complains. He's constantly crossing
              the delicate line between venting frustration and unconstructive
              nitpicking. He unleashes his cynical attitude onto whoever happen's
              around him, whether they want to hear it or not.</p>
