A provisional government was established in his place, ending 267 years of Manchu rule in China and 2,000 years of imperial rule. The former emperor, only six years old, was allowed to keep up his residence in Beijing's Forbidden City, and he took the name of Henry Pu Yi.<br><br>Pu Yi was enthroned as emperor in 1908 after his uncle, the Kuang-hsÃ½ emperor, died. He reigned under a regency and underwent training to prepare him for his coming rule. However, in October 1911, his dynasty fell to Sun Yat-sen's revolution, and four months later he abdicated. The new Chinese government granted him a large government pension and permitted him to live in the imperial palace until 1924, when he was forced into exile.<br><br></div>

Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone both won Best Director awards.<br><br>The winners received gold statuettes, designed by art director Cedric Gibbons and sculpted by George Stanley.

The top of the 180-foot tower was hanging 17 feet south of the base, and studies showed that the tilt was increasing by a fraction every year.<br><br>Experts warned that the medieval building--one of Italy's top tourist attractions--was in serious danger of toppling in an earthquake or storm. Proposals to save the Leaning Tower arrived in Pisa from all over the world, but it was not until 1999 that successful restorative work began.<br><br></div>

The company would later become the Bayerische Motor-Werke (Bavarian Motor Works or BMW).<br><br>As the original name suggests, BMW began as a manufacturer of aircaft engines.

In 1929, BMW built its first car, the Dixi, in a factory in Eisenach, Germany.<br><br>The outbreak of World War II saw BMW, like its U.S. counterparts, switch production to war manufacturing. BMW facilities were destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II. After the peace, a three-year ban was imposed on BMW by the Allies for its part in the war.<br><br>The BMW R24 motorcycle became, with its release in 1948, the company's first post-war product. BMW completed its first postwar car, the 501, in 1951. BMW is still one of the world's leading automobile manufacturers. The company is noted for its innovations in the field of ABS, Anti-Lock Breaking Systems.<br><br></div>
