              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>The first time it happened to marketing manager Crystal*, she was completely blindsided.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“I was going overseas for a work trip, and my supervisor asked me to take pictures for another project we were working on. She had seen my Instagram feed and said I took good pictures, so she wanted me to take some for use in our presentation to our director,” she said.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“Because of her instructions, I lugged my heavy DSLR camera all the way to Europe, and spent a lot of time and effort into curating shots. However, when I returned to the office and showed her my pictures, she looked at me incredulously and went, ‘I told you not to take these! Your pictures will never make it into the presentation. They’re only good enough for your own social media feed.’ I was completely taken aback — I had actually written down her instructions! But because I was so shocked, I couldn’t defend myself in time.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Account executive Marianne* had a similar experience in the advertising agency she used to work at. She said: “The account manager I was working on the same account with instructed me to come up with a few pitch ideas for a client. Over the course of the prep work, he dictated the direction of the pitch and reminded me to follow his instructions exactly. When we finally went to present the ideas to the account director, she was not at all pleased to find out that we had gotten the client’s brief entirely wrong.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“Instead of owning up to his mistake, the account manager agreed with her and told her that he’d already told me, and he wasn’t sure why I still went ahead with the pitch angle. He was so convincing that I actually tried to recall if I’d misunderstood him. When I asked him about it afterwards, he retorted, ‘Well, you didn’t have to take me so literally, did you?’”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>DENIAL, MISDIRECTION &amp; CONTRADICTION</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>It’s tempting to write off these apparent lapses in memory as one-off incidents, especially if you’re dealing with someone you work closely with. But if you’re starting to see a consistent pattern over an extended period of time, you could be looking at something a lot more insidious, such as “gaslighting”.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Gaslighting is widely defined as a form of manipulation that makes the victim doubt his or her sense of reality.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Through constant and persistent denial, misdirection and contradiction, the manipulator gains the upper hand when the victim starts to question their own memory and sanity. While the concept of gaslighting isn’t new, it has been more commonly covered in popular culture as a manipulation tactic in relationships.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>The term originated from the 1944 Oscar-nominated mystery thriller Gaslight, which tells the story of a young woman who is constantly manipulated and lied to by her husband, to the point where she isolates herself from the public for fear of not being able to trust her own grasp of reality.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Gaslighting was also brought to the fore in The New York Times bestseller The Girl On The Train, where a cheating ex-husband was revealed in a plot twist to have taken advantage of the lead character’s alcoholism to plant false memories of her abusive behaviour towards him.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>MORE THAN JUST A MANIPULATION TACTIC</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>But it was only last year that gaslighting outside of personal relationships became a hot topic, thanks to the United States presidential election — and, more specifically, US president Donald Trump.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Even when presented with video or written evidence of contradictory statements made throughout the course of his campaign, Trump would resolutely deny ever making them. Former CNN correspondent Frida Ghitis summed it up best in an opinion-editorial in which she stated: “Reality is becoming hazy in the era of Trump. And that’s no accident. The fact is Trump has become America’s gaslighter-in-chief.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Now, people are starting to take notice of such tactics, particularly in the work environment. If Crystal’s and Marianne’s stories sound like something you’ve experienced before, you may be a victim of gas lighting in the workplace.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Rachel Gan, manager of Sales &amp; Marketing, Consumer &amp; Healthcare at recruitment consultancy Robert Walters Singapore, shared two common examples.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“If your boss has a history of promising to do something for you and subsequently retracting his or her statement; or if you find a co-worker alternating between being warm and cold towards you, while constantly undermining your contributions, it could be a form of gaslighting.” she said.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>According to Ho Shee Wai, founder and registered psychologist of The Counselling Place, people who gaslight often have some form of personality disorder such as narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, or antisocial personality disorder. They could appear at any hierarchical level in the workplace, but problems are amplified when they are your supervisors.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“In Asia, we are always told to listen to our bosses and corporate settings do not encourage second guessing or questioning one’s boss,” said Richa Sharma, manager at employment agency Page Personnel Singapore.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>As experts describe it, gaslighting is a “sophisticated form of emotional abuse”. And the unfortunate thing is, it’s sometimes hard to identify and hence correctly manage it.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“Many people are unaware of the concept of gas lighting,” said Ho. “Many people chalk it up to having a difficult boss.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Daniel Koh, psychologist at Insights Mind Centre, agrees, “Most of the time, (the victims) are so caught up in handling their emotions or the current situation (of being gaslighted), they don’t realise the intentions (of the abuser).”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>A MENTAL &amp; PHYSICAL TOLL</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>According to Ho, it’s crucial that people are aware they’re being manipulated.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“The technique used in gaslighting is similar to those used in brainwashing, interrogation and torture that have been used in psychological warfare by intelligence operatives, law enforcement and other forces for decades. And the effect is a negative impact on the mental equilibrium, self-confidence and self-esteem, so that (victims) are no longer able to function in an independent way.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Sharma echoed those sentiments. “By listening to the accusations by the abuser, you are automatically and categorically giving him or her more power and control. As a result, you’re breaking the trust you have with yourself and handing it over to the abuser(s). The problem is bigger than you think.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Sounds exaggerated? Consider the physical and mental toll gaslighting took on Crystal and Marianne.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“I left every meeting with my boss completely drained — mentally and physically — from having to be hyper-present,” said Crystal. “I started exhibiting classic signs of burn-out: I physically couldn’t get out of bed in the morning, I lost my appetite, I lost interest in things I used to feel passionate about. My hair started falling out and my skin became patchy and dry.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>In Marianne’s case, despite exercising diligently and eating well, her periods became irregular because of the stress.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“There were days where I would pass out on my laptop at home because I was wracking my brains so hard for new ideas again and again in case he changed his mind. And because he would make sneering remarks about how I was such a ‘millennial’ — implying that I couldn’t take the heat — I tried even harder to prove him wrong. I ended up drinking almost every day to relieve the stress.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Despite the physical strain, both of them stuck it out for longer than they wanted to because of the same reason: They blamed themselves for the situation.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“I bought into his ‘millennial’ nonsense, and truly believed I was just terrible at what I did,” recalled Marianne. “I didn’t quit because I was afraid that nobody else would hire me, and I’d be proving him right.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>If the gaslighter is your boss, Robert Walters’ Gan suggests summarising and documenting your discussion after important meetings.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“In the event that your boss promises you a pay raise or promotion then denies ever having said anything, it would be good then to use the writer summary as a reference point — it could be in the form of an email or appraisal form,” she elaborated.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“If he or she maintains the same stance despite the evidence, maintain your calm but be assertive yet tactful by asking your boss what made him or her change his mind.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>In the case of a co-worker gaslighting you, Gan said that regardless of the situation, it’s important to maintain your professionalism. “If you feel the feedback provided by your co-worker lacks justification, try scheduling a meeting with him or her to obtain more clarification.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>When faced with such people in the office, both Sharma and Gan agree that it’s best to have a support system whether within or outside the company, and “basically, (let them be) your reason within the insanity”.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>It’s also imperative to have faith in yourself and trust your intuition.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“Have self-confidence. If you don’t allow others to get to you, then gaslighting won’t work,” said Insights Mind Centre’s Koh.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>Of course, if the situation doesn’t improve, sometimes there’s just no point fighting a losing battle.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“The healthiest way to end gaslighting is to put yourself as priority, and get out,” shares Sharma. “This is not a battle you need to win. There is no ‘they won’, or ‘they beat me’ scenario. You just need to move on and be at peace with it, but also recognise the lessons learned from the ordeal.”</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>DON’T BE AFRAID TO LEAVE</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>In the end, both Cystal and Marianne left their jobs because, despite confronting their supervisors, nothing changed.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: "Helvetica Neue LT W01_41488878", sans-serif; font-size: 1.9rem; line-height: 1.57895; letter-spacing: 0.02em;'>“My boss simply did not see anything wrong with her actions,” said Crystal. “The only thing left was to change my situation — either not let it get to me, or leave a job I loved. For the sake of my wellbeing, I chose the latter.”</p>

My mind felt clear and my colleagues even joked about my skin glowing the next day.”</p>

But ultimately, no job is worth the mental torture I had to endure. All I was looking for in a supervisor was someone who demonstrated basic respect for others. Gaslighting your co-workers and subordinates is the very opposite of that.”</p>

              <p>That why even during the interview time if you didn't want to suffer in your long term career, you must be very observant like Sherlock to judge whether the company is really your idea place to work, for example, if you ask for direction or help to the interview room in the company and these people inside give you the 'attitude' that you should know how to look for your direction yourself, it is already an warning sign how 'lonely' your future job is in this company.</p>
              <p>But the most obvious case would be the manager or in charge who interview you: from my experience if they try to 'sweet talk' you on how wonderful your job scope is, chance are it is most likely to be the most 'unpleasant' type that nobody want to do and they want to 'con' you in for it, it just the same logic like why your steady appear to be so caring to you during dating, but after marriage when they 'win' you, that when their attitude change 180 degree. Or if the interviewer keep 'complaining' about the job scope la and how life awful and negative crap etc, most possibly I would pray I will never get another second interview from this kind of company.</p>
