            <div class='col-md body'>Most people will be a little kanchiong and over-zealous intially but give the fella some time and he will settle down. Even the boss needs time to get to know the people and work processes, so it would be good for everyone if the men also 'educate' the boss by sharing with him/her their everyday work experience. Then slowly build up the trust from there.<br><br></div>
