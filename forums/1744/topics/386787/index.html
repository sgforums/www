              <p>Just wondering if anyone of you experience this at work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are not close with your collegues. In fact you purposely keep a distance from them because you know they are always gossiping about you. You have real evidence that they are really gossiping and talking bad about you and not just being suspicious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example, when you are in the toilet shitting and than your collegues walk into the toilet to pee and they don't know that you are in the cubicle shitting and than they talk bad about you. In fact you are in the cubicle and you hear all the bad things that they talk about you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They are watching your every move in the office. If your boss/manager is not in the office, than your collegues will watch you and than report to the boss/manager on what you are doing. They will always gossip about the mistakes that you make but never talk about the correct and excellent things that you do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You absolutely have no freedom in the office as they are always spying on you. You feel very nervous and stress and are afraid that you will make mistakes as you know they will tell your boss/manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When there are things you are not sure you don't really dare to ask your collegues because you are scare they will tell your manager/boss that you don't know how to do your job and you are stupid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone face such a situation in the office? Is this a very common situation in the office? Do you think it is better to quit if your workplace is such a terrible situation?</p>

              <p>usually they are like beast, they feel safety and prefer to live in a pack. in a group they will feel no one can buly them but they can bully people, with words. bosses also usually like it this way so attention can be diverted to one individual and no one will traget problems at bosses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>buy them food and treats ? i mean will that boost their ego or make them feel better. i never know since my childhood that you have to do this to make thing so low.</p>
              <p>i used to have one boss, always ask people go eat because they got company marney spend, then got one guy very loud when hear eat only quickly always very loud come lah go eat then go eat jap food like he is expert jap like that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's why i look see them all no up, no matter what the race or class.</p>

              you buy gifts because you CAN. it shows you have the ability to care. but if they asked for gifts that they want like an expensive bag, only a fool would give in to their demands. remember you work for your boss and not for your colleagues. so if a boss listens to a colleague's gossip about you, it shows the character of the boss. he will not last long, if he wants to fire you just wish him good luck for he had become company's dog instead.
