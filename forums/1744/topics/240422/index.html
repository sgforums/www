            <div class='col-md body'>to all the girls out there, if u are interested in working in a call centre, i hope u will find the below guide useful.<br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Call Centre or "Contact Centre" is a customer service oriented job whereby one is tasked to answer phone calls. Some might also be known as "Helpdesk" if the service provided is technically based or "Receptionist/ Operators" if the main job is to transfer calls to other parties.<br><br>The person answering the calls are known as "Agents" or "Call Centre Officer".<br><br><strong>How it works?</strong><br>Basically most call centre runs on PABX/IVR system which distributes the calls to the call centre agents. for example customers dialled the hotline number, usually he or she will hear an announcement 1st and asked to make a choice by pressing the keypad. once the choice is made, the call will be placed in a queue and if any agents is available, it will be routed to them. if not, they will continue hearing music/advertisement until an agent is free to take the call.<br><br>[b]Basics/b]<br>All agents will be issued something which we call a login ID, usually a 4 or 5 digit numbers that the agent must key into the phone every time they start work. this login ID is also an extension number which internal staffs can call them at.<br><br>usually the phones the agents are using won't be a DDI number, meaning to say external parties won't be able to call the agent directly except from calling the call centre hotline.<br><br>once logged in, the agent will have a few choices, they can either put themselves on "avaliable mode" and start taking calls or stay in "off' mode". a 'off mode' is for the agent to put herself on unavaliable so that calls will not be routed to her so that she can do other stuffs, like typing an e-mail or go for a break.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Salary</strong><br>Call Centre agents usually get a low basic pay because they will get incentives based on the numbers of calls they take. the more calls they take the more they get.<br><br><strong>Superiors</strong><br>In a Call Centre, they is usually a Call Centre Manager who will monitor the performance of the agents. their main job is to handle calls which the agents cannot handle for example when a angry customer wants to speak to the manger. a Call Centre Manager also generate reports and statistics on a regular basics to determine the service level.<br><br><strong>Performance/Reports</strong><br>How well an agent performed can be found in the report the Call Centre Manager generates. the report will usually shows how many calls the call centre receives, how many calls each agent answered, how long the customer is kept waiting in queue, how many abandoned calls etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Job Scope</strong><br>Whenever agents answer a call, they are often required to say "Welcome to [Company's name], this is [Agent's name]. How may I help you?"<br><br>After hanging up the call, the agent need to do something we called "After call work" which is the follow up action as requested by the customer. it can be keying in the infomation into the computer, dispatching the job to relevant parties.<br><br><strong>Working Hours</strong><br>Call Centres usually works longer hours than other jobs so that customers can call in anytime. for example Banks' Call Centres works 24 hours as customers might call in any time of the day to ask for credit card related enquires.</div>
