              <p>reaally this type of boss poor EQ. most be the type work in one company for very long neveer ever changed jobs type.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>once i went for an interview the lady (shallbe my immediate superior if i were to be hired) keep asking me if i were to be given the job can i do OT. My grade is OT that type cannot claim already. so i told her if there is a need to i will stay to solve any problems at my level and pass on to my subordinates once my part of the problem solved but she keeps insisting can i stay. fishy - this type is must be want to to also do the sudbordinate job because you cannot claim OT already - free and cheap labor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not for me though, some companies even stress on executive exempt staff doing their areas of work and they do not abuse or encourage higher level people doing lower level job.</p>

              <p>why is your boss so fark up one? you should have challenged him,
              if he gives his home tel no to customer, I also give <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>your home tel no is private and personal. if customer cant get
              you in office, still got your colleagues around what. otherwise
              your boss is still around to address customer concerns.</p>

              <p>Only HR has the personal details of every employee. some bosses may requirer hp to contact you but for desk job really don;t see the need. use the company phone line can oredi. i also encounter before one company there;s one laojiao in teh department suppose to have ALL and i mean ALL you personal details. this type of company ppolicy really sucks big time. How can some whho is not the HR dept have ALL your personal particulars? !</p>
