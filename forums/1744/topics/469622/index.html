              </p><p>Hi all, I had just started an internship and noticed my supervisor constantly bullying my co-worker in the workplace. The abuse were often physical. I managed capture some video of him hitting my coworker. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">The victim is shy and doesn't want to do anything about it. There isn't anyone in the workplace that will do anything about this.</span></p>

              <p>Everyone has a part to play, even if you are not an employer or even an 
              employee.  If you know of employers that are non-compliant, you can 
              report by calling this hotline: 1800-221-9922, or email <a title="workright@mom.gov.sg" href="mailto:workright@mom.gov.sg">workright@mom.gov.sg</a>.  The identity of the caller will be kept strictly confidential.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board
               are stepping up our efforts to bring about compliance with the CPF Act 
              and Employment Act (EA), so that employees, particularly more vulnerable
               groups like low-wage workers, enjoy their basic employment rights under
               the law.  Areas of focus include payment of CPF contributions, on-time 
              payment of salary, overtime payment, provision of paid annual and sick 
              leave, and adherence to working-hour requirements, amongst others.</p>
              <p>We will do this through a two-prong WorkRight initiative covering 
              enforcement and education. Besides ramping up enforcement, we will be 
              reaching out to the public through a publicity campaign which aims to 
              educate workers on their employment rights under the CPF Act and the EA,
               as well as to educate employers about their legal obligations.</p>

The victim, I'm wondering why he didn't retaliate and give a punch on that bastard supervisor face there and there. He is 29 years old and don't tell me SAF didn't teach him any tae kwan do? Anyway, good for the victim to report to the police and I hope that bastard supervisor get sacked by his employer and get heavy fines plus prison sentence. That will teach him an expensive lesson that he will remember for the rest of his remainder life. F**K to that bastard supervisor.</div>

              Response from MOM pertaining to the supervisor slapping his co-worker incidence.
              
              [Alert] The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has been notified via email today (20 May 2013) of an online video depicting someone who appeared to be physically abused by another. The person who recorded the video has contacted MOM and we have alerted the Police. As updated by the Police, the victim has lodged a police report.
              
              Employers are expected to treat their employees fairly and with respect. In situations where employees feel that they are unfairly treated or threatened, they should report to their supervisor/HR, or if unionised, they should seek advice and assistance from their union. If the threat involves physical harm, the employees should report this to the Police immediately.

              Whatever it is, is good for that ShaneM has loaded up that video in YouTube for Singaporeans and the rest of the world to see it, which attracted MOM attention. It is the only way to attract the authority attention and act immediately, plus to embarrass that bastard supervisor publicly too. Reporting to the authority with just making a report will take a longer time for appropriate action to be taken on that bastard supervisor. Shane M, good work. You did the right thing.

              yes yes, that bully deserves to be jailed and caned the maximum no. of times!  and sacked by the company!  it is odd that there is no words from the employer till now.
              
              young people come out to society to work only to face such kind of workplace bully!  that is going to leave a trauma on him when he really goes out to work after completing his studies.  but then again, everyone should stand up to his rights and not allow himself to be bullied this way.
              
              that is the sad truth of worklife in today's world.  besides physical abuse, there are also a lot of psychological abuses going everyday at the workplace, some visible and some invisible with veiled threats.
              
              if only these bullies think...if one day your son / daughter goes out to work and gets bullied, how would you feel as a parent?

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope the police investigating officer will investigate on that bastard supervisor background further. I think that recent victim is not the only one he has abused physically. Probably there were others in the past that he had physically abused the intern students from SIM or from other insituitions but the intern students did not report it regardless whether they were Singaporeans or foreigners. Maybe that bastard supervisor had abused more foreign students than Singaporeans in the past. He probably has physically abused his own children and he is a wife beater too, I will not be surprised, looking at his f**king face and what he has done many people would like to slap him too if one meet him personally, motherf**ker supervisor. That company should also be blamed should there were other similar cases in the past had took place but the management did not do anything. Wondering why the full time staffs in that company did not do anything too. In this case, that company should be black listed totally from having internship students with immediate effect.</div>

              wrong la...it was the intern who whistle blowed whom got his internship terminated by SIM.
              
              the victim was already no longer a student at SIM.  he is already 29yo...he continued working at the company at the intern pay rate for 3 years after graduating.  i think there is something wrong with this guy also...
