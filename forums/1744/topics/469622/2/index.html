              yes yes...he continued working there at the intern rate of S$500 without any contract with the company, with no leave and other benefits....and had his pay deducted for taking leave...
              
              this company needs to be taken to court by MOM for flouting the MOM regulations....

            <div class='col-md body'>The case is similar like an employer abusing a domestic maid, a parent abusing their children, a wife beater and a teacher slapping a student. He should be arrested by the police and lock-up in a cell with other alleged criminals awaiting for bail or awaiting to be charged in court before bail. And the sentence must be a deterant sentence with a punitive fine and a prison sentence to send a clear message to the others of the consequences of abusing workers at their workplace.</div>

              Looking at that bastard supervisor f**king face and behaviour...I have an impression that this is not the first time he had abused internship students in his company. Strong indication that he had done that same abused on other internship students in past. He did that without any hesitation or worries of being approached by his company management or by SIM management of his action....so confident that there wouldn't be any problems.
                  
              The police investigation officer should approached SIM and request for the list of internship students send in that company in the past and request for an interview or contact number to investigate further. Foreign students send to that company in the past could have been similarly abused. Should it turn out to be true then the police can bring more charges on that bastard supervisor.
                  
              The intern student that reported this incidence mentioned this when he had approached the internship oc-ordinator:
                  
              "(The internship coordinator) was just doing her job, and was trying not to
              make any rash decisions," he explained. "I wanted to head down to SIM
              to show her the footage and give her a better understanding of what was
              happening in that office. But I was really disappointed when she brushed
              me aside, saying that she will talk to the manager first. I felt that my school
              didn't take me seriously."
                  
              It gives an impression that somehow she knew about that bastard supervisor abusive behaviour. Maybe she knew about similar abuse cases on their student in the past but she had brushed it aside. SIM or the police investigation officer should approached her to investigate further.

              the S$100k is not just a compensation for the physical abuse but for the backpay of salary for 3 years.  S$100k for 3 years is not a lot for a graduate who worked that kind of long hours.
              
              no matter what, the bully should be jailed.  his stupid crap reason for the abuse cannot stand....he has no moral authority to dish out such punishment.  if he wants, he can do it at his own home.

              For foreign students to be attached for internship or on the job training in companies in Singapore....they need to have a work permit too. Many companies in Singapore took this advantage for cheap temporary labour besides giving the foreign students good testimonials and OJT certificates. The respective institution will apply that work permit for their foreign students on behalf of the company which in turn has to secure security bonds and insurance for them. One of the loophole within MOM system for employment of foreign labours in Singapore.

              "The company where the incident occurred is Encore eServices in Jurong East. The company was registered in April 2012, and designs management software for private clinics. The supervisor is only identified as a person named Alan.
               
              Two former interns at the firm were contacted by the press and they said they â€œworked in fearâ€� during their internship with Encore, and had to endure scolding sessions which would last for hours.
               
              One woman who quit after two months said â€“ â€œHe listed down all my mistakes and made me feel worthless. I broke down in tears a few times.â€� Another quit after nine weeks and mentioned that Alan was always threatening to terminate her contract."

              Two more interns speak out
               
              SINGAPORE â€“ The same supervisor has also been accused of abusing two other female interns, Shin Min Daily News reported.
               
              One of them told the Chinese evening paper that she was locked up in a room and harshly lectured by Alan. She revealed that she received at least five such lectures during the two months that she was with the company. Describing Alan as ill-tempered, she told Shin Min that he would flare up at every mistake made by his employees.
               
              The 23-year-old student worked as an intern at the company as part of a university arrangement. She received a monthly allowance of $500. She noticed during the initial days of her internship the suppressive environment there and that the employees did not speak much. She said she chose to resign as she was not able to put up with the stressful conditions.
               
              Another 20-year-old student, however, persevered and completed her internship at the company as she did not want her graduation to be affected. She said in a television interview that she went through nine weeks of unreasonable and aggressive treatment from Alan.

              <div style="position: absolute; top: -1999px; left: -1988px;">
              <p>According
                   to Lianhe Wanbao, the intern joined the firm at Jurong East three years
                   ago as an undergraduate. He was paid $500 a month and not given any 
                  benefits or leave days.</p>
              <p>When he graduated from university, the intern continued to work for 
                  the company under the same pay, still without a contract or any 
                  benefits.</p>
              <p>His family said that he often returned home late and also turned up at work even when he was ill.</p>
              <p>According to the intern, his supervisor, identified only as Alan, had
                   physically and verbally abused him from time to time. However, he said 
                  that the worst incident was the one secretly recorded and shared online.</p>
              <p>When asked, the intern told a Wanbao reporter that he did not leave 
                  the job as he liked it very much and learned many new things while at 
                  it. He also said that he felt like he could not leave because there were
                   always projects that he had to finish.</p>
              <p>Despite that, the intern had tried to resign once in 2012 but was told not to leave as the office was shorthanded.</p>
              <p>When he asked for a pay raise, he was told by his supervisor that his
                   performance was not up to scratch and that he did not have enough 
                  experience.</p>
