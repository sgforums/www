              <p>Well i think singapore bosses&amp;employers are taking things for granted due to this present economy crisis,thus they tends to assign more jobs to their subordinates to have multi-tasks job scope of work,whilst the formers ones are bound to think that those latter ones are too afraid of quitting their jobs,as it would be difficult for them to find another job and bring income back to support their families..</p>
              <p>I think its better to quit the jobs to prove them that by not working for them,we still wont be starving,anyway living in this world,don't tell me we have ti struggle and work like hell in order to earn such a miser and petty amount of money???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hands,I have been working in overseas over at ASEAN countries.</p>
              <p>Those employees'scope of work are single-task,yet their salaries are either same as us or more,so what does this implying to us,especially singaporeans?</p>

              <p>It all starts from the govt.   The CDC tells (psycho) those who go to them for help that employees must have the mindset to do more jobs (more job responsibilities) but get low salary.   They went on to say that these days are different from the past.     People must work much more and get paid less.</p>

              <p>actually for being paid as much, it's sort of possible to be true taking into account cost of living at the place. they come here because the money is big here. They can save and the money earnt here is alot when they go back.</p>
              <p>That's what a lot of malaysians are doing.And of course, it's easier to move back home when you're done working vs immigrating when you're done working at home.</p>

              <p>so you're saying that he's probably earning less, but also spending less, thus it appears to him that he's being paid the same, or even more ... in an even more limited jobscope job .... in another ASEAN country ? ..... </p>
              <p>it must be that, cos I still cannot imagine where else in ASEAN, can you be paid as much or even more to do an even more simple or limited job in Singapore, even if you equalize for currency.</p>
              <p>maybe the chap's got a good lobang brewing somewhere ..... he should share more details, list down the jobs and countries where he's worked.... </p>
