            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.thefunplace.com/valen/art/origin.gif"><br><br>February 14 is Valentine's Day. Although it is celebrated as a lovers' holiday today, with the giving of candy, flowers, or other gifts between couples in love, it originated in 3rd Century Rome as a tribute to St. Valentine, a Catholic bishop.<br><br>For eight hundred years prior to the establishment of Valentine's Day, the Romans had practiced a pagan celebration in mid-February commemorating young men's rite of passage to the god Lupercus. During these times boys and girls were segregated. The celebration featured a lottery in which young men would draw the names of teenage girls from a box and they will be partners throughout the Festival. After being paired, the children would often continue to see each other throughout the year and on occasion even fell in love and got married.<br><br>In an effort to do away with the pagan custom, Pastors and priests of the early Christian church ordered a slight change in the lottery. Instead of the names of young women, the box would contain the names of saints. Both men and women were allowed to draw from the box, and the game was to emulate the ways of the saint they drew during the rest of the year. Needless to say, many of the young Roman men were not too pleased with the rule changes.<br><br>Instead of the pagan god Lupercus, the Church looked for a suitable patron saint of love to take his place. They found an appropriate choice in Valentine.<br><br>Emperor Claudius II of Rome, also known as Claudius the Cruel was having a difficult time recruiting men as soldiers. He believed that married men made poor soldiers. So he banned marriage from his empire. But Valentine would secretly marry young men that came to him. He was eventually caught, arrested and condemned. He was beheaded on February 14th, around the year 270.<br><br>During the days that Valentine was imprisoned, he fell in love with the blind daughter of his jailer. His love for her, and his great faith, managed to miraculously heal her from her blindness before his death. Before he was taken to his death, he signed a farewell message to her, "<strong><span style="color: red;">From your Valentine</span></strong>." The phrase has been used on his day ever since.<br><br>Although the lottery for women had been banned by the church, the mid-February holiday in commemoration of St. Valentine was still used by Roman men to seek the affection of women. It became a tradition for the men to give the ones they admired handwritten messages of affection, containing Valentine's name.<br><br>The first Valentine card grew out of this practice. The first true Valentine card was sent in 1415 by Charles, duke of Orleans, to his wife. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London at the time.<br><br>Cupid, another symbol of the holiday, became associated with it because he was the son of Venus, the Roman god of love and beauty. Cupid often appears on Valentine cards.</div>
