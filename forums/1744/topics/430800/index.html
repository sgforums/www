              <p>I find foreign managers more polite than local ones....why? I dunno leh, local ones very petty and too proud....also the local managers "curry favour" the most....</p>
              <p>I used to work for a "psycho" local manager who had unrealistic expectations, he would gave me 3 days to complete a project that needed at least 1 week to complete....if I din do it on his timing, he would become a devil and scolded me harshly....I left my previous company becos of him....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>
              <p>Now I'm luckier to have an AngMo boss....very lenient and polite....But always make me do OT....well its still better than kana scolding everyday....Hahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
