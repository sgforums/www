              <p><em><span style="color: #008080;">Tuesday, June 16, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #008080;"><br><br>If dad looks exhausted this Father's Day 
              it could be due to his job, suggests new research that found many male employees 
              are now pressured to work up to 40 hours of overtime—often unpaid— per week to 
              stay competitive. <br><br>Women face the same pressures, but family obligations 
              may force them to work fewer hours on the job, putting them at risk for 
              demotions or even firings. <br><br>The new findings, published in the journal 
              Gender &amp; Society, add to the growing body of evidence that heightened 
              competition in the workplace, combined with modern business practices, are 
              resulting in near-unprecedented levels of overtime that may not even be 
              productive in the long run. <br><br>"This clearly does not ease the situation 
              for women and men who want to combine career and family-life," concluded lead 
              author Patricia van Echtelt and colleagues. "Moreover, a growing body of 
              literature shows that working long hours does not automatically lead to greater 
              productivity and effectiveness, and thus not necessarily contributes to 
              employers' needs but potentially harms the well-being of employees." <br><br>The 
              extensive study looked at the working habits of 1,114 male and female Dutch 
              employees. While the researchers indicate their findings could apply to other 
              countries, they chose to focus on the Netherlands, where outside family support, 
              such as childcare, has been unable to meet the growing demands. <br><br>Van 
              Echtelt, a Netherlands Institute for Social Research scientist, and her team 
              found that, among the survey respondents, 69 percent of all men worked overtime 
              versus 42 percent of women. Women who work overtime do so at a rate that is 
              about one-third lower than that of their male colleagues. <br><br>It's "usually 
              explained by the continuing trend for women to be more involved in unpaid family 
              work," the researchers noted. And even when partners share family chores, "men 
              often characterize their contribution as 'helping' their wives, without feeling 
              to have the main responsibility." <br><br>The researchers therefore predict 
              families with more kids and at-home responsibilities will become "more 
              constrained in their opportunities to indulge the 'choice' to work overtime." 
              <br><br>Choice is turning into expectation at most companies built upon the 
              "team work" model, with pressures coming from project teams, responsibility for 
              meeting profit or production targets, imposed deadlines and employees left to 
              manage their own careers. A separate study at a software engineering firm, for 
              example, determined that interdependent work patterns, "a crisis mentality," and 
              a reward system based on individual heroics led to "inefficient work processes 
              and long working hours." <br><br>Cornell University's Youngjoo Cha, who led 
              another U.S. data-based study accepted for publication in the American 
              Sociological Review, found that if a husband works more than 60 hours a week, 
              his wife is 42 percent more likely to leave her position. <br><br>Cha, who 
              agrees with the Dutch findings, said, "The norm of overwork systematically 
              disadvantages women, who are less likely to work long hours because of the 
              expectation that they will have primary caregiving responsibilities and do more 
              housework than men." <br><br>In future, van Echtelt and her team hope that 
              businesses will value their "employees more for their efficiency and relational 
              skills and less for their crisis mentality and working long hours." <br><br>###
