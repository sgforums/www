              <p>Recently I graduated with a MSW (Master of Social Work). I am a mid-career entrant n managed to get 1050 hours of supervised practice durng my course. recently i found a job n my situation is a bit weird la, as explained below:</p>
              <p>I started 2 weeks before this supervisor, she is coming bac to this dept where she was 2 years ago. 2 years have seen a lot of changes, online stuff etc. So this sup is telling me to do a filing system (very ancient) although I tell her most of the work is done online n which has replaced filing. She doesnt seem to und this n tells me to do it anyway.</p>
              <p>Thats another thing abt this supervisor - she doesnt listen n tells me to do things her way. Another thing also, before she came and when i was already there for 2 weeks, i was supervised by another acting sup who has explained to me alot of the work n how to do it which I find very useful.</p>
              <p>The real supervisor just tells me things that i already know. I dont find it comfortable sharing w her things that I encounter in my workplace bec of an experience - when i shared with her abt a case, she assumed a lot of things n stopped me before i can even talk. She then went on to talk abt HER own experiences and told me not to trust my colleagues so much from the other dept bec they will leave me in the lurch.</p>
              <p>recently i went on a ONE DAY leave and the day before, she texted me asking whether there are any updates. I say no, everything is okay and settled. she texted again saying cant be sure n she expect me to update her. i text bac saying i dont like her high n mighty tone w me and i m not a irresponsible worker to just leave n leave loose ends w my work. i also then vented my frus at working w her bec of her working style which is stifling me. after a round of texts bac n forth, i told her look its not like i am going on ONE MONTH leave only one day, so i suggested she look up any work pending online if she dont trust me. she say agree its difficult for me until she grant me to fly solo, inherently implying that i am territorial.</p>
              <p>Already working with her for 2 weeks I find tat she is carryng a lot of emo baggage n which she is transferring to me, she is dictating how to talk to my other colleagues from other depts, doesnt listen to how i handle the case but keep saying NO No No it should be done this way, and also she says thats how she works she rather protect than let the person suffer. But she is thinking i am sensitive like her when i am not. I would like to establish my own working r/ships n do the work my own way within ethical boundaries. As a sup, I expect her to act as a guide but she has not. I would like to do my work in peace but every now n then she calls me to her cubicle to talk to me abt the history of the dept n its future n how i have to network w external agencies which is impt. I already know this n i dun like the idea that she is often behind my back telling me this. Also, she is someone who enjoys a good gossip which i find rather strange.</p>
              <p>Can someone help me? I dont want to be fired bec of this sup.</p>

              <p>Life is happiness, and if one is developing territorial in work life, "happiness" becoming territorial and suffering arises. The importance of work in life is to develop one's mind and not be burden by work and cause suffering to others.
