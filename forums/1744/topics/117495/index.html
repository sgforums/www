            <div class='col-md body'>Hitler's successes as Nazi dictator have given way to a number of occult theories. One of the most common of these is the story of the Spear of Destiny. Also called the Holy Lance, this spear was believed to have been the weapon used to pierce the side of Jesus Christ at the Crucifixion.<br><br>The Spear subsequently passed through a multitude of hands, coming into the possession of many of EuropeÂ’s most important political and military leaders, including Constantine I, Alaric (the Visigoth king who sacked Rome in the year 410), Frankish general Charles Martel, Charlemagne, Frederick of Barbarossa, and Frederick II.<br><br>A leader who possessed the Spear was said to be invincible; Charlemagne and Frederick of Barbarossa were undefeated in battle until they let the Spear fall from their hands. A legend arose that whoever claimed the Spear Â“holds the destiny of the world in his hands for good or evil.Â”<br><br><img src="http://www.crystalinks.com/spearofdestiny.jpg"><br><span class="small">The Spear of Destiny</span><br><br>As a young man Adolf Hitler was fascinated by the Spear of Destiny, which he first saw displayed in the Hofsburg museum in Vienna, Austria in 1909. Hitler was familiar with the legend of the Spear. His interest in the relic was further amplified by its role in the 1882 opera Parsifal Â— by HitlerÂ’s favorite composer, Richard Wagner Â— which concerned a group of ninth-century knights and their quest for the Holy Grail.<br><br>HitlerÂ’s fascination with the Spear was pivotal in sparking his interest in the occult, which gave birth to his ideas on the origins and purpose of the Germanic race and contributed to his belief in his own destiny as a world conqueror.<br><br>On October 12, 1938, not long after the German annexation of Austria, Hitler ordered the S.S. to seize the Spear and other artifacts from Vienna. They were taken by train to Nuremberg, where they were stored in St. KatherineÂ’s Church. The Spear remained in St. KatherineÂ’s until 1944, when it was moved to a specially constructed vault beneath the church, built in secret and at great expense, intended to protect it and the other stolen relics from Allied bombs.<br><br>Nuremberg was captured by Allied troops in April of the following year. The vault was subsequently discovered by American Army officers. The Spear was confiscated by American forces on the afternoon of April 30, 1945, less than two hours before HitlerÂ’s suicide in his underground bunker in Berlin. Like the SpearÂ’s previous owners, Hitler perished after the relic was taken from him.</div>
