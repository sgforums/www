              <p><br>nothing much. The manager herself has just been promoted 2 years so still unexpereinced but very snobbish already, nose in the air type.</p>
              <p>She treats her staff with rudeness and arrognace. When i went lunch with her, she walked  far ahead of me leaving me alone like a maid.</p>
              <p>The big reason i resign was cos in this company, even my manager had not much authority. Imagine, simple letters she also could not sign. She had no right to make decisions which should be done by people her level.</p>
              <p>Thus, if manager already no freedom, what above me an executive?</p>
              <p>Lastly, there was no freedom in work. Nobody could use their own company email example <a href="mailto:serene@abc.com.sg">serene@abc.com.sg</a>, but could only use the department email. So when an email come in, whoever see it 1st must work on it. Where is the sense of responsibility? There will be also of blame pushing;''no i did not see the email. no he should be the one etc''</p>
              <p>All working adults yet treat each one like kindergarden, micromanage!</p>

              <p>They have the right to pursue further, but I doubt they will do
              so. if you receive a letter from them demanding payment if not
              legal action will be taken. just ignore and dun send a cheque/bank
              draft to them. its a hassle to employ a legal firm and also its not
              cheap, mind you. your 1 month of salary may not be enough to
              pay off the legal firm.</p>

              <p><br> nothing much. The manager herself has just been promoted 2 years so

              <p>She treats her staff with rudeness and arrognace. When i went

              <p>The big reason i resign was cos in this company, even my manager
              had not much authority. Imagine, simple letters she also could not
              sign. She had no right to make decisions which should be done by
              people her level.</p>
              <p>Thus, if manager already no freedom, what above me an
              executive?</p>
              <p>Lastly, there was no freedom in work. Nobody could use their own
              company email example <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:serene@abc.com.sg">serene@abc.com.sg</a>, but could only use the department
              email. So when an email come in, whoever see it 1st must work on
              it. Where is the sense of responsibility? There will be also of
              blame pushing;''no i did not see the email. no he should be the one

              <p>All working adults yet treat each one like kindergarden,

              <p>Whoa...that really sux. Imagine you had to send an important letter during lunch and couldn't get the signature because the big shots aren't around.</p>
              <p>I assume it's a full time job? But I think it's better if you go back and have a talk with their HR dept to settle this no matter how you dread to go back.</p>
              <p>But you know just because they are working adults doesn't mean they're mature people, have you encounter your colleague asking you to pass cheques to the boss office for signature because they dread going up? Not that I'm complaining as I can take a short break from my data entry job.</p>

              <p><br>yap. In my previous job, even important letters we executive could prepare and sign off and done! and we could make some major decisions ourselves.</p>
