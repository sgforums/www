            <div class='col-md body'>Never had an internship, but I did some photography contracts before going to Uni.<br><br>One notable job was being a stills photographer.<br><br>Loved the workplace, as it was a movie set. My team was in charge of shooting movie stills for pre-publicity/casting/post-production advertorial use.<br><br>Very hard work and graveyard timings (one time,  we started filming at 1830hrs and ended at 1430hrs the next day, for an entire week) , but it was very gratifying when you see your name in the credits when the movie ends. The pay was decent, although no amount of money can replace that at all. It helped me improve my workflow and editing skills too.<br><br>For another job, there wasn't much to do but to shoot models on a runway and being given the free run of the bar.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My first internship was at an organisational psychology consultancy, working one day a week for six months with no pay.<br><br>It was entirely voluntary and open to all Psych Honours students.  Of 60 applicants, ten got in and six went all the way to the end.  The other four quit because they thought making coffee for clients was sai kang.<br><br>Personally, I didn't mind at all.  Nobody else was offering anything in the organisational psychology field, and I got a lot of experience.  The real bonus came after all was said and done.  When I applied for the doctorate, I was the only candidate who was accepted without the need for an interview with the academic board.  The convenor said that previous interns from that program had gotten into the course and done well, so my internship experience was enough to cut through all the red-tape BS.  Considering 1200 Honours students applied for the course, that six months of free labour was well worth it.</div>
