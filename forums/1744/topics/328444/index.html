              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I have been working with UOB for the last three months. They didn't confirm my probation saying that my family commitments are too high to meet their requirement.!! I used to work very late most of the day and on weekends too. Is it political not confirming the probation? In singapore the governement and employers are promoting the work life balance. Here we are working so hard, still not confirming the probation based on the fact that I have child. Does any one had similar experience?</p>

But it is worse. My performance was ok. they didnt complain about that. I asked for leave when my kid was sick and they are not happy about that. I know it is only two of my seniors behind this decision not confirming my probation.

              <p>try calling up dbs to see if the opening is still there.. if not, there are always plenty job opportunities around.</p>
              <p>as for notice period, etc, that shld be clearly stated in ur contract, even if u r under probation.</p>

              in my opinion, UOB is the second worst bank for welfare (after - ahem...D-bank....).
              
              When I was an intern at the bank, my colleagues were telling me, look at the banks located in the proximity, ABN, Standchart, etc, their workers knock off at 5+ from wednesdays onwards, they knock off at 6+ on Mondays and Tuesdays only.  
              
              For UOB, they start work at 8+ and knock off at 6+ everyday.  I also heard, the pay is also one of the lowest.  So, don't work in local banks, got chance f**k off to a foreign bank.

              <p>  Well actually my company isn't as good as what pple think too . I work for a well known transport company and despite me always trying to clear as many fault as possible sometime even working ot for hours without even claiming it , they still spread rumour say i never do anything at all and that i don't know how to clear any fault at all . Now they trransfer me to another section which my manager condem them and my colleague always trying to taunt me n insult me cause they are the pioneer batch and not only my supervisor pamper them but even my manager also trust them fully . Favourism is very rampant in my company n there was ever once where 6 employees some of them pioneer batch too resign at one shot to the other famous transport company whom is offering at least $300 increment to those with relevent experience from our company . Reason is because some of the newer batch got promoted very much fasater then them and has lesser qualifications and one of them has a wife as a executive in another dept .</p>
              <p>   And as for my side , once one of the pioneer batch pple ask his new tech to fetch him from somewhere near bugis in the peak hour of the morning n the tech recieved a summon cos the company cashcard don't have enough money inside . When he bring it up to the supervisor , not only the supervisor din discipline the pioneer batch technical officer but instead offer to pay for the fine on his behalf . Being very disgusted at the rampant favourism , he resigned . When i was telling one of the senior tech abt this , he even dare to reply that the technical officer did nothing wrong n that new pple are supposed to do that and it was his own fault for failing to check for enough money inside the cashcard .</p>
