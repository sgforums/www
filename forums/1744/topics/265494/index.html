Anyway, if the company decided to "dump you off ", with or without anyone understudying you, they will do it.  Afterall, " money will make the world go round ", they can always pay higher to get someone to do the job ..  I got this experiences..  my supervisor is one who keep everything to himself, he rather work very late than asking us for help.  Seriously no one know his work.  He was very safe but remain in that position for many years.  Then one day, he was asked to leave with 24 hours.  None of us can take over his work.  No one really know..  The company paid a very experience manager to take over and within 3 months, a new job procedure was created.  Then one of us was promoted to take over his place.  See, no one is indepensable.<br><br>For me, if I teach and produce a good disciple, I will be praised if he done well.  If he screw it up, they will ask, " how you teach one ". so what you want to hear depend on how you much you want to teach your understudy ..   my two cents worth ..</div>
