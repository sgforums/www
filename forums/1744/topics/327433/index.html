              <p>during my job attachment in a big company in CBD area, got one chio colleague always change into skimpy sports tank top n short n revealing shorts n chiong out of the office during lunch time coz she go gym. she's in my department although i dun really interact with her since in the company is like everybody do their own stuffs.</p>
              <p>since she goes like 3 times a week. i purposely get ready to go for lunch when clock strikes 12:30. then when i see her i will walk out with her to the lift lobby... by the way, i always go tah pow lunch alone...come back office eat alone, coz not really close to the other female colleagues n some of them eat quite expensive meals during lunch, n they carpool together n go elsewhere eat.</p>
              <p>then i secretly admire her body while waiting for the lift n also when squeeze into the lift. Coz when she is formal wear cannot see so much skin. Lift very squeezy coz lunch time everyone going for lunch. She got quite a bit of cleavage too.</p>
              <p>i talked to her quite a bit but the moment the lift reaches ground floor she will run off to the gym, coz to save time since lunch hour is like 1 hour plus only.</p>
              <p>Then when she come back she will eat her own sandwich or something which she make in the pantry since she is those health conscious type.</p>
              <p>While talking to her, she also got asked me wanna join gym so can go together with her, but i didnt want to, coz i not the health conscious type n i also lazy, i prefer to spend my lunch time sleeping or surf net.</p>
              <p>haiz, i regretted, should maybe join gym so can get to know her better.... n i think she;s single also...quite pretty, although 3 or 4 years older than me.</p>
