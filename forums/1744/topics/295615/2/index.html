            <div class='col-md body'>hey...after reading all these, i realised that it's not only me who experience such problems in my previous company, huh...<br>things like, suddenly taking away bonus...bad management and stuffs.<br><br>but it makes me think too, are we the ones who are expecting too much and complaining too much?<br><br>i don't know...i always try to look at the employer's point of view too, and i endured some management problems and always did my best.<br><br>i felt i was taken for granted too...like, my efforts are never recognised, and i'm always maligned for things by one group of colleagues...<br><br>i was on very good terms with my manager. we have lunch or dinner together sometimes, and i asked her for some advice in dealing with some work problems since i'm new to the working society. and she always tell me that i'm doing very well and the boss admires my work, although i have always felt that the boss didn't really like me. but this kept me motivated and distracted from my 'bad' colleagues for awhile.<br><br>but one day, i kana sabo-ed by my colleague again, and the boss yelled at me across the room, and everyone could hear it. everyone looked at me. and my this particular colleague was like hiding his smile like that. damn sian to see his face. this happened while a new staff whom i taught a few days ago was around too. i tried to explain to the boss. the boss asked me to go home. i just suddenly lost all the motivation i had.<br><br>when i was packing my things, i was thinking, "when the company was very busy, i always worked long hours without OT pay, worked public holidays without any extra pay or off days, work on average 11.5 hours, 6 days a week...and this is what i get? and why the colleague want to do this to me? when he was new, i also intro-ed him to everyone, talked to him all these to make him feel comfortable..." don't know la. just felt that my nicety was quite stupid. kana taken advantage and bullied lor. haiz.<br><br>when i was about to leave, my boss shouted at me to come back. (maybe he suddenly realise that there wasn't enough ppl to work that day if i left...i'm always doing work of many ppl...haiz. multi tasker.) like what the hell. i was already holding back my tears. so i just left, and went to the washroom and cried.<br><br>next day, my friend intro me another job. so i never returned to that company. i sent in my resignation letter.<br><br>but sometimes, i still wonder if i was too...weak? i always wonder if it were other more experienced ppl...would they think i was useless? little bit also cannot endure like that...what do you think? please advise me, senpai!!! by the way, i have worked there for about 9months only..&gt;"&lt; lousy ba.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you must be very careful when terming poor management.<br><br>as singapore is very small and in each industry people do know each other.<br><br>you should try to paint it into a picture of disagreement over issues rather than an outright finger pointing.<br><br>however, i have come across cases where some people are infamous and everyone knows about the reason for leaving without so much of mentioning. not sure your approach, but the best way to get a better job is to place yourself on the block and let headhunters assist placement. most headhunters are quite professional and can assist you in disclosure issues.<br><br>you must be very careful sometimes. i know of one stupid person who claimed leaving due to compliance issues. this can open up to investigation and a big whoo ha over fiduciary responsibility.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in addition, to be frank.. you can be very upfront that you are seeking better opportunities and you feel that your previous organization does not provide the goal you're seeking.<br><br>you can also state money as one of the main reasons. it is expected, so you don't have to fumble and mumble about money issues. singaporeans' are adopting more and more american styled attitudes and throwing away values like loyalty and the like, so its no big deal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I tend to get bullied by bosses. My current one told me that he didn't bother to read my resume when he hired me. Anyways, I know he was pressured to take me in cause his boss wanted someone with business experience.<br><br>So now I am just cleaning up after my current boss and not doing anything that the bosses promised me.  I am a super P.A. and I realised the rest of my department is also demoralised by the way the bosses run things and back each other up.  But at least the rest of the department are very very well paid. The new staff which is myself and another guy found out we are the lowest paid staff in the department with the most work.<br><br>Bad situation. There is a lot of mis-managment of people and waste is very rampant. Its quite bad and very sad to see people just want to be paid to do nothing and spend all the time watching investment markets. When the infrastructure was down and people didn't have network access for more than 5 hrs, the CIO sat in his office and read papers.<br><br>Anyways, I am already planning my way out even when I am still not confirmed and just 3 months with them.  I felt that if I cannot be paid well, at least give me learning opportunities and growth opportunities.  But as i got to know the staff. Increment, promotion, training and staff benefits are non-existant. people just hang around long enough and will be promoted based on the years of service. People hang around cause there's just so much free time to do their own thing.<br><br>All I ask for my job is a good boss and colleagues who are not back stabbers.  I know this will take a miracle.<br></div>
