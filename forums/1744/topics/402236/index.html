              <p>I have a new boss. </p>
              <p>I dunno whether he good or not, cuz so far, he has not proven that he has substance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He keeps going on MC.  One month at least 2 days consecutively.  The most recent one three days.  And he keep going on urgent leave -- sometimes claiming that his mother is sick.  Sometimes, say got family problem.  And other times, say he got financial problem. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both his MCs and ULs are like rubber -- highly extendable one..  Every morning, he will call in or sms say that he's still on MC or UL. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our works got jammed, cuz he doesn't assign covering officer to clear his things in his absence -- he wants to micromanage. </p>
              <p>He not in office, but "his spirit" will haunt us cuz he will call each and every person to ask this and that and tok this and that -- things that are non essential.  And then he will say "Tomorrow I sure come back to office one".  And then next day, never show up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He missed all the impt meetings.  Dunno whether deliberate or not.  End up, staff have to attend without him.  Those meetings that don't involve his staff, he also never bother to get his staff to represent him.  And for those meetings that his staff do attend in his absence, he will call to show extreme concern like asking: "What did the meeting start"  "Who was at the meeting?"  "Who presented?"  "Who said what?"  "Did the big boss say what?"  And when the staff update him things like "Oh following meeting, we have to get this and that update.."  Then he will ma hou pao and say "Ya, you all better do it..."</p>
              <p>Whenever I get things done right, he will also ma hou pao and say "Not say I ma hou pao, but I already told you that you should do this ..." Damn irritating leh!!</p>
              <p>And then recently, there is a very very impt meeting.  He mc again.  I who was also sick, and my staff was most ill (high fever and stuff) both attended the meeting.  After that, he called my staff, again asked very concern questions like "What time the meeting start?"  "How was the meeting?"  blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>And then sent me a seriously long sms to lecture me for doing something that I should not do at the meeting ie. I got my colleague to attend the meeting when it's not his area.  (actually it was my staff who got the colleague to stand by, in case I really unwell and couldn't make it for the meeting)  I was like... double U tee ef!  Who is he to lecture me when he bong dang an impt meeting and somemore it's the dunno how many times liao.  I replied to him without even saying hi or greeting.  Just one line answer saying "we got him there cuz I am having a fever now". </p>
              <p>Then he said sorry and then followed by a long long long long long sms telling me if I cannot go to work the next day, can just tell him.  Tell he for what?  The next day, he bong dang again! </p>
              <p>I tok to the big boss with my concern cuz a lot of things were super jammed due to this guy's poor attendance.  The worse thing is: my big boss will chase for things "I asked for this and that, how come you all never give me".  And we all have a common answer:"we are waiting for &lt;my boss&gt; to clear/approve".</p>
              <p>I dunno how else I can tok to my big boss about it anymore.  I tok to him, but at the same time, I cannot like stabbing my own superior, right? </p>

              <p><br>But dunno when. </p>
              <p>I damn worried my big boss only wants to wait till probation ends before telling him to go, which means another two to three months to go.  This guy ah, every single day gets on everyone's nerve and he doesn't seem to feel it.  He even tell my staff that all the managers don't respect him so he can only friend my staff. </p>
              <p>He called one of my staff when she was having dinner.  He asked her whether she was busy.  She said she was having dinner.  He machiam like dismissed this answer and then went on tokking and tokking for very long with her. </p>
              <p>The other night, my staff was having high fever.  He called him around 10 pm to tok about what.  I was so furious on the next day when I found out from another manager.  Muz tok about what at such hour?  What stupid school he came from ah?</p>

              <p>What I may suggest:</p>
              <p>Get a few of the other staff together who feel as you do, and all of you approach the big boss together. Take joint responsibility so that no one person will be unfairly punished should anything go wrong.</p>
              <p>If you have to stab your boss to get your own work done, so be it. If you have to work for your wages, then it's only fair that he also works for his. </p>
              <p>If this means that his rice bowl will be broken, then good riddance to him. You are not breaking his rice bowl; he broke it himself with his lack of responsibility.</p>

              <p>Your boss is present at least 80% of the time. His boss might thinks he is a very good manager, work get done without his presence. He must be a good "manager" as he manage  his staff well.</p>
              <p>He is smart, he make cals because he needs information. Imformation is king in the corporate world. With information he can give the impression that he is "on top of things". He survives by using the mouth only to impress his boss. He reports as his own whatever he gleans from you and your colleagues to the boss. He will tell his boss whats going on, and that he has instructed this and that to be done. His boss is impressed.</p>
              <p>Stop giving him information.</p>

              <p>seems like most management love to take offs and not at werkplace all the time in most of spore company i was in.u cant just not pick up the line...thats bad for business and bigger boss will yell when he says why he cant get thru to section.</p>
              <p>best u go give info to bigger boss himself like the band of brothers episode 4 or 5 thing.the company also had a leader called Lta Dike who wasnt around and loved to go for meetings at hq with the generals...meanwhile everyday he is seldom at his position and only there to collect info.so the men went to boss or maybe it was one good man went to boss and told him the company updates....boss will question u but just say he isnt around or what band of brothers sgt told the big boss....maybe u could watch band of bros thing i think its  under title before besiege of Bastoge after Carentan.</p>

              <p>Your boss is present at least 80% of the time. His
              boss might thinks he is a very good manager, work get done
              without his presence. He must be a good "manager" as he
              manage  his staff well.</p>
              <p>He is smart, he make cals because he needs information.
              Imformation is king in the corporate world. With information he can
              give the impression that he is "on top of things". He survives by
              using the mouth only to impress his boss. He reports as his
              own whatever he gleans from you and your colleagues to the
              boss. He will tell his boss whats going on, and that he has
              instructed this and that to be done. His boss is impressed.</p>
              <p>Stop giving him information.</p>

              <p>I have a new boss. </p>
              <p>I dunno whether he good or not, cuz so far, he has not proven
                  that he has substance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He keeps going on MC.  One month at least 2 days
                  consecutively.  The most recent one three days.  And he
                  keep going on urgent leave -- sometimes claiming that his mother is
                  sick.  Sometimes, say got family problem.  And other
                  times, say he got financial problem. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both his MCs and ULs are like rubber -- highly extendable
                  one..  Every morning, he will call in or sms say that he's
                  still on MC or UL. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our works got jammed, cuz he doesn't assign covering officer to
                  clear his things in his absence -- he wants to
                  micromanage. </p>
              <p>He not in office, but "his spirit" will haunt us cuz he will
                  call each and every person to ask this and that and tok this and
                  that -- things that are non essential.  And then he will say
                  "Tomorrow I sure come back to office one".  And then next day,
                  never show up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He missed all the impt meetings.  Dunno whether deliberate
                  or not.  End up, staff have to attend without him.  Those
                  meetings that don't involve his staff, he also never bother to get
                  his staff to represent him.  And for those meetings that his
                  staff do attend in his absence, he will call to show extreme
                  concern like asking: "What did the meeting start"  "Who was at
                  the meeting?"  "Who presented?"  "Who said what?" 
                  "Did the big boss say what?"  And when the staff update him
                  things like "Oh following meeting, we have to get this and that
                  update.."  Then he will ma hou pao and say "Ya, you all better
                  do it..."</p>
              <p>Whenever I get things done right, he will also ma hou pao and
                  say "Not say I ma hou pao, but I already told you that you should
                  do this ..." Damn irritating leh!!</p>
              <p>And then recently, there is a very very impt meeting.  He
                  mc again.  I who was also sick, and my staff was most ill
                  (high fever and stuff) both attended the meeting.  After that,
                  he called my staff, again asked very concern questions like "What
                  time the meeting start?"  "How was the meeting?"  blah
                  blah blah.</p>
              <p>And then sent me a seriously long sms to lecture me for doing
                  something that I should not do at the meeting ie. I got my
                  colleague to attend the meeting when it's not his area. 
                  (actually it was my staff who got the colleague to stand by, in
                  case I really unwell and couldn't make it for the meeting)  I
                  was like... double U tee ef!  Who is he to lecture me when he
                  bong dang an impt meeting and somemore it's the dunno how many
                  times liao.  I replied to him without even saying hi or
                  greeting.  Just one line answer saying "we got him there cuz I
                  am having a fever now". </p>
              <p>Then he said sorry and then followed by a long long long long
                  long sms telling me if I cannot go to work the next day, can just
                  tell him.  Tell he for what?  The next day, he bong dang
                  again! </p>
              <p>I tok to the big boss with my concern cuz a lot of things were
                  super jammed due to this guy's poor attendance.  The worse
                  thing is: my big boss will chase for things "I asked for this and
                  that, how come you all never give me".  And we all have a
                  common answer:"we are waiting for &lt;my boss&gt; to
                  clear/approve".</p>
              <p>I dunno how else I can tok to my big boss about it
                  anymore.  I tok to him, but at the same time, I cannot like
                  stabbing my own superior, right? </p>
