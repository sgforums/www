            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Any specialised advice is highly appreciated.<br><br>A contract to build a website (around $6K) which I signed with a software development small company has expired. The company now claims they have completed the website, justifying whatever that are missing as 2% undone that requires 'fine-tuning'. The website is far from satisfactory and not as per the guidelines provided before the contract was signed.<br><br>As such, they refused to refund my money. I am looking into seeking compensation for the months of delays as well.<br><br>Initial deposit was $3K.<br><br>Where should I seek legal action? Small Claim Tribunal or a full fledged lawsuit?<br><br>If there are lawyers specialised in the IT field, kindly please PM me or reply here. Will greatly appreciate your generous help here.<br><br>Thanks a lot!</div>

That's why I regretted going for budgeted service like that.<br><br>Some small companies seeking quick buck overpromise and when they cannot deliver, they resort to undercutting clients or blatantly disregard the contract by justifying their stand through various means.<br><br>I can 100% confidently say and prove that they have not done the website to the specified requirement. It was a very detailed, bulleted, 5 page guideline for them to follow.<br><br>And the reasons for the delays were coding bugs, connection problem to my server, and many more. Despite them having to host in on their own server, they still could not present a satisfactory website. Even in the latest checklist i sent them, they even stated they missed some modules out. The rest are due for 'fine-tuning' when they are not even complete.<br><br>Now, they do not want to refund, much less compensate. They won't return my calls and only use emails. How professional is that?<br><br></div>

My guess is that they will just say that you changed your mind about this and that (quite natural for clients to do that because they do not know what they want, most, if not all the time and most, if not all the clients)<br><br>Or they might say that you asked them to do extra work (you think that it was part of the original agreement when it wasn't).<br><br>If the judge believe them then you LL. Since, how can the judge believe you when you have no idea what you are talking about? You need expert witnesses to testify for you and where are you going to find the expert witnesses?<br><br>The small claims court is your only hope and there is no guarantee that you will win.<br><br>Remember also that small claims do not have the ability to enforce decisions and that means you will have to sue them again in sub court if they refuse to accept the small claims judgment.<br><br>This works to your advantage as well since if they win, you ignore the court's decision, they have to take you to higher court.<br><br>So the small claims court strategy is not to win but to waste their time only.<br><br>In Singapore, you get away with murder when it comes to civil cases.

If they go back on their promise after the case has been closed by the Tribunal, you can take immediate legal enforcement and haul their asses up to Court. Compensation is almost guranteed if they continue their ways after being forewarned by the Tribunal.<br><br>Litigation:<br>It doesnt matter if you reserve your legal rights then or not, if you go to court, your lawyer can dig out all your rights. Sad to say, you still have to pay them for whatever was stipulated in the contract. But u can then sue them for breach in contract on their part for failing to deliver. Then u can claim compensation and terminate the contract. Take the money and find another party to fix it for u. Or else, u can choose to continue the contract as according to the original clauses. But to the discretion of the Court, you may need to pay them extra, or may not need to pay at all. Depends on how the accused party fight with his lawyer also. Please get a good lawyer, ur case may fail according to procedural law. Hope that your case would succeed.<br><br>But my personal advice is, threaten legal action but stick to mediation. Nothing good will come out of litigation. They will be too pissed to do a good job for you if u continue the contract. Even if you And you wont get much out of compensation unless your lawyer does a very good job in persuading the court.<br><br>Hope this helps (:</div>
