Open - Shut case.<br><br>If mediation doesn't work try the small claims tribunal and last resort to litigation.<br><br>If the contract terms are well drafted, eg, need to have this by when, need to have this , then should be a fairly easy case.

They won't handle B2B issues.<br><br>I just spoken to the litigation lawyer today. It's great when you meet really helpful people out there. It is heart warming, especially when you really need help and are in the rut.<br><br>SCT, for my case, can only seek refund. Which is only like $3K. I still lose out if I go ahead. So best is for me to negotiate again and try to salvage. Talk nicely, be humble. People usually show the stucked up side when they are FORCED to face with losses.<br><br>Indeed, for small companies with contracts involving $5k, $10K, a lawsuit really is not worth pursuing... At the end of the day, the inexperienced lose out. I guess that's life. And it is usually through such failures we learn big lessons about dealing with people and doing biz.<br><br>So for anyone out there who want to start up a business and is subscribing to a business service, please ensure you know exactly what you are asking for. If you go in blind to certain aspects, be prepared to lose and don't complain being cheated.<br><br>Moving on~<br><br>Thanks guy, for all the tips and advice rendered so far.<br><br>Cheers!</div>
