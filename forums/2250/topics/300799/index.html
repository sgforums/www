            <div class='col-md body'>Which format would you depend on for backing up crucial data on your com? DVD-+R, or DVD-RAM? And if it's the former, would you go with the original minus or the rumoured-to-be-better plus format?<br><br>Here's some of the articles I have looked at beforehand:<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd-ram#Advantages_of_DVD-RAM" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd-ram#Advantages_of_DVD-RAM</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-R" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-R</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD%2BR" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD%2BR</a><br><br>I have been using DVD+Rs for my backups as the impression I have was that write-once media are more reliable for data backups than re-writables. I have dismissed -RWs for certain, and -RAMs as I thought they were just for camcorders until a while ago when I read up the Wiki about it. It seems that DVD-RAM discs contains many features geared towards integrity and security of the data it holds. And, the wiki articles show one which has an optional cartridge. But how the hell does it fit into a computer optical drive?<br></div>

What I'm focusing on is data security. As in I don't want my data to be unreadable after 5-10 years from now because of, for example, the dye on the discs has started to decompose and form green goo etc.<br><br>While on the topic, I would like to know how you guys rank Sony, Verbatim and TDK in terms of media quality.

But your optical drive may not be the cause of the issue you are facing. How about burning other data, or working with CDs? If you have a DVD-RW (so that in case the burn fails, you can erase and re-use them) that is not of TDK, you can try them as well. Try changing the disc burning software used and other solutions so as to isolate the cause of the problem.<br></div>

LG not that bad la (self-consolation). Get a DVD-RW from other brands to test first. If still cannot, just tell the retailer what you have done to confirm that the drive is faulty then change to another drive of the same or other models de lo. If the 7-day 1:1 exchange period is over, then you'll have to use the warranty, I guess.<br></div>
