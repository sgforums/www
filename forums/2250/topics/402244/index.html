              <p>Get one in school, most likely u got convience that your friends are using more or less the same laptop, such that if anything mishaps happens, you can ask your friends. (Some got their wireless failed to work, so use Mobile Broadband in school). It is obviously usually cheaper as well compared to shops / electric shops.</p>
              <p>BTW, if you are not so demanding, why you are not considering to use your poly old-days laptop (Sorry if you had went to JC instead) ? It should works as well (Maybe just need a reformat / upgrade XP to Vista then Windows 7 with the download of Vista disc and install without activate / entering serial since Microsoft will be giving a grace peroid of 30 days)</p>
              <p>Get one outside, especially IT Show etc, I wont gurantee it will be significantly cheaper, but you got more choice (If you want to compare on to more aspects, such as the look &amp; feel, weight etc). Get a netbook if you want the cheapest in the town with no more than $1200 (Laptop might just start from $1200), but do bear in mind that it has a small screen of no bigger than 10 inch, and limited RAM with no more than 1 or 2GB (Partially is Microsoft politics). That aside, it means a netbook is very limited in performance but ultra - portable (Lighter is obviously) with generally longer battery life? (Maybe not due to smaller in battery size? --- This one I am not sure as well)</p>

              <p>Fujitsu is decent enough, though they don't necessarily perform the best for the price.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take a look at the brands, and the specifications of the laptop. For accounting, you need a fast processor, so a Core i5 or Core i7 processor would be good.</p>
              <p>For uni, they usually got more choices than poly fairs. Fujitsu, Dell, HP, Acer, Apple, NEC were the ones I saw at NUS IT COOP. Out of those, I'd rank</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I would not recommend Apple for accounting, because they do not perform as well as their similarly-priced Windows competitiors, and Fujitsu and NEC have quite high reliability. HP and Dell warranty is excellent, though not so good quality. Acer is if you enjoy fixing your own stuff.</p>

              <p>I would not recommend Apple for accounting, because they do not
              perform as well as their similarly-priced Windows competitiors, and
              Fujitsu and NEC have quite high reliability. HP and Dell warranty
              is excellent, though not so good quality. Acer is if you enjoy
              fixing your own stuff.</p>

              <p>Get from your School's IT fair. Normally prices there are cheaper with above norm specifications. </p>
              <p>For eg: </p>
              <p>Laptop A - Selling at Courts.. $1500.  i3, 2gb ram,  intel graphics</p>
              <p>Laptop A - Selling via School.. $1400- $1500, i5/i7, 4gb ram, nvdia graphics</p>
              <p>Specifications are generally higher and more bang for buck if you buy from school.</p>
              <p>They generally come with 3 years warranty instead of the standard 1 year if you buy from local retailers. </p>
              <p>Anyways, to add on what Raraken had said.  Fujitsu's reliability and quality is seldom questioned, you can definitely get a better specification laptop at the same price from other manufacturers such as Acer - imo, Acer gives the best specifications out of all the manufacturers. </p>
              <p>To be fair, I have 2 issues with my Fujitsu so far. I have 2 motherboards replaced due to a design flaw in my model - S6420, where the graphics cards get burnt rendering the Laptop useless. </p>
              <p>Thus, I would advise you to stay away from any S3 Chrome series Graphics cards. Generally they consume less energy than their counter parts, but their reliability is questionable .</p>
              <p>Graphics cards with Nvdia and Ati graphics shouldn't be much of an issue and I think it's a problem with the company supplying the cards rather than the Manufacturer itself. </p>
