              <p>What i want to know is that how can i secure it? like what are the setps to securing the wireless network ?? sorry IT noob here...</p>
              <p>Another thing is i would like to set up a new printer, a epson cx900F to replace my old canon i560.</p>
              <p>however the epson uses an usb port which my old router a pci BAL-04FPU  doesnt support..</p>
              <p>hehe sorry this is my home setup btw: a Aztech 
                                                                            ADSL Ethernet Bridge/Router

              <p>You can log in to the router. If your relative didn't change the settings, you can refer to the router's manual to log in and adjust the settings.</p>
              <p>Click once on the wireless network icon near the clock (two monitors for XP SP1 and below, one monitor for XP SP2 and above)</p>
              <p>Click on the <strong>Support</strong> tab. You will see a field named <strong>Default Gateway</strong>. Type in that IP address into your web browser. Enter in the username and password as provided by the manual.</p>
              <p>Navigate around. You'll find a section called <strong>Security</strong> or <strong>Encryption</strong> (or something else similarly named), which allows you to choose WEP, WPA or WPA2.</p>
              <p>This is where you apply the security for your wireless network. Once done, the router will either auto restart itself or ask you to restart it manually. Restart the router. In the meantime, don't do anything to the router or you'll risk corrupting the whole thing.</p>
              <p>You can set up your printer as a network printer, so that it can connect wirelessly to your network.</p>

              <p>OK...basically all the different forms of WPAs and the WEP are encryption algorithm for ur wireless...WEP is simple,functional but outdated....U can try the WPA2 or WPA-PSK...I wouldnt go into the technical details but either one of these is good enough for ur use...</p>
              <p>Open system allows ad-hoc login...more convenient to add systems into the wireless network...</p>
              <p>the choice of key type is just the length of the wireless password that U will need ur users to type in if they want to login to use ur router.Hex is longer in length...so should be better...but seriously...no difference lar...</p>
              <p>Important thing is to know which password to type in...to use the wireless...the password should look very random to a normal human being...</p>

              <p>hi sorry to bring this old topic back. but i think i screwed up the wireless router....</p>
              <p>after the last successful change in adding the password i tried to access it again through the ip address to change some settings cos my dad's old lappy couldn access it wirelessly.</p>
              <p>however before i can do anything i couldn get in through the ip cos dunno why the username and password doesnt work. so i resorted to resetting the device to factory default but now i still couldn get access through the factory default ip inoder to reset the whole wireless...... any help????</p>
              <p>do i have to access it through a desktop with a fixed ethernet connection or can i do it on my lappy through wireless??</p>

              <p>best thing now is to use a fixed ethernet connection on ur desktop to reconfigure the settings of ur router. i'm using a WPA2-Personal and i think it really isn't bad as most people use the most basic WEP encryption. use ur desktop and track the IP of ur router. log into ur router and set the type of encryption and the password.</p>
              <p>also, help ur father to configure his laptop. first, check for the wireless network after logging into windows. next, find ur network, select it and try to connect to it. key in the password after Windows prompted for you to do so. after successfully connecting to the network, select 'save this network' and 'start this network automatically' so as to ease your father's burden of entering the password everytime he needs the internet.</p>
              <p>hope i will be able to help u!</p>

              <p>connect to the desktop via ethernet. search for the IP of the router at the status of the internet connection at 'Control Panel &gt; Network Connections'. then go to the details (if there is) and find default gateway. that is the IP of the router. then go and log in to the router. if possible change the IP of the router to 192.168.1.1 for easier remembering.</p>
