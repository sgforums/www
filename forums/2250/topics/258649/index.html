Explain more pls</blockquote>Ports are basically communication channels. Think along the way of USB ports, PS/2 ports, parallel ports, serial ports, etc. All these ports that you see on a PC, are physical ports; they allow communication between the computer and the different devices.<br><br>For the Internet, they are also used for communication. The numbers will determine what kind of program you are using. For example, port 23 for Telnet, port 25 for FTP, port 80 for browsers (IE, Firefox, etc).<br><br>If you use a firewall, it will prompt you what kind of program is trying to access the Net, together with the port number.<br><br>For example Sygate firewall. When you attempt to connect to www.google.com, it will prompt you that iexplore.exe (Internet Explorer) is trying to access the Net using port 80.<br><br><blockquote>what is worm</blockquote>A worm is a virus, but is spread via networks. Blaster is one famous one.<br><br><blockquote>Yes , there alway microsoft updates and etc thing , how do i know they are not something that trying to wreck my comp ?</blockquote>If anyone attempts to tell you that there are new updates for Windows, Office, for your antivirus, for your browser or tries some other tricks (for example, nice screensaver program), don't believe it. All these programs are seemingly harmless, but in fact, have an evil intention.<br><br>Just like the Greek mythology.<br><br>The moment the file is downloaded, your PC could be infected.<br><br><blockquote>I do download stuff from the net , how do i know what im downloading is actually virus or backdoor , trojan etc</blockquote>Download from trusted sources. Open-sourced programs such as those from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Sourceforge</a>, programs from <a href="http://www.pricelessware.org/thelist/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Pricelessware</a> have been tried and tested to be spyware free. If unsure, do a Google search for user reviews and read their reviews. If the review is good, most likely it can be trusted. If you find mixed reviews, just post in the forum. Somebody will evaluate the product.<br><br>If it's a file, upload it to <a href="http://www.virustotal.com/" rel="nofollow">Virus Total</a> or <a href="http://virusscan.jotti.org/" rel="nofollow">Jotti</a> for a scan. If the results are clean, chances of it being a clean file is high. However, these results are no guarantee that the file is clean because malware mutates fast and antivirus companies jsut can't catch up to produce signatures to tell if a file is malicious.</div>
