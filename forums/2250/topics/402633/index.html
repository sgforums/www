              <p>Hi.... I reformatted my PC recently because I realised there are viruses and spywares on it.</p>
              <p>Got a few questions to ask about reformatting of PC.</p>
              <p>1) After I have reformatted my PC, does it mean that I have completely removed the viruses, spywares and malwares from it, since the PC has been restored to it's original condition?</p>
              <p>2) I reformatted my PC by using the Acronis True Image 10.0 software. Is there a limit to the number of times I can reformat my PC? I remember that on my previous PC, I had to use a recovery disk whenever I need to reformat the PC. Somebody told me that I can only use it for a certain number of times. Is this factually correct?</p>
              <p>3) Can somebody kindly enlighten me on the difference between system restore and reformatting of PC? When my PC got infected with viruses and spyware, I tried to use system restore before reformatting it. After I have used the system restore to restore my PC to an earlier time, it 'appears' that the viruses and spywares are no longer there. If system restore is so 'powerful', why do we need all the anti-virus softwares? Does system restore really helps to 'remove' the viruses and spywares?</p>
              <p>Thanks for taking time to read through and the help rendered!!</p>

              <p>1. You have to format your hard drive when they prompt you to select which drive do you want to install the OS on.</p>
              <p>2. Im not sure, i reformat my computer by inserting the OS's DVD into the Optical Drive and booted the disc from the BIOS.</p>
              <p>3. System restore is used to restore the original factory settings of your computer if you have screwed the settings on your computer up. (Not very sure though) Maybe that the virus is no longer detected by the OS, but it is actually still there. (Based on my experience, may not be true).</p>

              <p>Formatting is wiping out of all data. Deleted items are actually not 100% removed from the hard drive, formatting should be able to remove all of it.</p>

              <p>System Restore is roll-back or undo "settings only".

              <p>You could try formatting the hard drive first before doing a recovery.</p>

              <p>I thought the virus/spyware would be completely removed after I have reformatted my PC. I think my PC was infected with some virus/spywares or malwares. Over the past 2 months I got some random Chinese websites popping up all of a sudden.</p>
              <p>Two days ago while I was using my PC, think the virus/spyware struck again. It tried to redirect my home page from google to some other websites. The attempt was blocked. Subsequently there were lots of weird icons in chinese words popping up on my desktop. Eventually, the computer crashed. </p>
              <p>When I started my PC I couldnt even load window. I had no choice but to press F11 during the intial start-up and made use of acronics true image to reformat my PC. So far, everything is okay. The comp is just like how I have just bought it. No popping up of the stupid websites or what..</p>
              <p>Hope it stays this way <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>1) Reformat the PC means to delete everything on the harddisk. Everything will be gone, including the virus.</p>
              <p>2) Firstly, acronis is more of an image ghosting program like norton ghost. Technically, you can call it reformat, but literally, reformat means to put in the original windows disc, and reinstall it from there.</p>
              <p>The recovery disc on ur old PC works similar to acronis home. It deletes all the current files, then puts back the files ur pc originally have when u just bought it</p>
              <p>There is no maximum amount of times u can reformat/reclone ur hdd as far as i know, unless ur harddisk is spoilt.</p>
              <p>3) System restore will help if, for example, some programs that are installed screws up and cause the system not to boot, you can use system restore to 'turn back time' to the time where ur system is working.  However, you notice system restore does not delete ur documents, thus if some viruses is embedded in those files, system restore will not help in deleting the virus. Thus, anti virus is used to clean those files that are infected/embedded with virus</p>

              <p>1) Yes. You will be back to your original image, ie, the time when you first get your PC. All files you had and issues (OS issues) will be wiped out. If it's a hardware issue, reformatting would not help. </p>
              <p>2) To put it in a sense, True Image is like a reformatting software. Though it's a software that you can choose the time to go back to. Like the image you saved 3 months ago, rather than restoring back to the time where you first get your PC. </p>
              <p>3) System restore is to restore your PC to an earlier time.  Yep. Correct. However a flaw with system restore is that it does not delete any folders/ files you have created.  Viruses in general work around this thus they generally don't get removed. </p>
