              Hi,
                 I am going to build a DIY computer for a friend. Can advise the best setup based on the budget $5k? If price exceed somewhat it's ok. Will be using it for work and gaming mainly, so need good graphics. HDD i think will be going for 2TB. Thought of using water cooling because it's silent and more effective at removing heat? Please advise.

              Thanks SBS7484P, good advice. But I notice alot of gamers like to use AMD processor? Not sure why, because my impression is Intel processor is better? I admit I may be wrong because Intel is good at marketing...
              
              Thought of getting Alienware but for someone who knows how to DIY, then spects on spects, price on price, can get so much better spects with DIY than Alienware per dollar. Maybe the only disadvantage is that DIY don't look as stylish as Alienware, but using it as a desktop leh, not showing off, so nobody will see it. Unless want to bring the CPU walk around as model in Sim Lim or Funan. That's why lah, I think people with IT knowledge rocks... 
              
              I going to Sim Lim maybe this week to get the parts and build one up... Can't wait to test it on some games...

              <p>AMD is cheaper, and best bang-for-the-buck. Who else can give you 6-core CPUs for $300? I know Intel can't. You can get a 6-core 1055T at SLS right now. 2.8GHZ+Turbo Core. I'm probably getting one soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, if you go AMD, you can slap on a 6-core AMD+5970 rather than i7 + 5870. They cost about the same, but the AMD CPU will give you more gaming performance because of the stronger video card.</p>

              <p>Dollar for dollar, this rig will pwn the Alienware one.</p>
              <p>The Alienware is just flashy, lights, etc and has a great casing - it's pretty solid. But in terms of cooling, it leaves much to be desired. And I believe the CPU watercooling on the Alienware desktops make use of the same 120mm radiator ASETEK setup as the Corsair H50. Because ASETEK LLC makes both the units, they're basically the same thing.</p>

              <p>Thanks <span>SBS7484P</span>, good advice. But I notice alot of gamers like to use <span>AMD</span> processor? Not sure why, because my impression is Intel processor is better? I admit I may be wrong because Intel is good at marketing…</p>
              <p>Thought of getting Alienware but for someone who knows how to <span>DIY</span>, then spects on spects, price on price, can get so much better spects with <span>DIY</span> than Alienware per dollar. Maybe the only disadvantage is that <span>DIY</span> don’t look as stylish as Alienware, but using it as a desktop leh, not showing off, so nobody will see it. Unless want to bring the <span>CPU</span> walk around as model in Sim Lim or Funan. That’s why lah, I think people with IT knowledge rocks…</p>
              <p>I going to Sim Lim maybe this week to get the parts and build one up… Can’t wait to test it on some games…</p>

              <p>More programs are coded better for Intel and that's why it's coding and threading etc. just makes the Intel CPU work better on it.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it's also the way the CPU is built.</p>
              <p>Certain instruction sets etc.. Intel has the upper hand as these instruction sets just seem to work better with programs.</p>
              <p>As for games, due to the fact that many games either rely heavily on GPU coding etc and in cases like GTA IV, relies mainly on the number of cores the CPU has, that AMD takes the upper hand. Not only is it cheaper than Intel, but it does outperform the Intel CPU at times.</p>
