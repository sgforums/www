            <div class='col-md body'>I signed up for a paypal account recently and added a bank account as well as a credit card. My main purpose for signing up a paypal account is to receive money from sale transactions overseas. Amounts wont be huge so I didnt verify my account which requires me to pay US$3. However on the day i added my credit card, I had a S$1.44 deduction from my card. I have not made any transactions, added any money to my paypal account nor verified my account. Does anyone know the reason behind the deduction?<br><br>Thanks for your help! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Seller will have smaller market since in western union, seller pays all the charges (I think so).<br>At least Paypal help you when you escalate a claim. Only that when you are the seller, you must ship via registered mail and please read the instruction carefully. It is somewhere in paypal website. this is very important because if buyer escalates the claim and you do not follow the guideline provided by paypal, you will lose the case immediately.</div>
