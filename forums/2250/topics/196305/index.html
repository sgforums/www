I didn't know what to do.<br><br>2. I did look at the words on the screen, but they were all very blurry. I could only make out some vague instructions like 'Your computer has undergone a critical error.....'<br><br>3. I was surfing sgforums and a Diablo website (<a href="http://www.infoceptor.com" rel="nofollow">www.infoceptor.com</a>) at the time of the BSOD. I wasn't playing Diablo II.

And usually, BSODs are pointers to memory violation or conflict errors, brought on by applications, or failing RAM modules or a combination of software and hardware faults.<br><br>Note, Firewalls and antivirus apps suck up memory. Your use of both Trend Micro and ZoneAlarm just increase memory usage, and ZoneAlarm has got security issues. You should do a Google search on Zone Alarm security flaws - you will find juicy articles about it.<br><br></div>

Other programs running in the background are ZoneAlarm firewall, Trend Micro Officescan, and MSN Messenger 7.5.<br><br>I've read both links you provided, and I think it's the second error that I'm experiencing, since it didn't occur when I was booting up my laptop. I'll download the patch later since I don't have my laptop with me. Right now I'm using my office computer.<br><br>And yeah, I guess I'll follow the previous person's advice of not using Trend Micro and ZoneAlarm simultaneously. I guess I'll uninstall Trend Micro and download AVG instead. As for the firewall, I'll go scout for another free firewall.<br><br>I'll download the patch later tonight and will let you know if anything happens.<br><br>Thanks for your help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arrgh... yet another BSoD last night! I had just finished printing some MS Word documents when I suddenly got this:<br><br><strong>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA<br><br>****STOP: 0x00000050( 0xACD6314C, 0x0000001, 0xE1569007, 0x0000000).<br></strong><br>Going to the Microsoft support page didn't help much, for there are many possible scenarios for the 0x00000050 stop error and the 'page fault' message.<br><br>I give up. I'm going down to the Toshiba Service Center at NUS tomorrow (my Toshiba laptop was bought under NUS). If it really turns out that my motherboard's screwed up and needs replacing, I may or may not decide not to repair it at all depending on the cost.<br><br>No point spending $500-$600 replacing the entire hardware when I can get a decent low-end PC for under $1K. I'm not into high-powered applications anyway; I just need it for my countless reports, presentations and research.<br><br>Anyway, my grateful thanks to everyone here for your support.<br><br></div>
