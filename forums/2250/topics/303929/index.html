If you have no idea what's AD, read up on that.<br><br>After this, figure out how softwares can be pushed down via the AD to the users.<br><br>When using AD to push down softwares, it's either Assigned or Published. Depending on settings, you will find the softwares at different sections of Add/Remove Programs.<br><br>Also... if there are lots of users, consider using MS Systems Management. All softwares will be put on a server, users will install the Systems Management client. Via this client, users can install the program.<br><br>If you want to make the installation compulsory, try writing a script to install them after work time or when they log in.<br><br>If using enterprise solutions such as Symantec, usually there's a server to control them (the clients).<br><br>Virus definitions can be downloaded to your server first, then distribute to the clients. Or the clients can download them directly from the vendor's site. Again, it's dependent on your settings.<br><br>As for telling how many users are infected... I know Symantec has this option. But I have no access to servers, so I can't tell how to use them. Not sure for other enterprise solutions.</div>
