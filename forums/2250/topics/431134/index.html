              <p>I would really recommend getting custom built PCs as they offer extremely high amounts of value as compared to PCs built by big carporations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.5k might get you a 5670/6670-class/GT540-class and an i7 CPU with a big-name brand, but with a custom built PC, you can get a 6870/GTX560-class GPU with an unlocked Intel i7 CPU. You also tend to get a longer warranty period, depending on the package offered by the corporations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want, we can spec up a system for you which you can bring to a Sim Lim Square PC parts retailer to build. It usually ends up quite a bit cheaper.</p>

              <p>If you're going to buy non customized computers, I say go for ACER.  But if you are on a tight budget and want to get really good gaming specs for your computer, I suggest you have it custom buit.</p>
              <p>Suggested specs for your budget:</p>
              <p>Processor: Intel i3</p>
              <p>Memory: 2 Ghz</p>
              <p>Video Card: ATI Radeon HD 5570</p>
              <p>Motherboard: buy either ASUS or MSI</p>
              <p>Hard disk: 500 GB or more</p>

              <p>Would be good to go for Nvidia GPU since a lot of games are based on Nvidia Drivers(but doesn't mean that AMD isn't good). I would suggest custom building. It's much more cheaper that way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CPU + MOBO --&gt; Gigabyte Z68A-D3 MOBO &amp; i5 2500k = $594. (Do note that this is one of the latest release of Sandy Bridge MOBO. You can read up more on the Z68 MOBO).</p>
              <p>GPU --&gt; Palit GTX 560 Ti(cheapest of all 560Ti) / XFX HD6950(A good manu and card). = $318 / $365</p>
              <p>RAM --&gt; 2x2GB Kingston Value RAM = $54. OR 2x4GB = $106.(Assuming that you're not going to OC the RAM).</p>
              <p>PSU --&gt;Seasonic S12 620W(non-modular) = $113 OR M12 620W(modular) = $135.</p>
              <p>Optical Drive --&gt; Samsung 22x = $25 OR Samsung 24x = $28.</p>
              <p>HDD --&gt; Hitachi 500GB 7200RPM = $54 OR 1TB = $68.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Assuming that you chose the most expensive parts in this list, it only cost a total of $1296. You'll have an extra $204 allowance on getting a case or even a CPU cooler if you're intending to overclock your CPU.</p>
              <p>Do write to me if you have any more questions regarding the build. Hope others forumners can let me know if any of the parts are incompatible. Thanks :)</p>

Vram's only important if you're really playing at a super high resolution like 2560x1600. 1GB of vram is more than enough for Full HD resolution(1920 x 1080).</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The Ti is the better version of the non-Ti version. Yep. You can request them to assemble the parts for you. The reason for not using the power supply given by the case is because those power supply won't last you long. It might not even be powerful enough to power up your system. It's just made of garbage. it's good to invest more on a power supply as it if it's short-circuit, it will damage all the components in the system which is totally not worth it.

              <p>Yes. You must get a new Power Supply(unless you want to risk damaging your system) and for OS&lt; if you want to use your XP or Vista disc, no problem. W7 is just my suggestion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll do a price break down for you.</p>
              <p>CPU + MOBO = $572</p>
              <p>RAM = $130+-(somewhere there)</p>
              <p>GPU = Which GTX460/560Ti are you going for? Palit/MSI/Gigabyte/Point of View/ASUS/LEADTEK? For GTX460, the price hsould be around $200~$300 and 560Ti should be $300~$400(depending of the manufacturer of the card).</p>
              <p>Sound Card = Should be around $100.</p>
              <p>HDD = $55+-</p>
              <p>Optical drive = $25~$35</p>
              <p>Case = (Do you really need such a good case? It cost around $300 which can be used to further upgrade your system like changing it to a 1TB drive. Such expensive case are usually used for watercooling. For air cooling, a CoolerMaster Elite 430 is more than enough to fit in your whole system and you acn even install fans in it. You can also go and get aftermarket CPU cooler like CoolerMaster Hyper 212 which cost only $59. Which an aftermarket cooler, you can overclock your system and get a better performance overall. Ultimately, it's your choice. Take this with a pinch of salt :))</p>
              <p>Power Supply = $134</p>
              <p>Total amount(assuming you're getting a CM Elite 430 case and CM Hyper212 CPU Cooler and GTX560Ti from <strong>MSI</strong>) = $1533+-. If you're going to get the CM HAF 992 casing, it'll cost around 1.7k.</p>
              <p>Remember to bargain with the shopkeeper :)</p>

              <p>Yes. You will need to buy Windows 7 because it doesn't come pre-installed with your system. Therefore, you will need to purchase Windows 7 and ask them to help you install it.</p>
              <p>For GPU, i would recommend Palit/ASUS/MSI. Personal preferences. MSI's my favourite because of their twin frozr 2 cooler and it's one of the best cooler for GPU around but it's like 30% more expensive than Palit. As for my own system, i'm using Palit GTX460 because TradePac is trying to clear their stock and Palit's GPU are going for quite a low price. If you're getting Palit's card, GTX560Ti would be good. It's even cheaper than Gigabyte's GTX460.</p>
              <p>As for casing, i would recommend you to get CoolerMaster Elite 430. It's comes with a 120mm Blue LED front fan installed in it when you buy the case. You can have up to 6 fans in the case. 2 on top, 1 side, 1 bottom. 1 back and 1 in the front. And it cost only $79.</p>

              <p>The V8 is an aftermarket CPU cooler. It performs much better than then Intel stock cooler.</p>
              <p>As for GPU, MSI - $289 / Asus - $269 / Palit $237. The MSI one is 20~30% much more expensive to Palit because of the cooler and lower noise fan. If you want a really cool and quiet case, go for the MSI one. if you're tight on budget, then go for the Palit one. And the Palit one is relatively smaller than the other manufacturer. But the size doesn't matter if you're using the Cooler Master Elite 460 case :)</p>
