              <p>Hi Guys, I am thinking of getting an part-time IT degree. However, I hope to pick one with less programming modules not forgetting that it has to be recognized be majority of the employers here in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Any advice or suggestion? I am currently looking at a few:</p>
              <p>1) PSB - BSc in IT</p>
              <p>2) uniSim - BSc in IT and business comm (ERP)</p>
              <p>3) University of Adelaide</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>IT jobs are super few compare to others, also low paid and long hours nowaday. Of course there is some exception - but are you that lucky few ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at the newspaper and see what people are advertising for ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Business , Finance , banking, service &amp; hospitality !!! all these are where the jobs is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you think hardworking and talent will make you successful in IT, but ask yourself if putting the same effort in other areas - I am sure you would be able to achieve even more in $ and other returns.</p>

              <p>I see. Thanks for the advice. Because my background comes from engineering, that's why IT is the closest. If I were to take a degree in a diff field, I will really need to consider carefully as it may be tougher for me compared to those that has background.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, I believe other industry like banking, finanace and hospitality will requires you to work long hours as well. But mayb in terms of dollars and cents may be well off.</p>

              <p>Actually... This can be also seen from another perspective.</p>
              <p>The IT field is not as volatile as others, and thus fewer jobs are posted in the classifieds.</p>
              <p>Moreover, this  field and its not very big. There are also quite a few job agencies that are specialised in only sourcing for IT jobs.</p>
              <p>These companies don't frequently post ads on classifieds (costly) and after awhile, these job agencies have (roughly 80-90%) of all job resumes in the market anyways.</p>
              <p>While you're new in the job market, its easy to come to the conclusion that theres this awesome job waiting for you to do and paying you something you're happy with.</p>
              <p>However, once you hit say, 30-40 yrs old, and you've been working 10-20 yrs, you would be more astute and your perspective would tend more toward the "Hmm, so this job has high turnover" kind of perspective.</p>
              <p>Its always good to gently inquire the nature of a job opening if you can sneak it in the interview. (high turnover/company expanding/excessive workload, all possible considerations)</p>
              <p># My humble opinion is just stick to what you enjoy doing. You'll likely do it better or wont get burnt out so fast as people who make a financial decision when picking their career. (Those people who do, might leave and give the passionate ones a chance!)</p>
              <p># Every industry will be filled with people who do it for passion and people who do it for other reasons. Try to learn from everyone but feed off the energy and enthusiasm of more passionate colleagues (^.^)</p>
              <p>I'm a passion junkie.</p>
