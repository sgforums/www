You can have a lot of extensions in front, but only the last part is recognized.<br><br>For example, you can name a file this way: whatever.txt.exe.dll.mp3.doc<br><br>Windows will read it as a .doc file<br><br>So if the virus reads a .dll file to infect, it needs to be renamed as whatever.dll.old or whatever.dll.bak<br><br>Because all these extensions are useless in Windows.

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's my recommended tactic:<br>When I encounter files possibly left behind by an unknown program, and the anti-malware tools cannot do it, I forcefully erase the file from the computer permanently. I don't recommend working with the registry for this, unless you know what you're doing.<br><br>Use these tools:<br>Eraser<br>--------<br>www.heidi.ie/eraser<br><br>CCleaner<br>-----------<br>www.ccleaner.com<br><br>Use it and clear off the file.<br><br>Eraser setting to note:<br>Erasing preferences use the default 35 passes. Check all boxes.<br>CCleaner:<br>Main screen:<br>Check all boxes except Hotfix uninstallers, these are the uninstallers for windows updates. You may want to clear them out or not.<br>Applications:<br>Check all boxes.<br>Issues:<br>Check all boxes.<br>Please inspect the tools section of the program, under uninstall and startup, see if there's anything suspicious in there.<br>Options:<br>Settings: English, check the first 3 boxes off, enable ccleaner auto-check for updates, choose NSA 7 passes for secure deletion.<br>Cookies:<br>Up to you.<br>Custom:<br>Up to you.<br>Advanced:<br>Check boxes no. 4, 5, 6, 7.
