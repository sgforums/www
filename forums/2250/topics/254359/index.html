            <div class='col-md body'>Free software is great, and corporate America loves it. ItÂ’s often high-quality stuff that can be downloaded free off the Internet and then copied at will. ItÂ’s versatile - it can be customized to perform almost any large-scale computing task - and itÂ’s blessedly crash-resistant. A broad community of developers, from individuals to large companies like IBM, is constantly working to improve it and introduce new features. No wonder the business world has embraced it so enthusiastically: More than half the companies in the Fortune 500 are thought to be using the free operating system Linux in their data centers.<br><br>But now thereÂ’s a shadow hanging over Linux and other free software, and itÂ’s being cast by Microsoft. The Redmond behemoth asserts that one reason free software is of such high quality is that it violates more than 200 of MicrosoftÂ’s patents. And as a mature company facing unfavorable market trends and fearsome competitors like Google (Charts, Fortune 500), Microsoft is pulling no punches: It wants royalties. If the company gets its way, free software wonÂ’t be free anymore. The conflict pits Microsoft and its dogged CEO, Steve Ballmer, against the Â“free worldÂ” - people who believe software is pure knowledge. The leader of that faction is Richard Matthew Stallman, a computer visionary with the look and the intransigence of an Old Testament prophet.<br><br><a href="http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=40257" rel="nofollow">http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=40257</a><br><br>because linux is not making any money they cannot afford a legal defense so be prepared for the death of linux<br></div>

Microsoft gained the right to resell Novell's SuSE Linux products and services at a markup.<br><br>The latter fact makes Microsoft a Linux distributor for the purposes of GPLv3, according to the Free Software Foundation. The FSF controls the licensing process around open-source software.<br><br>Under new terms inserted into the final draft of GPLv3, "If you arrange to provide patent protection to some of the people who get the software from you, that protection is automatically extended to everyone who receives the software, no matter how they get it," according to an explanation of the rules posted on the FSF Web site.<br><br>"This means that the patent protection Microsoft has extended to Novell's customers would be extended to everyone who uses any software Novell distributes under GPLv3," the FSF continued.<br><br>FSF makes no bones about the motivation behind the new language. The provision is a means "to attack the Microsoft-Novell deal," the group stated.<br><br>The new rules are included in what the FSF is calling a "last call" draft of GPLv3. The organization said it expects the document to be finalized within 30 days.<br><br>If GPLv3 takes effect in its current form, it could force Microsoft to either terminate its alliance with Novell or give up its patent claims over parts of Linux. In Microsoft's favor, however, is the fact that Linux inventor Linus Torvalds has previously said that he intends to maintain the Linux kernel under GPLv2, which doesn't forbid arrangements like the Microsoft-Novell alliance.<br><br>Still, it could prove impractical for Microsoft and Novell to distribute only those parts of Linux not covered by GPLv3.<br><br><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199703098" rel="nofollow">Last week, Novell warned in a regulatory filing that changes to the open-source license contemplated by GPLv3 could undermine its relationship with Microsoft</a>.<br><br>Microsoft officials on Thursday slammed the Free Software Foundation over the draft. "It is unfortunate that instead of encouraging industry collaboration to solve problems for customers, going forward the FSF wants to burn down this bridge," said Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft's VP for intellectual property and licensing, in an e-mail.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>The last paragraph... sounds right... by doing this are we making things worse?<br><br>MS and FSF is just like PAP and WP... this will have no end...</div>
