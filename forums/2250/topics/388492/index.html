              <p>Currently, the Macbook have better specs as compared to the Macbook Pro 13" so I will advise you to wait for the Macbook Pro refresh. Regarding whether is it worth it or not than I will say it depends on how you use it, you basically do able to run almost everything on it (even windows application if you dual boot) but if you focus more on editing/surfing than it is better and faster. Get the Macbook Pro if you have the money, it is more scratch-resistant (it is still scratchable despite being aluminium).</p>

              <p>No confirmation yet but most probably true and regarding the Macbook Pro update it is going to be updated soon the life cycle of the current generation is ending. Currently they are rumors that Apple will do a website update after their financial report on 25th Jan. It is possible as the iMac and Macbook were both updated after their financial report.</p>
              <p>25th Jan Monday - Financial Report</p>
              <p>26th Jan Tuesday - Possible website update with updated products not worth the mention</p>
              <p>27th Jan Wednesday - Media Event.</p>
              <p>Oh and yes Dell Adamo XPS looks sleek and good but not a Macbook Air killer, infact I don't see the point of killing the Macbook Air anyway, the market is still really small and Apple just shoot themselves in the foot by giving the Macbook Air a skyrocket high pricetag.</p>
              <p>And back on topic, it still comes back to the point of what you want, Mac may not have more software than PC but it is still usable, I till now haven't even find myself in a situation where there is no mac alternative for that particular function. Price is see yourself, to be honest Apple quality has been dropping and they seems to have problem maintating two OS at once.</p>
              <p>P.S I do own a Mac, a unibody white Macbook actually and there is indeed reports that Apple quality is no longer the best in the industry.</p>

              <p>Oh, i see. Thx for the info. Dell and mac as 2 totally different machines. I would rather get the pro then the air which has lower specs and it's priced ridiculously high. Besides apple, the quality from other companies are also dropping. But imo, the service from apple is still excellent, and besides the <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse; white-space: pre;  ">compatibility, the software is better. what do you mean by maintating 2 os at once? </span></p>
              <p>If you meant maintaining, i would say if you expect to run windows and mac together, you're better off not getting a mac. </p>
              <p>How the performance and graphics on your mac compared to pc?</p>

              <p>Talking about virus... it's like 99.9% virus free because most of the com user are windows based in the past... so creator of virus would think twice of writing a virus for mac... and you are saying 99.9%? it is not possible lor... and but the way, if you install windows on a mac, it is like saying that you are inviting the 99.9% possibility to come and harm the system.</p>
              <p>Application have... but more expensive for mac os and lesser place carries them as most of the places carries windows based applications. So, if you don't know, I suggest that you keep your fingers off the keyboard and not reply.</p>

              <p>Depends on what you are using it for. If you want to play games and use windows stuff then dont get a mac. Even running parallel or bootcamp on mac won't give you as good a performance as a regular laptop.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, if using for surfing net, using word, normal usage, i strongly recommend Mac. Ever since switching to a mac, it has changed the way I use computer. OS X is very intuitive in usage (if you have used it you'd know). The expose function in OS X is something I cannot do without now. Very very very useful for multitasking. OS X also boots and shut down very quickly if that matters.</p>
              <p>There are a sizeable number of apps for all purposes for the mac and are generally well designed with good UI. Not sure what type of apps are you specifically talking about but most of these mac apps are available on the net for web downloads/purchase and are affordable. Mac does hang at times, but is not half as bad as when a pc hangs.</p>
