              <p>I just read the post by the VP at the end....</p>
              <p>Basket.... that was incredibly brusque and high-handed. For example, he said:</p>
              <p><em>'If we choose to develop and provide host-based processing features with
              certain sound cards and not others, that is a business decision that
              only we have the right to make.'</em></p>
              <p>Translation: 'If we choose to make profits instead of giving customers what they want, then it's because we have the right to do so.'</p>
              <p>Dang.... I'm glad I dumped my Creative Zen V Plus for an iPod nano.</p>

              <p>I'm not too keen to find out what's going on. Creative, as far as they are concern, don't really care a hoot about what users do as long as you don't claim rights over their stuffs. Creative doesn't like that a lot; the lawsuit between Apple and Creative should show a lot...</p>
              <p>However... do take note that Creative also licenses from other technology companies as well... while Creative can don't care for their own products... other technology companies which Creative licenses from may not think the same way. Creative could be sued if they did nothing about it.</p>
              <p>It's just bad PR IMO. Creative bore the whole thing.</p>
              <p>And BTW, coming up with a driver that works on Vista is not easy. If Vista doesn't like it, it will BSOD on you. It doesn't matter if you follow rules, Vista is just Vista. I'm not surprised if Creative has problems coming up with something that works. Creative also released some slipshod work for those who have good memory...</p>

              <p>Microsoft may monopolise the OS market... Creative doesn't have to follow suit... I think they may want to try out something else for all we know.</p>

              <p>The only logical reason I think of for such a response from Creative, is that they are planning to come out with a new series of sound cards that support Vista along with the necessary drivers but just for those cards only. This will then force users who are shifting from XP to Vista to upgrade their sound cards as well, which would translate to more profits for them.</p>
