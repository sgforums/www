              <p>hmmmmm...if u want a small laptop where u can put it in a lcd case they have the motherboard for it...but the lcd screen is hard to interface n looks weird even after u assembled it.</p>
              <p>trying to make a laptop with such small sensitive pcb board where even a drop of sweat can destroy it completely is not wise.its like trying to piece a PS2 console.high chances it wont work and even if it worked the performance is not stable and would crash or stop functioning prematurely.</p>
              <p>However they do hap a laptop on sale in australia for $400 brand new and i did see shops in spore selling somewhere around that price too.....and then theres the other mini laptop which are smaller n way cheaper.all around $400 or less even.</p>

              <p>I just thought that the processor is quite powerful.</p>
              <p>And since those prebuilt laptops have a lot of part which i do not need.</p>
              <p>So i could cut down on cost while retaining power.</p>
              <p>Card reader, DVD drive, wireless card and graphics card i do not require.</p>

              <p>Core 2 doesnt have on-die integrated graphics and the integrated
              memory controller.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, it uses 32nm transistor. 20w tdp vs 35w tdp
              for processor only.</p>

              <p>The IMC isn't that important. What you should care is battery life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Core 2 has a 3-chip layout. The CPU, Northbridge and Southbridge.</p>
              <p>Arrandale is 2-chip based. CPU and PCH. Of course you're going to have much better battery life, even with a 35W TDP. </p>
              <p>Then all I can say is you're going to wait a long time, if not forever, for Intel to release a socketed version of the i3m and for someone to sell a mobo, chassis etc.</p>

              <p>There are no Nehalem-based DIY laptops around. There were some
              barebones laptops being sold based on Core 2, primarily from OCZ.
              Buy the chassis, CPU, HDD, RAM and you're done.</p>

              <p>Why are there no Nehalem based DIY laptops? Most mobile Nehalem
              CPUS are SOLDERED onto the motherboard.</p>

              <p>Your best bet is to go the conventional route and get a laptop
