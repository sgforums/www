Its free. After that just search for the serial or *ahem* PM me for the serial and instructions to enter the registration key, which will upgrade it to pro version and allowing you to encode videos. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Its probably your original Superband files. Are they originally in avi format?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gordonator:</div><div class="quote_body">i find that many people actually regretted buying an ipod. reason being, many can't seems to fill up even half the capacity of a ipod example 20Gig. even if they do fill up, come on seriously, how long at 1 go can u listen up to 20Gig of songs in 1 sitting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>secondly, they regretted buying so soon as newer or cheaper vision came out within the next few months, like the ipod nano. they will feel their old model is obsoleted. </div></blockquote>It actually depends on how you maximize the functions of it. Most people only know it can store MP3s and videos. Ask them what is podcast they'll go "huh?" Some do not know how to convert videos so mainly listen to MP3s only.<br><br>My iPod is already filling up with the 'support' of podcasts. My friend uses his iPod to 'steal' other ppl's music libraries. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For your last point, you just have to ask the Apple geeks around you when is the next product release <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
