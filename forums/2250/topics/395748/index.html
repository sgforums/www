              <p><img src="http://i988.photobucket.com/albums/af2/techsgforums/MyPillowTalks/DIYPCGuide/RAM.jpg" alt=""><br><br><br>So you bought your ram, install the ram like in the following picture.

Make sure you have your stand off screwed onto the case.<br><br>Your motherboard will look something like this(On the pictures are some name of the expansion slots):<br><img src="http://i988.photobucket.com/albums/af2/techsgforums/MyPillowTalks/DIYPCGuide/slots.jpg" alt=""><br><br>Do not tighten all the screws! Because you need to check that the I/O (back panel) of the motherboard is line up nicely with the I/O shield. If you tighten all the screws and the board does not line up, you will need one extra step<br><br>Now that the motherboard is fitted on to the case, lets move on<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>If your motherboard comes with onboard graphics, and you dont wish to install an graphics card, you can skip this step<br><br>The thing at the bottom of your graphics card that allows you to slot it in your motherboard is called PCI Express x16 slot. The interface design of older graphics card is called AGP slot, and there are also other types of graphics card with different interface<br><br>This is how it looks like:<br><img src="http://i988.photobucket.com/albums/af2/techsgforums/MyPillowTalks/DIYPCGuide/PCIexpress.jpg" alt=""><br><br><br>This is how you put it in:<br><img src="http://i988.photobucket.com/albums/af2/techsgforums/MyPillowTalks/DIYPCGuide/InstallGPU.jpg" alt=""><br><br>NOTE THAT in the illustration above i didnt mount the motherboard into the casing, because it will be hard to take picture. Please mount the mainboard onto the casing before installing the graphics card, it is safer and easier</p>
