              <p>OK, I'm being forced to post again on SGForums.com again after all this while...</p>
              <p>A while back, the Nvidia graphics card in my computer started acting weird. I brought it to a computer shop, where I found that it had already blown, hence the reason why it was acting up. I decided to do some RAM upgrades in addition to replacing the graphics card, but then a chain of unfortunate events hit me; in short, both the motherboard and hard drive somehow blew out too after the upgrade and I needed to get both of them replaced.</p>
              <p>Now, I'm mostly tolerating this new motherboard, but what I can't tolerate is the way it makes my case fan spins at high speed (2400 RPM and above) and making a lot of noise. The CPU fan was originally spinning at high speed too, but I managed to reduce it by going to the BIOS settings and setting the minimum fan speed to a lower setting; the same can't be said for the case fan, whose settings are disabled in the BIOS. On my old motherboard, the case fan could spin at around 1000 RPM.</p>
              <p>I have taken it back to the computer shop where I got the motherboard replaced, but the staff there have said that the speed is hard-coded into the motherboard and cannot be changed. They have tried to reduce the noise by cleaning it out, but they said that there is no other way to reduce the noise, even if I replace it with a new case fan.</p>
              <p>I do not completely believe this to be the case (pardon the pun) and I'm seeking a way to quiet this thing down further; though it's quite silent now, the hum is definitely quite more audible compared to what it was with my old motherboard and it just grates on my nerves just to hear them from where I'm sitting now. Right now, I'm considering the <a href="http://www.nexustek.nl/NXS-nexus92mmrealsilentcasefan.htm">Nexus 92mm Real Silent Case Fan</a>, but I'm not sure if it's compatitable with my current motherboard.</p>
              <p>In any case these are my current specifications:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>MSI G31M3-FS Motherboard</li>
              <li>Intel Core2Quad Q6600 at 2.4GHz</li>
              <li>ATi Radeon HD 4670 with 1GB RAM Graphics Card</li>
              <li>Seagate ST3500418AS 500GB Hard Drive</li>
              <li>case fan appears to be connected to the motherboard via a 3-pin Molex connector</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I hope someone can help me with this. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Anyway, most mobo BIOSes allow speed control. You could try downloading SpeedFan and see if you can lower the RPM, usually you can though. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A 3-pin header requires a voltage regulation to control speed, while a 4-pin uses PWM-control. Most mobo BIOSes allow control of a few case fans. For those that cannot be controlled by the BIOS, SpeedFan usually solves the problem.</p>

              <p>I have already tried using Speedfan to lower the speed, but to no avail. I had only successfully raised the CPU's fan speed using that.</p>

              <p>When you are someone who is quite sensitive to noise, and when you live in an area or room that is almost dead-quiet most of the time, you will understand my worries here.</p>
              <p>In any case I think I might be buying myself the Nexus fan I mentioned above, since I tried messing around with Speedfan again to no avail.</p>

              <p>Instead of buying a new fan, you could get yourself a fan controller. Plugs into the 5 1/4" drive bays and controls voltage to the fans, which the control the speed of the fan. Most use 1 4-pin peripheral connector to about 3 or 4 3-pin fan headers. </p>

              <p>I have considered that, but I think it's a bit too much of a hassle just to quiet things down.</p>
