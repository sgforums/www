              <p>THE NEW software suites come with all the trappings of today’s modern
               software offering: cloud computing hosting options, software as a 
              service (SaaS) features, outsourcing, digital certificates, licences to 
              prevent piracy, software modules, and bundled service and support 
              packages.</p>
              <p>But the difference between these software programs – 
              which are listed in ephemeral internet relay chat (IRC) discussion areas
               and private online forums – and what you might buy from mainstream 
              vendors, is that they supply increasingly sophisticated hacking software
               to the unsophisticated – to fledgling hackers with little ability to 
              write their own computer code.</p>
              <p>“Lessons learned from large, 
              legitimate software companies – such as development practices, 
              anti-piracy techniques, and support and pricing practices – are 
              routinely duplicated in the underground economy in order to increase 
              efficiency and profits,” reports security company Symantec in a report 
              out this week on the growth in the underground market for so-called 
              “attack toolkits”.</p>
              <p>According to Orla Cox, security operations 
              manager at Symantec’s security response centre in Dublin, a maturing 
              market for hacking software and the dismay of previous creators of such 
              packages at seeing them – ironically – widely pirated and available from
               hacker discussion sites has produced a hacking software landscape that 
              is increasingly indistinguishable from legitimate businesses.</p>
              <p>“They’re
               trying to differentiate themselves from competitors,” she says. Thus, 
              vendors of such software suites, which tend to cost anywhere from a few 
              hundred to a few thousand euro, readily supply a range of services to 
              cater to the novice hacker.</p>
              <p>As with security companies like 
              Symantec itself, these suite producers can provide regular updates, 
              except that these enable their rogue software to take advantage of newly
               discovered vulnerabilities in browsers, applications and 
              infrastructure.</p>
              <p>Or, perhaps the hacker would like the seller of 
              the software to provide a hosting service for them from which to run the
               malicious code? That’s on offer too.</p>
              <p>And if a large package is 
              too expensive, buyers can instead purchase modules enabling them to do 
              certain types of hacking.</p>
              <p>As with mainstream commercial software, 
              many of the packages also require buyers to activate licences or use 
              digital certificates to ensure the packages won’t suddenly appear for 
              free on filesharing sites or IRC chat rooms.</p>
              <p>The new 
              sophistication of the software indicates the more limited abilities of 
              the buyers, says Cox. “These are less-educated hackers, if you like,” 
              she says. “They take more of a hobbyist approach rather than the 
              old-school hacker who learns to code. The buyers will have computer 
              skills, but maybe not coding skills.”</p>
              <p>Novice hackers can even 
              bundle in a service and support package to get help when they find a new
               module a little too confusing or can’t figure out how to get their 
              software settings quite right.</p>
              <p>“It would all be quite underground 
              though,” Cox says. “They wouldn’t exactly have a hotline that you can 
              call. But they will use instant messaging or IRC.”</p>
              <p>The main type 
              of suite being sold is called an “exploit kit”, and the most common way 
              of staging an attack is for users to place malicious code on a victim’s 
              computer.</p>
              <p>“It allows you to set up your own malicious site with 
              everything on it. This may be passing on malware or redirecting to a 
              malicious site when the visitor comes across this site,” says Cox.</p>
              <p>“It
               allows you to build up your botnet to stage attacks, or to send out 
              spam.”</p>
              <p>The hackers try to lure visitors to their websites using 
              search engine optimisation techniques and productive search terms.</p>
              <p>The
               most popular – at 44 per cent – are terms associated with adult 
              entertainment websites, while the second most common are terms 
              associated with video streaming, says the report. Toolkit users also use
               “typo-squatting” – they register a domain name a letter or two off that
               of a popular website in the hope of capturing clumsy keyboardists.</p>
              <p>In
               some cases, the users of such kits work for professional cybercrime 
              gangs, who will pay novice hackers for every computer they can 
              compromise, helping the gangs to build vast botnets for staging attacks,
               Cox says.</p>
              <p>A number of high-profile exploits using the kits has 
              drawn greater attention to the problem over the past year. Topping the 
              list, at least for the humiliation factor, was a successful breach of 
              three US treasury department websites using a toolkit called Eleanore in
               May.</p>
              <p>The website redirected visitors to a malicious site which 
              infected the visitors with malicious code and rogue security software, 
              according to the report.</p>
              <p>Another effective scam used a popular 
              toolkit called Zeus to harvest data from 55,000 vulnerable computers 
              last August. The group behind the attack, called Avalanche, used a 
              botnet to steal bank account information and credit card details from 
              victims.</p>
              <p>Symantec says “the relative simplicity and effectiveness 
              of using attack toolkits” has led to novice hackers with few coding 
              skills increasingly hacking for financial gain, rather than to deface 
              websites or cause general mischief. The report says the toolkits are 
              being used in the majority of malicious attacks online – indicating that
               relative novices are probably now behind the majority of hacking 
              attacks – with Zeus alone responsible for over 90,000 examples of 
              malicious code in just one month of 2009.</p>
              <p>“It is very likely that 
              attack toolkits such as Zeus have been responsible for infecting 
              millions of computers,” the report says.</p>
              <p>Symantec is now watching 
              this underground market for signs of consolidation, says Cox. Just as in
               the mainstream software world, some toolkit producers seem ready to go 
              to work together with a merged product rather than to continue to 
              compete.</p>
              <p>The market for merged products could be very lucrative. 
              Zeus sells for up to $4,000, but there are rumours that a new toolkit 
              comprising Zeus consolidated with another toolkit is now available for 
              about $8,000.</p>
              <p>“The kits are starting to be more expensive – and 
              more effective,” says Cox.</p>
