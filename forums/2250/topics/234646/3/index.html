That's no excuse. Two problems hit them - hardware drivers and softwares. Since these two aren't the major OSes on market, not many hardware developers will develop drivers for these two platforms. When you run into problems, you know where where to look.<br><br>2) There are workarounds for this. Still, not an excuse.<br><br>3) Linux only use is not just for server. It has other purposes (excluding desktops).<br><br>4) When MS cease support, who says you can't use XP? You still can. If you are a safe surfer, nothing will bring you down. If you aren't, then the advice would be to get another OS (security through obscurity) or get Vista.<br><br>5) That's if the PC is from some company. If you build one yourself, you can still use other OS.<br><br>6) That's a crap reason. Linux and Mac are known to be more stable than Windows, yet people still choose Windows. Why? As stated in your first reason. Humans are one lazy creature and don't like changes. When they get used to one thing, they would hardly want to change. Tell me, do you use the Dvorak keyboard or Qwerty keyboard? The Dvorak keyboard is better in all ways, yet not many people choose to use it.<br><br>Anything will be as secure as you want it to and anything will be as stable as you want it to if everything is left to default. The problem is, we don't. We are curious bunch of creatures, who wants to find out more things which leaves us with rubbish to clear. We are always seeking improvements, tweaking this and that spoils our PCs.</div>
