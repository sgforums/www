            <div class='col-md body'><strong>US agencies shun Windows Vista</strong><br><br>Joris Evers CNET News.com<br>Published: 14 Mar 2007 09:39 GMT<br><br><strong>The US Department of Transportation (DOT) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cite fear of compatibility problems as one of the reasons not to allow their tens of thousands of employees to upgrade to Microsoft's latest operating system.</strong><br><strong><br>"We are temporarily not permitting computers with the Vista operating system to be connected to our networks," Michael Baum, a NIST spokesman,</strong> said on Tuesday. The organisation's technology staff is testing NIST applications and evaluating the security in Windows Vista. The same holds true for Internet Explorer 7 and Office 2007, he said.<br><br>It is not unusual that agencies aren't rushing to install major software updates. Large organisations in particular tend to do a lot of testing before upgrading. The same happened when Microsoft released Service Pack 2 for Windows XP. The actions by DOT, which employs about 54,000 people, and NIST, with 2,900 employees, were first reported by Information Week.<br><br>The DOT also bans Vista, Office 2007 and IE 7. In addition to compatibility concerns, the department lists cost, available funding and a pending headquarters move as reasons not to upgrade, according to a DOT memo dated 19 January. The memo is still current, a DOT representative said on Tuesday.<br><br><strong>"There appears to be no compelling technical or business case for upgrading to these new Microsoft software products," according to the memo. </strong>The department plans to issue an update next month to clarify its strategy for 2008 and beyond, the representative said.<br><br>In a statement, Microsoft said it is working with many government agencies to help them adopt its latest products. "We respect the customer's decision," the company said.<br><br>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the largest organisation under the DOT, is taking the opportunity to consider alternatives to Microsoft's operating system and productivity software, said Tammy Jones, an FAA spokeswoman. This includes including running Linux on desktops and using Google's online applications, she said.<br><br>"We're trying to see what the cost impact would be to the FAA to convert to the new Microsoft products," Jones said. "We want to explore what some of the alternatives are. Google is one that we're looking at, so is Linux." The FAA has about 45,000 employees.<br><br>Vista has been available to businesses since late November and was released to the general public at the end of January. About 90 million copies of the operating system will be installed this year, predicts IDC. The analyst firm also foresees that consumers will be first to adopt the system. Businesses should be cautious, IDC advises.<br><br>"Business customers should take a cautious approach to adopting new Windows technologies and need to go through a normal evaluation cycle," IDC analyst Al Gillen wrote in a recent report. "Most organisations should incorporate a move to Windows Vista in their longer-term road map Â— unless they are planning to move toward competitive solutions."<br><br>Many organisations will need up to 18 months after the Vista ship date to verify their applications, get other software makers to support the operating system and run tests, analyst firm Gartner said in a December report. "Sooner or later, most organisations will deploy Windows Vista," Gartner's analysts said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Microsoft: OneCare should not have been rolled out</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Tom Espiner ZDNet UK<br>Published: 16 Mar 2007 13:03 GMT<br><br>Microsoft has said that its OneCare security suite has "a problem" with the underlying antivirus code, and admitted that security is just "a little part of Microsoft".<br><br>Speaking to ZDNet UK exclusively at the CeBIT show in Hanover, a senior manager for the software giant said that its consumer security product is far from perfect and that pieces are actually "missing".<br><br>OneCare has been dogged by controversy since its launch last May. Signs that the software was not up to scratch came earlier this month when OneCare failed to achieve certification in an independent test of security products. Shortly before that, it emerged that the product did not sufficiently protect users of Microsoft's Vista operating system against malware.<br><br>Microsoft apologised for the problems and has issued an update that has now been automatically pushed out to OneCare customers, to halt the false positive identification as malware of Outlook .pst and Outlook Express .dbx files.<br><br>Asked about these problems, Arno Edelmann, Microsoft's European business security product manager, told ZDNet UK on Thursday that the code itself has pieces missing.<br><br>"Usually Microsoft doesn't develop products, we buy products. It's not a bad product, but bits and pieces are missing," said Edelmann.<br><br>The problem lies with a core technology of OneCare, the GeCAD antivirus code, and how it interacts with Microsoft mailservers. According to Edelmann, the Microsoft updates and mailserver infrastructure do not harmonise.<br><br>"It's a problem with the updates, and it's a problem with the implementation," said Edelmann.<br><br>If mail is received from a server running Exchange 2007, users are unlikely to encounter problems. However, if mail is received from servers running Exchange 2000 or 2003, the likelihood of quarantining is high, said Edelmann.<br><br>"OneCare is a new product Â— they shouldn't have rolled it out when they did, but they're fixing the problems now," said Edelmann.<br><br>According to the security manager, security is only a small part of what Microsoft does, suggesting it does not have as much security expertise as established security vendors.<br><br>"Microsoft is not a security company. Security is important, but it's just a little part of Microsoft," said Edelmann.<br><br>Security vendor Kaspersky said that it was not acceptable for two Microsoft products Â— such as OneCare and Exchange 2007 Â— to be incompatible, especially as Microsoft has market dominance.<br><br>"Microsoft, welcome to our business," said Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of the company. "All in all it's a bad thing. It's not acceptable for Microsoft products to do that. Microsoft dominates the market. If they do that it creates a big noise, many affected people, and happy lawyers."<br><br>This is not the first time Microsoft has had a problem with OneCare and Outlook. In January OneCare also erroneously quarantined Outlook files. However, Kaspersky said that although the problems then and now were the same, the cause of the problems in January was different.<br><br>"They fixed the first false positive, and now they have the next one," said Kaspersky.<br><br>Kaspersky said that false positives are not just a problem for Microsoft, but for the whole antivirus industry. He said that about 1 percent of Kaspersky records were false positives, but they were almost totally stopped by the company's test robots. He added, however, that sometimes false positives are released by Kaspersky.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Microsoft partner: Vista less secure than XP</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Tom Espiner ZDNet UK<br>Published: 16 Mar 2007 16:09 GMT<br><br>Security company Kaspersky claims that Vista's User Account Control (UAC), the system of user privileges that can be used to restrict users' administrative rights, will be so annoying that users will disable it.<br><br>Natalya Kaspersky, the company's chief executive, said that without UAC, Vista will be less secure than Windows XP SP2. "Windows Vista with UAC disabled will be less secure than XP SP2," said Kaspersky, speaking to ZDNet UK at the CeBIT 2007 show in Hanover. "There's a question mark if Vista security has improved, or has really dropped down."<br><br>Kaspersky provides one of the scanning engines in ForeFront, Microsoft's business security product.<br><br>Arno Edelmann, business security product manager for Microsoft, said that Kaspersky's claims were surprising. "We have a thriving community of partners, and Kasperky is one of our best partners," Edelmann told ZDNet UK. "I find their statements a little strange because they have one of the best insights into Microsoft security products."<br><br>After being roundly criticised over its security strategy in the past, Microsoft has done a lot of work to improve its approach and has been touting Vista as its most secure operating system. But Kaspersky confirmed that her analysts had found five ways to bypass Vista's UAC, and that malware writers will find more security holes.<br><br>Kaspersky also added her voice to Symantec and McAfee complaints that PatchGuard, designed to protect the Vista kernel, is hindering security companies' work.<br><br>"PatchGuard doesn't allow legitimate security vendors to do what we used to do," said Kaspersky.<br><br>Symantec has claimed that PatchGuard is hurting security vendors more than it was hurting malware writers. Bruce McCorkendale, a chief engineer at Symantec, said: "There are types of security policies and next-generation security products that can only work through some of the mechanisms that PatchGuard prohibits."<br><br>Eugene Kaspersky, the company founder, said on Thursday that while vendors had to interact with Vista legitimately, hackers were under no such constraints.<br><br>"Cybercriminals seem not to care about Vista licensing," said Eugene Kaspersky. "They don't need to follow regulations or be certified by Microsoft Â— antivirus vendors do."<br></div>

"To add to the problem, you can't cancel or anything."<br><br>According to a thread on Microsoft's TechNet site, Microsoft has issued a hotfix for the problem, but it has failed to quell the outrage. For one thing, individual users must get Microsoft's approval before the fix can be downloaded, according to our tipster. And for another, hotfixes are more of a pain to install than patches.<br><br>We've contacted a Microsoft spokeswoman, who promised to see if a patch for the problem in the works. Meanwhile, Vista users continue to grumble.<br><br>"I simply can not believe that I updated to a new computer and put windows Vista on it to find that it's not even capable of moving and deleting files in an efficient manner," one disaffected user posted in the Microsoft forum. "Microsoft must be kidding! The most basic of features that I use all the time is a slow train wreck."<br><br><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1358057&amp;SiteID=17" rel="nofollow">http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1358057&amp;SiteID=17</a></div>
