That's no excuse. Two problems hit them - hardware drivers and softwares. Since these two aren't the major OSes on market, not many hardware developers will develop drivers for these two platforms. When you run into problems, you know where where to look.<br><br>2) There are workarounds for this. Still, not an excuse.<br><br>3) Linux only use is not just for server. It has other purposes (excluding desktops).<br><br>4) When MS cease support, who says you can't use XP? You still can. If you are a safe surfer, nothing will bring you down. If you aren't, then the advice would be to get another OS (security through obscurity) or get Vista.<br><br>5) That's if the PC is from some company. If you build one yourself, you can still use other OS.<br><br>6) That's a crap reason. Linux and Mac are known to be more stable than Windows, yet people still choose Windows. Why? As stated in your first reason. Humans are one lazy creature and don't like changes. When they get used to one thing, they would hardly want to change. Tell me, do you use the Dvorak keyboard or Qwerty keyboard? The Dvorak keyboard is better in all ways, yet not many people choose to use it.<br><br>Anything will be as secure as you want it to and anything will be as stable as you want it to if everything is left to default. The problem is, we don't. We are curious bunch of creatures, who wants to find out more things which leaves us with rubbish to clear. We are always seeking improvements, tweaking this and that spoils our PCs.</div></blockquote>1) No matter how linux try to as user-friendly as possible, there still command-line and certain stuff you still have to remember, there's no escape for it. For normal PC user, why would they want to take their time to remember since they can use microsoft windows which they are used to and have been using it for all this time. As you have know, when humans are comfortable with certain things, they wouldn't want to change it unless there is really a reason to.<br><br>2) Yup there is a workaround for window software and games for example using winetools, however it is not 100% workable.<br><br>3) Yup not only on servers, in smartphones, some entertainment hardwares too and some other non-complicated devices.<br><br>4) Yup, even if microsoft cease support for Win XP, normal user can still continue to use it, however if loopholes were to be found then it will be god bless them. Yea you can say hackers will target vista by then, but do you think companies will take the risk? Definitely not. Besides, as time goes people will surely change their computers, whether is it computer breakdown or those hardcore gamers, and this is when Win vista will comes with it. Don't forget computer you buy now will become outdated in a few years, maybe 3 years.<br><br>5) Yup if PC is from manufacturers definitely it will comes with vista. However like I said earlier if Win XP ceased support, microsoft will not release Win XP anymore, do you think those custom PC will still be able to get XP? I predict after the next few months to about a year from now, you will not see Win XP in the SG market anymore (Not sure about the net though). Besides, if people gotten themselves a new PC, there will be no reason for them to get outdated software anymore isn't it?<br><br>6) Finally, we will not escape from microsoft cluthes unless someone invent a more user-friendly (Hardware support, software support - Linux?), easy to use (no complicated setup - Linux?) and better interface (click and click - Linux?). Indeed Linux have better security for now (not much hackers and virus attack Linux for now but in future?).<br><br>7) Yup, Linux do have a XP look-alike desktop, however it is still kinda complicated for normal user, not as straightforward as microsoft desktop.</div>

I've never touch Linux command prompts just to use some programs. But if you are into tweaking and doing other things, then yes, you will touch it.<br><br>2) Not 100% foolproof, but at the very least, you could run something.<br><br>4) As I said, everything is only as safe as you want it to be. Nothing is better than your brain. Surely not everyone is just as rich to change their PCs when something breaks down. Some will just change the part that spoils, others will go for a full change. Also, the definition of upgrading is different for everybody. For some, it means a full change, right from hardware to software. For others, it's "I want this part, I want that part". Changing parts alone is enough to keep up with the technology.<br><br>5) Yes, you will still be able to get them, within a year after MS drop supports for their products. Retailers won't be so dumb to throw them away, as they cost money. Over on the Net, there are even versions of Windows 95. So nothing is impossible.<br><br>Even if they get new PCs, it doesn't mean they shouldn't get outdated software. True, new softwares will have better features. But that doesn't mean old ones should be discarded. Besides, there are addons to these old programs, which means new features in old programs. Won't really lose out.<br><br>6) Hardware support in Linux is limited, that I agree. However, some Linux fans have decided to go against that and have produced OSes that are compatible with your hardware.<br><br>The notation that Linux is hard to install is gone, especially for popular distros. Mandrake, Ubuntu, Debian, etc all have a GUI. They even have a partitioning wizard, which is a slider, to indicate how big you want a partition is. Not typing in numbers like for Windows installation. For popular distros, it's a point and shoot thing. No more command line interface.<br><br>Linux does have better security, not because it's not as popular, it's the way Linux is programmed. All users by default, are not administrators. No matter what, all users will need to create a password.<br><br>And don't forget, because it's open-sourced, many people are hacking it. It releases updates faster when bugs are found. Just as many people are hacking it, as many people are fixing it. Just using Firefox as example, it can be updated as many as 4 times per month, unlike IE, which is once per month.<br><br>There's no such thing as registry in Linux, which complicates matters, like in Windows.<br><br>7) I would beg to differ. You've got to try out one of the popular distros out there. It's much more easier than you think. Mandrake, Ubuntu, Debian, Xubuntu, Puppy, PC Linux, Slynux, Linux-XP are some of the more popular ones and they are easy to use.</div>
