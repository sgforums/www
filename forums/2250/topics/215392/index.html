            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bluejuice, maybe I can shed some light.<br><br>Firstly, before you begin considering notebooks, you should first decide what you want your notebook to do.<br><br>If its going to be for day to day office applications, surfing the web, and misc. non-intensive programs, then note that any core duo processor will be just fine for your needs. People tend to overestimate and give too much credit to processor speeds. Even if you're going to be gaming, processor impact between those few hundred mhz wouldn't be massive.<br><br>If you're going to be gaming, then you should be looking more towards what graphics solution the laptop comes with - the Dell 6400 that you're looking at for example can be configured for either an onboard Intel graphics accelerator, or a dedicated graphics solution such as the X1300, or X1400.<br><br>There are heaps of considerations that you're gonna have to factor in and account for. Instead of listing every one of them manually (because I'm lazy; but feel free to PM me if you need specific direction), why don't you tell us what you expect your laptop to do.<br><br>Regarding the 6400, it's of excellent build quality for that price. Dell makes great notebooks for the price bracket because there is no middle man. Infact, its the only notebook company I know of who has a rather translucent operations process. Dell customer service is pretty incompetent, but always polite and great to deal with. Besides, within the first year of use, any manufacturing defects will come to light, and will/can be dealt with using the standard one year warranty. Anything beyond that one year is anyone's guess. Go with the Dell, and save yourself a couple of hundred quid~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm also looking to buy a new laptop but after reading through the net ( I don't keep up-to-date) , I think it's best if I wait till at least Q1 of next year. By then, I think most laptops will be bundled with Windows Vista and thus I don't have to spend money to upgrade. But if you're happy with Windows XP, that shouldn't be a problem.<br><br>Also, at around the same time period Intel will be releasing their new Santa Rosa platform  which will give a significant jump in performance.<br><br>Info here :  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrino#Santa_Rosa_platform" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrino#Santa_Rosa_platform</a><br><br>One of the interesting feature is the Robson flash memory:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">"....gave a demonstration using a laptop that booted up almost immediately. Robson flash memory uses NAND flash memory to reduce the time it takes for a computer to power up, to access programs, and to write data to the hard drive. For notebook computers, it could also improve battery life..."<br></span><br>More info here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robson_flash_memory" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robson_flash_memory</a><br><br>So, since it's not urgent for me to get one, I'd rather wait a few months. I know pple will say that there will always be a new technology coming soon but I think this one will be significant and I want my laptop to last as long as possible. Price-wise, I think the cheaper versions will also take advantage of this technology except they just have reduced clock speed and perhaps lower memory. They'll just phase out the current platform.</div>
