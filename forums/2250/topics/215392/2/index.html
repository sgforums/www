            <div class='col-md body'>Dell is working to improve itself, so I'm probably not interested in Dell products as of now. For a tech person, brands do matter, as it differentiate between a good lasting product or a product that spoils within a short time frame. For the lay people out there, it's just as important, surely they do want to call the customer service half the time to get their laptop working?<br><br>Willing to try is good, but it is seriously a lot of luck.

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope the thread starter will avoid any computer brandsthat ships online at all costs no matter if this is a new or second notebook you are buying. Simply because you need to:-<br><br>1) test the notebook which you are going to take home for any configuration errors or adnormal behaviours.<br><br>2) check for dead pixels on the LCD screens as dead pixels will not occur over time. If its there, its there and if it happens to appear at the centre of the screen the display will look very bad.<br><br>3) if you want freebies you can check out roadshows and promotions. all OEMs have it one time or another and is not only limited to those that sells their hardware online only.<br><br>4) do not be tempted into believing that free upgrades of $650/ $1000 are available to you. always check for the upgrade details and conditions written before you buy the notebook. you may even doubt there are upgrades of up to $1000/- available at all.<br><br>5) last but not least be wary of notebooks that explodes.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What pipi has said should be noted. But do not reject online computer shops too fast - especially not a major manufacturer like Dell:<br><br>1) If the notebook arrives faulty (highly unlikely as the notebooks are tested before shipping) - Dell will ship a new one out to you in exchange or you can seek a refund - even mere dissatisfaction qualifies.<br><br>2) Regarding dead pixels - see (1) regarding dissatisfaction<br><br>3) Indeed roadshows give a number of freebies - Dell has none - they have no middleman. But Dell shapes their global supply and demand by fast changes in pricing - i.e. if they decide to run out Core Duos, they'll have a massive price reduction + cash off + free delivery + free memory upgrade + free hdd upgrade etc etc - if you miss out on this, too bad - these happen very quickly and you need to be monitoring the website - pricing changes usually occur every three days<br><br>4) Not every time will you get free upgrades of $650/$1000, but it has happened before, and it will happen again. Depends on your luck and timing. It really depends on whether Dell is hitting their projected sales figures - if they're not, they'll have massive reductions + free upgrades just to bump it up and meet their quarterly financial targets.<br><br>The last major run-out was when Core 2 Duos came out - Dell had massive sale - for the same price on the website now, you would have received a faster processer, more memory, larger hard drive, free anti-virus, free shipping + delivery (usually not free) + misc. freebies. That's how I got my laptop cheap. and Note: Core 2 Duo and Core Duos do not have major performance differences.<br><br>I expect the next run-out will be when the new Core 2 Duo platforms come out which will be next year.<br><br>5) Regarding notebook batteries, Dell has since switched suppliers - matter of fact, Sony was never Dell's only supplier. It really depends on your luck, your batch. In any case, Dell is not the only manufacturer affected by the recall, but as one of the largest selling manufacturers, they were definitely one of the worst hit.<br><br>6) Just because you buy online, does not mean you won't get warranty. There's an interesting difference. When my HP crapped out, I had to bring it to a service centre. When my Dell dvd drive crapped out, 2 technicians came to my house and resolved the issue.<br><br>But I must fairly point out, as I have earlier, Dell has HORRID CS. They are polite but absolutely incompetent. You will spend hours on the phone with them just trying to get them to understand your problem.<br><br>7) There is alot that can be gained both ways when you look at the different brands and their methods of delivery - you can gain immediate reliability (through your own affirmation of the quality when purchasing first hand), or you can gain huge savings (at the risk of initial quality being not there, albeit a very low one) - be objective and decide what best suits you.<br><br>--<br><br>With regards to what pipi said, I completely agree. It is entirely reasonable to purchase notebooks from shops. It really depends on what you want.<br><br>There is a major computer fair coming up soon - I don't know what (I'm not even in Singapore), that will be the best time to purchase, and negotiate for the brand name notebooks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Avoid online computer brands because<br><br>1) If the notebook arrives faulty (likely as the notebooks though are tested before shipping but are not tested for its entire lifespend), shipping a new one out to you in exchange means they will circulate the bad ones to the next customer who pick up the unit. A full refund is almost impossible if the flaw or defect on the notebook do not fit the manufacturer's terms and conditions.<br><br>2) Regarding dead pixels, if you get one you may still not be able to return because their policy may be 3 or more dead pixel before you can return.<br><br>3) Indeed roadshows give a number of freebies - online stores have none - they have no middleman but evens their profits by charging everything to tthe shipping costs. It will definitely be more expensive than your single trip cab fares. Online stores shapes their global supply and demand by fast changes in pricing - i.e. if they decide to run out Core Duos, they'll have a massive price reduction + cash off + free delivery + free memory upgrade + free hdd upgrade etc etc - if you miss out on this, too bad - these happen very quickly and you need to be monitoring the website - pricing changes usually occur every three days. but to wait for this to happen its like waiting for the blue moon to appear. if they decide to run out the core duo to pump in all the freebies, they will have to wait for the ram and hdd models and config to run out too because to put them in free costs money too. these are just gimmicks online stores put in to sell they recirculated fautly sub standard notebooks.<br><br>4) Not every time will you get free upgrades of $650/$1000, but it has happened before, and it will happen again. Depends on your luck and timing. It really depends on whether the online store is hitting their projected sales figures - if they're not, they'll have massive reductions + free upgrades just to bump it up and meet their quarterly financial targets. however, these are influnced by many factores including the market trends. so do youwant to wait until then before you can get to use a notebook or replace that old/ faulty unit you hav there on your lap?<br><br>The last major run-out was when Core 2 Duos came out - Dell had massive sale - for the same price on the website now, you would have received a faster processer, more memory, larger hard drive, free anti-virus, free shipping + delivery (usually not free) + misc. freebies. That's how someone got its laptop cheap. and Note: Core 2 Duo and Core Duos do not have major performance differences....well i will proof that once i got my hands on benchmarks tests and reviews and reports from ttrusted source or people.<br><br>I expect the next run-out will be when the new Core 2 Duo platforms come out which will be next year so please guys hand in there and support online stores.<br><br>5) Regarding notebook batteries, online stores have since switched suppliers - matter of fact, Sony was never the online store's only supplier. It really depends on your luck, your batch. In any case, the online store is not the only manufacturer affected by the recall, but as one of the largest selling manufacturers, they were definitely one of the worst hit. bad because of their returns now every other notebook manufacturers who hav good working batteries hav to return the batteries too for they fear that they will take the place of the manufacturer that sells what terrorists made.<br><br>6) Just because you buy online, does not mean you won't get warranty. but come to think of it all OEMs ffer warranties. There's an interesting difference. When my HP crapped out, I had to bring it to a service centre. When my Dell dvd drive crapped out, 2 technicians came to my house and resolved the issue. i guess the techicians must be too free with no jobs to do to ever be authorised to make a trip down to the client's location to servie a highly portable DVD drive...i guess it happens often so technicians hav to be on standby to make their customers happy in the event of DVD crapping out.<br><br>But I must fairly point out, as I have earlier, online stores has HORRID CS. They are polite but absolutely incompetent. You will spend hours on the phone with them just trying to get them to understand your problem because you never ask to speak with the techical guy instead u spoke to the sales representative. failing to understand they arrow their technicians down to look at the crappy DVD hot swappable drive.<br><br>7) There is alot that can be gained both ways when you look at the different brands and their methods of delivery - you can gain immediate reliability (through your own affirmation of the quality when purchasing first hand), or you can gain huge savings (at the risk of initial quality being not there, albeit a very low one) - be objective and decide what best suits you...oh what sh it i just worte...nevermind.<br><br>--<br><br>i really can't agree wif online stores....but its just me so you decide if things can actually be so sweet and dear in life.<br><br>There is a major computer fair coming up ..... oh who cares <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
