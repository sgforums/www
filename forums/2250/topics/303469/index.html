Frankly, I'm not so acquainted with a Mac OS. Looking at their current OS (Leopard), it does seem like programming in Mac is a whole lot easier, much more easier than in Linux or Windows, although both have RAD tools on developers hands. Perhaps it's the same on the iPhone.<br><br>Mac and Linux aren't really related, but they share the same base (both are derived from Unix).<br><br>If you use Linux, Apple shouldn't be too hard.<br><br>Pretty sure iPhone will lose the hype if consumers don't have the choice... Singaporeans just prefer choices than a lack of one. Unless there's going to be improvements over the phone, just like iPod, even if it's minor improvements.</div>
