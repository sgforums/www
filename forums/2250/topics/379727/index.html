              <p>Recently, the power on/off switch broke off from the two cables that are supposed to be connected to the switch.</p>
              <p>As such, I am now unable to turn off my PC (or if I did, would not be able to boot up the PC again). Any idea where I can go to fix this problem and how much the approximate cost would be?</p>

              <p>The solution may be as simple as opening the case and soldering the cables back to the appropriate terminals on the switch.</p>
              <p>If you're not daring enough to do that yourself, then you might just want to call a couple of computer shops and ask them to do it for you. It really shouldn't cost much to do so. Just make sure to ask for a quotation first.</p>

              <p>If I knew how much it would cost, I would have told you. I can only tell you that it shouldn't cost a lot if it just involves soldering a couple of wires, but then again, I'm not a computer techie.</p>
              <p>A soldering iron and solder would together cost not much more than $10 if you don't go for the higher-end models.</p>
              <p>But if you're not going to solder it yourself, and your warranty has already expired, then the only thing you really can do is to bring your CPU down to one of the computer repair shops at Sim Lim and to ask them for a quotation.</p>

              <p>As in the casing's power on off switch?</p>
              <p>Some info to make it clearer:<br><br>The switch is connected to a connection on the motherboard. The wire is connected to 2 pins on the motherboard. What the switch do is just to make a short in between the two pins. Or in other words, make electricity flow from the +ve to the -ve pin. And when electrical signal flows through, the pc will automatically turn on</p>
              <p>Thus, even if you have no switch, you just have to use a screw driver, short the 2 pins tgt, and the computer will turn on. You might have seen in computer shops when they test a motherboard, they just use a screw driver to touch and connect the 2 pin, and the fan starts spinning</p>
              <p>Computer shops will normally ask you to buy a casing for $50-60(as i dont think they sell the switch only), i don't remember what is the name of the kind of switch that is used on computer casings, maybe what you can do is to bring the switch down to a nearby hardware store and see if they have any of it</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Yes, to keep it simple, it is the cables being detached from the ON/OFF switch. There's nothing wrong with the other ends of the cables (ie. the ends joined to the motherboard).</p>
              <p>In short, what I have is the switch being detached from the cables and I'd need that soldered back. So in that regard, I am looking for someone able to do that. Cheers.</p>

              <p>where do you live @?</p>
              <p>How many cables are deteched from the ON/OFF switch?</p>
              <p>Actually for the time being what you can do is, to take the 2 wires from the switch, and short the ends together. this way, (in the same practice as the ignition of a car without it's keys) the computer will switch on.</p>
              <p>Any hardware store should sell a solder iron and soldering lead. it's pretty simple to solder like what the rest had said. a)just find the pt which the wire came out from, put the solder there, and while it melts (semi-liquidified state) put the wire back in.</p>
