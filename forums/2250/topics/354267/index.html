              <p>Recently, I installed the IE 8.</p>
              <p>The first thing that I notice is the fonts becomes smaller.</p>
              <p>Days later, my Mcafee Internet Security was hacked by someone.</p>
              <p>Now, I can see strips of black and white lines in the background of it.</p>
              <p>I can no longer download and install anti-virus update from Mcafee.</p>
              <p>When I tried to update it, the internet connection will cut off by itself.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, real time protection of Ad-aware is also being de-activated by the virus.</p>
              <p>I have tried reformat the hard disk but the problem just comes back again.</p>
              <p>Should not have installed IE 8. I found that the Mcafee Internet Security bar on IE</p>
              <p>sometinmes disappeared when IE 8 is being lauched.</p>
              <p>Is there other anyway I can eardicate the virus ? Must I have to buy a new hard-disk to</p>
              <p>solve the problem ?</p>
              <p>Thanks for any advice.</p>

              <p>Reformatted hard-disk already with full reformat (not quick reformat) using Windows XP Professional (SP3) disc.</p>
              <p>But when the anti-virus, firewall, internet security software are re-installed (installed without any internet connection to prevent softwares being infected), the virus is already back in the system ! It seems that the virus is being able to avoid being reformatted.</p>

              <p>IE 8 mistakenly blocks Adobe Flash Player.</p>
              <p>As a result, IE 8 will ask to install on almost every website visit to re-install Adobe Flash Player.</p>
