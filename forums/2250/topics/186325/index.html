The IP address assigned to him will be known, MAC address etc. But who exactly and the exact location of that user piggybacking on his network is rather impossible, unless the owner is very tech-savvy himself. And by that I mean, illegal ways to know.</div>

It's like going to macdonald to watch a show on a 21 inch tv when you could have watch it on a 42 inch tv at home.</div></blockquote>Half correct. You can disable broadcast SSID, MAC address, but if that particular SSID and MAC address is what the wardriver wants to trace, your router will still response. Anyway, wardriving is not about using bandwidth, it doesn't take up any bandwidth in fact. It just sends out request to your router, and your router will reply if it's there. Usually disabling of SSID and MAC address broadcasting would solve it, provided the wardriver didn't set a particular SSID and MAC address to find.</div>
