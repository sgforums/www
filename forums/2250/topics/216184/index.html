Some Antec LanBoy cases have strap-ons that allows the case to be slung over like a haversack or bag, or hand-carried like a suitcase. you should check out such cases.<br><br>back to the wieght there is nothing much we can say 'cept that the total weight of the hdds, boards and cards and Psu weighs just so and the better part of the difference lies on the case itself.</div>

Anyway f the intial one u recommended were intended and suits the mobo then it should be fine. as for the mobo i just check and downloaded the latest offer from Fuwell and it seems they spec out 'Abit KN9 Ultra NF570'. so if buyers who are interested may want to check out of its an Ultra or a SLi board prior to purchasing.</div>
