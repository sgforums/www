            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Blu-ray to sting HD-DVD</strong><br>Peter Familari<br>February 28, 2007 12:00am<br><br>AMERICA'S porn kings may decide who wins the biggest format stoush as the battle for the next-generation to replace DVDs heats up.<br><br>And this is the biggest battle since the Betamax VCR took on its rival VHS in the 1980s.<br><br>In January, anyone looking for a winner of the war between the two next-generation discs designed to replace DVD would have picked Blu-ray over the opposing HD-DVD format by a country mile.<br><br>The bet looked well-placed: the first two Blu-ray players, Samsung's BD-P1000 and Panasonic's BD10, along with a handful of GB BD movies, were in Australian stores in December.<br><br>HD-DVD movies were scarce and a player nowhere in sight.<br><br>Software support for Blu-ray is hefty. Every big Hollywood studio except Universal backs Blu-ray, and only a handful of labels are opting to press movies in both formats.<br><br>Blu-ray can also count on the hardware support of the world's highest-profile consumer electronics companies including Sony, Panasonic, Apple Computers, Pioneer, Philips, Samsung, Sharp, Dell, LG and Hitachi.<br><br>The HD-DVD camp includes Toshiba, Microsoft, GE, Kenwood, Canon, Onkyo, Teac, NEC and Mitsubishi.<br><br>But the clincher for Blu-ray is Sony's Blu-ray-equipped PS3.<br><br>The high-resolution gaming console is due out on March 23 and will be snapped up.<br><br>No wonder that last month it looked like a 3-0 to Blu-ray.<br><br>But just when it looked like being all over for HD-DVD two things happened.<br><br>Both prove why a month is a long time in the ever-shifting and often murky politics of consumer electronics.<br><br>The arrival of the HD-E1 -- Toshiba's first HD-DVD player -- in Australia -- in the middle of last month was the first.<br><br>The second occurred a week earlier at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, an event at which the adult industry holds a concurrent exhibition.<br><br>The whisper coming from LA got louder as the show went on.<br><br>Word was the $72 billion-a-year worldwide porn industry would use HD-DVD to maintain its 10 per cent share of an annual market of standard DVDs worth an estimated $30.3 billion.<br><br>The official reason was HD-DVD's lower cost of production.<br><br>Unofficially, it is Sony's longstanding and praiseworthy policy of disallowing its media to handle pornography.<br><br>The upshot is a Lazarus-like revival of HD-DVD.<br><br>But the smart money is still on Blu-ray. The format has the software and hardware firepower to see off HD-DVD, notwithstanding the latter's support from the adult industry.<br><br>In the long run, HD-DVD will survive only if the opposing camps agree to build dual-format machines.<br><br>It's a rerun of the recordable-DVD debacle all over again, when opposing groups publicly refused to build dual-format recorders.<br><br>The confused public bought neither.<br><br>In the end everyone caved in and nearly all DVD recorders read the -R and +R recorder formats.<br><br>Until the format issue is resolved, Toshiba is pressing on with HD-DVD and has finally released its first Australian high-definition player, the $1099 HD-E1.<br><br>The HD-E1 was meant to arrive before December, but after a frustrating number of false starts Australia's first HD-DVD player has finally arrived.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why worry..... let both Blu-Ray and HD DvD kill each other 1st, then see who the winner lah. Most if not all of us <strong>don't</strong> have a HDTV at home anyway..... And still, most player and HDTV can't display at 1080P...... by the time MediaCorp or Cable TV offer all HD channel, it will be at least 3-5 years from now..... HDTV price will fall to rock bottom..... with better model some more. S<br><br>So, just wait for few more years lah..... no hurry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In truth, there is no necessity for such high definition TV. Who the fark can see the difference.<br><br>The personal electronics industry just wants to introduce a new technology as they have reached the upper limit in selling DVD players. They just want a new adoption to increase profits.<br><br>Same thing as Vista, MS needs to force upgrades in order to push revenues up.<br><br>Best thing of all, I see alot of giam kana singaporeans buy expensive widescreen TV, fancy dvd player, then buy pirated DVD. Pirated DVD quality like sh*t like that, play on this kind of device also waste money.</div>
