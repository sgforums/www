It's via Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Activate Windows. If you don't, after 30 days, Windows will turn into a limited version. For what I don't know.<br><br>Civil rights advocates have nothing to say on this, but I'm pretty sure it irritated lots of privacy advocates. Firstly, this whole thing is automatic. Whether you like it or not. Windows dial back regularly to their own website to check for updates. For those with firewall, it's easy to tell. Your firewall will keep prompting you about some programs trying to access the Net.<br><br>Secondly, I've found out by chance that fooling around with Windows settings doesn't stop that communication.<br><br>Lastly, the automatic update feature is turned on by default. And you can't turn it off if you wish to update Windows.<br><br>As for Linux, if you are using popular distributions like Red Hat, Ubuntu, Mandrake, PC FreeBSD and Debian, they will install the drivers automatically. I've used PC FreeBSD. The drivers are loaded automatically. There are some bugs with their networking though. I had some problems configuring the modem settings and still has not get it settled yet. PC FreeBSD also has a nice GUI interface, and nicer than Windows too. And even more games than Windows to entertain the bored people.<br><br>If you use PC FreeBSD just for basic stuffs like doing school work, playing games, then you will have no problems migrating to it. If you are those who want to tweak here and there, then there are some problems. Linux commands and Windows commands are very different, and changing the wrong file is like Windows, reformat and reinstall next!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For those who are interested, here are two links to visit:<br><br><a href="http://distrowatch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://distrowatch.com/</a><br><a href="http://www.linux.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.linux.org/</a><br><br>linux.org seems to be down at the moment, I can't get in. linux.org is best for newbies to Linux.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Vista PCs to lock out rogue software </strong><br><br>Joris Evers<br>CNET News.com<br>October 06, 2006, 09:40 BST<br><br>As part of Microsoft's 'Software Protection Platform', people will be shut out of their PCs if the OS isn't activated soon after installation<br><br>Windows Vista will have new antipiracy technology that locks people out of their PCs if the operating system isn't activated within 30 days after installation.<br><br>If Vista is not activated with a legitimate product registration key in time, the system will run in "reduced functionality mode" until it is activated, said Thomas Lindeman, a senior product manager at Microsoft. In this mode, people will be able to use a Web browser for up to an hour, after which time the system will log them out, he said.<br><br>The new technology is part of Microsoft's new "Software Protection Platform", which the company plans to announce on Wednesday. It will be part of future versions of all Microsoft products, but debuts in Windows Vista and Windows Server "Longhorn", said Cori Hartje, director of Microsoft's Windows Genuine Software Initiative. Vista, the successor to Windows XP, is slated to be broadly available in January.<br><br>Microsoft has escalated its battle with software pirates during the past two years through the "Genuine Advantage" add-ons for Windows and Office, its biggest cash cows. The company is now expanding its push by baking antipiracy features into its new products and taking more drastic action when it finds that a product was illegitimately acquired.<br><br>Many users shouldn't be confronted by Vista's antipiracy technology, however. People who buy a PC with Vista installed from companies such as Dell, HP and Gateway, for example, should find the operating system activated already.<br><br>"Everything is going to be good to go right out of the box," Hartje said. "This is more for those who install after the fact."<br><br>Those who install Vista themselves, for example on existing PCs, will have a 30-day period to activate the operating system and validate with Microsoft that they have a legitimate licence. "During those 30 days, you get warning messages, it counts down. During the last three days they get very frequent," Lindeman said.<br><br>If ignored, after 30 days Vista will display four options. The first will allow the user to activate online, the second is to run in reduced functionality mode, the third is to enter a product key and the fourth displays instructions to activate by phone, Lindeman said.<br><br>"In reduced functionality mode, we will let you use your browser for periods of up to an hour before we log you off," Lindeman said.<br><br>Barring people from using their PC is a significant change from the antipiracy features that Microsoft bolted on to Windows XP with Windows Genuine Advantage. In XP, the piracy-busting features only put a block on downloading additional programs from Microsoft's Web sites.<br><br>Windows XP also included product activation, but people could still use their machine in "safe mode" if the operating system was not activated. Moreover, no activation was required if a volume licence key was used, the most popular way of pirating Windows. Starting with Vista, Microsoft will no longer give out those types of licence keys, which are typically used by larger organisations.<br><br>"Piracy is one of the most significant problems facing the software industry," Hartje said. More than a third of all software installed last year was pirated or unlicensed, she said, citing figures from the Business Software Alliance, a software industry group.<br><br>Microsoft will continue to check if Vista was legitimately acquired, even after activation. This happens, for example, when downloading additional Microsoft programs. Should a licence key be deemed illegitimate, the user will be given another 30-day grace period to acquire a legitimate licence key, Microsoft said.<br><br>During this grace period warnings will be displayed and Vista will block access to the Windows Defender antispyware tool, ReadyBoost memory expansion feature and Aero advanced graphics option, Microsoft said. Also, a persistent text will display in the lower right hand of the screen: "This copy of Windows is not genuine."<br><br>If Vista is not validated after the 30 days, the user will again be locked out.<br><br>As part of the increased effort to make it harder to pirate its products, Microsoft is also changing the way businesses license its software. New licensing systems will replace the current volume licence keys, which have been widely abused, Hartje said. "Fifty percent of the piracy, we think, uses keys issued to volume licensing customers," she said.<br><br>Volume licence keys are registration codes for products that Microsoft gives out to large organisations in plain text. One key can be used to activate and run an unlimited number of copies of the product, for example Windows XP or Office XP.<br><br>Starting with Vista, Microsoft will offer two different types of keys and offer three different ways to distribute them within an organisation. In all cases, some more work will be required on the part of the technology department at a company.<br><br>"They will just need to do a little extra planning," Hartje said.<br><br>The first type of product key to replace the current system is called "multiple activation key," or MAK. An IT pro at a company can install a key on a machine that will then need to be validated online. Alternatively a proxy can be set up centrally to activate multiple systems at once, according to Microsoft.<br><br>The second licensing option is called "key management service", or KMS. This requires the organisation to set up a KMS service on the corporate network that will activate client machines. The Vista PCs will silently find the KMS service and activate, according to Microsoft.<br><br>It may seem as though businesses will have to count all their licences, but it's really not as bad as it sounds, said Michael Silver, an analyst with Gartner.<br><br>"It has nothing to do with licence counting right now, but companies will need to expend time and effort and some money to administer this, in the name of helping Microsoft recoup revenue lost to piracy," he said. "There needs to be more of a benefit [for customers]. Linux and Mac communities will try to make hay with this, but this will not be the tipping point."<br><br><strong>This is the specific details on the logging off of VISTA, all please read carefully. </strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
