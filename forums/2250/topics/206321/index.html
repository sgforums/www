It will run across a 1066MHz frontside bus. If Intel runs true to form, it will be priced at $999. But with AMD's rival 4x4 platform, which is due to ship later this year for what AMD staff has said will be "substantially" under $1,000, Intel may choose to price it lower.<br><br>The existing Core 2 Extreme X6800 will continue to be made available through Q1 2007, but it may be replaced in Q2 2007.

The board has four memory slots capable of holding up to 8GB of 667MHz DDR 2 SDRAM. The 963 is an integrated chipset, so the board has its own GMA 3000 graphics engine. There are but three PCI Express x1 slots and three old-style PCI slots.<br><br>...the board has Gigabit Ethernet courtesy of one of the company's own 82566DC controller chips, and 5.1-channel audio, driven by a SigmaTel STAC9227 codec. <span style="color: red;">The board has ten USB 2.0 ports, four SATA interfaces and a single parallel ATA interface</span>. There are the usual legacy ports too.

The total is split down the middle between desktop and notebook CPUs, and represents Dell's demand through to the end of the year.<br><br>The desktop figure comes from Bank of America, which last week told investors it believes the PC giant has requested 1-1.2m desktop processors and a further 800,000 mobile chips. Soon after, Citigroup Research said it believes Dell has ordered the best part of 2m notebook processors alone.<br><br>The Citigroup reports points to AMD-based Dell notebooks arriving in September, with the first two models being joined by two more in October, doubling shipments to 400,000-600,000 a month for October, November and December.<br><br>The upshot: Dell will have shipped 1.2-1.8m AMD-based notebooks in Q4, and 1.4-2.0m for the year as a whole - ie. Q4 plus September. However many AMD-based notebooks Dell ships, half of them will be new sales for AMD, the rest will be balanced by reduced sales to AMD's other customers, the researcher forecast.<br><br>The new sales will push AMD's mobile processor shipment up 30 per cent quarter on quarter, Citigroup predicted.<br><br><a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/08/21/dell_amd_pc_shipments_2006/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/08/21/dell_amd_pc_shipments_2006/</a><span class="small"></span><br><br><strong><span class="large">Infineon blags big RFID US passport deal </span></strong><br><br>Data transfer safe, firm reckons<br><br>By INQUIRER staff: Monday 21 August 2006, 09:32<br><br><span style="color: red;">GERMAN FIRM Infineon said that the US government has given it a multi million dollar deal to produce ID chips for use in domestic passports</span>.<br>The passports will contain a chip with shielding which contains an encrypted version of a human's name, date of birth, photo and the validity period of the passport.<br><br>All new passports issued by the end of the year will be electronic passports, said Infineon, which is also supplying similar technology to other countries. All countries part of the US visa waiver programme must issue passports using secure chip tech by October this year.<br><br>Data transmission is 10 centimetres, and the chips include Basic Access Control (BAC) which lets immigration officers pass the passport over an electronic scanner. Infineon claims the active protective shields on the chip's surface and sensors "help prevent" crooks and passport blaggers from reading the data.<br><br><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33810" rel="nofollow">http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33810</a></div>
