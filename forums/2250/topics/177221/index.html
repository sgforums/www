            <div class='col-md body'>A <strong>fractal</strong> is a geometric object which is rough or irregular on all scales of length, and therefore appears to be 'broken up' in a radical way. Fractals can be most simply defined as images that can be divided into parts, each of which is similar to the original object. Fractals are said to possess infinite detail, and some of them have a self-similar structure that occurs at different scales, or levels of magnification. In many cases, a fractal can be generated by a repeating pattern, in a typically recursive or iterative process. The term fractal was coined in 1975 by BenoÃ®t Mandelbrot, from the Latin fractus or "broken". Before Mandelbrot coined his term, the common name for such structures (the Koch snowflake, for example) was monster curve.<br><br>Fractals of many kinds were originally studied as mathematical objects. Fractal geometry is the branch of mathematics which studies the properties and behavior of fractals. It describes many situations which cannot be explained easily by classical geometry, and has often been applied in science, technology, and computer-generated art. The conceptual roots of fractals can be traced to attempts to measure the size of objects for which traditional definitions based on Euclidean geometry or calculus fail.<br><br>for more info, pls refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractals" rel="nofollow">wiki</a><br><br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:tKKmFidOGwYt_M:www.phidelity.com/ph2/photos/fractals/dragonFire2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:TyXYZg5mA2iZTM:www.mccallie.org/myates/Fractal/images/mad%2520clown%2520with%2520legs.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:UAaN0ygHBnfwpM:www.uzcreations.com/images/graphics/fractals/uzc_frax_03.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:t1z0ohpqqnTw4M:www.infinitee-designs.com/Graphics/LgPix/Fractals/FractalThumbs/frac5T.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:3ryo4GkqUwJPdM:www.piglette.com/fractals/octopus.jpg"></div>

IT is never an isolated field, but rather, it is a field that helps to solve myriad types of real life problems.<br><br>being showy of my knowledge is my last thought. in fact, i dun know many uncountable things, worse still, i dun even know what i dun know. my perspective is that knowledge should be like blood, i.e., it must be allowed to flow. i thought it might be interesting to some of you to share what i know abt fractals and i also hv benefitted personally from knowledge that are shared by other fellow forumites too. as a matter of fact, i thought i know a lot about fractals, but when i finished reading the complete wiki page, i realised there are other missing pieces that i dun know, so i know what i dun know now. we live in an information overload era and we only hv 24hrs a day, so we hv to depend on frens to learn new knowledge.<br><br>(of course, i can understand the benefit of classifying fields into their respective names and jargons. it faciliates communication and focus.)</div>

IT is never an isolated field, but rather, it is a field that helps to solve myriad types of real life problems.<br><br>being showy of my knowledge is my last thought. in fact, i dun know many uncountable things, worse still, i dun even know what i dun know. my perspective is that knowledge should be like blood, i.e., it must be allowed to flow. i thought it might be interesting to some of you to share what i know abt fractals and i also hv benefitted personally from knowledge that are shared by other fellow forumites too. as a matter of fact, i thought i know a lot about fractals, but when i finished reading the complete wiki page, i realised there are other missing pieces that i dun know, so i know what i dun know now. we live in an information overload era and we only hv 24hrs a day, so we hv to depend on frens to learn new knowledge.<br><br>(of course, i can understand the benefit of classifying fields into their respective names and jargons. it faciliates communication and focus.)</div></blockquote>Haha, I know that. I was making fun of you. But seriously, it is too chim for those tech guys here. They need understand some things first. Going straight into chaos and order to explain fractuals is very hasty.<br><br>Edit: Don't need to go too deep. Just make this place fun, if not too serious liao people will go away.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
