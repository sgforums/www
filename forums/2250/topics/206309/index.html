            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Conspiracy theory hatches on Dell Sony battery recall </strong><br><br>The new face of DRM?<br><br>By Charlie Demerjian: Monday 21 August 2006, 05:48<br><br>THE WHOLE EXPLODING battery thing from Dell and Sony has been extremely misunderstood. People think it is a manufacturing defect, a freak accident, or other not planned mishap. We are here to tell you that can't be farther from the truth, it was planned, completely, and has far reaching ulterior motives(1).<br>The batteries that exploded are in a series of Dell notebooks, you can see the list here, are manufactured by Sony, and are <span style="color: red;">code named 'Golden Shower'</span>, or so a mole tells us. <span style="color: red;">This is not an accidental thing, it is a plan by MS, Sony and Dell to enforce DRM for the RIAA,</span> and we hear rumors that it is also compatible with the VIIV DRM infection, but no hard evidence has surfaced for that.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Most people don't realise it, but almost all laptops have a very sophisticated system controller in place of the normal keyboard controller. It basically controls most of the laptop's functions that are not keyboard related, all the buttons, widgets, and in most cases, the charging and care of the battery.</span><br><br>So, with all the pieces in place, the DRM mafia sprung into action. The RIAA supplied a list of random characters they felt infringed on their ability to siphon money from the unsuspecting, along with a bunch of programs that they also felt lessened their ability to control everything while sustaining their dead end business model.<br><br>The baton was passed to Sony who supplied the 'Golden Showers', a truly bang up job, engineered with a fiery passion. Willing Pawn was picked as the widest distribution channel, and the first one to dip their toes in this DRM based conflagration.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Strangely, we are told by moles deep inside Fortress Redmond that it took just four lines of IC2 controller code to set this off. Testing produced truly explosive results, and the game was on. Seed the packages to the masses, ironically with their own money paying for it, then one day, release the detonation DRM code.</span><br>From there on out, watch the pirates burn, and we mean burn. The problem of pirates removing DRM and only legit customers charring was considered a minor issue, the rootkit DRM infection was all the proof they needed for this. Sit back and watch them fry.<br><br>Basically, this whole battery scheme is not an accident, it is a grand conspiracy. When the RIAA does not feel you are paying them enough, and you have the gall to play your music on your computer without paying them more, ker-blammo. Golden Showers, Willing Pawns and DRM infections all tie in to an explosive finish.<br><br>The only problem is they got caught before all the pirate scum were eliminated, but as usual, the RIAA got off without so much as a slap on the wrist. Sony is again denying everything, and Dell lives up to it's code name. The shadow government in the northwest wasn't implicated, so they win too, but then again, if they were caught, freedom is only a campaign contribution away.
