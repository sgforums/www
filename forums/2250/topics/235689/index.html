            <div class='col-md body'>The <strong>Slingbox</strong> is a TV streaming device that enables consumers to remotely view their cable, satellite, or personal video recorder (PVR) programming from an Internet-enabled computer with a broadband Internet connection. It is produced by Sling Media, Inc of San Mateo, California.<br><br>How the Slingbox works<br><br>The Slingbox can redirect up to four live TV streams from a cable box, satellite receiver, or PVR to the viewer's PC located anywhere in the home or, when using a broadband Internet connection, anywhere in the world. For copyright reasons, only one user can access the signal from a Slingbox at a time. This way of accessing content is known as placeshifting.<br><br>The Slingbox connects a standard-definition TV source (via coaxial cable, S-video, or composite cabling) to an existing Internet connection (Slingbox Pro supports high definition TV). Personal video recorders and cable or satellite set top boxes can be controlled through a separate infrared (IR) cable that lets users change channels from the remote location. Software on a user's PC connects to the Slingbox and provides the user interface for viewing the video stream and changing channels.<br><br>Sling Player Software<br><br>Sling Media released the latest version of the Sling Player for Windows on December 22, 2006. Version 1.4 (technically 1.4.0.206) included a new theme to go with the other 3 previously included themes. This theme still works on the 1st generation "candy bar" Slingbox despite being designed for the new generation boxes.<br><br>Sling Media released a Windows Mobile version of their player on April 26, 2006 which allows users to stream their video over PDAs and smartphones. A high-definition-compatible version of the Slingbox was announced in September 2006.<br><br>Sling Media announced a Mac OS X port of the SlingPlayer at the January 2006 Macworld Conference and Expo with a promised release date of Q2 2006. The release was later delayed to Q3 2006, and then again to Q4 2006, leading to allegations that Sling Media was promoting vaporware. In September 2006, Sling Media began selling new Slingbox hardware in packages that had the official Mac OS X logo on the outside, indicating support for the Macintosh platform even though the Mac OS X port of the player software was still not available. Sling Media released the first public beta of their player for Mac OS X on October 31, 2006.<br><br>A Palm OS client has also been announced and is expected to be available on Q1 Â‘07.<br><br>Players for Nokia N73 and Sony Ericsson W950, and unlimited, free access are available as part of the X-Series from 3 in the UK, Sweden, Italy, Austria, Australia and Hong Kong.<br><br>During the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show the company announced a future feature known as Clip+Sling that allows users to share clips of their favorite TV shows with each other through a hosted Web service. The announcement was made during Les Moonves' keynote.<br><br>Versions<br><br>* Slingbox TUNER<br>* Slingbox AV<br>* Slingbox PRO<br>* Slingbox- discontinued<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Slingbox_front_view.jpg/300px-Slingbox_front_view.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://www.slingmedia.com" rel="nofollow">Visit Sling Media website</a></div>
