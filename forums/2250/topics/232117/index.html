            <div class='col-md body'><strong>US man badly burned by self-combusting cell phoneMobile provokes serious fire</strong><br><br>By Lester Haines<br>Published Tuesday 16th January 2007 14:31 GMT<br><br>A US man has been badly burned in a fire resulting from a spontaneously-combusting mobile phone, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.<br><br>Fifty-nine-year-old Luis Picaso, of Vallejo, California, who had been sleeping in his house on a white plastic lawn chair last Saturday night, was rudely awoken by a fire which melted the plastic chair, ignited his "polyester-blend slacks" and nylon soccer jersey and caused "second and third-degree burns across at least half his body".<br><br>When the emergency services arrived shortly before midnight, they found Picaso lying on the bathroom floor. His condition was described yesterday as "stable".<br><br>Vallejo Fire Department investigator and spokesman Bill Tweedy explained how Picaso's synthetic clothes had contributed to his injuries: "Cotton holds up the best. The only thing he had on that was cotton was his underwear. Everywhere the nylon was, that's where he got burns."<br><br>Tweedy confirmed that "from the burn patterns on Picaso's clothes and body, it was clear the fire began in the right front pocket of his polyester-blend slacks". He elaborated: "There were no matches. There were no lighters. He wasn't smoking. The only source was the phone that was in his pocket. I know he didn't spontaneously combust."<br><br><strong>Tweedy did not specify the mobile phone in question. He offered: "I don't believe it's a problem with any particular cell phone maker. It's a piece of electrical equipment. All electrical equipment can have a malfunction. This is a freak accident...It could be any brand of phone that could do that." </strong><br><br><strong>Nope, the handphone brand is not specified.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong><br><br></div>
