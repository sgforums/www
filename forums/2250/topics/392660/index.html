              <p>Just wondering what's the main different between SMU Bachelor of Science (IS Management) and SIM-Wollongong Bachelor of Computer Science (Digital Systems Security)?</p>
              <p>Each of these degree aims to produce what type of students?</p>
              <p>From what I see and feel of the programme structure for both, SIM-Wollongong might be more into the software engineering (programming) side whereas SMU is more on business IT management but still teaches u the skills to do software engineering.</p>
              <p>If I want to become a software engineer which do you think I should choose? Based on what you will learn and the skills/knowledge you will obtain, SMU or SIM?</p>
              <p>If based on the eyes of the employer in Singapore, a degree from SMU seems to be more, maybe, desirable than SIM or both are almost equally undesirable compared to NUS and NTU?</p>

              <p>I am not familar with the differences between the 2 courses but I have 2 SIM-Wollongong graduates behind me right now working as software engineers.</p>
              <p>my gut feel is that whenever IT is combined with business...business usually will have higher coverage than IT....making them technically weaker than those who come from pure IT background...that said...it doesnt mean these people cannot catch up with the programming...they just need time.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
              <p>I've actually have made up my mind to take up SIM-Wollongong - Computer Science since that is what I want and not SMU - IS Management which is from what I see a mixture of business IT management and software engineering.</p>
              <p>My friend asked me how marketable is SIM-Wollongong compared to SMU in the first place, if not isn't it wasting time and money, this is when I'm kind of hestitated. He's going for SMU btw.</p>
              <p>Currently, I'm waiting to be graduated from poly and going to NS after that. Been studying IT-Security Management for 3 years and it's not IT programming-focused, therefore I decided to get into computer science to get the skills I need to become a software engineer.</p>
