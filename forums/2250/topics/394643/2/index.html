              <p>Hmm, for PSU and casing i learnt mine more from experiences, when buying PSUs look at the side of the box and look how many amperes it can take, on which rail.</p>
              <p>Since Power = Voltage x Current, and Power is measured in watts, voltage in volts and current in ampere( written in I),</p>
              <p>we can say Power = V x I</p>
              <p>And then look at the powersupply boxes(multiple rail for this eg) and see which one 12v rail can take how much current, since 12v is a constant, it is up to current, lets say the 12v rail can take 18 amps max, using P=VxI, we get P=12 x 18, giving 216watts MAX on that rail. and see how many rails the psu have</p>
              <p>so u can do a bit of calculation and see if the box is crapping or is real when they say 450watts max* or 1000watts max.( This is like the cheap audio system which writes 5000watts PMPO, what we want is Root Means Square value, which can be calculated by dividing the peak value by root 2) The calculation may not be accurate because there are still other factors which are not considered</p>
              <p>And depending on how your system is configured , you can consider whether you want a multiple rail or single rail PSU</p>
              <p>Watts is one thing, and how clean is the power produced is another, cheap power supply may produce 500watts, but the dc voltage(which ideally should be either one straight line of power or no power, but impposible in real life) they produce may have more ripple(because they are stepped down and converted from AC) than a better quality 500watts, which have more capacitor to filter them</p>
              <p>Casing also learnt from experience, some casing  which look perfectly normal, but uses metal of poor quality, and you can actually 'flex' the casing. Then i dont sell this to customers who use graphics card which are heavy,as if u accidentlykick the PC, the casing will 'flex', and when taht happens parts connected via PCI and secured to the casing will 'move' along which leads to not so good contact point at the pci slots, and comp will crash.</p>
              <p> You know pci slots cards all have an L shape which allows you to secure by a screw to your casing. When inserting you need to fit the end of the longer side of the "L" shape metal piece into the casing, and some casings do not have a cutting large enough at the end to fit the whole card in, and you need to dig it wider with a screwdriver</p>
              <p>But then some casing looks small, but they take into consideration tat u use big cards, so they actually cut away the 5.25 or 3.5 inch bay to make room</p>
              <p>some also have crappily drilled motherboard stand off holes which you need to use a spanner and forcfully turn that stand off in, but that is rare cases and mostly happen on cheaper casings</p>

              <p>The 128-bit cards are in the low price range because they are CHEAPER to make. And the games don't care if it's 128-bit or 256-bit. As long as there's enough bandwidth, they don't care. As long as the memory can keep the GPU fed (Which should not be a problem), it's fine. 5750 = 4850. Looking at memory speeds and accounting for GDDR5's QDR, both cards have the same memory bandwidth, and the 4850 was never straved for bandwidth unless overclocked to 4870 speeds, in which case the lack of faster memory took it's toll. I overclocked the memory on my 4850 from 993 to 1100MHz and never got a FPS boost.</p>

              <p>Yes, that is true, though in the case of a 5750, the memory bandwidth is high enough to keep up with the 4850's bandwidth. The bandwidth issue is only a problem for the 5770, where it has half the bandwidth of the part it was supposed to replace, the 4890. In graphics intensive applications:</p>
              <p>GPU has the most important role. Memory bus has to keep up, yes, but it isn't THAT important in graphics-intensive apps. Take Crysis for example. The 5770 loses a few FPS due to it only having half the bandwidth. But again, it's only a few. The human eye will not notice it unless you intend to play Crysis at 1600p. Then that's a problem.</p>
              <p>Memory constraints hurt more in COMPUTATIONAL apps, not graphics.</p>

              <p>Ah, AMD Stream.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are few programs that run AMD Stream, but I can use for NVidia's CUDA.</p>
              <p>I have a 9500GS. Card sucks, memory bandwidth sucks more. I used Badaboom to test out my overclocks (Once deemed stable) and just by overclocking the memory to its limits (DDR2 @ 1200MHz) I gained quite a fair bit of speed. Cut transcoding time by about half a minute, which I deem pretty good for a sucky ass card. Other computational apps?</p>
              <p>Folding @ Home. I have both a CUDA and a Stream version. Using the CUDA version on said 9500GS, I managed to accomplish more "tasks" overnight with OC'ed memory than without.</p>
              <p>But gaming? Nah. Sucky ass card couldn't keep up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For NVidia, overclocking core speed by 6% won't really give you a 6% increase in speed. Maybe 2%? But overclocking shaders will give you the biggest increase. 6% OC might net you 5% boost?</p>
              <p>AMD locks both the core and shader speeds of their Radeon cards. So you increase both.</p>
