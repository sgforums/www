            <div class='col-md body'><p>what flaws you mentioning? <br>anyway, about the internet, compared to the motorola router used by starhub, singtel's white router penetration is much poorer. 2 walls and 4 meters away, the signal strength is 2/5 only. but overall, ok la.. download speed is reasonable.<br><br>mio comes with internet, mio TV and house telephone. extra discounts for handphone lines also. but if u dont want to watch their TV.. no point getting mio plan</p></div>

              <p>Yes, Mio Tv is using your internet connection to communicate with their server. In other words. If you are streaming contents on your mio tv. Your internet might suffer abit. If you are downloading your mio tv might suffer abit. So either way 1 device is suffering. </p>
              <p>But why?</p>
              <p>Cause Singtel Mio doesn't have a connection like what starhub does with their socket. So Singtel has no choice but to use internet connection to communicate. </p>

              <p>I am using Mio. Only internet and mobile and home</p>
              <p>Problems i encounter before:<br><br>- Microfilter by 2wire is sometimes faulty, which will either cause modem to disconnect, which lead to no phone, even in emergency. Reason is because mio voice is using Voice over internet protocol(voip), and the phone is connected into the modem. Thus, no modem, no phone.</p>
              <p>- 2wire modem does not save your login username and password, it seems to be the router's problem, singnet changed the router for free</p>
              <p>- People calling my home, but phone does not ring(i duno why either)</p>
              <p>Before i change to mio 4 years back, im on singnet broadband, 3mbps, no problems at all. But when i started to use mio 2 years ago, and maybe at that time the adsl2+ or voip technology is not that stable on the modem, it caused me to have a lot of problem with my house phone when my uncles and aunties call my house phone to look for my mum(you know they prefer house phone over handphone). If you use ur handphone more then it is fine</p>
              <p>I used mio tv 2-3years ago, not very satisfied. It seems that your TV
              will hang when u are using internet at the same time. Not sure how good
              it is now.</p>
              <p>Now im on mio 8mbps(internet and mobile+house phone only, no tv all those), things seems to have stablise a lot from the past recent years, maybe some rare hiccups here and there. Singnet has been very nice to me for tech support all these years. It is worth getting singnet in my opinion.</p>
              <p>The only thing i think is 'special' is that if you get the mio plan with handphone, is that if someone calls your house phone and u didnt pick up(either becos u were sleeping, or because  the modem is giving problems, screw ups etc...) it will give u a sms alert to your mio plan mobile phone</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am using Mio. Only internet and mobile and home</p>
              <p>Problems i encounter before:<br> <br> - Microfilter by 2wire is sometimes faulty, which will either cause
              modem to disconnect, which lead to no phone, even in emergency.
              Reason is because mio voice is using Voice over internet
              protocol(voip), and the phone is connected into the modem. Thus, no
              modem, no phone.</p>
              <p>- 2wire modem does not save your login username and password, it
              seems to be the router's problem, singnet changed the router for
              free</p>
              <p>- People calling my home, but phone does not ring(i duno why
              either)</p>
              <p>Before i change to mio 4 years back, im on singnet broadband,
              3mbps, no problems at all. But when i started to use mio 2 years
              ago, and maybe at that time the adsl2+ or voip technology is not
              that stable on the modem, it caused me to have a lot of problem
              with my house phone when my uncles and aunties call my house phone
              to look for my mum(you know they prefer house phone over
              handphone). If you use ur handphone more then it is fine</p>
              <p>I used mio tv 2-3years ago, not very satisfied. It seems that
              your TV will hang when u are using internet at the same time. Not
              sure how good it is now.</p>
              <p>Now im on mio 8mbps(internet and mobile+house phone only, no tv
              all those), things seems to have stablise a lot from the past
              recent years, maybe some rare hiccups here and there. Singnet has
              been very nice to me for tech support all these years. It is worth
              getting singnet in my opinion.</p>
              <p>The only thing i think is 'special' is that if you get the mio
              plan with handphone, is that if someone calls your house phone and
              u didnt pick up(either becos u were sleeping, or because  the
              modem is giving problems, screw ups etc...) it will give u a sms
              alert to your mio plan mobile phone</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">I have both Starhub and Mio TV.
              I will primarily be on Starhub cable so I turn Mio TV STB off all the
              time. To start up the box takes forever. And I've never gotten it to
              start up in the first attempt. It takes about 2 or 3 times not to
              mention the crappy video quality. I wonder if they even conform to
              broadcast video standards. </span></p>
