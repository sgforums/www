            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i've a problem dunno if any1 here can help or not.<br><br>The thing is i've 2 harddisk on my comp Master &amp; Slave. Mas 160G Sla 80G. I took out the slave and change it into the Master and load the OS Xp home onto it.<br><br>Every thing is fine only thing is i realise now that my 80G Master has become only 30G cos i didnt delete or format away the files that were in there as i thought when i re-install OS, everything will be gone. I am using a Hp recovery so i don't see any blue screen for me to select options.<br><br>The problem now is my HD shows only 30+G and a partition of 5G was set aside for a system recovery cos i am using a recovery CD. But the other 40+ Gb of HD space seems to have gone.<br><br>Anyone know how to solve this problem? like remove the partition, or where do you go to re-format a HD? and what do you need to type. I dont mind cleaning every thing away on my 80G and start again.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why did you set the jumper of the 80gb slave drive to master? I assume that your computer must have 2 IDE connector and it is always advisable to connect (when you are using 2 hard disks) them on a separate channel (i.e separate connectors). Maybe you connect them on a separate channel but are there other devices on that channel when you set the 80gb slave drive to master? If so that device has to be set to slave at least.<br><br>You can try setting back the jumpers to the original settings for all hardwares, boot from the 160gb master drive and format the 80gb slave drive if you can afford to loose the data stored there. Right click on the 80gb drive letter and chose 'format'.<br><br>Try that first and report. If you have been using other partitioning softwares you may need the rescue diskettes to access that partition before you can delete it.</div>

Boot from the only physical drive you have after the disconnection of other physical drives and get your system to boot from the CD-rom. Insert whatever reliable OS dics you have and format it.

The thing is i'm using a Hp recovery disk, i dont see any blue screen. i never use any software to partition it, the recovery CD did it by itself.

I know coz most probably you are booting from the 160gb hdd now using the OS on the 160gb hdd and viewing at the 80gb hdd as another drive letter/ letters.<br><br>Like i said whatever it is, shut down your PC, remove the IDE ribbon cable and power cable of your 160GB drive to force your computer to boot from the 80gb drive then use the OS disc to format your 80gb drive by deleting all the partitions in that 80gb drive.<br><br>Can try that?</div>

When you start up your pc there will be a moment of flashing of the computer make and specs, press F8 or Ctrl+Alt+Del continuously to get the computer to go into boot up settings instead of Windows.<br><br>At the booting devices section move the CD-rom up to 'first boot deivce' before accepting the changes and continue with the startup process. Shut down the pc again and restart. Now open your cd-rom or whatever optical drive you have and put you OS disc in quick. When the OS disc is read before the system goes into windows, formatting or partition modification options is open and you will see your blu screen.<br><br>Try that.</div>

Hope it works, i was getting tired and wanted to try something else or anything, even thought of doing it with a windows 98 start-up disk. You know, the Fdisk way then clear away the partition and format then off. Then start again with the Hp recovery CD (Windows Xp home) OS in the CD-rom dont know can or not.</div>
