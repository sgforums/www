              </span></p><p>An insidious computer virus
              recently discovered on digital photo frames has been identified as a
              powerful new Trojan Horse from China that collects passwords for online
              games - and its designers might have larger targets in mind.</p>
              <p>"It is a nasty worm that has a great deal of intelligence," said
              Brian Grayek, who heads product development at Computer Associates, a
              security vendor that analyzed the Trojan Horse.</p>
              <p>The virus, which Computer Associates calls Mocmex, recognizes and
              blocks antivirus protection from more than 100 security vendors, as
              well as the security and firewall built into Microsoft Windows. It
              downloads files from remote locations and hides files, which it names
              randomly, on any PC it infects, making itself very difficult to remove.
              It spreads by hiding itself on photo frames and any other portable
              storage device that happens to be plugged into an infected PC.</p>
              <p>The authors of the new Trojan Horse are well-funded professionals
              whose malware has "specific designs to capture something and not leave
              traces," Grayek said. "This would be a nuclear bomb" of malware.</p>
              <p>By studying how the code is constructed and how it's propagated,
              Computer Associates has traced the Trojan to a specific group in China,
              Grayek said. He would not name the group.</p>
              <p>The strength of the malware shows how skilled hackers have become
              and how serious they are about targeting digital devices, which provide
              a new frontier for stealing information from vast numbers of unwary PC
              owners. More than 2.26 million digital frames were sold in 2007,
              according to the Consumer Electronics Association, and it expects sales
              to grow to 3.26 million in 2008.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The new Trojan also has been spotted in Singapore</strong></span> and the Russian
              Federation and has 67,500 variants, according to Prevx, a security
              vendor headquartered in England.</p>
              <p>Grayek said Mocmex might be a test for some bigger attack, because
              it's designed to capture any personal, private or financial
              information, yet so far it's only stealing passwords for online games.</p>
              <p>"If I send you a package but it doesn't explode, why did I send it?"
              he said. "Maybe I want to see if I can get it out to you and how you
              open it."</p>
              <p>The initial reports of infected frames came from people who had
              bought them over the holidays from Sam's Club and Best Buy. New reports
              involve frames sold at Target and Costco, according to SANS, a group of
              security researchers in Bethesda, Md., who began asking for accounts of
              infected devices on Christmas Day. So far the group has collected more
              than a dozen complaints from people across the country.</p>
              <p>The new Trojan isn't the only piece of malware involved. Deborah
              Hale of Sans said the researchers also found four other, older Trojans
              on each frame, which may serve as markers for botnets - networks of
              infected PCs that are remotely controlled by hackers.</p>
              <p>There is W32.Rajump, which deposits the same piece of malware that
              infected some of Apple's video iPods during manufacturing in October
              2006. It gathers Internet Protocol addresses and port numbers from
              infected PCs and ships them out, according to Symantec. One destination
              is registered to a service in China that allows people to conceal their
              own IP addresses.</p>
              <p>Then there is a generic Trojan; a Trojan that opens a back door on
              PCs and displays pop-up ads; and a Trojan that spreads itself through
              portable devices like Mocmex does.</p>
              <p>How all this malware got onto the photo frames and what it's doing
              there is unclear. Trojans can download other Trojans, which is part of
              how botnets are controlled.</p>
              <p>While SANS is investigating the infections, the retailers are saying little.</p>
              <p>Sam's Club said it has found no infected frames, and its
              distributor, Advanced Design Systems, did not return calls seeking
              comment.</p>
              <p>A few Target customers complained about frames distributed by Uniek,
              a store spokesman confirmed. Target is no longer selling those frames,
              but that's because the frames didn't sell well over the holidays, he
              said. Target has found no infections, he said, but is watching for
              them.</p>
              <p>Best Buy said one line of its Insignia frames - also now
              discontinued - was infected during manufacturing but would not provide
              details.</p>
              <p>Costco did not return calls seeking comment.</p>

              <h3>How to avoid problems</h3>
              <p>Protecting
              against these new computer viruses, which so far are aimed at PCs
              running Windows, is hard - and sometimes impossible.</p>
              <p>Updated antivirus software works unless the malware writers get
              ahead of the antivirus vendors, which is what happened with the new
              Trojan. Computer Associates, for example, just began protecting against
              it last week.</p>
              <p>While some advise disabling Autorun in Windows, which allows devices
              to run automatically when they're plugged into a USB port, it's not a
              failsafe. Doing so requires some computer expertise, and this Trojan
              re-enables Autorun if it's turned off, according to Brian Grayek of
              Computer Associates. "If you plug in (the frame), you're already
              infected," he said.</p>
              <p>Deborah Hale at SANS suggested that PC users find friends with
              Macintosh or Linux machines and have them check for malware before
              plugging any device into a PC.</p>
              <p>She also recommended backing up data with an online service such as
              Mozy.com that offers free backup for home users with less than 2
              gigabytes of data. But it does not back up the operating system, she
              warned. If you're attacked and your PC fails, you'll have to reformat
              and reload all of the programs.</p>

              <p></p>
              <hr>
              <p>Didn't know this kind of frames are available here???</p>
              <p>Anyway, sounds bad. Looks like reformatting is the way to go. But then again, if your thumbdrive or any external drives are infected, reinstalling doesn't help. Plug in again, the whole thing starts again. It's an evil cycle.</p>
