            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, anyone here can help me, i will be very thankful... I have just got this comp from someone. The thing is i have 2 IDE Harddisk on my current comp and i was thinking of taking out the spare one which has all my data &amp; stuff on it and put it over here but this set uses the Sata connection. You see the red wire in Picture 1 &amp; 2, that is the sata connection wires. It has 2 HD already but can i add another? But its in IDE. There is this black pin on the corner of the motherboard which says Sec-IDE on the side (on Picture 10) Can it be use? or cannot mix two different type of connection HD on the Motherboard?<br><br>1) If can, what setting should i put at the back of the IDE HD?<br><br>2) Anyone know what memory i need to use if i want to add a higher ram, i saw on one of the ram it says PC3200U what kind of ram is this anyone know? and whats the max i can put up too?<br><br>3) On Pic 9, there is this white Aux port and Black CD port. Anyone know what are they for?<br><br>4) Also from the pictures, what connection type is the graphic card? Just want to know should i want to replace it.<br><br>5) Lastly, how do you see or know if the processor has been overclock or not? Or you can't tell weather it has been by just looking at the pictures.<br><br>Thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Picture 1<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/1c.jpg"><br><br>Picture 2<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/1-3.jpg"><br><br>Picture 3<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/1a-2.jpg"><br><br>Picture 4<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/1d.jpg"><br><br>Picture 5<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/2a.jpg"><br><br>Picture 6<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/2b.jpg"><br><br>Picture 7<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/3a-2.jpg"><br><br>Picture 8<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/4-1.jpg"><br><br>Picture 9<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/5-1.jpg"><br><br>Picture 10<br><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p92/nikoz1/5a.jpg"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can help you answer your qn 3, 4 and 5.<br><br>For qn 3 - that two port is useless. Nowadays, we don't use it anymore, you do not have to worry about it.<br><br>For qn 4 - Judging from picture 8, you are currently using a AGP slot graphic card. If you want to change your graphic card, you will need a graphic card that uses AGP slot. You can use PCI graphic card though, but I doubt the market still sell it. Actually, I also don't think market sell AGP graphic card anymore, you can check if you want to.<br><br>For qn 5- No you can't check whether if the processor is overclocked from the picture. You need to boot into BIOS to check it if you know how, if not I suggest you to leave it alone.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>For qn 1 - Yes you can add your IDE HDD to this set using the empty IDE connector in picture 10. Set the IDE HDD as master and connect it to the empty IDE connector in picture 10.<br><br>As for qn 2 - PC3200U (Model of your ram) is a DDR 400 ram. If you want to increase your ram, you just have to buy the same type of ram and insert into your PC. Judging from your processor fan, I think you are running a pentium 4 PC. You can refer to your computer manual to check out the maximum amount of ram your computer supported, but my guessing is your PC can support for to maximum 2GB of ram.</div>

The default setting for this on a system with IDE autodetection, is usually "Auto".</blockquote>jumpers in HDD are use to let mother board to recognise whether its a master or slave.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, Thanks, thanks guys. One more thing is, from the pictures no.4 &amp; 5, How come SATA HD use the black plug - like one thin line whereas the normal HD uses the standard 4 pin plug for power supply? Does all Sata HD use this kind of (like one thin line) for power supply, if not do they sell something to change the (thin line black plug) to a normal 4 pin type?<br><br>Thanks.</div>
