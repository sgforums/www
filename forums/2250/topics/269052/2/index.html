A lot of applications are still optimized for 32-bit platforms and single core CPUs, which is why there isn't any improvements. Between 2005 and 2007, I've seen a great improvement for 32-bit programs on single core CPU. They no longer use as much resources or have other sort of bugs which eats resources.<br><br>However, the same can't be said for duo core or even quad core CPU and 64-bit platforms PC. Although some programs are specifically for such platforms, the programs more or less are going the way of their predecessor.<br><br>2. Not really. It really depends.<br><br>3. LOL, Accepted.<br><br>4. OK, nice friend you are.<br><br>As for you... well... nothing to say. You are contradictory.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>1) The main problem now with computers are not the CPU... By changing the architecture and some software of the processor does help in the performance of the computer but the help is really insignificant. The main problem now with computer is the harddisk. The accessing speed of harddisk is too slow for the ram or CPU to run even faster... Therefore, the technology breakthrough tat I mean is the invention of faster but affordable harddisk...<br><br>1 &amp; 2) Most computer users do not really need very good computers... Majority will use computer to surf net, download, play and use simple applications... They do not need really expensive computers and thus if they diy themself, it doesnt really save much... &lt;---- assuming diy uses original software<br>In fact, it is encouragble to buy the cheapest computer... lol... Reason is very simple... Computer depreciates very fast... And therefore, one should buy the cheapest and make the computer dl 24 hrs daily... You use cheapest computer and force the computer do lots of work... In return, save more money &gt;&lt;<br><br>I am not being contradictory. It is just a pride ---&gt; I know tat I m in the wrong but I still insist I m in the right.... Well... u can say male ego if u want... &gt;&lt;<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm using a Dell Dimension 8200. It has lasted me for almost 6 years already. The hard disk has never crashed before. The only thing that went out of commission was the CPU fan that died a few months ago. Took me half a day to find the part from Sim Lim, where this vendor canibalized an old 8200.<br><br>But then Dell's tech support is not very good, especially with a call center based in Malaysia. It takes months for them to do a simple repair.<br><br>My two cents is, if you are a tech idiot, better to stick to a branded computer. Try to look for reliable brands with good tech support. With a DIY computer, YOU are your own tech support.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Of course, if you have the privilege of knowing IT expert friends and hardware enthusiasts, you can always ask them for help.</div>

By changing the architecture and some software of the processor does help in the performance of the computer but the help is really insignificant. The main problem now with computer is the harddisk. The accessing speed of harddisk is too slow for the ram or CPU to run even faster... Therefore, the technology breakthrough tat I mean is the invention of faster but affordable harddisk...<br><br>1 &amp; 2) Most computer users do not really need very good computers... Majority will use computer to surf net, download, play and use simple applications... They do not need really expensive computers and thus if they diy themself, it doesnt really save much... &lt;---- assuming diy uses original software<br>In fact, it is encouragble to buy the cheapest computer... lol... Reason is very simple... Computer depreciates very fast... And therefore, one should buy the cheapest and make the computer dl 24 hrs daily... You use cheapest computer and force the computer do lots of work... In return, save more money &gt;&lt;<br><br>I am not being contradictory. It is just a pride ---&gt; I know tat I m in the wrong but I still insist I m in the right.... Well... u can say male ego if u want... &gt;&lt;<br><br></div></blockquote>I feel that part of the reason holding some DIY enthhusiast back is the 64bit OS. The hard disk is reasoned as the slowest component of a pC because it is the only part operating by mechanical means. However only a fraction of a chunk of data leaves the hdd at one time before being broken up into many more fragments for data processing down the stream to the CPU and buffered at the ram. With hdd going SATAII and possibly SATAIII or higher, throughput has been greatly increased. seek times of hdd have also improved down to 4ms (seagate) and 2ms (WD raptor). One of the challenges to hdd maker now is making reliable hdd with larger storage capacity to satisfy the digital multimedia age and users.<br><br>Most people do not really need good computers because computer is not a thing of the past. Almost everyone owns one and our younger generation are taught how to use them at school. expensive computers is no subsitute for a reliable computer. you can get a cheap computer but you will never to expect it to run good for long 24hr a day for weeks and months and years. it will fail earlier than expected and you will have to spend money on a new cheaper PC again. it takes more than a cheap PC to dl while you do other stuff with your other programmes. you should not buy the cheapest and hope to squeeze every ounce from it. it is a very wrong concept.<br><br>ego is never an excuse for ignorant <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
