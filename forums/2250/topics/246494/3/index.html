            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by palp:<br><strong>Hi, my name is Lee and I am starting this thread to warn you fellow citizens of SG, the horrors of this one shop I been to in Sim Lim Square today dated 4/4/2007.<br>I was walking around Sim Lim today trying to find a PS2(dun ask, just know that my nephew destroyed my old one), and I came across this shop:<br><br>[b]Mobile Hut Electronics Pte Ltd<br>1 Rochor Canal Road #02-79 Sim Lim Square<br>Singapore 188504</strong><br><br>They quoted $S190 for a ps2 console. And I thought that was reasonable but being the typical singaporean that I am I decided to just walk around some more to see if I can get an even better price, apparently not. So I wen back to <strong>Mobile Hut</strong> and ask for one of their console. I wanted an NTSC UC unit but what they had was a modified unit so I thought sure as long as it can play the games i had at home(original games mind you). Then they told me that i had to pay $232 for the newer modified version because the one they had can only play NTSC J games i was like starting to get confused about the speech they were giving me about DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF MODIFICATION. I was confused but nonetheless i agreed to pay the extra, I was just lazy to walk around and find out more. The worse is yet to come.<br>I gave my nets card for payment but the total charge came up to about $252.10. Correct me if I am wrong here but $232 inclusive of 5% gst comes up to only about $243.60. I ask the sales person where the $8.50 had gone to and he told me it was <strong>AH KOW TAX</strong>. I was like wat the hell is that? the salesman said it was something like electronics tax. Again, correct me if I am wrong here. Is there such a thing as electronics tax in Singapore? By this time I was really starting to feel i am being cheated here, but i let it go since its already processed. The worse is still yet to come.<br>I told him i wanted to test my ps2. He opened up the box and just then he told me i needed to buy an extra adaptor for my ps2. I was like wat the F@#$. Wasn't the console suppose to be packed with an adaptor. i mean its a singapore region 3 machine. And he wanted to charge me $79 for the adaptor.he failed to mention that it did not include an adaptor. I got so fed up i told the salesman no. i not buying anymore stuff from u. the salesman was like spouting all his bad language out at me and telling me that he wun sell it to me even if i beg him. I was just furious, i didnt want to talk to him anymore. I packed my ps2 and he was like continually insulting me with his bad manners, he wasnt even interested in serving me anymore. Folks, the ah kow tax and overcharging aside, if it was you being insulted and continually being hurled abuses at, would you take it lying down? Is that the way to be serving your customers? sure i was furious but i kept my cool and tried reasoning with the salesman but he gave me a bad attitude. If Singapore wants to provide quality service then is that the way to be treating its customers? Oh and for your info, I bought the adaptor at another shop for $15. Can you say 'overpriced'?[/b]</blockquote>its totally... HILARIOUS...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  i seriously have nver heard of AH KOW tax before! why AH KOW.. u shld ask him spell it out for u n write it on the receipt! hmm. is that the salesperson's name? sounds like its his own private tax.<br><br>I hate bad attitude from the salespple! Pay them $$ still must see their face.. thats how sick..  but bringin up the issue to CASE is so tiring..<br>if onli there is a win win situation..<br><br>till then.. condemn the shOP!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SLS still got a lot of good bargain.... SLS is no doubt selling the cheapest computer related product in Sg..<br><br>Next time. Before decide to buy,check their attitude(that is very important),ask them if is they any hidden charge other than the final price he mention. Check the nets price display before u press the enter button..<br><br>If all these are observed,usually unplesant events will reduce.</div>

Just need to be careful when you go shopping.<br><br>Last week, I was shopping for a camera in one of the shops (in a complex opposite Takashimaya). They saleperson told me the price of the camera is $550, but he see me handsome he decided to slash the price to $450.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>WTH? Reduced by $100 automatically. Then when pressed for details on the camera, he said I must purchase the re-chargable battery at $88. Total is now $538. He again automatically reduce the price to $518.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Still got something missing. The SD card. He said it will cost $58 for 1GB or 2GB (cannot remember liao). Before I can say "let me consider", he asked for my credit card...<br><br>Scary...I walk out of the shop...<br><br>I saw the same camera selling for $499 at BEST. With battery, 1x1GB and 1x2GB card and card-reader...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><br><br>I cannot understand why people still buy big items from shops at Sim Lim Square or Tower. There have been so many reports of cheating cases. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Look at the number of shops there. All selling the same thing. They have to squeeze unsuspecting customers tightly in order to get enough to cover their rent, and the salary of the hungry helpers hanging around the shop. Those vultures scrutinise you when you go near and in their minds, they are only thinking of how to make the money go from your pocket to theirs. Products and services are alien to them.<br><br>My maximum spending in SLQ or SLT is not more than $50. If they want to cheat, let them have it...sub sub shui.<br><br>If you buy big and want better protection, shop at reputable places like COURTS, BEST, CARREFOUR etc....or even <span style="color: red;">Funan Centre</span> is better. </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
