            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, my name is Lee and I am starting this thread to warn you fellow citizens of SG, the horrors of this one shop I been to in Sim Lim Square today dated 4/4/2007.<br>I was walking around Sim Lim today trying to find a PS2(dun ask, just know that my nephew destroyed my old one), and I came across this shop:<br><br><strong>Mobile Hut Electronics Pte Ltd<br>1 Rochor Canal Road #02-79 Sim Lim Square<br>Singapore 188504</strong><br><br>They quoted $S190 for a ps2 console. And I thought that was reasonable but being the typical singaporean that I am I decided to just walk around some more to see if I can get an even better price, apparently not. So I wen back to <strong>Mobile Hut</strong> and ask for one of their console. I wanted an NTSC UC unit but what they had was a modified unit so I thought sure as long as it can play the games i had at home(original games mind you). Then they told me that i had to pay $232 for the newer modified version because the one they had can only play NTSC J games i was like starting to get confused about the speech they were giving me about DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF MODIFICATION. I was confused but nonetheless i agreed to pay the extra, I was just lazy to walk around and find out more. The worse is yet to come.<br>I gave my nets card for payment but the total charge came up to about $252.10. Correct me if I am wrong here but $232 inclusive of 5% gst comes up to only about $243.60. I ask the sales person where the $8.50 had gone to and he told me it was <strong>AH KOW TAX</strong>. I was like wat the hell is that? the salesman said it was something like electronics tax. Again, correct me if I am wrong here. Is there such a thing as electronics tax in Singapore? By this time I was really starting to feel i am being cheated here, but i let it go since its already processed. The worse is still yet to come.<br>I told him i wanted to test my ps2. He opened up the box and just then he told me i needed to buy an extra adaptor for my ps2. I was like wat the F@#$. Wasn't the console suppose to be packed with an adaptor. i mean its a singapore region 3 machine. And he wanted to charge me $79 for the adaptor.he failed to mention that it did not include an adaptor. I got so fed up i told the salesman no. i not buying anymore stuff from u. the salesman was like spouting all his bad language out at me and telling me that he wun sell it to me even if i beg him. I was just furious, i didnt want to talk to him anymore. I packed my ps2 and he was like continually insulting me with his bad manners, he wasnt even interested in serving me anymore. Folks, the ah kow tax and overcharging aside, if it was you being insulted and continually being hurled abuses at, would you take it lying down? Is that the way to be serving your customers? sure i was furious but i kept my cool and tried reasoning with the salesman but he gave me a bad attitude. If Singapore wants to provide quality service then is that the way to be treating its customers? Oh and for your info, I bought the adaptor at another shop for $15. Can you say 'overpriced'?</div>
