            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I am at my wits end here. So I'm turning to the general public and I hope anybody with a good opinion or two can tell me about them.<br><br>I lost my hp (possibly pickpocketed) on Dec 22nd at Vivocity, I tried repeated to call my hp on the day I lost it. At first I wanted to report lost right away bcos whoever had my phone had off the phone, but later it was switch on again. Holding on that ray of hope, I kept calling and sending msgs and eventually called in to disconnect my phone around midnight (although Singtel claimed I called at 150am).<br><br>Anyway, I later received a bill of $500 for calls made overseas to Thailand, Vietnam, Sweden on Dec 22nd itself. I went to the police and they told me to go to Singtel and I went to Singtel and they told me to go to the police. Basically both parties were rather blase about it.<br><br>Of course, mine would have not been the first case in history.<br><br>However, I was shocked that neither the police nor Singtel even had the slightest interest in investigating into the matter despite the numerous overseas numbers reflected on the bill. I was even more appalled to be informed by both the police and Singtel that they do not have the technology.<br><br>Whether or not technology is really available in our country, it is just unbelievable that basically the reaction I have received is that I'll just have to bite the bullet.<br><br>I have written a letter of appeal to Singtel, but they are unwilling to waive the charges, only those from 150am onwards, which really amounts to little.<br><br>So I am asking if there is anyone out there who has any suggestions on what else I can do. I am not exactly wealthy.<br><br>I have tried calling the numbers on my bill, the individual appears to be thai. I have been unable to communicate with the owners of these numbers because they only speak thai/other languages. (Thai being the majority)<br><br>Please, if you have any idea at all, please email me at <span style="color: blue;">Email removed by Moderator</span>.<br><br>I sincerely ask for your help.<br><br>Eileen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, you're responsible for your own possessions. Thus, any unauthorized local &amp; overseas calls made by that dishonest a*shole cannot be held responsible by the telco. If so, wouldn't the telco have to bear all the costs of tons of people who had lost their phones and succumbed to bearing the cost of those unauthorized calls made by the thief?<br><br>For example: if you had lost your phone at 11pm. You reported at 1am. From 11pm - 1am, during that 2h period, cost of any calls made will be charged on your account. And I can assure you once you had reported to them, your line will be immediately disconnected. That will render your SIM card useless.<br><br>Everyone knows that reporting to the police is rather a waste of time. Look at the number of loss phone cases. They have better things to do. And by doing so, the chance of gettin' your phone back is say, 10%?<br><br>I had lost a few phones before. And I called my telco to report straight away to disconnect the line. 'Cause I know that holding onto that glimmer of hope of gettin' my cellphone back is rather futile.<br><br>Anyway, I could empathise with your situation but I would strongly suggest to you to stop whining.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when u lost ur phone, the onus is on you to disconnect the line immediately..instead, you depended on "a ray of hope" which unfortunately extinguished before you can reach that ray.<br><br>You cant do much to refute Singtel's persistence should they decide to pursue this matter. At the very most, u can call back the number which the one who got your hanphone kept calling. Maybe that can reveal the identity and hopefully, you can at least file a civil suit for Misappropriation of Property</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you discovered the loss of your mobile phone, the onus is on you to immediately contact SingTel so that your line could most probably be terminated to prevent any unauthorised use. Any charges incurred after your report to SingTel would then not be your liability.<br><br>However, it seems that you had failed to report the loss immediately. Hence, denying the charges incurred will be downright difficult...........<br><br>The charges incurred may be heavy but you still cannot escape legal liability for the payment...... You can propose an installment payment scheme to SingTel at best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
