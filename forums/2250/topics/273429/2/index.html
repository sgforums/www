The salesman is identifiable and the post recounts specific instances which would give any boss a damn good reason to terminate employment. And for what? The point he is trying to make is AVOID THE SHOP BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO PASS OFF SECOND HAND GOODS AS NEW ETC ETC. There is no good reason whatsoever for revealing his sources.<br><br>When you are out working full time, you will understand how valuable jobs are.

Even it's for legitimate purposes (think of the dumb law that protects employees for telling the law enforcement that a company is using pirated products), it's like talking behind somebody's back.<br><br>Although I'm not exactly a working adult, I still won't do anything as long as it doesn't sound right to me.<br><br>What you said makes sense... but what's been done can't be undone.</div>
