              <p>So you sent the laptop for servicing because it shut down? But in your first post, it says it worked fine before repairs. Which is it?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I do not know which place you sent in your laptop for fixing.</p>
              <p>From experience, what they would do is either they  de solder the particular part and replace the faulty component or they would replace the whole motherboard. In particular , the 8400 and 8600 series which are famous for this problem.</p>
              <p>If the motherboard is replaced they are unable to confirm if the motherboard is new. That's because they are getting parts from their suppliers (Mostly OEM manufacturers). These OEM Manufacturers refurbish the motherboards and then sell it back to those who ordered the parts. Thus there's no way you will know if it's new.</p>
              <p>Normally the shop that you repaired from will offer a warranty of a few months. (1 month as a sign of good will). If it's still within that period check up with them.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the cost will also determine if it's repaired or replaced. How much did you replace your motherboard for.</p>
              <p>Like Raraken has said. It could be overheating. It could be the card too (My S6420 has the all unreliable s3 dedicated graphics. So far, i have 2 burnt graphic cards already).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here's a few thing that may help.</p>
              <p>When it shuts down, does any messages appear when you boot it up - like windows recovery error. </p>
              <p>Does it refuse to start up? </p>

              <p>Let me presume this.</p>
              <p>1)  The laptop functions properly without hangs/shutting down if you do not use any graphics intense programs</p>
              <p>I need to know this.</p>
              <p>2) What are the settings you normally use when you are gaming.</p>
              <p>-------------</p>
              <p>My view on it would be overheating that causes the graphics card to stop functioning (too intense game) / it can be a faulty graphics card.</p>

              <p>yes, so far the laptop is functioning well without hangs/shutting down if i don't use any graphics intese prog,</p>
              <p>the game i play is ray city, its a racing car game, even i put the setting to the minimum, which is the lowest resolution, the game will still either hang or shutdown.</p>
              <p>so it is highly possible that my graphic card is faulty right?</p>
              <p>because the sub contractor keep telling me that it is my software programs problems, or my internet game problems, saying that my internet speed is like 56/kps etc, which i feel that he is trying to push the blame to the game instead of changing a new graphic card for me,</p>

              <p>All signs point to overheating. The higher ambient temperatures when the aircon is switched off causes the laptop to shutdown faster, right? The overheating component is usually the graphics card, but both graphics card and CPU would share the same cooling system, so if one overheats the other would too.</p>

              <p>  To confirm if the cause is overheating, why don't you download HWmonitor and check the temperature. Of course, while monitoring the temperature, you can't be playing a full screen game.(Or you won't be able to see HWmonitor)</p>
              <p>If the games you play can't be changed to windows mode, you could use others such as MapleStory which can.</p>

              <p>HWmonitor is under CPUID, the same as CPU-Z.</p>
              <p>Anyway, HWmonitor would appear roughly as the image below.</p>
              <p>CPU temperature, GPU temperature and also HDD temperature at the bottom.</p>

              <p>FYI..</p>
              <p>Auto shutdown cause manay things..</p>
              <p>But this are the very common cause.</p>
              <p>1. faulty cpu fan --no choice but to replace it.</p>
              <p>2. poor ventilation while playing hardcore graphic games.</p>
              <p>3. faulty motherboard- no choice but to change it.</p>
              <p>4. laptop battery - you might not believe it but sometimes try to use your laptop without the battery try to run it by the power source only and see if it works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your graphic card doesnt have to do with the auto shutdown. just try to focus to your motherboard and cpu fan.</p>

              <p>I suspect 2 main problems.</p>
              <p>1) System overheating</p>
              <p>2) Battery unable to provide enough power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>System overheating occurs fairly frequently on older laptops - I could get my dv2713 to hit 100C easily.</p>
              <p>As for battery, if you are using an aftermarket battery from shops like Innovative Technology Pte. Ltd in Sim Lim, that might be the problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not sure how aftermarket batteries from other shops are related, but the original battery for my HP dv2713tx died and I purchased a replacement from Innovative @ Sim Lim.</p>
              <p>The system would turn itself off if I played a game @ maximum screen brightness when running off the battery itself. So I suspect the battery could not provide enough juice for the system to run.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either way, here are steps you can take.</p>
              <p>Download Everest Ultimate (Google for it.. Latest version is 5.50) and take a look under Computer &gt; Sensor.</p>
              <p>I choose Everest over other programs like SpeedFan because at times, SpeedFan isn't very accurate in reporting the temperatures.</p>
              <p>Check your CPU and GPU temperatures. For a laptop, they should NOT exceed 65C on idle (idle refers to when you're doing nothing on your laptop, no programs running, just monitoring Everest).</p>
              <p>If they are exceeding that temperature, you have most likely found your culprit - overheating.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think Sony service centre is all that bad.. Except that they charge you even before they start repairs. They charge you to have your appliance checked out.</p>
              <p>That sucks.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, HP service centre doesn't suck in that way, its just that HP overcharges a LOT.</p>

              <p>TS did say that during warm wheathers the auto shutdown could happen...so high likely is overheating issues.(I cant confirm it until TS provides his temps)</p>

              <p>Regarding battery, is the battery you bought same as the previous?</p>
              <p>If yes, that would be battery quality problems.</p>
              <p>If no, 1)The voltage of the battery doesn't meet your usage requirements  or</p>
              <p>2)because each battery is different, the connection between the battery and laptop could be loose even if tightly fitted in.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't be sure on that...the graphic card can overheat you know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, use HWmonitor will do because</p>
              <p>1) Everest Ultimate is not free.</p>
              <p>2)It is quite complicated whereas HWmonitor only has one display page.</p>
              <p>3)To check overheating, HWmonitor provides everything you would need.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Temperature limit depends on Hardware, so i would recommend you to first post a screenshot of your temps here.</p>
