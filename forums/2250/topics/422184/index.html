               computer has been rather unstable lately. The temperature would rise to
               80+ degrees within a few minutes of operation (but I ignored it). Then,
               within 5mins, the computer will auto shut down with a blue screen 
              (message: irql not less than or equal) and restart, showing only a black
               screen. If I try to restart the computer immediately, I’ll be faced 
              with a black screen. When I try to restart the computer after a day or 
              two, the computer may start up, and if it does, it only operates, but 
              only for a few minutes before the blue screen appears. (Cycle repeats.) 
              On those random occasions when the computer decides to start up, I will 
              see the message: dram timing is too tightly reloaded... On the final 
              occasion time before my computer died, the message shown on the blue 
              screen was win32k.sys.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I’ve
               opened the CPU and found out that the fan for the graphics card wasn’t 
              turning when the CPU is powered up. I took out the graphics card and 
              cleared some dust and oiled the fan for the graphics card. Following 
              which, the fan for the graphics card was functioning when the CPU is 
              powered up but the computer is still unable to start up. When I press 
              the power switch, the screen remains black and some clicking sounds (not
               beeping sounds) can be heard from the CPU.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Wondering
               if any experts here can shed some light as to what is happening to my 
              computer? Is there anything that I can do to salvage it? Is there any 
              thing that I need to buy or something? Got quite a lot of info on the 
              com that is quite important so any help is very much appreciated!</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Cheers!</span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL could be hinting at faulty RAM. Download <a href="http://www.memtest86.com">memtest86</a> and run it. Errors point to a faulty stick of RAM. Find out which stick is bad by removing one stick of RAM and running memtest86 again. If there are no errors, then you should have solved that particular BSOD problem.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the responses..</p>
              <p>I'm using AVI motherboard. Do you need more details about it? I don't know what other details can I furnish you because there are so many brands (eg. Intel) and undecipherable numbers on my motherboard haha..)</p>
              <p>My heat sinker seems to be intact. However, the fan is quite clogged with dust. I've removed the dust. Was wondering if it's the dust that caused the temperature to soar within minutes of using the computer.. Maybe that heat has charred some parts of my computer because because of my prolonged usage..</p>
              <p>I didn't overclock my CPU (not intentionally at least), nor did I reset 
              my CMOS because I am a com noob and I know better not to tweak such 
              settings. Having said that, right now I see nothing on my screen when I 
              start up my computer - so I 
              can't access anything that allows me to tweak my BIOS settings try 
              running any programs (eg. memtest86) or extra hardware that allows me to
               tweak any kind of settings..</p>

              <p>AVI or VIA? I've never heard of AVI. Hmm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which version of Windows are you using?</p>
              <p>And does the motherboard have integrated graphics built in? The graphics card could have fried. If you have a spare graphics card lying about, try use that instead. If no output is still displayed, then either your motherboard or CPU are fried. How old is the system in question?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you could take a picture of the system internals (motherboard, GPU etc.) I think I should be able to identify the parts inside.</p>
