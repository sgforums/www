              <p>Have you ever seen or been exploited by people asking you to perform IT stuffs and they are paying you a meagre sum and citing that you're a student?</p>
              <p>My friend and I are both year 3 and have finished all our modules except attachment, we are one of the best in the cohort. We've been approached by a 3rd party to construct a large website with its own internal search engine and they offered $300 in total.</p>
              <p>Ridiculous? I think so. They cited that "You all still student, not worth much."</p>
              <p>So I argued that we are already considered graduated because our gpa won't change anymore and something like that would take a few months to do and for $300 it's too little. My guess is that 2 person rush, we should at least be getting $1000 each for minimal?</p>
              <p>Because this website involves the use of some map API.</p>
              <p>We're both java programmers and web designers, other than java we have moderate knowledge of many different frameworks and languages such as javaFX to name some.</p>
              <p>Thoughts?</p>

              <p>If Google Maps... the API is out there and is FOC. Furthermore, static maps is very easy to do. Probably not going to get paid a lot to do a static map.</p>
              <p>But if dynamic map, it's different thing. It depends if you want to use Flash or JavaScript to implement it.</p>
              <p>Search... I'm not sure. Written from scratch or using someone else's engine? Using Google's engine is not hard to implement either. But if you are using someone's engine, but they provide you with the APIs to implement, that may either be hard or easy to implement, depending on how complicated it is (both client's needs and what the application can provide).</p>
              <p>Clarify with them what they need and see how they want to implement things. If it's borrowed from here and there and writing some simple codes to get it done, not a lot of money...</p>
              <p>In my current workplace, adding a search engine (Google), add a Google static map, Google widgets, RSS = half day. Not worth $300 even.</p>

              <p>My time, it was about $150 per page (static site). Of course if you got a portfolio to show, then value can negotiate lah..

              <p>Think if give me $300 ask me do website, at best... I'll throw in a custom template, edit a bit, throw in the content, photoshop a few simple pics and that's it.. want simi scripting $300 is really like makan people.. Students inclusive..</p>

              <p>Where are the certs to show that you are qualified in JAVA and other programming skills? No have right? So suck thumb lor, must wait until you got the cert then you can show that you have finally graduated. What if you fail your attachment?</p>

              I truely agree. Yes, you might be the best, top, wont affect much blah blah blah, but the fact is that, you still don have the degree.
              
              Why not u do, do a good job, request for a testimonial after that. The next time you find a job, you can always state that as your experience. The long term gains will definitely be greater than the 1k or so. Be positive okay!
