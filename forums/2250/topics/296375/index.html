And at the end of the day, the network must serve it's users or there's no point to the network.<br><br>If you have to offer wireless access and your clients don't support WPA, WEP is better than nothing. I used to recommend changing WEP keys regularly but there really isn't any point anymore.<br><br>But of course, security requirements are also important. In my office, if your device does not support at least WPA, that's just too bad.<br><br>Fortunately, even my old Dell Axim X30 supports WPA. I did recently deploy a wireless network where the client insisted on using WEP. I warned them about it but I guess they just don't take security seriously.<br></div>

They said their even if someone cracks the WEP key, it's okay because all they send is a product code and a timestamp.<br><br>I told them it's still not safe. First of all, their protocol is unencrypted. There's also no authentication between the clients and the server. The server identifies the clients by the mac address.<br><br>Finally, the server runs on Windows and I don't know if they are using a firewall. I suspect not because the guy who was configuring it didn't even know what was a valid subnet mask.<br><br>But oh well... if they think it's not important who am I to argue. I just make sure they are isolated from the rest of the network.</div>

The WEP is there not so much for security but just to stop passer-bys from leeching off your connection.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>EAP with WPA will require servers for authentication.  If its a big enough network, I guess its worth it?<br><br>The cheaper way is as mentioned, leave the WEP guys on a seperate VLAN and route them to the network with extremely strict port restrictions.<br><br>Sometimes the problem is not with having uninvited guests on the network.  Its having invited guests with insecure/infected/ laptops.
