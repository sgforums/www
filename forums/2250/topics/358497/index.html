              <p>i wish to get a new gaming desktop, but i have no idea on what parts to get. is there any site that tells the difference between each type of part? like what is the difference between each type of graphic card, mobo and chipset? i have been reading a lot but until now i still i don understand nor know which type of part to choose.</p>
              <p>also is there any site that tells u how much each part cost and which type for each part is recommended?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>alternatively , you can also help me by suggesting a build to me.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>SLI and CrossFireX are nVidia's and ATi's implementations of multi-card setups respectively. Yes, 1 powerful card is usually much faster than 2 slower cards, but it depends. 2 GeForce 8500s usually get owned by a single 8600. But 2 HD4850s will smack the shit out of a single HD4890. It depends, usually.</p>

              <p>Ownage, but expensive. I'd go with HD4830 CFX. Somewhat cheaper, and you can use Intel mobo. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First time actually recommending ATi <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif">. Mid-range, ATi currently smacks nVidia's arse right now. NVidia GTS250 is a refresh, G1XX is a refresh. Basically, NVidia is using 2 year old technology in their cards, since the 9800s were a 8800 refresh. Still, for something 2 years old, they can still hold out.</p>

              <p>Based on your budget and needs, we can help you draw a list of items that you will buy, dont ask open ended question which I think it is a waste of time to spoon feed you every single details :)</p>

              <p>Budget around how much?<br> <br> the x38, x48, x58 are high end chipsets</p>
              <p>the p45, 35s are mainstream chipsets.</p>
              <p>these 2 are good for a gaming computer<br> <br> They are all intel chipsets, that means uses intel CPU, and
              supports using two ATI graphics card simultaneously. Nvidia
              graphics card can be used on, but only 1.<br> <br> Motherboard is just like something that connects all your parts
              together. High end mobos have better designed heatsink for heat
              dissipitation on the northbridege, south bridge, and better power
              phase around the CPU<br> <br> The intel chipsets are for crossfire, means using 2 ATI grpahics
              card at one go<br> The Nvidia chipsets(eg, 780i, 790i, etc) are for SLI, means using 2
              NVIDIA graphics card at one go<br> <br> Which type of ram that can be used depends on the motherboard. Most
              support ddr2 now. The Newest core i7 supports DDR3<br> <br> <br> Gaming systems generally need good power supplies as the graphics
              card are very demanding for power.<br> <br> Graphics card are 'invented' by ATI and nvidia. They are made by
              manufacturers like gigabyte, msi, xpervision....etc<br> <br> for eg, a geforce 9800gt can be made by msi. and can be made by
              gigabyte. There will be a bit of differnece here and there because
              some tend to have an factory overclocked version</p>
              <p>For now the most bang of the buck should be the Radeon
              HD 4890, though quite expensive if i remember correctly</p>
              <p>Powersupply should be around 600 watts and above if you are
              running a good graphics card, maybe a couple of harddisk
              etc....fans<br> <br> Also a normal 450 w can be sold for $35. While a good one can be
              sold for $80++<br> The more expensive one is 'true power', it means sth like
              it can produce 450w, and go higher. THe $35 ones normmally
              produces 250 watts and peaks at 450w</p>
              <p>Rams are cheap nowadays, if you are just buying a normal
              computer, a value ram will do.<br> <br> Value rams are actually cheap rams that simply gives u the extra
              memory you want. More expensive memories are made to squeeze out
              every extra speed. These extra speed are called the timing. It is
              defined as how fast infos are past from one section of the ram to
              the other. There is also the frequency, the speed of the ram.<br> <br> A value ram could be 800mhz, with a timing of 6-6-6-18. A good ram,
              also 800mhz, can have a timing of 4-4-4-12<br> <br> Ram also can be run in dual channel, which is faster. THe core i7's
              mainboard, which is x58, supports triple channel</p>
              <p>I also duno where to start to explain<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br> Just post ur qn. Tell me your budget maybe i can help u config a
