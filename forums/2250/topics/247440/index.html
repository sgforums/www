            <div class='col-md body'>Sure you can escape from that crack , emulated OEM Crack is for ppl whose bios that does not support SLIC. Depend on the crack MS can actually detect the boot up record [MBR IF i am not wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ] Or worst they update the SLP2.0 To 3.0 .<br><br>I tried that crack before for testing purpose , Offical used ^_^ and it seems that if you run everest the program it says that your SLIC is emulated hence even a program can check whether if it is real or emulated why can't MS ?<br><br>Change the product key ? but when you use the Validation tool they check for your product key hence they can check if it is blacklisted or not ?<br>Sure you can get a Vista Upgrade set and do a clean install better than upgrade as the different between and upgrade set is the clean install . PM me if you want to know that upgrade loophole to do a celan install or you can search the net .<br><br>Hmmm so far the loophole that i can see from MS in vista is the COA Product key , go to best or anywhere that sells comp and copy their product key from there and install and lastly the disadvantage is to call up M$ and answer some questions and you are activated BUT OF COZ THIS IS ILLEGAL AND NOT RECOMMENDED AS THIS IS CALL STEALING !<br><br>RTM Version had been leak before the release date of vista ~!<br>It is meant for manufactor to preinstall vista .<br><br>Paradox crack , emulated OEM  is a good bet to be defeated. It's a .sys file and can be easily detected. Also, if you do not have a match of slic data and motherboard bran, it can be detected.<br><br>Remember when SP1 Winxp came about ? Where those pirated XP can't install as it detect crack program and file<br>My opinion is that Vista maybe  a trap which lure pirates and m$ sending warning letters and so on .<br><br>My advice to you is that you use genuine Windows , No spyware , No worry , No need to be afraid of WGA :p<br><br>Though OEM Keys for some branding like Asus , HP Maybe the same M$ WILL do something about it for sure !

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Change the product key ? but when you use the Validation tool they check for your product key hence they can check if it is blacklisted or not ?</blockquote>That's why I say MS is dumb, yet at the same time clever.<br><br>This hack works as long as you get the volume licensed keys and the correct ones. Some volume licensed keys are abused, thus blacklisted. I do know of some that are blacklisted.<br><br>List of blacklisted keys:<br><br>XXXXX-640-0000356-23XXX<br>XXXXX-640-2001765-23XXX<br>XXXXX-640-643718x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-641-309376x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-642-064580x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-642-464364x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-643-334701x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-644-081772x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-644-451265x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-644-874896x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-644-933704x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-644-962396x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-645-833254x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-645-994962x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-646-031843x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-646-104081x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-646-105103x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-647-318838x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-647-592029x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-647-677834x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-648-301691x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-648-819992x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-649-106765x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-649-941392x-23XXX<br>XXXXX-650-292312x-23XXX<br><br>All are volume licensed keys that have been abused.<br><br><blockquote>Remember when SP1 Winxp came about ? Where those pirated XP can't install as it detect crack program and file</blockquote>Yup. But MS has also made one silly mistake in SP2. It allows pirated products to bypass it totally. Earlier, MS ship SP2 CDs for free. Those CDs doesn't check if the copy of XP is genuine.<br><br>In fact, upgrading to XP SP2 at that time when it was released had no checking mechanisms.<br><br>It was by chance I discover it. I installed a non-legit copy of XP for testing purposes and tried updating it. No problems, either via CD or the website.<br><br>But all these won't work now. Checking mechanisms are in place... although I bet that there are ways to bypass WGA.</div>

MS may purposely delay the workaround fer pirated vista and later maybe during the time where SP1 is relised and everyone fail the activation hence they etiher got addicted to vista and got to buy an original vista or downgrade it back to WinXP  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So buy original and you don't really had to worry abt anything<br><br>MS is paying alot of atttention to the cracks !<br>They had comfirm abt the Vista keygen [where it takes decade to generate a genuine key <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">]<br><br>So they are actually watching hackers carefully  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Lukzs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>And MS is dumb enough leak Office enterprise where no activation is needed</blockquote>Hehe, this part is the funny one. On MS part.<br><br>I would agree with you on the SP1 part. But how well does it go, it will be another issue. The bad guys are always one step ahead of MS.<br><br>Remember that Longhorn was released in 2003 in the pirated markets, way before MS released it and renamed it to Vista.</div>

As we looked to develop a solution, it was important to ensure that product activation technology could still deliver an acceptable degree of protection, while at the same time, reduce the need for an extra step by the end user,Â” Kochis revealed.<br><br>The Redmond Company introduced a marker in the BIOS of the OEM's motherboard that identifies OEM systems. Via this action, Microsoft managed to intimately connect Windows with a value in the BIOS of the motherboard, and with an OEM machine and an OEM licensed operating system.<br><br>Â“Over the years we've seen examples of BIOS editors that, with some work, allowed people to make an edited BIOS appear to be an OEM BIOS. Because Windows Vista can't be pirated as easily as Windows XP, it's possible that the increased pressure will result in more interest in efforts to hack the OEM Activation 2.0 implementation,Â” Kochis opined.<br><br>As of now, Microsoft revealed that it is aware of two cracks that exploit the Windows Vista OEM 2.0 activation. One method is essentially the same as the OEM cracks implemented in Windows XP and it involves editing the BIOS of a motherboard in order to masquerade the motherboard as an OEM product. Kochis classified the process as labor-intensive and risky due to the fact that users can render the motherboard completely useless. Â“So while this method works today, it's potentially hazardous and really doesn't scale well to large numbers of systems, which makes it less of a threat,Â” Kochis added.<br><br>As far as the second OEM workaround is concerned, Kochis promised that Microsoft will have little trouble in tackling it as it simply involves a software crack designed to make Windows Vista believe that it is running on OEM hardware.<br><br>Â“We focus on hacks that pose threats to our customers, partners and products. It's worth noting we also prioritize our responses, because not every attempt deserves the same level of response. Our goal isn't to stop every "mad scientist" that's on a mission to hack Windows. Our first goal is to disrupt the business model of organized counterfeiters and protect users from becoming unknowing victims. This means focusing on responding to hacks that are scalable and can easily be commercialized, thereby making victims out of well-intentioned customers,Â” Kochis concluded.<br><br>MS Will do something abt it but it gotta be hard <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
