              <p>I think the laptop is alright. A laptop is worth whatever you are willing to pay for it so I think "scammed" is an unduly strong word.</p>
              <p>I've had quite a lot of experience supporting Sony Vaio laptops in an office environment. Personally I would never buy one myself because:</p>
              <p>1. The warranty support is terrible. Even for the smallest issues, I have to bring the laptop down to a Sony store and the laptop will be gone for at least a week. The Sony stores just basically take in the product and send it down to their service centre.</p>
              <p>The best support I've received so far is for the Dell Latitudes (I have no experience with the Inspirons). You call Dell, they send a guy down. They fix the problem on the spot. Most importantly, since they fix it in front of you, you don't have to worry about your data or wiping your hard drive before you send in the laptop.</p>
              <p>2. The website is a mess. It's gotten a bit better now but it's still awful. Sony has a whole mess of part numbers that are different from region to region. If you are reinstalling your OS, finding the right drivers can be a nightmare. Having said that, they are getting better - getting better in the sense that going to the website is no longer like getting kicked in the balls, but like getting slapped in the face a few times.</p>
              <p>Having said that, there are a few good things about Sony Vaios:</p>
              <p>1. Most of their high end laptops are not bad looking. Sony has many different interesting designs. Some are god-awful ugly but most are quite okay. I think the SZ and TZ series look pretty good. I find the keyboards pretty good to type on.</p>
              <p>2. Sony tends to pack a lot of stuff into their laptops. Even the ultraportables tend to come with a built-in DVD drive (if that kind of thing is important to you).</p>
              <p>3. Sony laptops tend to be light though some may argue that it makes the laptop feel flimsy.</p>
              <p>4. Sony laptops are usually quite innovative but then again, you pay for that innovation. The dual graphics chipset thing is good though it's up to the buyer whether it's worth the premium. Dual graphics chipsets give you the best of both worlds - increased battery life when you are not doing graphics intensive tasks, and much better graphics performance when you need it.</p>
              <p>But as I said, I wouldn't buy a Vaio for myself but I can see why someone else might want one. The TZ is a great laptop for ladies. It can slip easily into a handbag and it adds very little weight. The keyboard is smaller than standard size but still easy to type on even if you have pudgy fingers. If you have smaller hands, even better.</p>
              <p>My gf really wants one.  ;)</p>
              <p>But anyway, you have to decide for yourself if the laptop is worth it to you. If you ask me, it's not bad but my opinion shouldn't matter.</p>
              <p>If you were wondering if a Sony Vaio can help you get laid, the answer is no. You need a Macbook Air for that. But don't worry, at least the Vaio won't hurt your chances like an Acer would.  :p</p>

              <p>And to think just 6 months ago, I paid $1000 more than that for the same specs at the last refresh.  :p</p>
              <p>But I don't think think this model is an appropriate substitude for the SZ series.</p>
              <p>1. It's much more expensive especially when you take the bundled software into consideration.</p>
              <p>2. It's much bigger and heavier. Much.</p>
              <p>3. I'm not sure what the Nvidia 8600GM is for. As far as I can tell, I don't use it at all except for perhaps, OS eye candy. Oh right, it's for all those games that are supposed to come out for the Mac. Games like erm... ahhh... ya... games.</p>
              <p>4. I think multi-touch is a bit gimmicky. Just like coverflow. It's nice to have especially if you are using a laptop that has only one mouse button. Sure it's a nice feature, but I wouldn't say it's the most important feature.</p>
              <p>Oh... Apple's warranty support sucks as bad as Sony's. My MBP battery has gone through 51 cycles and the battery health is less than 30% now. I've tried to cycle it and all that. I'm told I have to send the whole notebook in. I can't just send in the battery. That means I have to lose my laptop for at least 1 week just to get the battery checked. And I will probably have to reformat the HDD before I send it in because the HDD is not easily user replaceable.</p>
              <p>I think I'll probably just buy a new battery. The support still sucks though. And Applecare is expensive.</p>

              <p>Price wise ... well , I am going to check Best denki today and maybe other stores and see how much is my SZ56 is worth .</p>

              <p>The website state : $3199..</p>
              <p>For those who went to the same webpage on 3/3-9/3 , you will see that there is a $400 cash rebate .. but no more liao..</p>
              <p>So to "comfort" and "lie" to myself ... i should tell myself that I bought it at $700 discount + free m$ office + ram + mouse + case :P</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I feel like being "cheated" is that .. the salesmen (yes more than 2 said) said that this model is BRAND NEW .. came out on 6/3 ... And after some checking , I believe that this model came out ~3 mths ago ..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well , if I were to used it on speed mode .. it can alst ~3hrs ..(:</p>
              <p>It's worth buying though ...although you can buy a slightly better specs with $2499 from other brands ...</p>

              <p><br>I am *almost* positive that you can run your monitor at native resolution in Stamina Mode. There's no reason why a X3100 cannot drive a 1280x800 resolution screen.</p>
              <p>When you change to stamina mode, go to your display properties and check the settings. If it's not at 1280x800, change it to that resolution.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking I would prefer to get laptops from:</p>
              <p>1) Dell - cheap, can last + good service support. As mentioned above, it's after sales support is quite good. Comparable to other brands in fact.</p>
              <p>2) Lenovo Thinkpad Series - yea I know it's Lenovo now, but the support is pretty good. Not to mention the various Thinkpad features, like one button recovery, the anti-shake software etc. Never regretted buying. I was overseas and accidentally wiped out a critical system file (think I posted that online before...) and I called the support team in Netherlands. Got a package within the next week for me to restore all my precious stuff.</p>
              <p>3) Asus - Except for the hefty price tag, I would definitely get it. Performance worth the money.</p>
              <p>Won't really consider Sony (too exp) and Compaq-HP (ahem....). Would love to try Toshiba and Packard Bell though. haha. And of course, I still own an Apple. Rocks my world man.</p>

              <p>Yup. The whole idea is to extend the battery life by using a less power hungry graphics component when you don't need the performance.</p>

              <p>I got my G1S last year but kind of regreting it. Its a big, heavy, power sucking and hot behemoth with very poor battery life (1 hour at most) and very hot AC adaptor (so afraid that the adaptor will overheat that I had to put some heat sink on it.).  Can only use it as a Desktop replacement. Drivers support from Asus is also very poor and slow. The last NVidia Graphics  Driver update was in Aug '07.</p>
              <p>Luckily, I still have my trusty 4-5yr old HP nc6000 for use when I'm on the move.</p>
