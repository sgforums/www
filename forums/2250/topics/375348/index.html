              <p>after about 2 hours of effort.. i still cannot connect to my house wireless internet from my prolink netbook...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i know that my netbook inside should have the wireless card already or whatever you guys call it. my netbook is Not using windows XP. I am using PCLinuxOS, the latest version.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I read that this linux, also has a additonal name of minime, unlike Ubuntu, does not have wireless connection stuff things preinstalled liao... This means that PClinusOS is a very barebone linux.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the PClinuxOS control panel.... i went to the Networking section and try to setup up a internet interface... but after clicking a few things there... it was still unsuccessful...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I read that netbook usually when booted.. will automatically search for wireless connection.. but for my this prolink netbook or PClinuxOS thing.... i cannot see a blinking light on the netbook chasis indicator....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My laptop comes with a drivers and utilities CD, but since it seems to be working for windows only... i dun think my PClinuxOS requires this CD....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also read from a guy advice that what he did was to use the Kwrite to change a file so that it will cause my PC to scan for PCIMA(something like that) and allow me to be able to setup the wireless interface... tried his advice once but still cannot setup wireless successfully in the control panel Networking section....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HELp........thanks.</p>

              <p>Buy a 8 GB thumbdrive.</p>
              <p>Using a desktop or laptop computer, copy all the files in the windows XP disc into the thumbdrive.</p>
              <p>Next, plug the thumbdrive into the USB port in your Prolink netbook and install windows XP.</p>
              <p>PS : Other reasons for buying a 8 GB thumbdrive, copy CD or DVD movies and games and install them into your netbook. A DVD will take up about 4.7 GB, so you will need to buy a 8GB, not 2GB or 4GB, thumbdrive.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, thanks for those advice. I will consider them and take note.</p>
              <p>However, my current plan is to continue with my situation and solve it. I will highlight some main points</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First..some facts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Linux: PClinuxOS</p>
              <p>My prolink laptop has ethernet controller and wireless adapter which I found using lsusb and lspci which tells you what devices are connected to the PCI or USB buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, from what i have researched. Somehow the linux i have cannot detect, recognise the hardware. I do not know whether it cannot recognise ethernet controller, or wireless adapter or both. I am not sure what is the difference between these 2.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, the key is to get/download the drivers of the network hardware so that the driver will act as a communication to the linux. In order to download the right key, I have to figure out what is the model of the hardware. I have narrowed to 2 model, cause there is the ethernet controller one, and the wireless adapter one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First is RTL8187B wlan adapter (realtek), the second one is  ethernet controller:realtek semiconductor Co., Ltd. Unknown device 8136 (rev 02) ... after researching, i found that it could be RT8101E.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Downloading the correct drivers seem to still incomplete still.... even with correct drivers to devices... there seem to be further steps before my Linux can detect my house wireless. Further configuration seems to be needed still.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I read that some people need to change a file so that the netbook will detect network during bootup. I read that also someone need to ndiswrapper command to force the Linux to recognise the drivers and the device together..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hope somehow you guys can assist me... I am not sure which stage i am at now. Have I figure out the correct device ? If i have got the device right, have i downloaded the correct drivers? I do have a driver rtl8187b from the CD that comes with netbook although I do not know whether my netbook can understand that file or not cause maybe it is meant for windows execution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, if i have the correct driver? DO i need to put the driver into a correct location in the LInux so that something can happen. What else do i need to configure ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks...</p>
