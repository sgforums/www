              <p>And the HD5870 eats the GTX285 for breakfast. Then eats the GTX295 for lunch. Then kena eaten by the HD5970 :P</p>

              <p>Change to a HD5870 1GB, will give you better performance. CPU-wise, pretty much overkill. You could go AMD (And PWNED32 won't like this XP), and invest the money saved (like $400) in a 2nd graphics card (read: HD5870 CrossFireX). 750W will be enough, though I'm not too sure mynextcom has the best deal for it. RAM-wise, if you go AMD (COME TO DA DARK SIDE <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">), Get Team Xtreem RAM, very fast. If you stick to i7, keep the Kingston. Or Team Elite RAM, if you can find.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I regret recycling all my pricelists, then I can help you further leh.</p>

              <p>Seasonic makes their own power supplies, and sells them to other companies as well. These companies sell these power supplies as their own under their own brand. Thus, Seasonic is an ODM (Original Design Manufacturer).</p>
              <p>Preliminary searching has revealed that the Extreme Power Plus is made by AcBel. They aren't that bad, but Seasonic would be better in quality.</p>
              <p>Mobo-wise, if you aren't going to overclock, better off getting MSI or Gigabyte. ASUS Rampage II is meant for enthusiasts, those going to overclock to 4+GHz. EVGA, again, depends on the mobo. EVGA X58 SLI LE is a good budget choice. Or just go with Gigabyte EX58-UD3H. Very good mobo, for those who want to go Socket 1366 on a budget.</p>

              <p>HardwareZone has all the pricelists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All consumer processors now support x64. So they wouldn't affect the hardware choices, only software. I would suggest x64 and lots of RAM, since rendering with less than 4GB is not very ideal (I did 3D rendering on a Pentium M laptop with like 512MB of RAM in school. Not very fun. Kept crashing.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overclocking works by forcing your hardware to work outside what they have been officially rated for. It allows you to save money since you can gain the performance advantage of a more powerful component but having cost advantage of cheaper parts.Usually, it isn't needed. Unless you're an enthusiast. For rendering, modelling, don't overclock unless you are willing to risk corruption and instability. Use parts that are guaranteed to run at their rated speed, and use parts have conservative speeds.</p>

              <p>So I guess I'm going to look at a x64-capable mobo and prolly about 6-8gb of RAM. On to software, I'm hoping that most of the programs now are x64 compatible.</p>
              <p>Are there any other cons or downsides to overclocking? Aside from the corruption/instability issues with rendering?</p>

              <p>I think I will not be overclocking then. Don't know what parts or setup I should look at though. What kind of setups would I be looking at, a full CPU, if I had a budget of 2k and 2.5k respectively? Just the CPU, I've got a seperate budget for two LCD screens haha.</p>

              <p>Core i7. No wait, wait for Core i9 to come out, 6-core CPU. Dunno how much it will cost though.</p>
              <p>If you would be doing heavy rendering, an i7 will be the best way to go.</p>
              <p>Core i7 920</p>
              <p>12GB (6x2GB DDR3-1333)</p>
              <p>A suitable motherboard with 6 DIMM slots (Eh PWNED, help me on this leh. You using i7 right :P)</p>
              <p>2 1TB HDD RAID 1</p>
              <p>Rendering: NVidia Quadro FX graphics card (Not Quadro NVS)</p>
              <p>Gaming: Pretty much HD5800 or bust. Or when GTX 300 comes out, see which one delivers better performance.</p>
              <p>750W PSU ( Thermaltake Toughpower would be good, modular, and one of the best watt/$ ratios)</p>
              <p>Nice, cool casing. HAF 932 will keep the components nice and cool.</p>
              <p>Prolima Tech Megahalem (CPU cooler)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there is spare cash after this, I would suggest another few hard drives, in a RAID 1 (1:1 Redundancy) or RAID 5 (4 Hard Drives, mirror. Bigger capacity, but will not achieve capacity of 4 hard drives).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the graphics, it would depend in what you primarily do. If you game most of the time, put the HD5800 or the GTX 300 inside and let the CPU do the rendering. If you primarily render, but might want to game occaisionally, a good Quadro graphics card would be nice. However, keep in mind that the Quadro and FirePro cards are very expensive. You do get better warranty and higher quality than with the regular GeForce and Radeon cards.</p>

              <p>GPU-accelerated rendering only works on Quadro and FirePro. So Yes, it would still perform pretty well, but you would need a fast processor since the processor's the one computing the polygons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if you game more, HD5870 it is. And CrossFire it if you can.</p>
