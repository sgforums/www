              <p>Here u r:</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>Cloud computing is the use of computing resources (hardware and software) that are delivered as a service over a network (typically the Internet). The name comes from the common use of a cloud-shaped symbol as an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it contains in system diagrams. Cloud computing entrusts remote services with a user's data, software and computation.</p>
              <p>End users access cloud-based applications through a web browser or a light-weight desktop or mobile app while the business software and user's data are stored on servers at a remote location. Proponents claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure costs, and focus on projects that differentiate their businesses instead of infrastructure.[1] Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and enables IT to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand.[1][2][3]</p>
              <p>In the business model using software as a service, users are provided access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis. SaaS providers generally price applications using a subscription fee.</p>
              <p>Proponents claim that the SaaS allows a business the potential to reduce IT operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider. This enables the business to reallocate IT operations costs away from hardware/software spending and personnel expenses, towards meeting other IT goals. In addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can be released without the need for users to install new software. One drawback of SaaS is that the users' data are stored on the cloud provider's server. As a result, there could be unauthorized access to the data.</p>
              <p>Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network.[4] At the foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of converged infrastructure and shared services.</p>

              <p>How cloud computing works:</p>
              <p>Let's say you're an executive at a large corporation. Your particular
                   responsibilities include making sure that all of your employees have 
                  the right hardware and software they need to do their jobs. Buying computers for everyone isn't enough -- you also have to purchase software or <strong>software licenses</strong> to give employees the tools they require. Whenever you have a new hire,
                   you have to buy more software or make sure your current software 
                  license allows another user. It's so stressful that you find it 
                  difficult to go to sleep on your huge pile of money every night.</p>
              <p>Soon,
                   there may be an alternative for executives like you. Instead of 
                  installing a suite of software for each computer, you'd only have to 
                  load one application. That application would allow workers to log into a
                   Web-based service which hosts all the programs the user would need for 
                  his or her job. Remote machines owned by another company would run 
                  everything from e-mail to word processing to complex data analysis programs. It's called <strong>cloud computing</strong>, and it could change the entire computer industry.</p>
              <p>In
                   a cloud computing system, there's a significant workload shift. Local 
                  computers no longer have to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to 
                  running applications. The network of computers that make up the cloud 
                  handles them instead. Hardware and software demands on the user's side 
                  decrease. The only thing the user's computer needs to be able to run is 
                  the cloud computing system's <strong>interface software</strong>, which can be as simple as a Web browser, and the cloud's network takes care of the rest.</p>
              <p>There's
                   a good chance you've already used some form of cloud computing. If you 
                  have an e-mail account with a Web-based e-mail service like Hotmail, 
                  Yahoo! Mail or Gmail, then you've had some experience with cloud 
                  computing. Instead of running an e-mail program on your computer, you 
                  log in to a Web
                   e-mail account remotely. The software and storage for your account 
                  doesn't exist on your computer -- it's on the service's computer cloud.</p>

              <p>Cloud computing essentially is the main focus of IT departments now.  They try to improve their use of whatever cloud the company uses (be it their own or one they bought) to make the company run more efficiently.</p>
              <p>The cloud can also be used for more recreational purposes, such as this: http://www.rightbrain.sg/</p>
              <p>It really is a marvelous thing and is the present and future of IT.</p>
