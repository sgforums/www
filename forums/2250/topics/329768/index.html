              <p>Hi, I am wondering if anyone ever encountered a similar problem using WinXP whereby this message keeps appearing at the startup "<span style="color: #ff0000;">We apologize for the inconvenience, but Windows did not start successfully. A recent hardware or software change might have caused this.<br><br>If your computer stopped responding, restarted unexpectedly, or was automatically shut down to protect your file and folders, choose Last Known Good Configuration to revert to the most recent settings that worked.<br><br>If a previous start-up attempt was interrupted due to a power failure or because the power or reset button was pressed, or if you aren’t sure what caused the problem choose start windows normally.<br><br>SAFE MODE<br>SAFE MODE WITH NETWORKING<br>SAFE MODE WITH COMMAND PROMPT<br>LAST KNOWN GOOD CONFIGURATION<br>SART WINDOWS NORMALLY.</span><br>"</p>
              <p>When this message appears, I am actually given a feel options to select (ie.start windows normally, in <span id="lw_1220722987_0" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">safe mode</span>, in safe mode with <span id="lw_1220722987_1" class="yshortcuts">command prompt</span>, start using last known good configuration, etc). However, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no matter which option I choose</span></strong></span>, my PC automatically reboots (ie.never gets to the Windows mode) and reloads a screen with the "We apologize..." message, effectively starting an infinite loop.<br><br>    At <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=nph00236&amp;dlc=en"><span id="lw_1220722987_2" class="yshortcuts"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=nph00236&amp;dlc=en</span></span></span></a> , HP provides a step-by-step guide to get rid of this problem, but it doesn't seem to work on my system regardless of what I do. Effectively, I currently have two options - I either need to re-install WindowsXP and format my hard disk with no chance of backing up any files (not ideal, as there are some documents I need to access) or I basically stick with this problem.<br><br>    I am not sure what has caused this problem as from my readings online, this problem should only be caused by installation of a new hardware (I have not installed any recently). More importantly, despite being unable to load windows, I am also unable to perform any system recovery following the instructions at <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=bph07145"><span id="lw_1220722987_3" class="yshortcuts"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=bph07145</span></span></span></a> .<br><br>     Can someone help and take a look at those two links and see if there is a way to troubleshoot this problem? Thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS : I use a HP 5700 desktop...</p>

              <p>I kinda suspect it's a hardware issue too. However, I narrowed the faulty components to either being the RAM or the HDD.</p>
              <p>For a few months previously, I'd been consistently getting error messages that say my "virtual memory is too low". While nothing catastrophic has emerged from this, I tried debugging the problem by tearing my CPU apart and replacing the existing RAM with one from another desktop of mine. Even after replacing the RAM, the same problem persists (I also tried moving my RAM to one of the other free slots with no improvement).</p>
              <p>Hence, I think the problem is with my HDD. For the record, I'd also tried booting up with nothing but just my keyboard and monitor cables connected to my CPU - even then, I still can't get windows to load. Hence, unplugging component by component to diagnose this problem is out given my circumstances.</p>

              <p>My main concern now is I need access to some stuff from my HDD, so formatting the HDD and reinstalling WinXP is not an option just yet.</p>
              <p>Any chance someone might know of some technical experts you could recommend to fix this problem? Also, what's the market rate for fixing such problems? Thanks.</p>

              <p>I did nothing different. I logged off last night, things were fine. When I tried booting up this morning, the darn error started infesting my CPU.</p>
              <p>How should I go about booting up using a live CD? I don't have a rewritable CD-RW and given the pathetic condition my faulty PC is in, I can't download from that terminal either. So what do you suggest?</p>

              <p>Try to restore to the previous checkpoint if you havent already done so. Problems like this are often caused by new hardware or software, where drivers etc conflict with what was already on your system.</p>
              <p>Failing that, you can buy a cable from a computer store (not sure of the price here in Sg but in HK they are about S$5 or less incl power supply) to connect your disk via USB to your other computer. Then you should be able to retrieve your files. Of course you need to be confident that you can unplug your HDD and successfully hook this up!</p>
              <p>The only other problem i have had of this nature is when a boot sector got corrupted, but i dont think you would get this far in the boot stage if that was the case.</p>
              <p>Always keep your essential files backed up. You can buy 512Gb USB drives quite cheaply now and they are great alternatives for backing up those large music/video files. You can keep one online and one as backup. Always ensure to properly disconnect a USB drive (via the Safely Remove Hardware system tray icon) if you are not first going to turn the machine off.</p>
              <p>Post back with more details if you still have problems</p>

              <p>Edit: We're not going to back up on Linux.... data will be lost once you shut down. Rather, it's through Linux that we'll attempt to try to back up data.</p>

              <p>Try to restore to the previous checkpoint if you havent already done so. Problems like this are often caused by new hardware or software, where drivers etc conflict with what was already on your system.</p>
              <p>Failing that, you can buy a cable from a computer store (not sure of the price here in Sg but in HK they are about S$5 or less incl power supply) to connect your disk via USB to your other computer. Then you should be able to retrieve your files. Of course you need to be confident that you can unplug your HDD and successfully hook this up!</p>
              <p>The only other problem i have had of this nature is when a boot sector got corrupted, but i dont think you would get this far in the boot stage if that was the case.</p>
              <p>Always keep your essential files backed up. You can buy 512Gb USB drives quite cheaply now and they are great alternatives for backing up those large music/video files. You can keep one online and one as backup. Always ensure to properly disconnect a USB drive (via the Safely Remove Hardware system tray icon) if you are not first going to turn the machine off.</p>
              <p>Post back with more details if you still have problems</p>

              <p><br>I think it's the boot sector problem now. Got a tech guy to come and take a look, when he ran CHKDSK, the darn system ran haphazardly (ie. from 40% --&gt; 55%, then dropped back to 42%) triggering the loop of sorts.</p>
              <p>He's since taken my CPU back to perform data recovery and get my windows sorted. How did you fix your problem when (assuming you experienced this before) it was down to the boot sector getting corrupted?</p>

              <p>Thanks for the replies, folks!</p>
              <p>Let's hope I get my files recovered and the system back in working condition!</p>
