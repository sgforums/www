              <p>As the title suggests, the 2WIRE 2701HGV-E Model by singtel's mio plans offered to customers(me) is kinda crappy.</p>
              <p>everyday so long i on 8 hours or more, there will be some time where the connection just disconnects itself. the broadband link starts to weaken as the LED flickers slow and fast, the internet LED offed. This is breaking a lot of my unresumable downloads, gameplays, even worst i had once lost a project (over transfer to another person's computer via the internet) due to unrecoverable data.</p>
              <p>QN: is it the Mio Box or the long usage of the internet connection? this sorta happened when i used another modem the Aztech Hurricane. i swapped ethernet cards in my CPU, changed LAN Cables, checked the DSL connection cables. nothing's wrong. anyone got similar issues; i found several other similar forum post pertaining to this problem in other websites.</p>

              <p>There could be a lot of reasons as to why you are facing this problem.</p>
              <p>Without personally checking your network, i can't give you a sure answer.</p>
              <p>But i can tell you that i am using the same 2WIRE Modem/Router as you, and have never faced this problem even when running for 24 hours.</p>
              <p>Since you mentioned that the same thing happened with another modem, i'm guessing that its your line problem. You might want to get singtel down to test your phone line.</p>
              <p>Are you using any router besides the MIO box?</p>
              <p>And did you attach a DSL filter? just fyi(if you dont know), if you didn't, everytime someone picks up the phone, you will disconnect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope this helps!</p>

              <p>How can the modem/router all-in-one be at fault?</p>
              <p>Now most routers(if not all) are joined together with a modem...so if that is the case, the problem shouldn't only occur with singtel's one right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, different modem works differently...i have the same modem as TS, so i can say that it is not the cause.</p>

              <p>Did you notice roughly when it dc?</p>
              <p>DSL filter attached doesnt 100% mean you're safe.</p>
              <p>Two issues could still happen.</p>
              <p>One... is a faulty filter.</p>
              <p>Two... is when filtered wrongly, as in attach wrong slot.<br>The Phone line die die must go to the phone port, while modem side die die must go to the DSL port.</p>

              <p>If 100% sure is modem problem, i can only think of this few possibilities.</p>
              <p>1. Got hacker ( modem have wireless)<br>2. Settings problem<br>3. Software/Hardware problem(Try upgrading the software.If hardware then bo bian.)</p>
              <p>In this kind of situation, need to see the modem personally then will know what problem.</p>

              <p>I don't know if it's related or not, but do you have another
              wall phone jack at your house? I have two (one in living room, the
              other in my parents room).</p>
              <p>I used to have disconnected issues that was because I didn't put
              the filter in my parents room. But I connected it in there and have
              never encountered any more issues. My modem currently has been
              turned on for 1 week without any problems.</p>

              <p>Under this condition, the modem will disconnect everytime someone picks up a phone and only reconnect when all phones are back in place.</p>
              <p>He mentioned that it will not connect back, so i doubt its the case...but there is also a possibility of someone leaving the phone on after a call.</p>
