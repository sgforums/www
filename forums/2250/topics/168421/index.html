I switched on my office's Mac. As usual... the screen slowly lit up..... as usual, the Mac would display a smiling Mac icon... NOT! It displayed a sad Mac. Now, when a Mac boots up with that sad Icon, it usually meant a major problem.<br><br>Following that, I heard a weird sound coming from the CPU. It's likened the sound when you stir coffee in a cup... but in this instance.. it sounds smoother and consistent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I rebooted the comp and wala..... but comp prompted tt the HD was missing.

            <div class='col-md body'>Had this PC a long while ago. Inserted a football game CD and installed it, played for a while. I think it was FIFA 1996 that time and I owned a NEC computer, 100 MHz one, very old hardware. After shutting off my computer, I cannot get it to start the very next day. The computer was brand new, and I had to send it back for repair. Do not think this is a virus problem, must have been something else. The CD was original in the first place. Never played anymore games after that.</div>
