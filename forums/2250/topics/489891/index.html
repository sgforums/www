              <p>I bought my laptop - Lenovo U430P from my poly last year April and certain software is alrdy installed for me such as Microsoft office, myob etc.</p>
              <p>Recently, I lend my friend my USB and I didn't know it was infected with shortcut virus so I insert it into my laptop and everything is inside this suspicious looking shortcut folder but I didn't suspect at that moment and went on to open the file. After that I start to suspect and I went to try inserting my another USB which is free from virus and I found out that it gets converted into all inside a shortcut folder as well. I knew it was a virus by then.</p>
              <p>i tried the command prompt method but it cannot remove it from my laptop because I tried using a third USB and it gets converted into shortcut folder as well so I know the virus exist in my laptop. I have updated windows defender though but it can't detect this virus.</p>
              <p>I see online that wscript.exe, desktop.ini, thumbs.db should be deleted but I search it up and a lot of the same file names appear but created in diff dates. I didn't remove any yet because I'm scared it is some important files that is necessary for the laptop to function. </p>
              <p>My main purpose is to remove the shortcut virus from my LAPTOP that keeps converting my USB into a infected USB with shortcut virus because I have spare USB and I need the laptop to save school work but now I can't because I don't even dare to insert my USB anymore T_T,</p>
              <p>Should I factory restore? How do I do that? My laptop comes with windows 8.1 when I bought it and inside the package, I saw this 4 disc that states "windows 8 product recovery media". Do I need to use this 4 disc if I factory restore? I want to delete everything! I don't mind deleting those software because i can ask my school help desk On how to download it back again for free I think. I have my sch work uploaded to google drive because I didn't backup beforehand and now I can't insert any USB.  However, if the 4 disc is needed during factory restore, but he external disc drive uses a USB cable, will it get infected wight he virus as well?<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> I</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I'm really worrying abt it for one month alrdy because I can't find a solution and I emailed lenovo service centre last week and they did not reply anything to me yet. I must admit I'm a IT noob so if anything I say does not make sense please excuse me T_T. </span></p>
              <p>Pls share with me any alternatives ways as well I just rly wanna get rid of this virus from my LAPTOP only before sch reopened. Your help is greatly appreciated! </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Try to install Avira anti-virus software and see if the program can remove the virus. If it does not work, call the lenovo support helpdesk to see if the laptop is under warrenty and if it is, ask them whether you can send the laptop to them so that they can fix the problem, otherwise you better pray the phone support could help you resolve the problem. Or you can check with your poly if they have any IT department or shop that offered laptop's support for help.</p></div>
