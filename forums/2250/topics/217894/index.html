Many adopters report that only by using BitTorrent technology, with its dramatically reduced demands on networking hardware and bandwidth, could they afford to distribute their files.<br><br>Software<br><br>Many major open source and free software projects encourage BitTorrent as well as conventional downloads of their products to increase availability and reduce load on their own servers. Examples include OpenOffice.org[6] and most major Linux distributions, including SUSE[7] and Ubuntu.[8] BitTorrent is also used to distribute updates to the BitTorrent client itself, as well as to other clients such as Azureus and BitComet.<br><br>Games<br><br>Various sites on the Internet like gameupdates.org offer authorized game files via BitTorrent; the demo of the flight sim X-Plane is offered via BitTorrent, as are the World of Warcraft ingame patches. Another such example is PlaneShift, which uses BitTorrent for its primary method of distribution. For the first time, the demo of Football Manager 2007 is offered for download through BitTorrent.<br><br>Film and video<br><br>The film studio Warner Brothers Entertainment plans to distribute its films and TV shows using Bittorrent.[9] The fan-film Star Wars: Revelations is distributing two DVD images as well as the film by itself via BitTorrent, while Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning and Cactuses, both feature-length films, were provided for download via BitTorrent. The fan-films Star Trek: New Voyages are distributed via BitTorrent among other methods.<br><br>mariposaHD is the first HDTV series made to be distributed over the internet. The free Creative-Commons licensed videos are available in both (1080p and 720p) HD formats. By utilizing Microsoft's WMV HD video codec to compress the videos and BitTorrent to transfer the files, mariposaHD are able to distribute data intensive high definition video over the internet at relatively modest cost.<br><br>Music<br><br>The SXSW (South by South West) music festival in Austin, Texas has released two packages of mp3 music filesÂ—nearly a thousand tracksÂ—from their 2006 festival by BitTorrent download, along with trailers to two DVD films that can be purchased.[10] Babyshambles, Pete Doherty's band, distributes two collections of music, Shaking and Withdrawn Megamix and Untitled by Bittorrent from their official website.[11] In 2005, the rock group Harvey Danger began distributing their third full-length album, Little by Little..., using BitTorrent. Discipline Global Mobile (the record label/website begun by Robert Fripp) uses BitTorrent technology to distribute. Folk punk band Defiance Ohio distributes their music from their website using mp3's, ogg's and torrents. The free music portal Jamendo also uses BitTorrent to distribute its 1000+ albums.</strong><br></blockquote>Edit: Thanks davidche for pointing out.

            <div class='col-md body'>Saw this in a drama forum that I usually haunt to get my drama torrents  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Q5. Why is my download so slow? Why am I not downloading faster? There's many seeds and peers, but why is the torrent is moving slow?<br>ANSWER:<br><br>****SLOW SPEED****<br><br>if you're wondering why it's taking so long for you to complete (downloading so slow), there may be several reasons:<br><br>==MISCONFIGURED ROUTER/FIREWALL==<br>is the light (or text) on your BT client YELLOW? did you 'forward the ports' on your router or 'open the ports' on your firewall?<br>help yourself complete faster (and make life easier on the seeder) by going to the SUPPORT section and reading TWEAKING BITTORRENT. it may take you a few hours to configure, but it'll save you DAYS of downloading time later!<br>not sure if you're configured right? see if you pass the nat check: http://btfaq.com/natcheck.pl<br><br>==TOO MANY TORRENTS OPEN==<br>many people make the mistake of trying to dl/seed too many torrents at one time. be PATIENT and not GREEDY. you will find that your speeds will probably improve if you limit yourself to 2-3 torrents at a time, rather than trying to dl four or more.<br><br>==ADJUSTING UPLOAD SPEED==<br>make sure you are not using 100% of your upload speed (we recommend using about 80-90% of your max upload speed).<br><br>also, make sure you're not choking it down to a minimum 3kB either! i've noticed that on most torrents, the higher i set my ul speed, the greater my dl speed.<br><br>example: let's say your max upload is 96kB.<br>if you set your torrent upload at 96kB (100%), you computer would not be able to perform other small network functions such as sending/receiving acknowledgement packets, etc.<br>if you set it too low (like 3kB), you may not get much in return. (bittorrent rewards SHARING.)<br><br>not sure what your max upload speed should be?<br>...1) you can call your isp and ask them what your ul speed should be. divide this number by eight and you will get your BT speed (example: 768kb = 96kB) (kb stands for kilobits; kB stands for kilobytes. 8 bits = 1 byte. Your bittorrent client measures speed in bytes while your ISP usually advertises speed in bits.)<br>...2) google for 'bandwidth speed test' and see if you can find a test for your UPLOAD speed. i know that www.dslreports.com has one.<br>...3) test it w/ your BT client. after you complete a torrent, turn off ALL other dl/ul's. set your client to 'SEED = UNLIMITED'. see how high your ul speed goes. try this with several torrents, and you will eventually figure out what your max BT ul speed is.<br><br>==UPLOAD RATE vs MAX UPLOADS==<br>many users think the best method of sharing is to spread it among the MOST amount of peers. (example: you set upload at 40kB; and set max uploads to 20 peers. each peer gets 2kB per second.) this is actually a poor method and inefficient use of BT.<br><br>BT chops a torrent up into "pieces". you cannot share a piece until you have COMPLETED that piece. therefore, if you have a 500MB torrent, it may chop it up into one hundred 5MB pieces.<br>if each peer is getting only 2kB per second, it will take a looooong time before a peer completes a 5MB piece to share.<br>instead, the better method is to set the amount of peers as LOW as possible. this way, each peer gets more kB per second. peers COMPLETE pieces faster, and thus, SHARE pieces faster.<br><br>==SUPER-SEED ON?==<br>some people think the word 'super' is pretty cool, so they always turn super-seed on. the super-seed option is not to be turned on unless you are the ONLY seeder on the torrent. otherwise, DO NOT turn it on.<br>more super-seed info: http://www.bittornado.com/docs/superseed.txt<br><br>==FRAGMENTED HARD DRIVE==<br>sometimes a highly fragmented hard drive can actually cause your computer to run slower.<br>right-click on your C: drive (or your dl drive) and choose 'properties'. click on the 'tools' tab and choose 'defragment now'.<br>click 'analyze', and repeat for every drive that you have. are your drives highly fragmented? stop everything and take the time to defrag and reboot.<br>you'll find that a UNfragmented drive will allow you to allocate a file faster and may improve speed.<br><br>==OTHER MISCELLANEOUS FACTORS THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT==<br>* your ISP is throttling/limiting BT traffic (or p2p traffic, in general). if you're brave, you can call them and ask them if they have this policy.<br>* the peers you are connected to are very slow uploaders. they might have a very low upload speed or are setting their upload speed too low.<br>* the peers that are on the torrent have not configured their router/computer correctly for BT (you may have yours set up properly, but they may not).<br>* there is something wrong with the connection(s) between you and the other peers. you could try dropping off and connecting later, or wait for the situation to improve.<br><br>Taken from <a href="http://www.d-addicts.com" rel="nofollow">here</a></div>
