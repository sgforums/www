              hey everyone, im a newbie in building up a desktop. but since my frens tell me that build desktop better and cheaper than buying a pre built one off the shop, i think i might wanna try making one...
              my main objective of the desktop is that it should be compatable for future upgrades and i will be using it mainly for gaming and that 3D vision ready would be great! haha... the cpu casing: i hope that have window and led lights and the cooling system is using the liquid thingy de... dun like fan... like so lao tu.. haha...
              erm monitor: big big good... but dun too big i get headachee when play too long xD
              erm willing to spend 4k max to build.. should include cpu, monitor, keyboard and speakers ba... mouse dunnid... pls help... xD i most likely buy end of the year ard dec after my a lvl.. erm... yea... so pls help... :) thx a lot everyone!

              <p>Bro, concentrate on your A levels first. Besides, once your A-levels finished there will be more powerful stuff released by Intel and AMD, so whatever is out now may be outdated once you decide to buy it.</p>

              <p>Liquid cooling is supposed to be a lot more efficient and silent than air-cooling, but I beg to differ. Yes, liquid cooling is cool (literally and figuratively), but there is the chance of leaks and failures within the unit. I find air-cooling more reliable in this sense.</p>

              and about motherboards, what is the one we usually use? they say support this and that but i dunnoe which one we usually use haha...
              about the comps that use liquid cooling, example would be acer predator 7750 jus came out as well ... as hp voodoo seriesxD

              <p>It all depends on your use..</p>
              <p>Don't go out and pick parts that you have absolutely no use for. That's just wasting your money.</p>
              <p>As for liquid cooling, there are basically two kinds.</p>
              <p>The basic type like Corsair H50 and upcoming H70, built by Asetek. These are highly similar to the 'watercooling' used in HP Voodoo, Acer Predator, Dell Alienware etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other kind would be a full custom loop in which you willl have to buy radiators, waterblocks, pumps, reservoirs, tubing, anti-kink coils, fans and other things like coolant with anti-algae (high silver content) and antifreeze.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do wish to go into custom watercooling be warned that it is not cheap in the least way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Much effort and money has to be spent building the loop and to get the effects you desire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, don't say air cooling is lao tu. Radiators from a water cooling loop will still have to make use of fans to cool the liquid passing thru them, so fans are still an important part of the system.</p>

              <p>for cooling system do you find car that is cooled by fan or air? so far only one type of car. now all car is cooled by water. the problem is car is moving all the time and cooling is efficient. unlike computer stays put and never move at all. you had seen cars that stuck in the traffic jam and got over heated with steam all over the places.</p>
              <p>if your computer got cooled really fast, the heat will be traferred to the room. you will notice the room get warmed pretty fast if you did not turn on the house fan.</p>
              <p>personally water cool is not really that great, you still need a fan to cool down the water.</p>
              <p>so what it matters is the noise that is created by the fan. how much noice you can take it.</p>
