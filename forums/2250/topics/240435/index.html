            <div class='col-md body'>SimLim? Don't really trust the place there. My friend brought his CPU to install a RAM bought from one of the shops. When he brought it home, he realised the shop changed his 2.4GHz processor to 1.2GHz. Very untrustworthy. Anyway, what's about the price to build a comp with a decent graphic for occastionally gaming, decent soundcard, 2.4GHz processor and 1GB RAM?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no fun in DIY if you don't assemble the PC yourself. If you gonna get some guys to assemble it for you might as well get an OEM like Dell or Acer. Don't be surprised you will go into some trouble if someone else install everything for you with all the separate hardware you chose. Get an OEM you are still backed by warranty and aftersale service.<br><br>For complete noob you have to get to know all the processors and the mainboards with the various chipsets. Learn the form factor and how each processor type fits into the board. Getting the incorrect pin count means a misfit. For graphics card its the same but you should not go wrong, after all there's only 2~3 sizes to choose from - AGP, PCI-e or PCI2.3. Hard disk SATAII and RAM DDR(2) should be the trend now while most card should support larger screens and wide resolution too. PC case sizes are still generic at ATX while the ROM and Floppy still stays. You do have to take note of the output power pin count for the PSU to choose from as the correct type with enough power will then be able to flare up your system and run it steady. As for sound you can add a card but for the average user, the onboard sound chip at the mainboard should be all that is needed.<br><br>OS is the other important thing and for a first build it usually takes up a portion of the budget.</div>
