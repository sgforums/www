              <p><span class="newsText"><span class="custom_itxt"><em><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong></em> -- AMD announces that starting next month, the company plans to release
              for download a free ATI Catalyst driver update that instantly unlocks
              new ATI Stream acceleration capabilities already built into millions of
              ATI Radeon graphics cards.<br><br>ATI Stream is a set of advanced
              hardware and software technologies that enable AMD graphics processors
              (GPU), working in concert with the system’s central processor (CPU), to
              accelerate applications beyond just graphics. This results in better
              balanced platforms capable of running demanding computing tasks faster
              than ever1.<br><br>ATI Stream-enabled software titles for
              entertainment, gaming and productivity are being released or are under
              development by a growing list of independent software vendors (ISVs)
              including ArcSoft and CyberLink.<br><br>To give users immediate benefit
              from ATI Stream, AMD also plans to release in December a free
              downloadable version of its ATI Avivo Video Converter utility. This
              intuitive, easy-to-use application enables transcoding of HD video up
              to 17 times faster1 than with the CPU alone, in tests performed using
              an ATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics card. “ATI Stream is one of the best
              examples of the power of Fusion, and today’s announcement is the first
              major step in taking this important new technology mainstream,” said
              Rick Bergman, senior vice president and general manager, Graphics
              Products Group, AMD. “For the millions of people that have already
              purchased an ATI Radeon HD 4000 series graphics card, this is one more
              way we’re saying thank you and helping them get more out of their
              investment. For those who haven’t yet, it’s one more reason for them to
              go online right now and buy one.”<br><br> ATI Radeon graphics
              processors from AMD are already found in millions of PCs around the
              world, each running the ATI Catalyst software driver. In the past 12
              months, the various ATI Catalyst driver packages have been downloaded
              48 million times, averaging nearly four million downloads each month.<br><br> The next ATI Catalyst release is version 8.12. AMD has begun
              distributing a beta version to its hardware and software technology
              partners for testing, with the final version scheduled to be released
              for download on or around December 10. Once installed, the driver
              package automatically turns on the ATI Stream acceleration capabilities
              within ATI Radeon HD 4000 series graphics cards. This will have the
              immediate effect of allowing any ATI Stream-enabled application to run
              faster, with no special effort required by consumers to enable this
              technology. As always, expert users will have the ability to customize
              their ATI Catalyst driver install options.<br><br>Users can then
              download and install the free ATI Avivo Video Converter. In tests
              performed using this utility, AMD was able to convert an hour of video
              to a portable player format in about 12 minutes. Combined with one of
              the recent ATI Radeon HD 4000 series graphics card offerings, the ATI
              Avivo Video Converter helps deliver video conversion at up to twice the
              speed of competing solutions, at just over half of the suggested retail
              price.2<br><br>A growing number of ISVs are also lining up to provide
              ATI Stream-enabled applications, including ArcSoft, a leading provider
              of innovative digital imaging technologies and multimedia solutions.
              The company plans to provide an update in December to its TotalMedia
              Theatre application that will includes ArcSoft SimHD, a new type of
              post processing technology that allows consumers to experience
              close-to-HD viewing of standard definition content thanks to ATI
              Stream. Another is CyberLink, an innovative software developer for
              digital media creation, playback, sharing, and enjoyment applications,
              has optimized its award-winning video editing software, PowerDirector
              7. PowerDirector provides a robust set of features and functionality
              for capturing, editing and distributing HD video. The updated version,
              which is scheduled to be released in Q1 2009 will include ATI Stream
              accelerated video conversion, featuring performance and functionality
              exceeding that of the Avivo Video Converter.<br><br> To ensure easier
              development of ATI Stream enabled applications capable of running on
              platforms from multiple vendors, AMD is a member of the Khronos working
              group defining the OpenCL standard, and is evolving the ATI Stream SDK
              to be fully OpenCL compliant.</span></span>   <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LOL?</strong></span></p>
