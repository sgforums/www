              <p><span class="postbody">Fact sheet: IT Industry is affected by the Financial Crisis
              <br> On Sept 30 2008, Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft spoke at a news
              conference in Norway "We have a lot of business with the corporate
              sector as well as with the consumer sector and whatever happens
              economically will certainly effect itself on Microsoft," he told
              Reuters.
              <br> "I think one has to anticipate that no company is immune to these issues," he said.
              <br> <br>Meantime, stock price of Apple dropped 40% during 6 weeks. On the
              other hand, according to the Forrester’s survey(a research company
              based in USA), nearly 43% company cut down the budget on IT to deal
              with the financial crisis, Besides more than 49% IT dept in financial
              industry has the same planning. <br> Furthermore, from the majority IT Company’s third quarter Financial
              Report, we can see the whole industry meet a large decline in sales; it
              marks that the winter for IT industry coming.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why financial crisis affect IT industry? </span> <br>As we know, financial industry is the most important factor in the
              economy development. When financial organization suffered a great loss,
              the financial crisis will become credit crisis. It means currency
              circulation crisis, then it’s very difficult for us to borrow money
              from bank. Without the support from financial organizations, a large
              amount of companies will meet a financial shortage and have to cut down
              the budget. <br> <br> Secondly, the inconsistent trend of financial situation that cause the
              shrinking discretionary spending. Corporations and individuals keep
              their pocket tight and wait and see; it is going to affect business
              investment concerning consumer spending on IT products
              <br> <br>Thirdly, each industry is connected and affected by the economic
              structure. Since the bankruptcy of banks and financial organizations,
              how can IT industry be immune from this crisis but ignoring the
              interactional linkage?
              <br> <br> <strong>Is there any solution for IT Firms to survive from the financial crisis? </strong><br>The answer is absolutely yes. Those are “innovation in technology,
              switch or begin into new business sector” can definitely survive and
              grow their business, though the financial crisis took all us to a
              predicament. <br> Nevertheless, Crisis not only gives us challenge but also Opportunity.
              Challenge and Opportunity are twins and often appear simultaneously.
              <br>Let’s analyze the current situation in IT Industry. Since the
              shrinking purchase power, most companies would prefer to maintain and
              repair their IT hardware instead of buying new ones. For the IT
              service/Repair Firms, they will not decrease but get more business. <br> However, we can not ignore the crisis and wait passively.  We have to expand our business arrange and survive from it. 
              <br> For example, IT firms can invest and start new business in IT industry:
              computer application service, computer maintenance, data
              backup/recovery and etc. <br> Along with the proliferation of computers in business, the demand for
              various incidental IT services is increasing. Data recovery service is
              one of these incidental services and the most promising one.
              <br> <br> <strong>Why Data Recovery is a most promising service for IT firms? </strong><br>Firstly, Data loss not only means a large sum of cost wasting for
              companies. It also hampers routines and slows down development of
              enterprise. So if there is any way to rescue the data and avoid the
              loss, all companies are willing to accept and buy the service.
              <br>Secondly, IT firms have one unique advantage to start Data
              Recovery Service. Mostly, Data loss is always companied by computer
              crash. When Computer Crash happened, most clients wouldn’t realize that
              they need data recovery service. They prefer to call IT service
              companies to repair their computer. So if IT firms can provide data
              recovery service while clients need it, it is very favorable for both
              clients and IT firms.
              <br>Thirdly, data recovery is new and it has bright prospective
              future. If you heard of the JBL ad on airplane and know JBL starts
              providing Data Recovery Service, how will you response on that? <br> <br> So for most IT firms, Data Recovery Service can be new revenue.
              <br> <br> <strong>What Procedure is Data Recovery assignment involved? </strong><br> The following three issues are critical for your data recovery
              business. They includes the first (Technical Know-How) and the last two
              (Marketing Plan and Financial Resources) followed only if you can
              handle the first. <br> <br> Technical Know-How: As this industry is professional, specialized
              know-how is required to handle the varied types of data recovery
              assignments. Generally speaking, there is 3+1 work flow applicable to
              all data recovery case:
              <br> <br>Of all the stages, Stage 3—data retrieval, is the most widely
              spread and long-running; all data recovery companies, even end users,
              by downloading software, can handle mission of this stage easily. But
              according to SalvationDATA experts only 30 to 40 percent of all data
              recovery cases are simply stage 3 cases. The left percentage requires
              an ability to handle with the stage 2 and stage plus 1 issue. <br> <br> Stage 2, disk data extraction, is also widely known and adopted as
              “disk imaging” by data recovery services nowadays. But according to our
              company, SalvationDATA, most of our potential clients perform this
              important stage using ghosting tools designed for and work on good HDDs
              only, not the patient HDDs that are unstable or inaccessible because of
              media defects and instable head, which are common challenges of Stage 2
              in practice. Even more, with those traditional imaging tools, the time
              involved and the ordinary user-level repeated-read access to the media
              bring a risk of damaging the disk and head, making data lost
              irretrievable.
              <br> <br>Stage 1, drive diagnosis &amp; restoration, is the primary stage in
              a broad sense data recovery flow but in fact deals with the deepest
              level in 3+1 broad sense data recovery flow. Unfortunately, Stage 1 is
              missing from most of the data services or even went unnoticed. It was
              simply done in a zigzag procedure and often incorrectly due to lack of
              proper tools. By so doing it was as good as putting away customers and
              profits. Our data has shown that up to 40% of data recovery cases have
              Stage 1 issues; and that IS NOT what going to happen that we can skip
              Stage 1 and perform Stage 2 and 3 and still to get certain percentage
              of data. You CAN NOT get anything in case you are not capable for the
              primary stage.
              <br> <br>Plus 1, refers to Head or Platter Exchanger when encountered with
              motor seizure or head crash. This kind of problem often happens where
              the Drive is clicking or dropping from height. Concerning this issue,
              you need to replace the components and fix the mechanical malfunction
              first.
              <br> <br> From above 3+1 work flow, you may get know the basic guidance of data recovery.
              <br> <br> <strong>Then let’s move the following 2 factors which are relevant to your data recovery service.
              <br></strong> <br>Marketing Plan: It is the same as other service you are engaged in.
              It needs marketing plans and strategy. You should think more about
              customers’ convenience, satisfaction, price setting, and target market.
              If possible, you need advertising on different mediums too.
              <br> <br>Financial Resources: Of course you need budget to get the business
              started before you benefit from your investment. You need facilities
              like a Clean Room and equipments to carry out the assignments. You also
              need to pay expensive technicians.
              <br> <br>Supposing the Marketing and Financial investment are not the
              barriers to stop you, then you need think more about the facilities and
              data recovery equipments.
              <br> <br>We have to admit that Data Recovery is a game for professionals and
              engineers to play, it is impossible to get started without any HDD Data
              Recovery Equipments provider.
