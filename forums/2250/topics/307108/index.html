              <p>Hi, any of u here has your own blog/website and uses Google Adsense?</p>
              <p>was wondering how long do u all take to achieve $100? the minimum amount before they send out the check.</p>

              <p>It will take forever unless traffic to your site is coming in by the thousands daily or your visitors are kind enough to click on them. Because from what I remember, the rate for CPM ads (cost per thousand impression) is below a dollar, unless your site contains adult material. If you have quality content, I would actually suggest buying the CPM ads here (it's fucking cheap at $0.02 SGD, or $0.03 for sgGirls.com, per CPM, which I'm considering to purchase as well) to link to your site and place Adsense ads there.</p>
              <p>And by the way, Adsense would probably have earned a lot from naive webmasters (which I once was) through unpaid payments due to its minimum $100 policy. So you would want to consider that before joining the slaves who are doing free labour for them when the quota is not hit.</p>
              <p>You may wish to look at other advertising programs that are much more well-paid than Adsense (btw, Adsense is not really that good on the publishers' side) as well. One of them which deserve some consideration in my opinion is Text-Link-Ads.com. But I guess that you're planning to place ads on your Blogspot site, which may not be compatible with their scripts.</p>
              <p>Another alternative would be to contact potential advertisers directly. You'll need to be confident of constant traffic flow to your site and quality content, of course, and this method gives you the most bucks versus all other methods since there's no middleman. Some may even offer a commission for you per sale completed as well. For example, if you own an established anime blog site, you can call up small retailers selling anime-related merchandise such as figurines and DVDs to ask if they are interested to work out an advertisement deal with you.</p>
              <p>One more would be to run your own advertisement program. Kinda tedious, since you'll need the server resources and advertisers who are interested to place their ads on your site. One great example would be sgForums.com itself. But as mentioned earlier, it is selling its ads at $0.02 CPM, so I don't think you would want to compete with that.</p>

              <p>Oh. I remember a web tech-oriented forum was doing it as well, which is sharing approx 50% of its ads revenue with its members. I can only remember that it had a green background and using IPB or vB for the backend. This tactic is quite effectively imo, since it will spur members to click on the ads and become more active on the forums.</p>
