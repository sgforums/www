              <p>To be honest, touchscreen is a gimmick. Most people I know revert back to the ol' mouse and keyboard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do want to get this, get Spec 2. For $300 more, you get an All-In-One (AIO) that can actually play games. The i5 CPU is also more powerful than the i3.</p>

              <p>1TB can last a long time. We don't know what kind of hard drive they will be using, but knowing Acer, it's probably a Hitachi or Toshiba unit. These are pretty good drives, nothing special, but pretty good.</p>

              <p>If I were you, I would not go for Acer. I'm not sure whether I'm just unlucky, or it's just the quality of Acer. After less than 6 months, my desktop's dvd drive failed. Then I've recently bought a new Acer laptop, within a week, the battery couldn't be charged.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i see no purpose in having a touchscreen monitor, its more energy consuming to use the touchscreen then the conventional keyboard and mouse. Furthermore, if anything goes wrong, the repair is going to cost way more than of an average cpu because it is all built in.</p>
              <p>Spec wise, both are fine for work.etc, but it really depends on how you use it. If I were you, i would get Hp/Compaq, or a Mac over this.</p>

              <p>i3 has no turbo. and that processor model is dual core.</p>
              <p>while i5 750 is a quad core processor.</p>
              <p>if you do alot of processing, the i5 would be better.</p>

              <p>Can explain what happened?</p>
              <p>your situation could be a one-off, and that wouldn't be fair for the manufacturers.</p>
              <p>most of the time is problem caused by user.</p>
              <p>i'm using a HP, and i didn't get any un-solveable problems so far.</p>
