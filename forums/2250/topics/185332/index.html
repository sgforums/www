            <div class='col-md body'>Apple unveils software to permit Windows use<br>By Duncan Martell<br><br>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Computer Inc. , the maker of the Macintosh computer and iPod music player, on Wednesday rolled out a first-ever software patch to run Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system on its PCs, a move that could draw millions of new buyers.<br><br>Apple shares surged 9 percent on Nasdaq, where it was the second most active issue. The move could also effectively bring to a close a decades-long rivalry between Apple and Microsoft over their respective operating systems.<br><br>By allowing Macs to run Microsoft Corp.'s Windows, the operating system found on more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers, Apple could woo people who want Macs, which are considered by many as easier to use and more stylish, but prefer the Windows operating system.<br><br>In June 2005, Apple said it would switch to Intel Corp. chips from those made by International Business Machines Corp. , citing the performance advantages of Intel processors.<br><br>"Ever since we introduced Macs using Intel chips, we've had some customers asking, 'Hey, can you run Windows on these Macs as well?"' said Phil Schiller, head of worldwide product marketing for Apple, in an interview.<br><br>Apple, which celebrated its 30th birthday on April 1, will move its entire Mac line to Intel chips by the end of 2007.<br><br>Schiller said company research showed two groups of potential Mac customers, what it called "switchers," or those likely to switch from Windows to the Mac OS X operating system.<br><br>The first group included those who are open to using a Mac but want to run programs that work only on Windows, such as Microsoft's Outlook calendar program, which isn't supported on Mac OS X, or popular video games.<br><br>The second group, Schiller said, included those open to using the Mac OS X PC, but wanting a "safety net" if they choose to run Windows.<br><br>"Most of them will switch and find they never need to run Windows," Schiller said.<br><br>Apple, with about 3 percent of the worldwide PC market, said the "Boot Camp" software, available immediately as a download, enables Macs to run either Windows XP or the Mac OS X operating software.<br><br>Apple rivals Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. and other PC makers use Windows as the operating system for its desktop and notebook PCs.<br><br>BIGGER BITE OF THE MARKET?.....<br><br><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060405/3/3zvmy.html" rel="nofollow">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060405/3/3zvmy.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Apple Computer, in a move to reach out to a broader market, unveiled software that enables its Mac computers with Intel processors to run rival Microsoft's Windows XP operating system.<br><br>Apple said that its software, called Boot Camp, was available for download starting Wednesday, and that the application will be a feature in Leopard, the company's next major release of the Mac operating system.<br><br>The move marks another shift for Apple to reach a broader group of computer users, the vast majority of whom use the Microsoft operating system.<br><br>Though Apple still sees itself as a major rival to Microsoft, it has made concessions to Windows users such as allowing them to use its wildly popular iPod music players and iTunes music store. Windows is used on more than 90 percent of personal computers.<br><br>Apple first announced plans to begin using Intel processors in its Mac computers in June and the products began shipping in mid-January.<br><br>The company said the Boot Came software is a preview version licensed for use on a trial basis. Apple also said it will not provide support for installing or running Boot Camp and noted it does not sell or support Windows software.<br><br>"Apple has no desire or plan to sell or support Windows, but many customers have expressed their interest to run Windows on Apple's superior hardware now that we use Intel processors," said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing.......<br><br>"We think Boot Camp makes the Mac even more appealing to Windows users considering making the switch."<br><br>"A key reason why Apple hasn't gotten more 'switchers' is likely due to a lack of strong Windows compatibility," said Shaw Wu, of American Technology Research. "We believe this is a big deal and potentially could be a significant game changer."<br><br>Joe Wilcox, analyst at Jupiter Research, said the move could provide an incentive to purchase the Macintosh by allowing users access to a broader variety of Windows software.<br><br>"Apple has removed another barrier to switching," he said.<br><br>But he noted that the cost of Mac is already higher and that users will have to buy the Windows software as well.<br><br>"Consumers would pay a premium, as much as 200 dollars for Windows XP Home, as installation would require full version, not the upgrade," Wilcox said.<br><br>"So cost would remain a barrier to switching for some folks. A 1,299-dollar iMac would look more like 1,500 dollars when adding the cost of Windows XP Home."<br><br><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060405/1/3zvno.html" rel="nofollow">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060405/1/3zvno.html</a></div>
