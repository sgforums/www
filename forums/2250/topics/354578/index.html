              <p>Failure rate means the HDD spoil or malfunction.</p>
              <p>traditional laptop hard drives have a higher failure rate than desktop ones due to the heat, wear, shocks and mainly the moving mechanical parts.One of the most commonly repaired/replaced item in computers is the HDD.</p>
              <p>it is reason for inventing SSD drive because of its speed , reliability ( much less failure rate) and no moving mechanical parts</p>
              <p>SSD is a worthy investment for laptop</p>

              <p> The rapid technological advancement of computer technology has brought numerous changes to the way we use our computer. Aside from introducing new computer application software, these changes are apparent to our data and filing system tools. Most of these changes either welcome a new gadget or replace an old computer gadget to improve the efficiency, accuracy and speed of computer applications.<br><br>Since data storage devices are getting smaller, thinner and more compact and convenient to carry, old and bulky discs will eventually be phased out. They are expected to be replaced by more reliable, better, smaller and external file storage devices called Solid State Drives (SSD). Manufacturers agree that SSD will be the future of the computer storage devices. With their better and energy-efficient features, no one can resist the improvements that it delivers on the traditional filing and data storage system of the computer hard disk.<br><br>Compared to the traditional hard disk drives, SSD is better in terms of power consumption and speed. Since SSD was created after the hard disk drive, it carries more advanced technologies. Its data saving capabilities are rather more sophisticated to that of a hard disk drive. Power saving features has constantly been a part of the modification and improvements done on existing computer gadgets, components and parts. Understandably, the more sophisticated SSD are more power-efficient when compared to the older hard disk drives. Another SSD advantage is the design and material used in its overall construction. Because of its sturdy construction, it is virtually resistant to the damaging effects of falls or shock. Another advantage of SSD over hard disc drives is the size and weight, as you put an SSD and a hard disk drive of exact data storage capacities side by side, the difference will be obvious. Traditional hard disk drives are bulkier and heavier when compared to the light and compact construction of an SSD. Just imagine how much more data an SSD of a hard disk drives size store.<br><br>Manufacturers say that SSD secures files and data better against commonly destructive environmental factors. In case of accidents such as falls or even fire, the files saved on SSD are more likely to be recovered than those saved on a traditional hard disk. This is because SSD lacks the moving parts that are typically found inside a hard disk drive. When performance comparisons where done on various models of laptops, SSDs took the lead in performance scores and evaluations. The traditional hard disk drives remain competitive in achieving marginal difference in the scores achieved by SSDs.<br><br>Flash-based storage devices are nothing new to computers these days. Beyond their practical multi-functional features, these devices have evolved into a welcome accessory. Undeniably, SSD presents more practical, reliable and overall better storage and filing system security options to computer users. These devices are said to eventually replace the traditional hard drives of the computer. However, due to its high-cost, time will only tell for that to happen. But just like other computer devices, it only takes time for these great inventions to become cheap enough for the general public's use.<br>Derek Rogers is a freelance writer who writes for a number of UK businesses. For information on storing your data, he recommends using a solid state drive.<br></p>

              <p>It is better to store your OS on the SSD, as how much files can you stuff into a 32GB SSD? If you really want to put your data, everything into the SSD's, make sure you have a lot of cash. Get 2 250GB SSD, like OCZ Core V2 series or the Intel X-25 SSD's and 1 500GB regular HDD, put them in a RAID 0+1 setup. Given a good Southbridge/Northbridge or dedicated RAID card, you can have 200+ MB/s read, 170+MB/s write speed. The HDD is there to back up everything.</p>

              <p>It is better to store your OS on the SSD, as how much files can you stuff into a 32GB SSD? If you really want to put your data, everything into the SSD's, make sure you have a lot of cash. Get 2 250GB SSD, like OCZ Core V2 series or the Intel X-25 SSD's and 1 500GB regular HDD, put them in a RAID 0+1 setup. Given a good Southbridge/Northbridge or dedicated RAID card, you can have 200+ MB/s read, 170+MB/s write speed. The HDD is there to back up everything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SSD's are a good investment for the businessman or executive. they are hardy, shock proof, reliable and will improve the battery life of your laptop. Also very shockproof.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sory if my posts tend to be very wordy. But are you going to get an SSD soon? I might be able to help with the SSD you buy.</p>

              <p>data like word doc, pdf files. of course not photos or videos. if the job requires that kind of files for storage, then i think SSD is just not the most economical way.</p>

              <p>u see, SSD is good for running OS, storage can be any other optipn. But what we are talking about is stability of OS under SSD platform.</p>

              <p>BRO, U DONT GET IT. WHEN OS ALSO FAIL, U CANNOT ACCESS YR DATA. I presume that the word "Data" refers to programs and files which the OS uses, not generic stuff lke mP3s or word files.</p>
              <p> U store yr OS on a SSD, it will be less likely to fail, response and read/write operations are snappier and u get to do things like video editing, surfing internet  or other processing much faster and less likely to hang and give u errors.

              <p>you don't get it too. programs are afterall programs, can be reinstalled. data files, on the other hand maybe accumulated work and when lost, it maybe a few years of lost work. if you know the necessary files to extract, you can fish out just the data files needed to open it with another system with the same program. </p>
              <p>now i see that you want to save the whole chunk of data and programs, then i will go with Raraken on, how much can you store on a 32GB SSD?</p>
