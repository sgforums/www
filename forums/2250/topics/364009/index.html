              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">Tuesday, June 9, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>It's a familiar scene in airports and 
              train stations. Hands full with luggage, briefcase, laptop or coat and there's 
              something you need to remember, like the level and row numbers where you parked 
              your car in the deck. What do you do? <br><br>Instead of relying on your memory, 
              or finding a place to put all your stuff down to find a pen and paper, wouldn't 
              it be so convenient to simply write "level 4, row H" in the air and be able to 
              retrieve it later? <br><br>Engineering students at Duke University have taken 
              advantage of the accelerometers in emerging cell phones to create an application 
              that permits users to write short notes in the air with their phone, and have 
              that message automatically sent to an e-mail address. <br><br>Accelerometers are 
              the devices in phones that not only keep track of the phone's movements, but 
              make it possible for the display screens to rotate from landscape to portrait 
              modes depending on how the phone is rotated. These devices are always "on," so 
              there is no additional burden on the phone to use this new application. 
              <br><br>"We developed an application that uses the built-in accelerometers in 
              cell phones to recognize human writing," said Sandip Agrawal, electrical and 
              computer engineering senior at Duke's Pratt School of Engineering, who with Duke 
              graduate student Ionut Constandache developed the PhonePoint Pen. "By holding 
              the phone like a pen, you can write short messages or draw simple diagrams in 
              the air. <br><br>"The accelerometer converts the gestures to images, which can 
              be sent to any e-mail address for future reference," Constandache said. "Also, 
              say you're in a class and there is an interesting slide on the screen. We 
              foresee being able to take a photo of the slide and write a quick note on it for 
              future reference. The potential uses are practically limitless. That this 
              prototype works validates the feasibility of such a pen." <br><br>Agrawal, a 
              Pratt Engineering Undergraduate Fellow, received the inaugural Hoffman + 
              Krippner Award for Excellence in Student Engineering for the development of the 
              PhonePoint Pen application. The award, created by the German technology firm 
              Hoffman + Krippner, was presented Tuesday, June 9 during the 2009 Sensors Expo 
              and Conference in Chicago. <br><br>While this first generation application 
              permits the writing of short messages or simple drawings, it is only a matter of 
              time before this prototype system will be able to handle larger and more complex 
              air-writing capabilities, according to Agrawal's mentor, Romit Roy Choudhury, 
              assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering. <br><br>"One of the 
              efforts of our group (</span><a href="http://synrg.ee.duke.edu/microblog.html"><span style="color: #333333;">http://synrg.ee.duke.edu/microblog.html</span></a><span style="color: #333333;">) is to take a fresh 
              look at how people get their information into the Internet," Roy Choudhury said. 
              "We're trying to get past the whole idea of typing on a keyboard or using a 
              stylus to enter information into devices. Many people get discouraged with 
              current phones and their small keys. As phones get smaller, this frustration 
              will only grow. <br><br>"And today, especially now in the age of Twitter and 
              micro-blogs, the speed in which you send information becomes more important," 
              Roy Choudhury said. "To be able to write quickly using only one hand would be 
              very attractive to many people." <br><br>Although challenges still remain to 
              broaden the capabilities of the PhonePoint Pen, the engineers are confident they 
              can be solved. Currently, air-writers must pause briefly between letters, which 
              can slow the process down and rules out the use of cursive writing. Also, each 
              letter must be written large. These improvements would come as a result of 
              improved algorithms and more sophisticated accelerometers, the scientists said. 
              <br><br>"It is only a matter of time before we improve the performance of this 
              application," Agrawal said. "We plan to further augment the pen with real-time 
              feedback, character recognition and better support for drawing diagrams." 
              <br><br>Roy Choudhury expects that the PhonePoint Pen prototype will be 
              available for download within the next few months. <br><br>### <br><br>Duke
