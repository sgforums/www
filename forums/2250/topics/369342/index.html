              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am looking for a web host that can serve me better.  Currently using  a US based one which is crap...What are the popular ones? Should I use a SG based one?  I use e commerce applications like shopping carts btw..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A friend of mine suggested using Google's professional email..anyone have experience in it?  Thought it would be more robust tho i dont really like their "labels" concept</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for your help</p>

              <p>I dont know about popular email, but I think for webhosting, you can try <a href="http://www.on.sg/">Oryon Networks</a>.</p>
              <p>Local web server located in Singapore and provides pretty good customer service and most importantly good uptime.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want to compare more, you can try going to <a href="http://www.sgwebhostingtalk.com/">SG Webhostingtalk</a> forum for more recommendations, but note that some hosts there that offer good prices are from US and not SG.</p>

              <p>1. What type of e-commerce app? You don't have to tell us the e-commerce app name, but I need to its specifications. Is it written in PHP? Uses mySQL? Etc?</p>

              <p><em>new to this but i know it uses php and needs a mySQL database. a local hosting company says needs LINUX platform only but my current US host is using Windows platform</em></p>

                                      webhost must definitely have HTTPS. Yes? No?</p>

              <p><em>my current host email client is a total fre*kin disaster. could not stay logged on the Horde email for more than 15 seconds. host insisted nothing wrong. sent screen shots and even video to show the login loop back but still not solved. they switched me to Squirrel email but that cant send attachements greater than 2mb. again they say they see no prob on their end so basically tell me life sucks for me. tried turning off firewall in my modem, remove firewall in computer, tried using other pc in another location using different network still same problem. so enuf is enuf</em></p>
              <p><em>btw i use IX Host . not to flame them but if anyone also uses them pls share with me if u have the same problems as i do</em></p>
