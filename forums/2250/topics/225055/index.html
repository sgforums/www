            <div class='col-md body'>Rogue security software is software that uses malware (malicious software) or malicious tools to advertise or install itself or to force computer users to pay for removal of nonexistent spyware. Rogue software will often install a trojan horse to download a trial version, or it will do other unwanted things. The first and still most comprehensive study of rogue and real antispyware programs [1] was carried out by Eric L. Howes, one of the world's most renowned security professionals.<br>Contents<br><br>* 1 Effects<br>* 2 False Positives<br>* 3 Detection<br>* 4 Rogue Software<br>* 5 See also<br><br>Effects<br><br>The main goal of rogue software makers is to sell their product. Many times fake Windows dialog boxes will appear. Most of the time, they will display a message such as "WARNING! Your computer is infected with spyware! Buy our product to remove it!" Usually, when the dialog box's OK button is clicked, this will direct the user to the software's website. Sometimes, even clicking the upper right hand X button to close the dialog box will produce the same effect or activate the software's installation. (Pressing Alt+F4 can circumvent that trick). Some software, like SpyAxe will automatically download the trial version without any user action (drive-by installation).<br><br>False Positives<br><br>A variant of the above technique that rogue security software makers use is that of false positives. A false positive is a fake or false malware detection in a computer scan. This can convince even such users that their computer is infected who may not be deceived by the abovementioned similar claims without a scan. This is quite different from an accidental false positive, which can be produced in a scan by security software from honest companies.<br><br>Detection<br><br>Almost all antispyware software will detect rogue software if it is in a computer. Oftentimes, rogue software will install a Trojan horse to download the software from the maker's website, like Titan Shield. Antispyware software can detect the Trojan even before the software is installed. Programs such as , AVG Anti-Virus, CounterSpy, Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy (free), Spy Sweeper, Spyware Doctor, SUPERAntiSpyware (pay), and Windows Defender (free for Windows XP users) can usually detect these. However, often removal of new, aggressive rogue programs requires use of programs such as HijackThis combined with manual removal processes because it can take quite a while before the manufacturers of the abovementioned legitimate programs learn how to automate the process and update their programs. Use of HijackThis without specialist help can cripple a computer, and users are advised to get help from the many voluntary specialists in many forums such as Spyware Warrior, Safer Networking, and many others.<br><br>Rogue Software<br><br>* ErrorGuard<br>* SpyAxe<br>* Malware Wipe<br>* WinFixer<br>* SpyFalcon<br>* PSGuard<br>* Titan Shield<br>* SpySheriff<br>* Pest Trap<br>* AntiVirus Gold<br>* WorldAntiSpy<br>* SpyTrooper<br>* SpyWiper<br>* PAL Spyware Remover<br>* Spyware Stormer<br>* Spyware Quake<br>* SpywareNo<br><br>from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_software" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_software</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Trustworthy Anti-Spyware Products<br>Protecting your PC w/ quality anti-spyware applications...<br><br>When choosing anti-spyware protection, you should rely on products with deserved reputations and proven track records. That means avoiding the new and unknown, and not succumbing to impulse buys of anti-spyware products that you see on the Net, esp. those included in the "rogue/suspect" list on this page or advertised on Google.<br><br>At the very least, you should have an anti-spyware scanner, and there are several reputable anti-spyware scanners available on the Net -- some even for free. But anti-spyware protection goes beyond having an anti-spyware scanner like Spybot Search &amp; Destroy or Ad-aware. Even after installing and running an anti-spyware scanner, you should take steps to lock down your browser and protect your system against further infestation by spyware and adware.<br><br>What follows below is a set of recommended steps for installing anti-spyware protection for your PC. If your PC is already infested with spyware or adware, see the instructions for getting help included later on this page.<br>1. 	  	Install an anti-spyware scanner (or two...)<br><br>One basic tool in every user's toolbox of software ought to be an anti-spyware scanner. There are several excellent anti-spyware scanners available -- some free, some for pay. These include (but are not limited to):<br>Ad-aware<br>AVG Anti-Spyware<br>Pest Patrol<br>Spy Sweeper<br>Spyware Doctor<br>SUPERAntiSpyware<br>Windows Defender<br><br>Disclaimer: the maintainers of Spyware Warrior have enjoyed consulting relationships with Sunbelt Software, makers of the CounterSpy anti-spyware application. Given that relationship and the inherent conflict of interest it represents, we refrain from recommending CounterSpy. Spyware Warrior has no financial relationship with any of the companies whose products are listed or recommended above. We are not employees, affiliates, representatives, or other agents of any of these companies.<br><br>In addition, there are other "freeware" scanners that you may find useful:<br>Spybot Search &amp; Destroy<br><br>Anti-spyware scanners work much like anti-virus applications (such as Norton Anti-Virus, McAfee VirusScan, et al), except that instead of scanning your PC for viruses, trojans, and worms, they scan your computer for spyware, adware, and dialers.<br><br>You should not rely exclusively on this short list of anti-spyware applications, however. Rather, you should investigate and test a range of reputable anti-spyware programs to find the programs that are best suited to your own privacy and security needs.<br><br>We recommend using at least two anti-spyware scanners regularly, as one will often pick up items that the other misses. Even after you install an anti-spyware scanner, be sure to keep it updated because new spyware and adware appears on the Net almost daily.<br><br>Anti-Spyware for the Mac<br><br>We're starting to get more and more questions from Mac users about anti-spyware. At this time, the only anti-spyware program that we know of for the Mac is:<br><br>MacScan<br><br>Anti-Virus &amp; Firewall Applications<br><br>In the past year, several anti-virus, anti-malware, and personal firewall applications have incorporated robust anti-spyware detection and removal.

We are not employees, affiliates, representatives, or other agents of any of these companies.<br><br>2. 	  	Install anti-malware protection<br><br>Basic Free Protection<br><br>Scanning for spyware and adware isn't enough to protect your PC. You also need to take preventative steps to ensure that unwanted software doesn't come back. One effective way to prevent spyware and adware from returning is to install an anti-spyware prevention program such as:<br>SpywareBlaster<br>SpywareGuard<br><br>SpywareBlaster and SpywareGuard are excellent, free programs from JavaCool. I recommend installing and using both, as they protect your computer in different ways. SpywareBlaster "inoculates" your Internet Explorer browser against the installation of unwanted spyware and adware from the internet. SpywareGuard actively monitors your PC and prevents spyware infestations. Both are easy to install and update.<br><br>Advanced HIPS &amp; Rootkit Protection<br><br>In the past few years a new generation of anti-malware protection products has emerged. This new type of anti-malware protection, called HIPS (Host Intrusion Protection System), works at the kernel level to intercept malware before it hits your hard drive and infects the system. Although this technology is still maturing, a HIPS defense may be worth looking into for some users. For a run-down of the latest HIPS applications, see this discussion on the Spyware Warrior forums:<br>Sandbox, HIPS, Virtualization, &amp; System Hardening Apps<br><br>Advanced users may also be interested in the broadening array of anti-rootkit programs that are available:<br>Rootkit Info &amp; Detection Apps<br><br>Please keep in mind the HIPS and anti-rootkit applications are both emerging technologies that may not be appropriate for home users who aren't technically savvy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>3.  	   	 Lock down your browser<br><br>One of the most prevalent means for spyware and adware to be installed is through Internet Explorer. To prevent spyware and adware from installing without your knowledge and permission, you need to "lock down" Internet Explorer. There are several ways to do this.<br><br>Securely configure the Internet zone<br><br>First, you can securely configure the Internet zone of Internet Explorer and add sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone. This means that by default web sites will not be able to use "active content" (i.e., ActiveX controls, Java applets, and scripting) until you explicitly choose to trust those web sites. See this page for instructions on how to securely configure Internet Explorer:<br><br>Internet Explorer Privacy &amp; Security Settings<br><br>By turns, you could also use this free program, which will automatically configure Internet Explorer for you:<br><br>Enough is Enough!<br><br>One potential downside to securely configuring the Internet zone is that some web sites will not work properly until you add them to the Trusted sites zone -- a process that some users find cumbersome.<br><br>Add bad sites to the Restricted sites zone<br><br>Second, you can use another approach to "locking down" Internet Explorer which avoids the hassle of broken web sites by adding known "nasty" sites to the Restricted sites zone. Doing so gives your PC protection against known threats while still allowing most web sites to work by default. To put the clamp down on a long list of undesirable web sites, you can install and use this free program:<br><br>IE-SPYAD<br><br>If you choose to use the Restricted sites approach of IE-SPYAD, be sure to update your copy of IE-SPYAD regularly, as new web sites are constantly being added to the list.<br><br>4. 	  	Use an alternative browser<br><br>Internet Explorer is not only the most popular browser on the Net, it is also the browser most widely and easily exploited by spyware pushers to install spyware and adware behind users' backs. Thus, you might decide that Internet Explorer is simply not worth the hassle or risk. In that case, you can install and run an alternative, non-IE browser such as:<br>Mozilla<br>Firefox<br>Opera<br><br>All three of these browsers are mature, robust, and fast. Moreover, they have built-in pop-up blocking and several other nice features that Internet Explorer simply lacks. More importantly, all three of these browsers are much less susceptible to unwanted adware and spyware installations. And all three are free.<br><br>Note: even if you do switch to an alternative browser, you should still lock down Internet Explorer, as described above. Given that Internet Explorer has effectively been integrated into Windows, it can still be exploited by adware and spyware that gets installed to your system through other means. Thus, locking down Internet Explorer remains important even if you're not regularly using Internet Explorer to browse the internet.<br><br>5. 	  	Keep your system safe &amp; secure with Windows Update<br><br>To prevent unwanted spyware and adware from being installed behind your back, you need to install all the latest "Critical Updates" from Microsoft. Doing so is easier than you might think.<br><br>Microsoft has an entire Windows Update site devoted to automatically updating users' systems with all the latest fixes and patches for a wide range of Microsoft software, including Windows, Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access), and Internet Explorer.<br><br>We strongly urge you to take your system past the Windows Update site and let that site download and install the appropriate fixes for your computer. Doing so just might save you some grief and headaches down the road:<br><br>Windows Update<br>http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/<br><br>Much of the update process at Windows Update is automated, so it's simple and convenient. The Windows Update site will install a small program to analyze the software on your system and recommend the appropriate fixes. This process takes only a few minutes.<br><br>Once Windows Update has finished analyzing your system, you'll be presented with a menu of downloads that Windows Update deems appropriate for your computer. At a minimum you should let Windows Update install the fixes marked as "Critical Updates." The other available updates ("Recommended Updates," "Drivers and Enhancements") are optional.<br>Check the boxes for the updates that you wish to install ("Critical Updates" are checked by default). Then click the appropriate button to start the download and installation process. You'll be shown a summary of the updates that you've selected, and then you'll presented with a "License Agreement." After you click through the "License Agreement," the download and intallation process will start.<br><br>Since the entire download and installation process is automated, there's almost nothing for you to do except reboot the computer after all the updates have been installed.<br><br>6. 	  	Read Licenses &amp; Privacy Policies<br><br>Anti-spyware applications alone can't protect you entirely from unwanted spyware and adware. You have to do your part as well by being vigilant in your online behavior.<br><br>One of the more common sources for spyware and adware is "freeware" (e.g., Grokster or KaZaA) that bundles unwanted third-party applications. Another common source involves third-party web sites that automatically start the installation of spyware and adware when you visit those sites. These auto-installed spyware and adware programs may initially appear to be plug-ins necessary for the web site itself, though usually they are not.<br><br>Wherever you happen to encounter spyware and adware, you will usually be presented with a EULA (End User License Agreement) and/or Privacy Policy. Do not blindly click through these documents. Read them carefully and look for the tell-tale language that discloses the presence of adware or spyware. For tips on what to look for, see these pages:<br>DSLReports.com - EULAs &amp; Privacy Policies<br>The Problem with Privacy Policies<br>Ben Edelman - Grokster and Claria Take Licenses to New Lows<br>Ben Edelman - Gator's EULA Gone Bad<br>EULAlyzer (free EULA parsing/analysis tool)<br><br>Most if not all of the "adware-supported" or "advertising-supported" applications on the Net have adware-free equivalents. There's simply no need to use advertising-supported applications. If you're looking for truly free software without any unwanted surprises, see the following sites:<br><br>CleanSoftware.org 	OldVersion.com<br>FreeWindows.dk 	The OpenCD<br>GNUWin II 	The OSSWin Project<br>Moochers 	Pricelessware<br><br>location <a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm#sites" rel="nofollow">http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm#sites</a></div>
