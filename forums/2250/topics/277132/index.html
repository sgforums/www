If you are using wireless, please make sure that nothing is interfering. Walls, doors, handphones, microwave ovens can drop a signal.<br><br>2. Please list out what you have tried.<br><br>3. Unstable connections may not be the cables at all. If after all troubleshooting you still have problems, you are welcome to call up Starhub to help you diagnose. And remember, you can't switch ISP as and when you like if your contract still has not expired or is not near expiry date.<br><br>Lastly, please keep to the original thread. You've already started one.</div>

I have tried restarting the router and modem before.. unfortuately it still doesn't work<br>2. Whenever i get this screwed up problem, i hardly can load a page.. i cant even access starhub utilities and when i do, my connection is back to normal so the readings are normal again!<br>3. Have called starhub abt 7 times in a span of a year and they did tests, monitoring etc.. they said they read the package losses but their connection was still perfectly fine..<br>4. I live in Bishan but i dont think its the area or else.. confirm newspaper.<br>5. Bought a new modem as starhub told me my teryalon or dunu wht modem was faulty.. out of warranty but still receive same problem.<br><br>To confirm this problem, my download acclerator plus, while downloading, will suddenly drop from 400+kb/s to 2.3 kb/s..<br><br>soloman2k5's solution<br>Try this method, Connect cable modem at living rm pt without splitter and conn pc directly to it. do a ping to www.yahoo.com and www.hotmail.com, if still getting losses, call starhub lor. might be modem or cable point issue.<br><br>1. connect cable at room point meaning directly to the modem without any router whatsoever? tried that b4.. still got prob<br>2.ping yahoo.com b4.. sometimes 2,3,4 losses.<br><br>Guys im very frustrated at starhub.. i cant play morpg games now cause it lags, i cant download stuff, i cant surf when the lag comes.. it comes abt once a day now.<br><br>Suggested Solutions:<br><br>1. Connect at living room pt<br>2. diff internet explorer (TRIED)<br>3. disable router firewall (HOW?)4. ping own IP (No losses)<br>5.when u encounter slow access, do a traceroute to the website instead of ping, to see where the losses occur.(HOW?)<br><br>* Before i disconnect my entire pc and move it downstairs, is that the only solution left?<br><br>Problems:<br><br>1.
