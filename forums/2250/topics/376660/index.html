              <p>Hi i need help with upgrading my hardwares inside my computer. Im using it for hard-core gaming so i need go advice on which to get first.</p>
              <p>here is my Current PC specifications...</p>
              <p>Processor: <span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; color: #333333;"><strong>Intel pentium DUAL CPU E218</strong><strong>0 @ 2.00 </strong><strong>gHz</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; color: #333333;"><strong>RAM: 2GB RAM </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; color: #333333;"><strong>Graphics card: GEforce 7100/nforce 630 @512mb</strong></span></p>
              <p>Currently i cant play L4D and COD:WAW because its very laggy. same goes to GTA: IV</p>
              <p>and others that requires high-end specs. im thinking of upgrading my graphics card to GEforce 9800GT to reduce lag for the games. would it be better to upgrade the processor to Quad Duo at 2.6+ gHz first?</p>
              <p>need advice. thanks :)</p>

              <p>Quad can multitask more</p>
              <p>A high end core 2 duo is good enough. As for graphics card i think the one u mention is good enough.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Upgrade your graphics card since that is the one making your games laggy. A quad-core will benefit you if you multitask alot, or you simply cannot wait for the program to load at start-up. But for now, upgrading the GPU is the cheapest option. The 9800GT is powerful enough for your gaming needs.</p></div>

              <p>yes</p>
              <p>it is due to bottlenecking</p>
              <p>imagine ur processor can handle 10 piece of information in one sec, but you are using a graphic card that can only handle 2 piece of info in one sec. so overall it still lag</p>
              <p>Dont buy a fast cpu and a slow gpu, and dun buy a slow cpu but a fast gpu</p>
              <p>need to be somewhat stable<br>Maybe like a core 2 duo 2.8 and a 9800</p>

              <p>its custom build and its a gift from my dad. so i would not want to get a new PC. plus, this pc can play COD4 finely. so i guess its already not that bad.</p>
              <p>well my budget would be $500 or less with upgrading of system power supply, graphics card, processor and RAM.</p>

              <p>What powersupply are you using?<br>What motherboard are you using?</p>
              <p>For ram i think it is enough for now.</p>
              <p>If you give me the money to upgrade,  i will do the following:<br><br>If your powersupply is a true power 450-500watts you can consider to continue using it for a 9800gt, and it cost around $210 max</p>
              <p>That makes an extra $290</p>
              <p>If your motherboard supports E7500 2.93ghz processor, you can consider buying that cpu, max it should cost $200. I think there is not worth getting the E8400 that is at 3ghz, however it does perform better...and it cost $62 more</p>
              <p>And that leaves $90</p>
              <p>You can spend the money for a coolermaster extremepower 550w for $90max</p>
              <p>that will take up $500</p>
              <p>However if your motherboard does not support newer processor, then i think you can try overclocking it up abit and get a 9600gt graphic card, as i feel that it is more 'compatible'.[PLEASE ADVICE, im not very sure about the performance diff]</p>
              <p>I dont wanna say this but if your mobo doesnt really support the new processor, i think i will save up and spend the $500 on the next PC.</p>
              <p>Reason is that if you spend a lot on a graphics card and your processor cant keep up, it is not worth it as the CPU will bottleneck</p>
              <p>And if you get a slow graphics card that your processor can keep up with, you might not get a lot of performance gain, and you will feel that the money is not well spent</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Raraken please give some professional advice, i might be wrong</p>

              <p>Powersupplies are normally installed on top inside your casing, look at the sticker and see the power, how many watts. Mostly if they write there "450watts standard rated power", it can only produce 250-300watts. Best is to check the sticker and look at "true power"</p>
              <p>Motherboard u can manually open up your casing and look at the bottom of your motherboard, look at the model and make.</p>
              <p>Or u can download <a href="http://www.cpuid.com">CPU-Z </a>and look under the 'Mainboard' tab</p>
              <p>Actually for monitor there is no need to change. What the salesman might be telling you may be the video out plugs of your graphics card.</p>
              <p>To put it simple, your old monitor supports only VGA input connection. However most new graphics card does not have VGA output connections anymore, they have something called DVI and HDMI or a mixture. However there is something called a DVI to VGA converter that should come with the graphics card to allow you to hook up your monitor</p>
              <p>How old is your monitor? Nowadays monitor are all widescreen(so u can see more in your games) and thin in appearance. However to me it is the same becos i dont game a lot.</p>
              <p>Speaking of coolers, if you are not going to overclock your CPU by a lot, there is no need to buy 3rd party coolers to replace your old one. Anyway CPUs comes with their own coolers</p>

              <p>2nd: Add on to what MPT said, when you check your power supply, look at the label for +12V. The value shown underneath +12V is very important when it comes to upgrading the computer, as it determines if you need to change it.</p>
              <p>3rd: As MPT said, check CPU-Z under Mainboard tab, and look under Link Width. Though with the NVidia 630i Chipset, it should be PCI-E X16. Any PCI Express videocard will fit.</p>
              <p>4th: He's trying to make you buy a new monitor. Your current monitor is fine, if it's a CRT even. He's talking about the connectors on the monitor, be it VGA or DVI, though most, if not all, video cards come with DVI - VGA adapters.</p>
              <p>5th: The standard cooler is fine if you aren't going to push the computer hard.</p>

              <p>i've looked through my outside casing of my computer but find no sticker accept the license for windows XP.</p>
              <p>About the motherboard thingy, it will take some time for me to open up the case. </p>
              <p>my monitor's brand/model is " Compaq 1501" very old. its been with me for 8 years already.</p>

              <p>What powersupply are you using?<br> What motherboard are you using?</p>
              <p>For ram i think it is enough for now.</p>
              <p>If you give me the money to upgrade,  i will do the
              following:<br> <br> If your powersupply is a true power 450-500watts you can consider
              to continue using it for a 9800gt, and it cost around $210 max</p>
              <p>That makes an extra $290</p>
              <p>If your motherboard supports E7500 2.93ghz processor, you can
              consider buying that cpu, max it should cost $200. I think there is
              not worth getting the E8400 that is at 3ghz, however it does
              perform better...and it cost $62 more</p>
              <p>And that leaves $90</p>
              <p>You can spend the money for a coolermaster extremepower 550w for
              $90max</p>
              <p>that will take up $500</p>
              <p>However if your motherboard does not support newer processor,
              then i think you can try overclocking it up abit and get a 9600gt
              graphic card, as i feel that it is more 'compatible'.[PLEASE
              ADVICE, im not very sure about the performance diff]</p>
              <p>I dont wanna say this but if your mobo doesnt really support the
              new processor, i think i will save up and spend the $500 on the
              next PC.</p>
              <p>Reason is that if you spend a lot on a graphics card and your
              processor cant keep up, it is not worth it as the CPU will
              bottleneck</p>
              <p>And if you get a slow graphics card that your processor can keep
              up with, you might not get a lot of performance gain, and you will
              feel that the money is not well spent</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Raraken please give some professional advice, i might be
              wrong</p>

              <p>The 630i supports 1333MHz FSB CPUs, from what NVidia says, so a new CPU is possible though go to your mobo manufacturer's website to confirm, since I think this is more about mobo implementation, since the manufacturers may not have designed the board for 1333MHz FSB.  I would suggest an ATi GPU right now, like the 4670 or 4850, since the price/performance ratio is pretty good compared with Nvidia.</p>
              <p>And since his monitor is a 15-inch, probably 1024x768, the 4670 is more than enough.</p>

              <p>Seeing from your graphics card, we can tell the chipset is a 630i. I am using the exact same chipset, OEM Compaq PC + a few upgrades. You still need to open it up since we need to know what model and how capable you PSU is. Specifically amperage on the +12V rail.</p>
