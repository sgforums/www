              <p>I was looking through and couldn't find a Mac thread. So, here it is! All Mac users, or potential Mac users, talk about it here.</p>
              <p>I'll get it started: I have a Unibody MacBook 2.4 GHz. However, there was a hinge problem so it's been at the service center since Sunday. I'm using my brother's Windows Vista desktop until I pick it up tomorrow.</p>
              <p>I've only been a Mac user since December 2008 -- roughly 6 months. But you know what I've realized? How much better Macs are than Windows! lol. It's been painful using Vista for the past few days, even though it's a pretty new, high-end, quad-core desktop. I don't know exactly where the problem lies, but I think it's because of the many inconsistent UI features. OS X is just so much smoother, quicker, and polished, even while running on an average-spec laptop; on the other hand, Windows feels sluggish even while running on a quad-core desktop.</p>

              <p>Oh, sorry, I didn't realize this forum was exclusively for technical support. Here, some other off-topic threads you can go and be an asshole in:</p>
              <p>http://sgforums.com/forums/2250/topics/361311<br>http://sgforums.com/forums/2250/topics/360817</p>
              <p>And there are some others. You see, I read the title of this forum to be "IT Support <em>AND</em> Tech Corner", but I guess you have an obscure interpretation of "Tech Corner".</p>
              <p>Also, I'm not trying to incite a flame war; you obviously are. Go ahead and create a Windows thread; I don't care. This thread was created with the intention of Mac users being able to come and talk about Macs. I was saying how much better I liked Macs over Windows; you can disagree with me, but don't assume that I'm trying to start a flamewar.</p>

              <p>FYI, I've been a Mac user much longer than you have, and the way most Mac users compare Vista and OS X gets on my nerves. Its fanboys who give us a bad name; Do you know how many people have a bad impression of us Mac users? Words like, 'Oh, OSX is sooo smooth and fast, not like Vista!', could have been rephrased into much better words. I was not, and never do, like flame wars. </p>
              <p>I use a Mac Mini, and sure, its fast, but Windows is my preferred choice. </p>
              <p>Also FYI: Pros and cons dude. </p>
              <p>Macs aren't upgradable, and applications for Macs are few. Sure, no viruses, but who wants to waste time on an OS that less than 5% of the world population use?</p>
              <p>Windows are upgradable, and sure, they CAN be unstable, but their code was meant for a variety of platforms and processors: IA64, x86(-64), Intel, AMD, VIA. Mac code was optimized for a small amount of hardware, and Ive gotten my fair share of kernel panics on my Mac(More than my desktop, actually). And my desktop is a not-so-new quad-core.</p>
              <p>So yeah, you can't really blame me for not liking fanboys. They always ruin the image of the users. Just try not to be one, and its fine. </p>
              <p>Are you hyped-up about Snow Leopard?</p>

              <p>It's not like I'm mindlessly bashing Windows. I've been a Windows user for my entire life, up until December of last year, so I know what I'm talking about. OS X *is* much smoother than Vista. Why is it so bad that I stated an honest observation?</p>
              <p>Before I got my MacBook in December, I had an HP Pavilion laptop that ran Vista. It was slow as hell. (And btw, this laptop had decent specs.) I had to do multiple system restores because one day it stopped starting up. I had to reformat once because programs constantly crashed. On my desktop, which ran XP, Windows got slower and slower until it took over ten minutes to start up.</p>
              <p>My Mac has given me very few problems. Yeah, Safari crashes multiple times per day, which really annoyed me. I'm now back to Firefox. I'm not saying Macs are so perfect and totally flawless; I'm appreciating how much better the overall experience is. The fact that less than 10% (I thought it was like 8%, not &lt;5%) of the world uses Macs doesn't matter to me... I'm not trying to be like everyone else for the sake of it, you know. I have everything I need on a Mac: MS Office, Firefox, uTorrent, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, FileZilla, iTunes, VLC, Audacity... hell, even Geometer's Sketchpad. I bought VMware Fusion together with my MacBook because I thought I would need it. I don't. How is using a Mac "wasting time"?</p>
              <p>Also, I understand how Macs aren't for everyone. I hardly even understood what you said in your fifth paragraph, and frankly, I don't really care. The average user doesn't, either. I don't care much for the technical details; as long as my computer has decent specs and works fine, I'm happy. I haven't had that experience with Windows computers (the part where it works fine, I mean).</p>
              <p>Lastly, I know this post is really defensive and whatnot, but you said Macs are a waste of time. Therefore, I get to respond to that.</p>

              <p>True, so its each to his own tastes. After much tweaking, here and there, my desktop (not my Mini) is blazing fast. Faster than even the Mac Pros in my school. I should say, using Windows has allowed me to expand and broaden my IT knowledge. Much more than Mac, I should say, but kernel panics get on my nerve, since there is no error code to dissect what's wrong. I always have to go to any Apple service centres to repair my Mac, if there is a hardware failure, but it fits in my bag, so I don't mind. I get overjoyed if my desktop has a funny problem, like the HDD fails, or the OS is unstable, since I get to have some 'fun' with it. Eheheh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">. </p>
              <p>Plus, Mac is more <span style="font-style: italic;">user-friendly</span>, not <span style="font-style: italic;">enthusiast-friendly</span>. Its more of a 'general population' thing, so Its not up my alley. Finder works like a charm, though.</p>
              <p>Kernel panics are the Mac version of the Windows BSOD, and they aren't fun, less fun than BSODs......Yeah and Safari crashes too much. I got Firefox, but what I really want is Chrome for Mac. Firefox and Safari are a bit too slow for me, and running anything on a Mini is hell, if you know what I mean.</p>
              <p>And Macs aren't a waste of time. I'm just not used to it, and its slow, when I compare it to my desktop. The integrated graphics don't do much, so I'll see if I can get a new Mini or a new Macbook Pro soon. Once I upgrade my PC, that is. And its understandable if you go on the defensive. People like to defend what they love, don't they? I'd kick someone in the crotch if they decided to insult my desktop or anything.</p>

              <p>Heh, yeah, I want Chrome for Mac, too. Firefox is many times much slower than Safari, and the only reason I use it over Safari is that it doesn't crash. I even have a Safari theme on Firefox.</p>

              <p>Heh. The reason I want Chrome on Mac is that Safari and Firefox are too slow on a Mini.</p>
              <p>I've already tried to install OSX on my other computers, but they always have a compatibility issue which forces me to stick with my Mini for OSX. I'm looking to get an MBP or Mac Pro soon, if I can and if they are faster than my current computers, anyway.</p>

              <p>i agree with raraken.</p>
              <p>mac parts are hard to find, and even rare-er are the service manuals, telling you what is what.</p>
              <p>generally windows computers are more fun, because you get to DIY your pc. customise it. macs have variants for each model but the specs arent really that different. although it can be said that os x is more stable, nicer-looking, and the bragging rights that you have a mac, there's still things that you can only do on a windows pc and not a mac.</p>

              <p>Well, yeah. There is nothing on a Mac that a PC can't do.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Macs are just Sony computers with a different OS: Overpriced for what you get.</p>
              <p>I tried building my own Hackintosh 'Pro'. Worked excellent, until I couldn't get software updates, though. I don't really like Apple 'cause they take a long time to accept that there is a flaw in the designs, like in the past iBook generations.</p>

              <p>Personally, I don't build or upgrade my computers manually, and I see why people who like to DIY their computer dislike Macs. However, I generally care more about software than hardware (given that it's not too crappy), and I find that OS X delivers a much smoother and more reliable experience than Windows does.</p>
              <p>If you're talking purely hardware, yes, Macs are overpriced for what you get. But as I said above, I generally care more about software than hardware. VAIOs don't offer anything more software-wise than an HP or Dell, but Macs do.</p>
