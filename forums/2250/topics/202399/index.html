The crack can only work for one version of the software. Since the anti-spyware application is updated, the crack will not work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you install programs, registry entries will be created. That's how the program knows whether you have installed it before and thus preventing you from reinstalling it again. You have to delete registry entries related to them and install it again. This is risky as registry entries are created everywhere for the program. Delete wrongly and that's it.<br><br>Spyware Doctor version maybe the same all the time, but the build number is different. That's how they defend themselves against crackers. You have to find the crack with the correct version and build number for it to work. However, to prevent successful registration of cracked programs, the makers of Spyware Doctor has cleverly used anti-spyware definitions to defeat cracked softwares. Any softwares that have been cracked and attempts to update, will either fail or update successfully, but will return to the same old trial program after updating definitions.</div>
