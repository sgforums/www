            <div class='col-md body'><p>There is an in-depth review of <a href="http://www.tuneclone.com/index.php"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336699;">TuneClone Audio Converter software</span></span></a>. The author gives an average score of 4.5 out of 5.<br><br><img title="TuneClone Score" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3248/3047779466_96f1614091_o.jpg" alt=""><br><br>So what do you think of this review? Is it fair and honest? Now let's take a look at the highlights of this review:<br><br>iTunes has invaded pretty much all musical use on the computer anymore, people who don't really know much about computers hear about iTunes and assume that's what they're supposed to use for their music on their computers. Case in point, a friend of mine does not own an iPod, but yet he and his girlfriend used iTunes to transfer all of his music over to his computer and it's kinda stuck there now. Well he'll be the first to admit that he really doesn't know much about computers at all, so seeing as iTunes was so popular that's what they decided to use for his music, of course they didn't ask me anything at all. They transferred over many, many songs, and of course his mp3 player, a Sandisk, can't play them so he was stuck with what to do next. So he called me for help, mind you though, most of his music isn't copy protected/copy righted etc, he's actually a world renowned Waltz or Ballroom Dance instructor, so he's got tons of music he uses for that kind of stuff, and once they spent the hours to put it in his computer via iTunes he was basically stuck, it was either re-do it all through another program, buy an iPod or figure out another way to get his music to his Sandisk player converted to Mp3 format.<br><br>So there are a few free versions out there that will help my friend out, but I needed something that was easy to use, very easy to use and I found TuneClone, which is very easy to use so that's what I've got for review today. TuneClone is a program to convert you iTunes or other music services music over to mp3 format, quickly and easily. It essentially creates a virtual CDRW drive on your computer and virtually burns the CD from the main program, iTunes of other and then TuneClone automatically rips it to mp3 format for you, so in a few easy steps you've got music that is easily transferred and played on any device.<br><br><strong>Tech Specs, Features or the Basic Info:</strong><br><br><em>Note: The information in this part is from TuneClone homepage, so please go to <a href="http://www.tuneclone.com/index.php"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336699;">http://www.tuneclone.com/index.php</span></span></a> to get to know about tech specs, features and basic info of TuneClone Audio Converter.</em><br><br><strong>Installation, Testing and Comparison:</strong><br><br>TuneClone is a download, so there are no box shots etc, just download and install, very easy to do.<br><br><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3063/3047779496_b7bef55da0_o.jpg" alt="TuneClone setup"><br><br>There's really not much to do on the end user part of this program, most is done automatically. Load up TuneClone and hit the 'Open Media Player' button and your iTunes or whatever will open for you. If you wish you can change the output directory, and other settings like bitrates etc, but for most the default settings are fine.<br><br>To use TuneClone you just burn a CD with your program, I'm using iTunes of course, you just have to make sure the destination drive is the TuneClone virtual CD, other than that there's nothing else to change really.<br><br>As soon as you hit burn, your CD will start to burn virtually and then TuneClone goes to work converting the files to MP3 format for you automatically.<br><br>That's it, there's really nothing much more to it, very easy to use for even someone who doesn't know much about computers.<br><br><strong>Summary and Comments:</strong><br><br>TuneClone is a great way to free your music from one of the music services out there, it works well, it works fast and it's very easy to use.<br><br>DragonSteelMods gives TuneClone Audio Converter Software a <strong>4.5</strong> out of 5 score.<br><br><strong>Pros:</strong><br><br>-Easy use<br>-Fast<br>-Works well<br><br><strong>Cons:</strong><br><br>-Expensive<br><br>The full review is available at <a href="http://www.dragonsteelmods.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10186&amp;Itemid=38"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336699;">http://www.dragonsteelmods.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10186&amp;Itemid=38</span></span></a></p></div>
