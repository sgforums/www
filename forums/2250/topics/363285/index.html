              <p>It is better to change the fan speed setting on this modernv thingy to manual. Just now it was in auto mode, it override my dual core center's fan control, and slow it down to 1K rpm onli.</p>
              <p>Other than those, you just need to connect a molex, tape the sensors, and connect the fans(if you want).

              <p>I do that online already, except not the assemble one lah! Anyway, I can't work, I'm too young, you know, even though I know alot more than some of the shop assistants I met. Don't wanna say this, but, they very noob. </p>
              <p>Also, my record for stripping down a computer was less than 10 mins, power supply, mobo, ram, CPU, CD/DVD, HDD. That was a PIII system, I think. Assembly was, around 15-20 mins, except I forgot the 20-pin mobo connector XD</p>

              <p>Also, my record for stripping down a computer was less than 10 mins, power supply, mobo, ram, CPU, CD/DVD, HDD. That was a PIII system, I think. Assembly was, around 15-20 mins, except I forgot the 20-pin mobo connector XD</p>

              <p>Ya i am using asus silent knight 2, it was installed incorrectly(sort of) as it exhaust the hot air up where there are no ventilation back then, instead of exhausting hot air out through the rear fan</p>
              <p>If based on computertv(formerly known as tigerdirect), the 3870x2 still beats 9800gx2 in some games. Obviously not crysis as it is build for nvidia.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12D-jy4mFjw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12D-jy4mFjw</a></p>
              <p> My plan was to use the 3870x2 for watching HD movies on big lcd tvs when i save up enough(but still haven gt the money).</p>
              <p>Striker formula mobo are nvidia chipset, back then i was planning on crossfiring, so i got the x48 chipset. The good thing is that if you crossfire, both slots run at x16 speed instead on x8, x8 on those p45s. However due to the fact that the mobo supports ddr2 and ddr3, the bios was HELL. Good thing is that it is qutie stable now</p>
              <p>X2 cards any mobo can use wad...it is one graphic card with 2 processors</p>
              <p>As for measurements, just remember it tkaes up 2 drive bays</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Casing wise i feel that my cm sniper storm is good, there is another AMD version. However some of my friends tell me this casing dosent look good. Anyway it is up to individual's preference. Maybe if you want to have lots of cool looking drive bay accesories u can get the lianli armoursuit, it is a full tower, a lot more taller than mine</p>

              <p>Hey, another ComputerTV watcher! Yeah, I did my research, and actually, they're pretty close. Did the 3870X2s face microstuttering as well?</p>

              <p><br>I think any system that uses 2 gpus, or have 2 gpu proccesing simultaneously may encounter microstuterring, due to the fact that they are like being crossfired or sli, just without the 'connector' outside.</p>
              <p>One of the factor that cause multistuttering is that the 2 gpus share the same video ram.People say Multistutering is gone on the 4870x2 as the 2gb of ram is not shared between the 2 gpus, more to 1 to each</p>
              <p>anyway, i believe my 3870x2 does suffer from it, When i play games it will run very fast for a few seconds, then have a significant lag then fast again..sth liddat</p>
              <p>I also liked the armouruit last time, but because of the pricing i decided not to get it.</p>
              <p>aiya, work part time for the money lor, or can do data recovery to earn some cash<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"><br>I find that data recovery is a very good way of earning money if the harddisk is not damaged too badly, as long as it is not the internal platters that are damage, softwares and abit of hands on may still be able to recovery some data</p>
