              <p><br> I think any system that uses 2 gpus, or have 2 gpu proccesing
              simultaneously may encounter microstuterring, due to the fact that
              they are like being crossfired or sli, just without the 'connector'
              outside.</p>
              <p>One of the factor that cause multistuttering is that the 2 gpus
              share the same video ram.People say Multistutering is gone on
              the 4870x2 as the 2gb of ram is not shared between the 2 gpus, more
              to 1 to each</p>
              <p>anyway, i believe my 3870x2 does suffer from it, When i
              play games it will run very fast for a few seconds, then have a
              significant lag then fast again..sth liddat</p>
              <p>I also liked the armouruit last time, but because of the pricing
              i decided not to get it.</p>
              <p>aiya, work part time for the money lor, or can do data recovery
              to earn some cash<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"><br> I find that data recovery is a very good way of earning money if
              the harddisk is not damaged too badly, as long as it is not the
              internal platters that are damage, softwares and abit of hands on
              may still be able to recovery some data</p>

              <p>Data recovery I got do, as long as the essential portions not affected then can lor. Put drive in external eSATA, plug in and copy. (My method, seems to work fine for my 3 drives which dunno why fail also, all 500GB drives <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif">. Every 5/6 months will fail liao).

              <p>den i bought it, put some shit in it from an old p4 pc so i could use it as a small living room media centre (try try first) and the casing didnt look quite that bad in the living room. i accidently dropped it while pulling it out the box, and there wasnt a problem with it, so thumbs up :)</p>
