Yes, I agree with you on the part that everything is shared on the interent, dedicated isn't really dedicated.<br><br>However, think it this way. If you are a singnet user, the only bottleneck you may experience is the internet. What do I mean? As you all know, the speed you are getting depends on the ISP (Internet Service Provider) and the server you are connecting to (Websites). Use Singnet plan, 5mbps, for an example.<br><br>Think it this way, you are a car (user) and you can travel at a [b]dedicated</strong> max speed of 5km/hr. So now you are travelling on a highway (the link between the you &amp; internet), however you can only travel at 2.5km/hr because of the speed limit (Server/internet). But, if you travel on a highway with a speed limit of 5km/hr, you can travel at full speed.<br><br>So the only bottleneck you might be experiencing is the speed limiter of the highway. Which means, the amount of bandwidth the servers allow you to use when you are connected to them.<br><br>However, for starhub user, it will be a different case. You will be experiencing two bottlenecks instead of one. Why two? Think it this way. Again, you are a car with a speed of 5km/hr. You are now travelling on a highway (the link between you &amp; internet) but this time the highway is <strong>not dedicated</strong>, so there are many cars (other users) on the highway because of that you can only travel at 2.5km/hr instead of max 5km/hr.<br><br>Even if the speed limit of the highway is 5km/hr, you will still travel at 2.5km/hr because of the other cars on the highway slowing you down.<br><br>So the two bottlenecks you might experience is whether will there be cars on the highway slowing you down and the speed limit of the highway. Which means, it will depend on whether will there be many starhub users using the net when you are using and how much bandwidth will the server you are connected to allow you to use.[/b]</blockquote><strong>why u all never caculate data loss through transmitting....<br>both provider has its pro and cons<br>but if u are gaming like almost 24/7 u wont want singnet to keep on disconecting (from RPG,CS dota)</strong><br><br>if u want/use starhub u do not want to be lag, u can be also be killed by laggness<br><br>Compare by Game              Singnet                     Star hub<br>CS                                 good                       fair good<br>downside<br>Singnet &gt;&gt;&gt;   extreme worest u need restart com + modem<br>Starhub &gt;&gt;&gt;   hope there is no much people in game or be killed<br><br>dota                               good                         better<br>downside<br>Singnet &gt;&gt;&gt; team mate dc, left u been handicapped<br>Starhub &gt;&gt;&gt; been killed but u can revenge<br><br>Maple                                fair                            best<br>cant comment much cos 2D<br><br>Repplez                                  good                    fair<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>For those MIO user bashers, I really have no idea what ordeal you guys are suffering from by using mio but for me, its been nothing short of great!!!<br><br>I have signed up for Singtel Mio plan for $68 per month. The service activation was one day earlier than the installation day as confirmed by the wonderful WyWy shop personnel in Novena Square.<br><br>On the actual day, the service technician came down one hour earlier as agreed. Installation took barely 5 minutes, and I actually asked him to conduct a series of phone checks first. E.g, I tried calling using Mio voice to my mobile, using my mobile to call back, etc. All works wonder. But seems to be a bit of echo.<br><br>The technician also helped me set the firewall settings for the Mio box (2wireHGV) and even surf the net to speedtest.net to check up the speed. It is indeed close to 3Mbps (2950kbps to be exact).<br><br>So far, I received NO internet disconnections and my Mio voice been working perfectly fine. My mother been hogging the phone throughout while my brother will be using wireless LAN for his British council studies while I am surfing the net using ethernet (not wireless). Yes, all 3 at one go!<br><br>Only thing is that I still dunno how to configure my E65 after signing up for Mio mobile.<br><br>Previously I was using<br><br>1.5Mbps ==&gt; $43 per month. Only 3 DCs throughout my 1 year contract. Was offered same price but speed upgrade to 3Mbps but I still turned to Mio.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>classic plan ==&gt; close to $80 per month due to no free incoming calls. Pretty fed up cuz was in a new job with many incoming calls looking for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>House phone ==&gt; can reach up to &gt;$80 in 3 months time cuz my mother often use the house phone to chat with her mahjong khakis   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>By signing up the Mio plan, I save a total of $203-$68= $135 (theoretically, excluding Mio mobile settings at $15/month plus the other VAS settings for Mio voice). Got a pleasant surprise when their monthly bills came cuz they bill correctly!<br><br>So far so good. Pretty impressive with singtel for introducing this new service. BTW, I am staying in Woodlands, just behind Vista point.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
