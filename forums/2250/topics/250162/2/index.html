            <div class='col-md body'>so my recommendation.  sign up for MOL.<br><br>so far i dont experience DC from their server. their donwload and upload speed(domestic) promised. easier setup comapred to Singnet.<br><br>no much problem connecting. unlike singnet, you have to be authenticated<br>before connection establish... and i experience many trouble trying to connect their server.</div>
