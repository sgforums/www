              <p>FOR most people, computer code is a foreign language - something that only geeks understand.</p>
              <p>   But a new national programme is looking to turn code into kids' play through the use of simple logical reasoning and animation.</p>
              <p>   Some 12 secondary schools and four primary schools were part of a trial this year by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to teach students simple programming.</p>
              <p>   These schools include Cedar Primary School, St Joseph's Institution Junior, Bukit View Secondary School and Springfield Secondary School.</p>
              <p>   MOE said it will encourage more schools to join the enrichment programme, known as Code for Fun, next year.</p>
              <p>   The scheme for upper primary pupils and secondary school students aims to promote interest and develop talent in computing.</p>
              <p>   Under the programme, students tinker with Scratch, a programming language developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which allows people to create their own interactive stories, video games and animations using code.</p>
              <p>   The trial is part of a national push to make Singapore a Smart Nation, which uses technology to make life better and more convenient for people.</p>
              <p>   At last week's launch of the Smart Nation vision, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had urged schools to expose students to IT and basic coding skills.</p>
              <p>   A spokesman for MOE said students currently pick up coding through elective subjects, co-curricular activities such as infocomm clubs, and enrichment classes.</p>
              <p>   Mrs Clara Lim-Tan, principal of Yu Neng Primary School, which took part in Code for Fun this year, said its objective was to "demystify the notion that coding is challenging".</p>
              <p>   It also exposed pupils to "the use of algorithms and logical reasoning to solve problems by breaking them down in a fun way", she said.</p>
              <p>   For 10 weeks from July to October, the school, which counts infocomm technology as one of its strengths, had hour- long coding lessons for the Primary 4 cohort. Pupils were given a task to write codes to create and animate a story.</p>
              <p>   Along the way, they learnt how to follow instructions in translating algorithms into programs on computing devices. They also learnt to detect and correct errors in algorithms.</p>
              <p>   "They learnt the importance of being creators, rather than just consumers of technology," said Mrs Lim-Tan.</p>
              <p>   Her school, which hopes to extend the programme to all levels eventually, will continue the lessons for pupils in Primary 4 and 5 next year.</p>
