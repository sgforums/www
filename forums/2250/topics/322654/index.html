              <p>Try the keyboard and the mouse on another computer if available, and scan your computer for malware in the meantime. It could be a simple case of hardware malfunction, or a malware is hogging up so much of your CPU resources that it delays the keyboard and mouse inputs, along with utlilizing your internet connection to send data which result in the slowdown of video streaming on your computer.</p>

              <p>There was a conflict between the owner of Zion, a VPN in the form of an mIRC add-on script once popular among gamers, versus one of the main programmers of Zion otherwise known as CuteWorm (a <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/10123793985550505636">Singaporean</a> in fact).</p>
              <p>What CuteWorm did was that he exposed one of the vulnerabilities in Zion which allowed remote code execution and pointed out where the code can be located within the script. He has also advised visitors on his site to boycott Zion and use alternatives instead. Coincidentally, there was a new patch for Zion around the same time which seemed to have removed it, but on top of that, it modifies the hosts file on the system to point cuteworm.com to their own servers (ZincPlay.com, 66.212.25.134) so that no one using Zion will be able to access <a href="http://cuteworm.com/">CuteWorm's site</a> and find out that the existence of the vulnerability, on the pretext of <a href="http://zincplay.com/forum/thread-3914-1-1.html">protecting its users from TrojanH.CuteWorm</a> (which probably didn't exist).</p>
              <p>I think they have resolved the issue among themselves already, I guess, seeing that there's once again a download link for Zion on CuteWorm's site (it was previously removed when the vulnerability was exposed).</p>
              <p>Long time short, speaking as an ex-user of Zion, Zion sucked, just like its owner.</p>

                      probably didn't exist).</p>
              <p>I think they have resolved the issue among themselves already, I
                      guess, seeing that there's once again a download link for Zion on
                      CuteWorm's site (it was previously removed when the vulnerability
                      was exposed).</p>
              <p>Long time short, speaking as an ex-user of Zion, Zion sucked,
                      just like its owner.</p>

              <p>Well, came across this site while searching for my own news.<br>Thanks for putting this news up.</p>
              <p>Anyway, we didn't resolve the issue. sprion, the owner of Zion/ZincPlay, has decided to mask the entire event with this TrojanH.CuteWorm.</p>
              <p>Well, I removed Zion initially from my website. Then I thought again, freedom is always given to users to choose. The fact is there and they are to make the decision, not me. If they choose to get infected, they face the music. I don't wish to get into the picture anymore.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, it's a free world. I have no rights to restrict the downloading of Zion. Afterall, if users can't get it from my website, they'll get it elsewhere. So might as well...</p>
              <p>Although yes, I have put Zion at the bottom of the list on my website, to prove that it is not that highly recommended.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm happy that someone sees the light and truth.</p>

              <p>LOL... Guess Zion/ZincPlay isn't too honest. If such a virus exist, there would be tons of info on Google.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your clarification. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>By the way... you should have a better name. Others couldn't take the opportunity to play with it. TrojanH.Cuteworm... kinda obvious how both are linked.</p>

              <p>Haha! Perhaps so. The word "worm" just somehow instils fear in users.</p>
