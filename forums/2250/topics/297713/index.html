The interface and how the system is ran.<br>-There are other free alternatives like openoffice that's compatible with microsoft office suite<br>-I have tried ubuntu. It's faster than vista if you would not mind those fancy graphics.But you cant expect so much. There's bond to be bugs and lesser support when u screw up as there are windows users than linux users, although the numbers are increasing by leaps and bonds.<br>-You can request a free cd from ubuntu (6 to 10 weeks shipping). And then follow the instructions. Or download it from the web and burn the iso image into a cd.<br><br>The experience wise, you would feel that it's quite weird @ first -- i was too used to windows and when i tried a mac, i was err errr. Definitely not for gamers. You would be better off with xp as it supports more titles of games.<br>There are alternative software like i said openoffice which is somewhat like microsoft office 2003.  I do not really know much yet, as i m still testing the grounds of linux.<br><br>Currently there are many kinds of Linux Os. Puppy linux, ubuntu, linux os ect ect. Pick out the one that u like and test it out first before deciding to install (live cd). Insert and just run it on your computer.</div>

While there are some easy-to-use distributions around, ultimately, you still have to know the command line (aka DOS) in Linux. Click click click won't get much done in Linux.<br><br>Some commands are very much used in Linux, especially during the installations of programs<br><br>./configure - finds out if you have the necessary programs to install something<br>./install - installs the program if ./configure reports no problems<br><br>--help - how to use a particular command. E.G. ifconfig --help<br><br>By the way, it's not called DOS or Command Prompt in Linux. It is called Terminal or Bash (depending on what you use) in Linux. Terminal is usually found in Gnome and KDE-based distributions, while Bash is often seen with Xfce and other distributions.<br><br>Linux is also case-sensitive.<br><br>While you can do this in Windows - cd desktop or cd Desktop (brings to your desktop in Windows), Linux doesn't recognize this.<br><br>To go to your desktop in Linux, the proper command is cd Desktop, anything else, Linux will cry out loud that it doesn't exist.<br><br>Something to get used to in Linux - My Documents in Windows = Home folder in Linux. It's called Home, and is either on your desktop or on the Task Bar (where the Start button is) or both. Ubuntu has it on both.<br><br>There's no more C drive. C drive is now this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> /<br><br>There's no error absolutely, it's just a slash. And a forward slash.<br><br>Unlike Windows where everything is spelt out nicely, in Linux, there's some short forms.<br><br>usrs - users<br><br>If you wonder where your folders are - look into this folder. Your Linux log in username is under that folder.<br><br>All Linux user accounts also need to be password protected, whether you like it or not. Windows doesn't need you to protect your account, but by default, this is compulsory in Linux.<br><br>Permissions are also applied differently. This you don't have to know unless you are an administrator. As a normal user, the usual permissions will do fine.<br><br>Don't tweak the permissions there if you know nothing about it or you will lock yourself out.<br><br>Now on to privileges. All Linux users are normal users with no administrator privileges. If you need to do anything that requires administrator privileges, you log in as root (sudo or su or sudo su via command line does the trick).<br><br>Root in Linux = administrator in Windows (with the notable exception of Vista, but I won't discuss this part, see the Vista thread).<br><br>2. Difficulty in implementing MS stuffs - not so, if you are keen on alternatives. There's Gnome Office, KOffice, OpenOffice and others to choose from. But of course, if you are so stuck... there are ways.<br><br>Games are the only notable exceptions. Not many succeeded in loading a game on Linux that's for Windows. You could find alternatives, definitely.<br><br>Linux is also another pain in the ass to set up. With a bit of technical knowledge and some help from the forums, you may be able to set it up, but a minority don't.<br><br>Ways to get MS programs up in Linux -<br><br>a. Download and install Wine. Load MS Office via Wine.<br><br>b. If you have money, download and install CrossOffice.<br><br>c. Get a virtual machine such as VMWare or Virtual Box, install Windows on the virtual machine, followed by MS Office. Run everything from this virtual machine. If you need the files, upload it to a file server, download from there. Linux can read these files as usual without problems.<br><br>Paid version of VMWare allows you to copy and paste your files from the virtual machine to the main machine... so if you want to avoid the hassle, pay for VMware and just drag and drop your files to Linux.<br><br>d. Dual boot. Install Windows first, followed by Linux. If you need to use MS apps, boot to Windows. As Windows can't see Linux partitions... you need to either transfer those files to a portable device (such as thumbdrive) or upload them to a server then download it.<br><br>3. Yes, I am. For easy-to-use distributions, I recommend either Pardus or OpenSuse. The latter is more popular and has much more support. If you missed Windows days, you may want to try Ubuntu or its derivatives.<br><br>4. Download the ISO file, burn it to a CD. Before burning this ISO image, make sure that you tell the program to create a bootable CD, otherwise there's no way it will boot up.<br><br>If you seriously have no idea how, this program will do it for you nicely:<br><br><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/burncdcc.html" rel="nofollow">BurnCDCC</a><br><br>Download and save this program. Open it, browse to the ISO file and click on Start. Once done, your CD will automatically eject. This CD will also be a bootable CD.<br><br>After that, get into BIOS and set your CD/DVD drive as the first boot device. Put in the CD, save the BIOS settings and let it boot up from the CD.<br><br>If you want to be completely Windows free, use the default settings. The default will just delete away Windows, format and install Linux. If you want your Windows, partition correctly.</div>
