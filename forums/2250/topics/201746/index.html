            <div class='col-md body'>Let me give all the instructions before I go off to sleep. Other forumers can help if the moderators are off to sleep. We need to study.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Once confirmed that your power supply, hard disks, RAM, CD/DVD drive is connected properly and firmly, try booting up your computer. See if it runs.<br><br>If it runs, it could have came loose because of expansion due to heat and contraction once you cool down the PC. This could result in chip creep. It's not a big problem, just clean up and reinsert them back again.<br><br>If it doesn't run, check for burns and smoke. Open up your CPU casing and smell it if there are anything that burns. No burns and smokes, continue to the next step.<br><br>Unplug everything, from keyboard to printer that is connected to the CPU.<br><br>Try booting up. If the POST screen shows, power off the PC. Wait for 30 seconds. Off all power supplies. Plug in the keyboard. Boot up again. If there is POST screen, repeat the steps again with another hardware. Only plug in one device back one at a time. If you plug in one device and POST screen no longer shows, it's that device that is giving trouble for you. If it's still under warranty, replace it. If it's not, consider whether you want to replace it or repair it.<br><br>After this, check your monitor. If it is a LCD, put it in a box, bring it to your friend's house and test it. Does the POST screen shows? If yes, it's not your monitor's problem, probably with your own CPU. If it doesn't, replace your LCD monitor. If it is not a LCD monitor, try sending it for repairs. CRT monitors last very long, if not, buy a new one. It costs less than $50 for a second-hand CRT monitor.<br><br>One more thing I forgotten, buy an additional battery and replace it. If it starts up properly after replacing, it means your battery is dead. If even a replacement battery doesn't help, I recommend you buy a new motherboard already unless it is narrowed down to some devices that are causing problems.</div>
