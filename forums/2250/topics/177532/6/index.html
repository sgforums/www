Nokia said the 6131 would retail for about 275 euros ($326.90), excluding subsidies and taxes.

The basic model, 6070, would have a retail price of about 135 euros ($160.47), Oistamo said. He added that all three phones would start shipping in the second quarter of the year.</div>

Nvidia is best known for its powerful PC graphics processors. But over the last few years, it has taken steps to recreate sharp graphics on mobile phones and handhelds. The company sells standalone graphics chips for mobile phones and licenses its graphics technology for other chipmakers to incorporate into their products, said Derek Perez, a company spokesman.<br><br>Handheld-device designers looking to cut costs tend to pick all-in-one chips that can handle basic applications such as processing, graphics and voice calls. Chips like the GoForce 5500 are designed for expensive handsets that let consumers watch movies, play PC-style video games and even pick up digital television.</div>

And Microsoft and Nokia use about five times more of the network than we do. Network capacity is scarce and battery power is scarce.
