We are all e-businesses now.<br><br>From the hot-dog cart on the corner to the multinational manufacturer, all businesses rely on the digital world for at least some part of their operation, from ordering parts to delivering products and communicating with customers and employees. The continued success of our economy depends on the enormous efficiencies made possible by the digital world.<br><br>Yet there is a hidden threat to this digital future: It's not some cyberattack, but the loss of consumer confidence in the online experience. If consumers don't believe that their critical information is protected from irreparable damage or unauthorized access, they won't continue to embrace the digital lifestyle. And that won't just hurt the digital economy, but the economy as a whole.</div>

That means security can be coordinated across the entire network, from the worker at a desk to the guts of the system.<br><br>"Assume employees are going across a lot of networks," Chambers said. "So you have to build in security from the home to any number of networks."</div>

Brad Sherman, a California Democrat who was probing whether the Internet company had cooperated with the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance efforts.<br><br>"It wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment," said Callahan, who was testifying under oath. He added that Yahoo would "only turn over information if it's required by law."</div>

Both are banning it from their networks.<br><br>Last week, Google unveiled Google Desktop 3, a free, downloadable program that includes an option to let users search across multiple computers for files. To do that, the application automatically stores copies of files, for up to a month, on Google servers. From there, copies are transferred to the user's other computers for archiving. The data is encrypted in transmission and while stored on Google servers.<br><br>The Electronic Privacy Foundation urged consumers to boycott the software, warning that Google could be forced to turn over the data to the government if subpoenaed, even if the data is stored on Google servers only temporarily.</div>

When a peripheral device was connected to a USB (universal serial bus) 2.0 port, the notebook's battery life plunged at a greater rate than would normally be expected from the use of a peripheral such as a mouse or storage key. At the time that details of the flaw were published, Intel denied its processors or chipsets were the responsible for the issue. And Microsoft refused to confirm to CNET News.com until yesterday that the software company was responsible for the battery performance problem .<br><br>Microsoft published a Knowledge Base article on the subject in July 2005, but made that information available only to PC vendors and partners, a company representative said in a statement. The software maker is not releasing the article to the public, but a copy was posted on Slashdot that industry sources have confirmed was the original article.</div>
