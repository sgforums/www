But most of its historical strength lies in emerging markets such as its home base of China, and the majority of the PCs it ships are ThinkPads, a brand it acquired from IBM. The company agreed to purchase IBM's PC business in 2004 for $1.75 billion in cash and assumed debt in hopes of not only acquiring contacts at large U.S. corporations through the ThinkPads, but also to find new customers for its Lenovo-branded products.</div>

It accelerated after the Bush administration took office and especially after the 2001 terrorist attacks, according to archives records.<br><br>But because the reclassification program is itself shrouded in secrecy--governed by a still-classified memorandum that prohibits the National Archives even from saying which agencies are involved--it continued virtually without outside notice until December. That was when an intelligence historian, Matthew M. Aid, noticed that dozens of documents he had copied years ago had been withdrawn from the archives' open shelves.</div>
