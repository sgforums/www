Is your personally identifiable data handled by the government in a way that your privacy might be breached or such that your data is safe? Inquiring minds want to know.<br><br>And just in time, a privacy think tank called the Ponemon Institute has issued its 2006 Privacy Trust Study of the United States Government. The report ranks public perception of the privacy protection practices of federal agencies, based on responses to various survey questions. More than 70 agencies were evaluated, and each was assigned a privacy trust score by factoring together positive and negative survey responses.<br><br>Let's turn to the bad news first. The least-trusted federal agencies, starting from the bottom, are: the Department of Homeland Security, the Transport Security Administration, the CIA, the Department of Justice, the Office of the Attorney General, the National Security Agency, the Bureau of Citizenship &amp; Immigration, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.</div>

Get ready to pay up</a><br><br>Technology is a wonderful thing, when it works. Just as cars run reliably but lawn mowers never start, many people wonder why humans are capable of creating amazing technology but can't make PCs that average people can understand.<br><br>As a result, demand for PC support services is booming even as retailers and PC vendors pare down their standard warranties. Fed up with pleasant but unsatisfying support answers, PC users are increasingly willing to pay for support from those companies. Third-party PC support is becoming big business, with Best Buy aggressively promoting the services of the Geek Squad and vendors like Dell jumping to provide their own touch.<br><br>It's not completely clear how big the market is for premium consumer support, said Matt Healey, an analyst with IDC. However, the overall market for Windows support last year was $7.8 billion, which includes everything from corporate server support to consumer PCs. It's safe to say the market size for consumer support measures in the "billions," he said.</div>

One of the company's first big customers was Piggly Wiggly Carolina, which last year purchased fingerprint scanners for all of its 118 stores after a four-store pilot program found shoppers who paid by fingerprint moved through the checkout line faster and returned to the store more often.<br><br>"We found that the people who used it started visiting our stores more often and spending more dollars," says Rich Farrell, vice president of information services at Piggly Wiggly. During a three-month pilot test, 15 percent of shoppers at participating stores signed up for the service, in which they completed a transaction with a fingerprint instead of entering a PIN code or signing a receipt. Store visits among those shoppers went up 12 percent, resulting in a 15 percent increase in spending.</div>

In seconds, the molecule turns from a floppy, formless shape into a rigid structure. When adding a blood or saliva sample contaminated with cocaine to the sensor, the change can be instantly measured by sending electrons through the DNA and seeing how they travel.</div>
