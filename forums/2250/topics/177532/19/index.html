The Net neutrality proponents even argue that the nondiscrimination prohibition should apply to wireless and all other technology platforms that deliver Internet access to consumers. Unfortunately, the Net neutrality forces appear to be gathering strength just as the broadband marketplace is becoming vigorously competitive, rendering a new government Internet mandate unnecessary. Adoption of a broad Net neutrality prohibition will impose monopoly-era public-utility-style regulation on new broadband services in an era characterized by competition.<br><br>Witness the bill (S. 2360) introduced on March 2 by Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. His "Internet Non-Discrimination Act of 2006" provides that a network operator "shall not interfere with, block, degrade, alter, modify, impair, or change any bits, content, application or service transmitted over the network of such operator." Nor shall it "discriminate in favor of itself or any other person, including any affiliate or company with such operator has a business relationship in (A) allocating bandwidth; and (B) transmitting content or applications or services to or from a subscriber."</div>

Yes, we all know about both sides of the story Â— the complaints by both patent holders mostly outside Asia and those in Asia new to the patent regime.<br><br>A recent report by the U.S.-based Manufacturing Policy Project concludes that companies from countries with weak IP protection are copying technologies from unprotected patent applications that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and Japan's Patent Office (JPO) post on the Internet. The JPO found out that its applications are being examined about 17,000 times daily from China and 50,000 times daily from South Korea.<br><br>The report claims that Chinese pirates and counterfeiters are now defending themselves with a new technique called Â“A Great Wall of Patents.Â” This process involves filing for patents in China for the products copied. The applications are claimed to use modified drawings and descriptions taken from the patent office Internet sites in the United States, Europe and Japan.</div>
