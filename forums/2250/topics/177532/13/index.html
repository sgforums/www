The software inside the player was forged at Iventor by a small team of programmers led by Paul Mercer, 38, a veteran Apple Macintosh software designer.<br><br>Samsung's decision to hire Mercer is significant because Apple, in designing the original iPod four years ago, turned to Pixo, the company Mercer founded after he left Apple in 1994 to create software for handheld devices.</div>
