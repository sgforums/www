The list extends to everyday devices like hard drives and programming languages. But today, about half of Big Blue's revenues derive from consulting services--hardly a hard science.<br><br>Horn's job is to make the squishy field of services resemble something like an engineering discipline.

New PCs that come with Vista will come with a Windows Automatic Upgrade DVD, which can be used with a later update that is purchased online.<br><br>"If you want more features in Windows Vista, you can upgrade to another version," Microsoft said in help notes that accompany the most recent test version of Windows. "You can either buy a separate upgrade disc at a retail store or use Windows Anytime Upgrade to buy the upgrade online, and then use your Windows Anytime Upgrade disc or the Windows installation disc to complete the process."</div>

Its successor, "Woodcrest," uses the same interface and fits into the same machines, and is due to arrive in servers in the third quarter of the year.

It gives us both performance and performance-per-watt leadership. That'll be the one we position most aggressively, market most aggressively and use as the flagship product," Gelsinger said in an interview Tuesday at the Intel Developer Forum.
