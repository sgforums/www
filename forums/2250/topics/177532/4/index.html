While the Net is indeed facing a threat, it's not the one that some pundits make it out to be.<br><br>Consider, for example, a CNET News.com editorial by Gigi Sohn of Public Knowledge. Sohn claims that "without regulation, the vital Internet we know today would never have developed." That's a laughable reinterpretation of history akin to Al Gore's insinuation that he created the Internet, and a twist of the facts worthy of George Orwell's "1984." But in a world where information moves so fast that people sometimes forget the facts, it's worth setting the record straight.<br><br>The Internet, and the technologies that developed around it, has thrived precisely because of minimal government regulation. The idea that bureaucratic control of the old telcos spurred the growth of the thriving communications infrastructure we see today is palpably ridiculous.</div>

Well, as the Byrds once instructed, first you get a guitar and learn to play it, at least a little. Then you get the right haircut, the right clothes. Then you go see the agent downtown. After that it's cake; though, to assure maximum fame, it helps to get an embarrassing video on the Internet, marry fabulously, get hooked up to a drug habit and -- rock gesture of all rock gestures -- to die young.<br><br>Jen Trynin didn't commit all of these star turns, but she worked her way through a few. As she recounts in her booze-drenched and smoke-wreathed memoir, "Everything I'm Cracked Up to Be: A Rock &amp; Roll Fairy Tale," her career trajectory started off innocently enough: learning the guitar at age 11, identifying with Joni Mitchell and other singer-songwriters, releasing a pleasant EP on an obscure jazz label.<br><br>But then, in the whirl of the early-'90s Boston scene, Trynin decided that she was really a rocker and formed a band. Here her book takes off, and it's a whirlwind. At first, naturally, her geography is all uphill, from the indignity of landing a slot three dozen down the list at an open-mike night to the hard work of flogging a self-released debut CD, the memorable "Cockamamie." More than once she threatens to quit the music business, saying of that particular kitchen, "It's not the heat, it's the stupidity."</div>
