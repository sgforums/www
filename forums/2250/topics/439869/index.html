              <p><br>sim lim is not for the noob. i suggest you google on the internal structure of a standard desktop and not rush into DIY and act coola fter that showing your friends what you did. probably one day after you build your PC you will simply want to get a stabdard OEM desktop instead, going back to the start. maybe one day you will only want enough just to get your PC doing the stuff everyone does daily, surfing the net, playing some games, doing your office work, watch some clips so on..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i can answer you now is you will get conned and fleeced like a sheep now if you walk into simlim. only those who knows the hardware they want inside out can walk proudly there, get what he wants and fuck off. these ar etthe people who knows when not to give in to tricks, taunts, challenge and group tricksters trying to have a saleman sell you things while a bystanding accomplices (acting like regular customer) telling you that.</p>

              <p><br>i used to believe so. my first few computer parts i bought from Fuwell at Sim lim, still working okay. but i bought one graphics card from fuwell funan (before the store outlet there closes a few years back) - the card just died less than a year use. and the odd thing is allthe good parts i bought from them in sealed condition, except the one i bought from the funan outlet not in sealde condition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so l earn the ghard way, and i also learn no matter how good an organizaton or a shop is, there are bound to be times when they do some things to their goods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its not the shop names i tell you, as long as there are humans, and humans operate the act, there will bound to be cases like these.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that;s why i never mentioned all these shops telling TS they are safe to shop at but rather let him go try himself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just like people say batam or my is good here and there. i been there work a few times now - not need many more times , and i still feel Singapore is better and a place for me, to be borned, live and die here. of course some or most of us are unhappy, but those unhappiness we can vent out during elections, as long as every few years our constutuency allows us the chance to vote with no walkovers.</p>

              <p>You may be glad to know that they have changed drastically in the past few years. PCT used to be a sketchy shop, and then they brushed up on their customer service and is now one of the busiest stores in SLS.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
              <p>Same goes for Fuwell. They have expanded such that they now have two outlets within SLS and though their customer service is lacking in some areas, they are honest and reliable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cybermind has to be the store that exhibited the biggest change. They used to be known as 'Choppermind' in the past but now feature prices on par with other stores and are home to one of the largest monitor display showcases in SLS.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>nevertheless, i will still warn TS about buying stuff anyway, espeicially electronics ones like computer parts. Many shops there now follow Fuwell's practise, to have a price list updated so prices more or less are fixed and open for comparisons and purchaser's choice. but stillhave to be careful, like i wrote, as long as there are people involved, there alwasy will have problem.</p></div>

              <p>I must say though, computers in singapore are freaking

              <p>In USA, Canada, even Malaysia, a extremely good computer can be
              built at around S$1.5k Try the exact same built in Singapore, BAM,
              S$2.4k.. Sigh, really ridiculous, no matter how i look at it.</p>
