You cannot use a 3132 for reference. I check Hp site and even they only printed the series number (V3000T) and quote the possibilties. Unless you have the specification exact for V3136TU from some trusted sites then you can approach them.<br><br>I guess they are using this fine line to address to customer and they were prepared for it. Don't be suprise that V3136TU was a model number requested by or provided to starhub for this promotion. An if aver a specification sheet were requested HP/ compaq might be able to produce one true and accurate showing that it comes without an infrared port.</div>

You cannot use a 3132 for reference. I check Hp site and even they only printed the series number (V3000T) and quote the possibilties. Unless you have the specification exact for V3136TU from some trusted sites then you can approach them.<br><br>I guess they are using this fine line to address to customer and they were prepared for it. Don't be suprise that V3136TU was a model number requested by or provided to starhub for this promotion. An if aver a specification sheet were requested HP/ compaq might be able to produce one true and accurate showing that it comes without an infrared port.</div></blockquote>Well i dont know abt the 3136 spec coz i thrown the box with sticker away <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Anyway Why dont u head over to HWZ and discuss with them over this?</div>

DVD-RAM optical drives can write on all DVD-media including dual layer DVD-media that has double the storage capacity of a standard 4.7 GB media up to 9.4GB.
