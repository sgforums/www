            <div class='col-md body'>ST: June 28, 2006<br>SingNet should fix access problems first<br><br>IN THE news recently, SingNet was talking about deploying ultra broadband and raising access speeds up to 100Mbps.<br><br>The irony is that it cannot even fix basic access problems in its current network.<br><br>I have been a SingNet broadband subscriber since May last year.<br><br>In the first year, I was a 512kbps user but as my experience was very unsatisfactory, I upgraded to 1500kbps unlimited plan since May this year.<br><br>I started using an online trading portal from November 2005, and it did not work because the network was very slow.<br><br>Since November, there is a history of my case no.5657577, which did not get resolved.<br><br>Because of the poor performance, I upgraded to 1500kbps plan, and my experience got worse, even for basic browsing.<br><br>Trying other networks, I have connected to the same sites using wireless LANs in my neighboorhood and I can see a marked improvement when I get on some of them (apparently StarHub's broadband).<br><br>It is also worthwhile noting that when I changed the network in my travels abroad (eg. in Korea, India), the response times improved dramatically.<br><br>This proves that the problem is in the SingNet network and not with my personal computer set-up or the remote servers being accessed.<br><br>For instance, last month I was in Delhi and stayed in a hotel which had a 512kbps DSL line.<br><br>Still, my online experience was far better than what I experienced at home here.<br><br>Besides, most of the time on Skype, the voice keeps breaking up whereas most others can use it quite well.<br><br>I am a telecom professional and can figure out from my experience that it is not the DSL link, which the SingNet linesmen keep coming to test again and again.<br><br>It is either the SingNet network that is the bottleneck or it uses very high over-subscription on the BRAS, which effectively chokes the throughput.<br><br>I am really tired of taking pings, trace-routes and remote terminal traces and sending them to the SingNet staff over the past six months.<br><br>I have done everything I possibly can to help their Tier 2 and 3 technical staff to fix the problems, but there was no significant improvement.<br><br>The other thing about SingNet customer service is its method of contact.<br><br>Everytime one needs to contact SingNet, one has to either call the customer technical support hotline and go through the whole history again or go online and fill out the customer feedback forms.<br><br>It's painful and frustrating doing it every time.<br><br>There is no way for the customer to cut short this process even when he has been interacting on the same issue for months.<br><br>Rajiv Jain<br><br>same with us <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

That's because they are hosted by us, so they will be fast.<br><br>However, once we cross this border, the speed difference would be significant. There are a few reasons for it.<br><br>1) Peak Hour Traffic Delays Content-hosting servers may be overloaded during peak hours, when the number of concurrent connections exceeds the webserver's capacity. This can result in delays in accessing data. You should re-try accessing the site at a later time. This is especially so when we cross different timelines. Right now, it is night time here. Over at the US, it's getting to day time soon. As more users wake up and start accessing their favourite sites, this delay can be significant, to the extent of not able to access the website.<br><br>2) Content Provider's System Configuration<br>Different content-hosting webservers can provide varying end-user experiences. For instance, webservers with high-powered CPUs and large amounts of memory would be better equipped to handle a high demand for content as compared with less powerful webservers.<br><br>Similarly, end-user access speeds may also be affected by the content providers' bandwidth connection to the Internet. If this bandwidth connection is insufficient, the end-user may experience slow access speeds, even if the local Internet service provider has allocated sufficient bandwidth for this connection.<br><br>This problem is more tricky as it is now not within our means to solve it. It's up to the providers to improve the situation.<br><br>3) External Routing Delays/Congestion Slow connection speeds are sometimes also due to overseas routing delays or congestion. In such cases, the delays may be beyond the control of local service providers. Again, this is not within our means.<br><br>There's also another factor: the number of hops.<br><br>Hops are the number of point-to-point links in a transmission path. Since each link is terminated at a network device such as a router or gateway, the processing performed within the device to determine how to forward the packet adds overhead to the transmission. Although each point-to-point link is technically a hop, the hop count is the number of network devices between the starting node and the destination node. An IP packet traveling over the Internet can easily "hop" through more than a dozen routers. Depending on how each company configures their network, it may take a longer or shorter time. Typically, the more hops the data packet has to make, the longer it would take.<br><br><a href="http://www.ida.gov.sg/idaweb/broadband/infopage.jsp?infopagecategory=factsheet:broadband&amp;versionid=1&amp;infopageid=I3853" rel="nofollow">More information here</a></div>
