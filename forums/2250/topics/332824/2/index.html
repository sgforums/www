              <p><br>its not clipping. its due to interference from some components or shielding wasnt done properly. its a high pitched "ssssssssssssssssss" that u sometimes hear on cheap hi-fi, but in this case, its not my speakers, as when i turn off the PC, the hissing disappears. it shows that my integrated audio card is the cause of all this.</p>
              <p>anyway, ive used to have an "r/d/s" brand sub sitting in the living room, its loud, it plays low, its got a 15" driver, but it doesent really sound that refined. and not to mention it looks like a Borg Cube. :P i just sold it off last month.</p>

              <p>professional ones, he tested the suond for me to hear, very impressed, but abit afriad about the price,the speaker is identical to the size of the speaker the school hall uses, and woofer although 15", need at least 600watts, the size bbbbiiiigggg</p>
              <p><br>no fanciful lights, only 1 or 2 green power, a dial to turn, i tink if i seen correctly there is a word "crown" or "QSC" on it, and the dial have sth like +5, +10, then 0 or -5, -10...looks and sound like somthing serious</p>

              <p>karaoke speakers are crap.. they sound tinny and annoying. unless u managed to master the art of EQ tuning, whcih i spent 2 years perfecting mine. ive got wharfedale 32 band EQ hooked up btw my pc and my altec MX5021 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>to get a strong mid bass, u gotta amp up the 125-350Hz region, but that might result in some boominess, if overdone. usually, pro audio speakers come with horn loaded tweeter design, which emphasises the highs so they can be projected over a distance. this might get irritating when you blast rock music, as the crash cymbals fall on 1-2kHz region. tune it down, like what i do to my MX5021 cus it also has horn loaded tweets.</p>
              <p>for woofers, EV might be a tad bit weak. try behringer woofers. got oomph. provided u know how to tune la <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>a useful tip to those who just got new speakers:</p>
              <p>dont immediately blast the speakers when you plug them in on first run. it might result in damage of some components or in the less serious case, sound degradation.</p>
              <p>be sure to run the speakers on less than half volume, covering at least 4 hrs each day for a span of 2-3 weeks. then slowly amp it up. this will warm up parts and get it ready for blasting. after this process, may you then proceed to blast your system but dont forget to exercise caution with teh bass controls if any. overdosage on volume and bass might result in damaege to the weaker woofers.</p>
