Using JavaScript?<br><br>If yes, basically, you got owned by her. By disabling JavaScript, one can easily view the blog. If you are using other methods... also, you mentioned that you gave the password to others, so whoever knows that password would have given her access.</div>

I'm using a router. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div></blockquote>Gateway address is for you to configure your router.<br><br>There's another IP address known as the internal IP address. You can tell it by clicking on your connection (near the clock), select the Support tab. You will see IP Address: X.X.X.X, where X are numbers. That's the one assigned by your router, and is the internal IP address. Internal IP addresses are used on local networks only. So let's say you have a laptop and a PC and you want to share files, you can just connect to your laptop without ever needing the Internet.<br><br>The external IP address is what we are talking about. It's the one assigned by your ISP (Pacnet, Singnet, Starhub, M1, QMax, iCell). They are the ones that get logged by servers. Recall the threads hijacking? Jason knew because it was logged down by servers. It's also traceable, in the above link given to missqi.</div>
