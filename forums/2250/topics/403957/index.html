              <p>Hi i'm new here so please bear with me if I'm abit noob or what lol. I'm offered for SingNet recontract and I made a choice to recontract with 6Mbps broadband plan (unlimited) at the same price as my current 3Mbps one.   I have a problem here, because they offer to give me an ADSL2+ Integrated Wireless Modem for free but I already have a ADSL modem (Prolink Hurricane 8000). My question is, because I set the delivery date/time for the free modem for next Wednesday, but my new plan is activated this Saturday, will the net connection still work through my current modem (wired). I've read from the site that it supports max 8Mbps downstream, but I'm worried that it might not be compatible as most of the plans now are using wireless. So, will it still work before I can get my free modem?  Thanks if you can offer your opinions. :)</p>
              <p>P.S. Another question, is the wireless modem above stated USB or Ethernet? Because I don't have ethernet port but only USB ports. It'll be a bother if it's ethernet and that my current modem isn't compatible... :/</p>

              <p>To your first query: You will still be able to use your current Internet connection. Rest assured.</p>
              <p>To your second query: It has both  USB and Ethernet. Furthermore, you have an additional wifi connection if your PC has built in wireless.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p> Just to make sure, my Prolink Hurricane 8000 uses ADSL (first gen) not ADSL2+, so 6Mbps plan really is compatible? What's the different between those two anyway, and how will it affect my new connection? Another thing is that I saw some sites state that the Prolink can max 4Mbps but the official website shows 8Mbps. Which one is true? And yet another query, I've heard from my cousin that the internet connection speed can be affected by the performance of our computer itself. I'm using an old Dell with only 128mb of RAM, so how badly will it be affected? Currently I have seamless connection with my 3Mbps plan. And another one is, my connection tray icon shows 3.4mbps everytime I connect, but I'm using 3Mbps, so will it hinder my 6Mbps if it continues to show 3.4Mbps? Why does it show 3.4Mbps anyway? Sorry about the bombardment of questions, but I really need confirmation on all those above issues. Thanks.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Guys it seems that I got my 6Mbps connection activated today and I have it running now. Problem is, the modem I'm using, the Prolink Hurricane 8000, seems to be limiting my downstream speed at about 4Mbps. But it's stated to be a full-rated ADSL modem and should go up to 8Mbps. So what's the beef here? And furthermore, my phone line seems to be unavailable when I pick up the phone, I only hear the Tooot-Toooot-Tooot~, not the constant Trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt~. What's this about?</p></div>
