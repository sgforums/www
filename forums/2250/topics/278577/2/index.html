            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously I don't think starhub is that bad for surfing website. But for what i know is that When i play WOW connected to US server it sure lag like shit compare to when i' in US <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> But when i tried my friend singnet line is not so bad. So i guess starhub is not that good for mmorpg so far away. I'm someone who can't take lag. So is preferred. I got some friend who play with 1000ms latency and they say is fine. so is all about preferred.</div>
