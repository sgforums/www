            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>Just a theory... But wouldn't it make sense to make sure all the testing servers on the http://www.speedtest.net/ website were on the traffic shaping exempt list if you knew in advance that your customers would go to this website and post results about how fast their connections are to various servers in different parts of the world? You always want to present your own ISP in the best possible light(by this I mean from the ISP perspective).<br></strong></blockquote>How do you know if an exempt list even exist? I think it's just an excuse for your cause. You can might as well say that any server accessible to a StarHub user at 15kB and above is "in the exempt list".<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>Now thats a troll. its not even a zip file at all.<br>file 1MB.220.233.0.0..80.chenc.file.zip<br>1MB.220.233.0.0..80.chenc.file.zip: data<br>I called it .zip to stop browsers from trying to open the file. By default when they see a .zip extension, they present you with a dialogue box rather than trying to open it automatically. The file was created from random data using this command:<br>dd if=/dev/urandom of=./1MB.220.233.224.217..80.chenc.file.zip bs=1024k count=1<br>This website here is the manual page for dd:<br>man dd<br></strong></blockquote>Do you even know what's a troll? I think you should take some time at Wikipedia to read about it, or maybe just take a quick look at the mirror.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>The reason why I linked to that article is that this could be an ongoing problem(lack of sufficient international bandwidth). They possibly solved the gaming issues using QoS and traffic shaping(shaped web traffic to slow speeds) which means they would not have to have upgraded their backhaul or if they did, not by much. When ISPs in Australia start to run out of International bandwidth, they are exposed in the media, even including the biggest ISPS:<br>Optus caught short on international bandwidth<br>Just as a quick side note... The SG Govt. now owns Optus.<br></strong></blockquote>So now you're feeling sore that ISPs in SG don't run out of bandwidth?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>Just because I'm a newbie at this forum does not mean I am newbie at IT/computers/networking. I made sure my tests and results were bulletproof before coming here and posting. What is that quote they say in relation to the truth?<br>All truth passes through 3 stages.<br>First, it is ridiculed.<br>Second, it is violently opposed.<br>Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.<br></strong></blockquote>Yea, accept it, StarHub doesn't cap its download speed. Stop opposing the truth.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>Now that I have anwered those questions. Time you answered mine(A better question would be, why are you so hostile to the evident truth. What ulterior motives do you have? Do you work for or someone you know work for SingNet/PacNet/other small ISPs in Singapore?)<br></strong></blockquote>Bah, I'm just hostile to your false statements. My motive is to prevent forum newbies to come in and spread rumours without sufficent proof. Hmm, I think a friend of friend of friend of friend of friend of mine is working in either SingNet, StarHub or PacNet.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>I have explained my testing methodology in detail. Take it upon yourself to try it out and DISPROVE IT.<br>BTW surely you mean "Easy-Off Bam. BAM! And the dirt is gone!" :p<br></strong></blockquote>Good that you know it too. So why are you still here? (Guess like I need some H2SO4).<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>220.233.*.* is a host in AU that I have administrator access to. I do have the power on this machine to influence the test results either for the negative or postive via stange firewall and/or shaping rules. However I did not do so for theses test.<br></strong></blockquote>God knows.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>I'll explain it a little more simple for you to understand... When you type this into your browser:<br>http://www.sgforums.com/<br>http is the protocol<br>www.sgforums.com is the server<br>there is an implicit :80 done automatically by your browser. Its done in the background so you don't notice it. Try clicking on this link here:<br>http://www.sgforums.com:80/?action=forum_display&amp;forum_id=2250<br>and tell me where you end up.<br></strong></blockquote>It leads to a blank page. If you could tell us that "there's an implicit :80" in URLs, why can't you even decode an "[and]amp"? Or you didn't even bother to proofread your own posts?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>Anyway with the release of my new speedtest tool there is a call for more servers to join in.<br></strong></blockquote>Don't worry - I've just came up with one.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>Previously it would have been tempting to blame it on the other end for being under heavy load or not having enough bandwidth. Now it turns out to be the opposite, the server is fine, its the ISP who does not have enough bandwidth<br></strong></blockquote>I think it's still the former, y'know. You still can't get over that Optus incident?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>I found out two weeks ago when out 2 of the 3 Singaporeans who happened to be on the same ISP both complained of slow speeds while the other Singaporean on a different ISP had lightening fast speeds. Immediately I thought it was a little strange and needed investigating. Furthermore in this thread alone it has only been two people who have stepped up to confirm what I have been saying LyonK(technically inclined yes/no?) and chenc(who already admitted they didn't know about the specific issues we have been talking about) and these two should be congratulated for their bravery in a clearly hostile environment. The 3 most technically inclined users here, LatecomerX, ndmmxiaomayi, and kenn3th(who recently participated in a speed test yet refuses to participate in this one) all refuse at point blank to confirm or deny these speed tests. Not one of these 3 have duplicated my testing procedures even though full details of the testing tools and methodology has been given. One has to wonder why(my turn for a conspiratorial viewpoint)?<br></strong></blockquote>Why should I bother to even try out your "testing procedures" when:<br>1. you have just joined the forum yesterday<br>2. the zips are of unknown origin - you could be trying to spread a virus/malware<br>3. you are just a stranger floating on the net whereas StarHub has buildings all over Singapore<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by johnnygamer:<strong><br>A gamble, a risk, one they were willing to take. One they have successed in getting away with for who knows how long until I exposed what is going on here. When you consider the motive of money, it makes perfect logical sense. As for the irked customers, the ones outside a contract of course, tell me, that have they done so far? About the only thing I've seen here is denial of the reality of what is occuring(looks at 3 amigos) - stage 1 of the truth process.<br></strong></blockquote>Eew. I guess you're still at Stage 1 of accepting the fact that StarHub didn't cap its DL/UL for port 80.<br></div>

I guess its because quite a bit of technical knowledge is required to setup said test. To make things more easier for the average punter I have setup an online speedtest that only requires visiting said website and clicking the download link and then posting their results in the forum.</blockquote>As I've said, you need a reasonable sample size.<br><br><blockquote>This line of reasoning would quickly develop into a paranoid conspiratorial viewpoint. 3 different servers, all speedlimiting StarHub IPs on port 80 only? It must be a conspiracy :p</blockquote>Conspiracy? Maybe. There are so many servers out there. I still don't buy that quote.<br><br><blockquote>I have already told you my theory on why. It was so they could put off upgrading their international bandwidth. My theory is that this has been ongoing since or shortly after that article's news report when StarHub must have introduced QoS and traffic shaping. By making sure applications that need low latency are giver a higher priority and making sure that applications which aren't time sensitive(web surfing) are given a low priority and speed, they can fake network improvements. Don't get me wrong, QoS and traffic shaping can give you network improvements, but International websites at dialup and ISDN speeds is not an improvement, its a step backwards. By the way it would not be too noticeable if the majority your traffic was already been cached beforehand. But what happens when it hasn't been, it would be extremely slow. Previously it would have been tempting to blame it on the other end for being under heavy load or not having enough bandwidth. Now it turns out to be the opposite, the server is fine, its the ISP who does not have enough bandwidth</blockquote>That is possible... but still, it's anyone's guess. Also, they have just settled a lawsuit. I don't think they will pour in money to upgrade... if this is true.<br><br><blockquote>A gamble, a risk, one they were willing to take.
