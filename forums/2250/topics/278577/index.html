I'm sure you can see the folly in that.<br><br>Please visit <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.speedtest.net/index.php</a> again and chose a server outside of SG. Please pick one in either US or AU. After doing so please take another screenshot and post your results here for all to see.<br><br>After doing that.... I am sure it would be possible to add sites to the traffic shaper exempt list and it might be possible that speedtest.net is added to the exempt list. Can you please repeat the testing procedure we used? Its quite simple...<br><br>0. Download WGET from here:<br><a href="http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/wgetwin-1_5_3_1-binary.zip" rel="nofollow">WGET for Windows</a><br>1. Extract the zip file to C:\wget<br>2.

Also paste what speed you are on.<br><br>If your results match ours(10-15KB/sec) you will clearly see that StarHub is capping international websites. To answer your question, if it was Odex all protocols and ports both local in SG and international would be speed capped :p As to "Why the heck would StarHub cap download speed to such a low limit?" I answered that in my original post:<br><a href="http://forum.starhub.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?s=efc000e7b56899a41a0387e4256b040c;act=ST;f=21;t=22900" rel="nofollow">StarHub is capping intl websites to 10-15KB/sec</a><br><blockquote>This would suggest that StarHub is maxing out their international bandwidth and have put this in as a band-aid solution instead of upgrading their backend haul bandwidth.</blockquote>Also read the article I linked to within that post:<br><a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1265035" rel="nofollow">Gamers upset about StarHub's sluggish broadband speeds</a><br><br>Again if your results match ours(10-15KB/sec), then your responses have been wrongfully quite hostile. No need to shoot the messenger. Go and unleash your anger where it rightfully belongs, on your ISP StarHub, in their official forum. Take the time to register at their forum and tell them in that thread I started that your not happy. After that tell people you know who uses StarHub to go and post there also.<br><br>You might ask why bother posting there? Simple StarHub believes that complaints about their service are "few and far between" and also they believe that "we do not agree our connection is slower", posting provides a rebuttal to both of those beliefs.<br><br>I'm looking forward to your results.</div>

So if your testing to a so called partner website you will receive the full speed. .<strong>Try surfing to a website outsite their list and you will be surfing at the crippling speed of 10-15KB/s.</strong> Try with some other smaller servers around.

            <div class='col-md body'>P2P is a different kind of technology, so I don't think it will be a good comparison. Most home computers will never get to the stage of being a dedicated server, unlike servers that are purposely build for that.<br><br>Besides, P2P means connecting directly to someone else, while connecting through a website is not. Singapore internet connections prohibit us from directing connecting to a server. Everything is going through a national proxy.</div>

How much bandwidth is allocated to them? What's the server specs? How many people are accessing the server at any one time?<br><br>These factors can cripple a fast server. Castlecops, a well-established security website, has a huge server, great bandwidth. But yet they are slow. Why? As a security website, they are a target of attack. This can greatly reduce bandwidth. Tens of thousands can be accessing Castlecops at any one time.<br><br>Even without considering any attacks on Castlecops, it does take some time to reach Castlecops and download stuffs from there due to the workload.</div></blockquote>I'm quite well aware of those nuances. The anapnea is hosted on a 100Mbps/100Mbps connection. I'm waiting to hear back from the blacksburgpower admin what bandwidth he has allocated to it. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>However my testing methodology bypasses nuances like the ones you have suggested above. When the person on StarHub downloaded a 1MB file on port 80 he only got 10-15KB/sec. When he downloaded a different 1MB file FROM THE SAME SERVER straight after that one had finished ON A DIFFERENT PORT he got 78.77KB/s. This was clearly explained in the results section of the original thread.</strong></span> <span style="color: red;"><strong>This is clearly proof that StarHub are traffic shaping international web traffic that falls outside of their partner net to the crippling speed of 10-15KB/sec.</strong></span> This was clearly explained in English in the original thread IF you took the time to read the whole thread in its entirety and took the time to understand what was being said.<br><br>During the time of testing, one person on StarHub, the other on SingNet, they both downloaded from the same servers pretty close in time to one another. While the person on SingNet got variable speeds for different runs, the person on StarHub got consistent speeds of 10-15KB/s.<br><br>My results are quite easy to verify for youself. Find yourself one friend overseas who has a home broadband connection with an upload speed greater than 10-15KB/s. Get them to setup SHTTPD on both port 80 and some other random port. Get them to put 2 different test files into the SHTTPD directory. Download one file using port 80, download the second file using some other port. Record and post your results here.<br><br>In regards to p2p and torrents, that would not be a fair comparision for two reasons, one, not all of them connect on port 80(in my original post I stated that web traffic[port 80] is being speed limited), two, p2p and torrents normally have multiple connections to different people for the same file so the transfer speed you are seeing is an aggregate of those individual streams.</div>
