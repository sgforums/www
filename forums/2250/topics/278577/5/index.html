            <div class='col-md body'>personally i think it all started with the big earthquake in taiwan which broke several undersea cable lines. Faced with heavy internet traffic woes, Starhub decided to cap the speed to some sites in order to maximise speed to other more popular sites.<br><br>Seriously i think everything has become slow since the taiwan earthquake.</div>

Typically when there is a break in the submarine cables or there is a repeater failure it normally takes 10 days to repair the problem however it can extend up to 25 days to repair the problem. That earthquake was almost 1 year ago and so the submarines cables would have already been fixed by now.</div>
