            <div class='col-md body'>I wanted to switch from Pacnet to Starhub. However, my friend advised me not to as they mentioned a case whereby some IT company (Odix or something) had 'forced' Starhub to reveal information of its subscribers?<br><br>He told me it's a case of illegal d/l of anime? Pardon my ignorance. How does one d/l anime?? Does it mean those like 2mb+ short clips? or? How can those that dl short clips be fined so high? What does anime means and how does it involve the company? The way my friend described is like so vague and dangerous. If one never downloads anime illegally, will any other info be disclosed then? Any gurus wish to update me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
