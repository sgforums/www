            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm found the below info<br><br><blockquote><br>discussions.virtualdr.com<br>A hard drive contains platters that are magnetic media capable of having the magnetic state of areas on them changed and having this magnetic state retained/maintained. Data is held on a hard drive by representing it in binary form (1s an 0s). The way these 1s and 0s are physically represented on a drive's platter(s) is by having areas (spots) that are magnetically charged or not. The 1's are represented by charged (positive and negative) areas, the 0s are represented by uncharged areas (there is a level of tolerance by which an area is deemed charged or not). When a sector becomes "bad", or is deemed to be so, it is because areas within it no longer appear to be able to maintain a sufficiently magnetized (postitive or negative) state (charge) to represent the 1's data in those areas. Bad sectors are marked (flagged) in a table and, when possible, remapped to one of series of spare sectors all hard drives have.<br><br>Now, sometimes an area is deemed (flagged) as bad when it may in fact not really be. Perhaps some oddity during the write process caused the spot to be too weakly charged (which really shouldn't happen or at least not often as that is a sign of another problem), rather than it being a case of the actual area on the media being bad in some way. Using the appropriate utility a sector previously marked as bad can be un-marked (taken off the bad list). And you can use one of these utilities to put a sector back in service (so to speak). Nothing is "fixed", just made available for use again as is.<br><br>Few if any sectors in modern hard drives should go bad after they leave the factory. Occassionaly maybe a sector may be erroneously flagged as bad when it really isn't, but this should be very rare. And if sectors do start cropping up as bad it is time to start thinking about another hard drive. Bad sectors can't get repaired, not by the user (not even with the hard drive manufacturer's utilities).<br></blockquote>if the above info is indeed true, does that means freezing will actually affects the harddisk polarity???</div>
