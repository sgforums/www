              <p>I was looking through the internet search for a hosting company for my company's new website. Apparently I chanced upon this site cmsforever.com. I don't know if I should sign up for its services. The reason is while all the other hosting services I have came across either required a monthly or yearly subscription, or imposed advertising banners on the site, cmsforever.com only require a one time payment to have the web hosting account and domain name setup and owned forever without advertising.</p>
              <p>I mean it sounds pretty crazy.</p>
              <p>Mind if any of you who has signed up for this company's package give me some feedback. Hopefully as soon as possible. Cause I read that there are only 500 accounts up for grabs, and I seriously wonder how many there are left?</p>

              <p>I wonder why would you be the one in charge of something that you obviously had no clue about?</p>
              <p>There is obviously not the numbers of account left. Just a advertising ad to push people to sign up.</p>
              <p>There is no such thing as forever... What will happen if their company had no income and still need to maintain the site? Their company will fold and so will their servers...</p>
              <p>And it is always better to get hosting and domain in different coy.</p>

              <p>Well you know economic crisis and all, so everyone is thinking of cutting cost (citibank workers got retrench, DBS workers got retrench....etc etc), So boss being alittle on the kiasu side, (though company is still making really nice profits at the moment), told me to research into alternatives to cut cost from our existing operating structure as well.

              <p>Of course there are other means for cutting cost too, some of them are listed below</p>

              </ul>

              <p>Yeah they might. Only problem is this company has been around for ages under the name futureworkz.com.sg. They have quite a few very big clients in their portfolio. Apparently this is a recent branch off from their main operations (web developement) and their office is just downstairs from mine at iHUB. I often have coffee with one of their staff.</p>
              <p>I think if it is a scam, it will definitely be very hard for them to run off with such a major establishment they have and all.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, I think I should go tease him about it over coffee tomorrow. Hehehe.... :P</p>
              <p>And probably sign up a few accounts with him after that. After all he did leak out info that his boss will be switching the pricing structure back to normal after the 500 accounts have been sold. Not much left apparently less than 50 accounts actually.</p>
