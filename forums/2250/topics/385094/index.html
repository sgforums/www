              <p>Hi there, my computer screen has a problem. Please help.</p>
              <p>The screen keeps lag, auto shut and few secs later, it auto on again. And would appear an ATI pop out. This problem happens more when playing 3D game (such as audition). Sometimes the screen would even lag and shut for a long period of time, and I have to off and on the computer switch. I tried to scan thru virus but none was found. </p>
              <p><em>Only the </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>screen</em></span><em> keeps auto restart.</em></p>

My mum did tried to bring the whole CPU down to the repair centre but the person can't observe any problem, as he though maybe is the game has problem. So my mum was ask to go home and try out other games. Realising that not only playing audition has problem, maple too. Now, she is busy to bring down to the repair centre :S</p>

              <p>get the right model of your ATI graphics card. you can look at the system properties or you can open up your CPU to look at the model number. After that go the manufacture website and download the latest driver for your ATI graphics and install it.</p>

              <p>Simple. Reverse the steps you took to overclock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you seriously honest-to-god don't know how, </p>
              <p>Open up ATI Overdrive (Right click on the Catalyst Control Centre icon in your taskbar thingy)</p>
              <p>Click the button on the top-left</p>
              <p>Select Overdrive</p>
              <p>Move the sliders to the left.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There. All done.</p>
