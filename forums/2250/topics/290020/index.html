Since she was living in SG, she literally panicked that if she continued using this copy, someday the police would come knocking on her doorstep &amp; arresting her.

Is this also happening in SG?<br><br>The online media in Indonesia is really open, many news sites offer real time news; good or bad, which the government has little to none control of.

Piracy in computer related software had in the past helped us to gain knowledge that would otherwise be rather unaffordable for many. However our society is more affluent now and Singapore wants to be knowned to protect intellectual property rights and being an anti-pirate assists in the formulation of Free Trade Agreements. Thus most forms of piracy  widespread.<br><br>We hardly get knockdowns (illegal or otherwise) due to our stance against piracy and we don't have brands like Nike setting up sweatshops in our country as labour costs are considerably higher.<br><br>No we do not have police knocking on our doors due to illegal softwares on our PCs. Businesses do however get into trouble when someone blows the whistle on them.

Since she was living in SG, she literally panicked that if she continued using this copy, someday the police would come knocking on her doorstep &amp; arresting her. I simply told her to relax &amp; re install. But she insisted on purchasing an original version &amp; thats exactly what she did.<br>I know the grim reality of my advice was wrong, but here in Indonesia where everything pirated &amp; knock offs prevail its somewhat "not a big deal" to use these things...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>My questions are:<br>Did my GF over react?<br><br>Here in jakarta, there are many buy&amp;sell internet sites that offer varied (either legal or illegal) items; Either branded knock offs, internet pay site passes, original merchandise meant for export, adult ent, soft&amp;hardware, glasses, tv series, electronics, sportswear (last week i bought an adidas jacket for about SGD 25  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), etc: virtually anything CHEAP ! Is this also happening in SG?<br><br>The online media in Indonesia is really open, many news sites offer real time news; good or bad, which the government has little to none control of. I ask again, is this also what its like over there?<br><br>Is it ok if i were to share my knowledge websites of anything cheap (either legal or illegal) for example recorded motivational dvds?<br><br>Thank You and I hope not to offend anyone, just looking to find out info regarding SG internet life...<br></div></blockquote>Your GF over-reacted.<br><br>And, for your country, things are cheap, either legal or illegal. In Singapore, things are either free and illegal or expensive and legal. Open-source stands in the middle of both.<br></div>
