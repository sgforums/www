The gameplay was choppy and i always got pwned before i knew what happened:(:(:(. Anyway i tot i needed a new com so here i am. Eh can someone give me a rough info on how custom rigs are being sold at simlim sq? Cause i'm really a noob and dont know much about it. also i really dont know what kinda system is required to play bfbc2 on high settings with no lag, so pls recommend too:) Thanks my budget is $1200:) also is ATI's Radeon HD 4870 better ot nVidia's GTx 260 better? Thanks:D</p>
              <p>btw i dont need monitor and mouse.... Just need a OS. Preferably Win7 or Vista 64 bit. Issit around 200 bucks? or can i find better prices at sim lim? thanks</p>

              <p>There is a stickied thread regarding DIY pc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't play that game so i don't know. Anyway, you can always reduce the graphic settings if it lags. No one said that you had to use high settings. Performance or quality...you decide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why don't you just buy ATI's 5x series graphics card? (in case you play dx11 in future)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Win7 64-bit is about $149.</p>

              <p>Depends on graphics cards. If you are playing on Intel HD graphics then that's the problem. Dedicated graphics should be playable if you tone down the details and resolution.</p>

              <p>Go to this thread. Any gaming rig there should be able to handle BFBC2 pretty well.</p>

Eh i'm aware of the sticky forum:) but when i went to hp's webpage i noticed a com with an ati series 5 costs lesser than the same com with gtx 260. Yeah i'm using integrated graphics. Is that the major problem? But the graphical memory is quite large leh, 512. Hmmm btw should i choose i5-750 or should i get i7-860? Both are quad core and seems quite pro to me:) thanks</div>

              <p>And yeah, nVidia's cards have always had a price premium over ATi cards. Everyone knows that ATi cards give you much better price/performance ratio.</p>

So a radeon hd 5770 should be better than the gtx 260 1.8 gb? Anyway what do you guys think of this configuration?

              wrong there’s gtx 260 900mb and gtx 260 special edition 1.8 gb
              right? Is there any other diff except for the memory? So a radeon
              hd 5770 should be better than the gtx 260 1.8 gb? Anyway what do
              you guys think of this configuration?<br> Specs: Intel core i7-860, 6gb ddr3(3 slots), 640 gb hard drive, ati
              radeon hd 5770, dvd lightscribe drive. Thanks<img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p>No.</p>
              <p>GTX260 &gt; HD5770 in gaming performance, as long as GTX 260 has 216 shaders (Which should be all those still on the market).</p>
              <p>But on a practical viewpoint, take the 5770. Lower power consumption.</p>

              <p>Technically, it's the 216 shaders that give the GTX260 the edge over the 5770. The original 192 shader version should be on par with it.</p>
