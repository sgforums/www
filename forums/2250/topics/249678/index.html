This is now apparently in use by<br>major sites and ISPs to send user Web browsing activity information back to<br>a third party without the knowledge of the user.  This software reportedly<br>exists as a Java applet and is loaded to users by participating customers of<br>the tracking system.  It has seemingly been around for some time but is<br>only now really appearing on people's radar.<br><br>More info about this abomination from the company itself is at:<br>http://www.redsheriff.com.<br><br>A quick search on http://groups.google.com for "redsheriff" will yield<br>significant information and help with setting up firewall blocking<br>of this "service."

It's very easy when it's triggered - the Java icon will be at your system tray. You won't see it unless you remove that icon.<br><br>But that pest is one step ahead of us.

I wouldn't blame NLB using the tracking pest. One, it needs to buy books. Without knowing Singaporeans' tastes, it's hard to buy. It also recommends books on a regular basis, so a profile of the people visiting it is good. Otherwise, good books are hard to find. Two, it doesn't spam you, so the data received have been kept confidential, a good sign. Three, no funny advertisements/pop ups/ pop unders. Fair enough, it's not used for other purposes.</div>
