              <p><br>from some other forums:</p>
              <p>I will walk you through the procedure to change the input language in Windows Vista home basic.  This procedure applies to every supported Chinese language, and input method.  You would just select the one that best suites you.  For the purposes of this walkthrough, I will assume you will be using the Pinyin input format with simplified characters (the most common Chinese phonetic input language in North America).<br><br>The display language is the language that Windows uses in wizards, dialog boxes, menus, Help and Support topics, and other items in the user interface. Some display languages are installed by default, and others require you to install additional language files. Common Chinese character sets, should be pre-installed, however may need to be activated.<br><br>We will assume the worst, and that you need to activate the Chinese character set.  Simply do the following to install support for east Asian character sets: <br><br>Open Regional and Language Options by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Clock, Language, and Region, and then clicking Regional and Language Options.<br><br>2.  Click the Keyboards and Languages tab, and then click Change keyboards.<br><br>3.  Under Installed services, click Add.<br><br>4.  Double-click the Specific Chinese language you want to add, then double-click the Specific Chinese text services you want to add (Input display etc.), the select the Specific Chinese text services options (voice recognition, handwriting etc.) you want to add, and then click OK.<br><br>The system will now install the files.  It may prompt you for your administrator authorization, if authorize windows to continue and then continue as outlined below.<br><br>For Windows Vista Simplified Chinese input is unified into a single input platform with multiple styles although there still is access to several Windows XP IME. The platform is the Microsoft Pinyin IME (MSPY) and it has three styles:<br><br><br>• Sentence-based input – Using the Classic Input style, a pinyin syllable is converted into a Chinese character automatically when you start typing the next one. This style is the same style used in previous versions of MSPY. <br><br>• Phrase-based input – While using this style, couples of unconverted pinyin syllables display simultaneously in the Reading window. MSPY converts these into Chinese characters automatically, eliminating the reading window flicker. <br><br><br>• Word-based input – This style is designed on the basis of the Intelligent ABC Input Method, developed under the lead of Professor Zhu Shoutao at Peking University. When using the ABC input style, there is no auto-conversion from pinyin to Chinese characters. Instead, the candidates are selected by pressing SPACE or ENTER <br><br><br><br>When you change the display language, it is changed for your user account and is not changed on the Welcome screen. If you want to set the display language for multiple users or the Welcome screen, you need to apply the settings to all users.  I will discuss that at the end of this document.<br><br><br>1.  ---&gt; Open Regional and Language Options by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking "Clock, Language, and Region" and then clicking Regional and Language Options.<br><br>2.  Click the Keyboards and Languages tab.<br><br>3.  Under Display language, choose Chinese, which I will assume is Pin yin (the most common Chinese phonetic input method in North America) from the list, and then click OK.<br><br>Note: If you don't see the list of display languages, you need to install additional language files first. If that is the case it requires more instruction, however it should not be a problem. <br><br><br>When you change the display language to Chinese, which I will assume is Pin yin (the most common Chinese phonetic input method in North America); the text in menus and dialog boxes for some programs might not be in the language that you want. This happens because the program might not support Unicode.  Again this is an item that can be addressed if need be.  Most software and modern webs handle Unicode.<br><br>Openïƒ To apply the settings to the desktop and default users, - Regional and Language Options by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking “Clock, Language, and Region” and then clicking Regional and Language Options.<br><br>2.  Click the Administrative tab, and then click Copy to reserved accounts.  If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br><br>3.  Do one of the following: <br><br>• To copy the current settings to the default user account; select the Default user account (new users) check box. The default account is used as a template for creating new user accounts. This setting allows administrators to set the default format, keyboard layout, and display language for new users. Any user account created on the computer after the settings have been copied to the default user account has these settings applied to it. Existing user accounts are not affected.<br><br>• To copy the current settings to the system accounts, select the System accounts (local system, local service, and network service) check box. The system accounts are special accounts used by Windows services. This setting allows administrators to specify a display language and keyboard layout for the Welcome screen. It also sets the display language for users who have not specified a display.<br><br>I made this article extremely comprehensive as I have been getting a mass number of emails requesting this same procedure for this and other languages.  This procedure is identical for all languages, with the exception of character installation.  All character sets except the Latin (ASCII) character set must be activated the same as outlined in the foregoing procedure.<br><br>Hope this helps.  Feel free to PM me if you need further assistance.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Chris Egilo<br>Microsoft Certified Development Engineer<br>egilo.ps1x.com</p>
