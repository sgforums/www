              <p>Thinking of buying a notebook but dun know which one to go for, my requirement :</p>
              <p>budget : preferably below $1800, AMD processor is a must, not too big or bulky in size thus screen size shld be somewhere 13-14 inch the max, able to downgrade to XP, Window Vista I'm not too keen, the rst of the specs i'm quite flexible.</p>
              <p><br>I'm not a techie, any good suggestions ?</p>
              <p><br>Thanks a million. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Finally you are back <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>My current desktop is Compaq with AMD 64 x 2, till date no problem at all, i'm extremely happy &amp; satisfied with this processor.</p>
              <p>As for notebook, i'm not too sure how hot it will be if I were to choose AMD. I like AMD cos its blazingly fast, never had any experience of hanging before.</p>
              <p>What is your suggestion mayi, which model &amp; brand shld I go for, battery is also impt to me too. Maybe i shld give a second thought on Intel.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Although I'm biased towards AMD, they are best for desktops. I don't recommend AMD for laptops because they can get real hot and hurt you. The temperature is high enough for you to shout "ouch" when you touch it.</p>
              <p>So far, I have only seen Dell and Acer offering AMD processors. Think Compaq and Packard Bell also offer them, but not so sure.</p>
              <p>Battery life for AMD laptops isn't very long (at the most 2 hours), although can be tweaked to improve, but it's not as good as Intel laptops. Intel laptops can last for about 2 to 3 hours depending on how you use it. Mine (Intel laptop) lasts for 3++ hours because I run on medium processor speed and 0% brightness.</p>
              <p>If you are thinking of Intel laptops, and given your budget, Dell, Acer, Packard Bell, Lenovo (Y and N series) will be the ones to look at. Dell offers a downgrade to XP. Lenovo also has one, have to request. Specs wise, most of them are good enough. Not too bulky either, although it's not always the case for Acer.</p>
              <p>Warranty wise, most Acer laptops don't last beyond their warranty. If it's a one-year warranty, you will start noticing problems either before the warranty ends or shortly after the warranty ends. Service centre is far too (if you don't live near Jurong).</p>
              <p>The rest are fine. Lenovo series need to be watched. Those series are relatively new and has mixed reviews, some as bad as Acer, some say as good as Thinkpads.</p>

              <p>What you've said is true, Acer's product doesn't live up to expectation, its more like a "laylong" brand to me, definitely out for me.</p>
              <p>Looks like I've to increase my budget a little bit more in order to allow me to look at HP or Compaq.</p>
              <p>Tech support is also impt to me cos had a very bad experience with Belkin tech support in the past.</p>
              <p>As for Dell, my past understanding is that Dell outsourced their tech support to a third party thus the support that we are getting really depends on individual luck.</p>
              <p>Sigh, customer service in S'pore is generally quite poor &amp; pervasive. Too many things to consider <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"></p>

              <p>HP Compaq series/ Hp pavillion series are offering Amd processors too.</p>
              <p>Actually i will sit back and watch the acer's series. Their entertainment series (Something like HP's pavillion seriess cost about $1900++ now ) quality wise + functions are comparable to HP's  (Specs are way better for that price too -_-''</p>
