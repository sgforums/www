            <div class='col-md body'>Instead of putting science fiction where it shouldn't be, there are tools and methods available for secure deletion of sensitive information from your computer.<br><br>Not everybody is trained in all this IT security stuff, so bring the information to them if they cannot do it.<br><br>Eraser @ <a href="http://www.heidi.ie/eraser" rel="nofollow">www.heidi.ie/eraser</a><br>A secure deletion tool for deleting all sorts of files and folders. Why use Eraser?<br>Most people have some data that they would rather not share with others - passwords, personal information, classified documents from work, financial records, self-written poems, the list can be continued forever.<br><br>Perhaps you have saved some of this information on your computer where it is conveniently at your reach, but when the time comes to remove the data from your hard disk, things get a bit more complicated and maintaining your privacy is not as simple as it may have seemed at first.<br><br>Your first thought may be that when you 'delete' the file, the data is gone. Not quite, when you delete a file, the operating system does not really remove the file from the disk; it only removes the reference of the file from the file system table. The file remains on the disk until another file is created over it, and even after that, it might be possible to recover data by studying the magnetic fields on the disk platter surface.<br><br>Before the file is overwritten, anyone can easily retrieve it with a disk maintenance or an undelete utility.<br><br>There are several problems in secure file removal, mostly caused by the use of write cache, construction of the hard disk and the use of data encoding. These problems have been taken into consideration when Eraser was designed, and because of this intuitive design and a simple user interface, you can safely and easily erase private data from your hard drive.<br><br>Top reviews from the most popular software sites and magazines confirm that Eraser is one of the best security tools available for Windows.<br><br>DBAN @ <a href="http://dban.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://dban.sourceforge.net/</a><br>Description: Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot floppy that securely wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically and completely delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect, which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data destruction.<br><br>DBAN is a means of ensuring due diligence in computer recycling, a way of preventing identity theft if you want to sell a computer, and a good way to totally clean a Microsoft Windows installation of viruses and spyware. DBAN prevents or thoroughly hinders all known techniques of hard disk forensic analysis.<br><br>Common users only know that the only way to delete a file is to delete it via the recycle bin.</div>
