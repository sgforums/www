            <div class='col-md body'><br>Some users have gotten the massive Office 2007 SP1 update automatically, even though Microsoft Corp. said it would not use WindowsÂ’ Automatic Updates to push out the large upgrade for several months, the company confirmed Thursday.<br><br>Anyone running a preview copy of Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1), which was made available to all comers only Wednesday, will receive the Office 2007 upgrade automatically. Users of other in-beta Microsoft products, including Windows XP SP3, which is still in limited testing, will also be hit by the Office update, which weighs in at almost 220MB.<br><br>Â“As noted to beta customers, if [they] are running Vista SP1 beta software, as part of the beta program, Office 2007 SP1 on pre-release Windows Vista SP1 will automatically install as planned for this beta program,Â” said Bobbie Harder, a senior program manager with the WSUS (Windows Server Update Services) group.<br><br>News Source: PCWorld<br><br>Others, including Susan Bradley, a writer for the WindowsSecrets newsletter, noticed the automatic download and install of Office 2007 SP1. Â” I woke up on Wednesday morning to find a notification that a Vista machine had rebooted after being patched,Â” Bradley said in ThursdayÂ’s issue of the newsletter. Â“I found, to my surprise, that the new Service Pack 1 for Office 2007, which was released on Tuesday, had been auto-installed.Â”<br><br>Bradley also said that even if users of Vista SP1, Windows XP SP3 or WSUS 3.0 SP3 manually installed Office 2007 SP1, Automatic Updates later automatically installs Â— actually re-installs Â— the service pack.<br><br>Earlier this week, when Microsoft unveiled the service pack, it said Automatic Updates (AU) would not be used to deliver SP1 for at least three months, and maybe as many as six months. In any case, it promised to give users 30 daysÂ’ notice before it pushed it out using AU.<br><br>While technically true Â— Office 2007 SP1 is only shoved to users running a preview OS Â— some Vista users have been confused by the appearance of the service pack in their Windows Update listings this week as they downloaded and applied numerous security patches.<br><br>sigh, ms what r u doing</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure what's this all about?<br><br>From what I know, MS has released Automatic Update blockers to companies. This is for those who don't want Automatic Update to automatically update anything in their company's PCs and creating havoc.<br><br>For those who wanted to block IE7 from installing... you would have come across MS IE7 Update Blocker. That's basically what the Automatic Update Blocker is about.<br><br>Implemented successfully, there should be no more updates to the user. I'm pretty sure it worked, at least for me.<br><br>Now... regarding this part:<br><br><blockquote>Users of other in-beta Microsoft products, including Windows XP SP3, which is still in limited testing, will also be hit by the Office update, which weighs in at almost 220MB.</blockquote>I believe this includes all kind of software under MS Connection. I'm in the Windows Live Testing team and others, obviously I'm hit.<br><br>I haven't check with my friends, but I don't think I've seen any Automatic Updates scheduled for them.<br><br>Not on other testing team, can't verify if it's true, other than the Office 2007 update.<br><br><blockquote>Earlier this week, when Microsoft unveiled the service pack, it said Automatic Updates (AU) would not be used to deliver SP1 for at least three months, and maybe as many as six months.</blockquote>This part - just me lucky? I've not received any update notifications.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Must be some of idiotic settings again.
