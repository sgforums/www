              <p>Study purposes, any laptop will do, actually. Unless, of course, you intend to do 3D modelling/programming, in which case a middle-high end laptop is required.</p>
              <p>I would recommend the Acer Aspire series over Lenovo, unless its the Lenovo Thinkpad series. Both me and my sis use Acer Laptops, ~14'. Both of us never had a problem with our laptops, and she had hers for quite a few years. HP is also quite ok, but they overheat easily, even those using lower-end CPU and integrated graphics. Gateway laptops are quite stylish, actually, like ASUS, and both are quite powerful. Both have excellent warranties, but ASUS comes out above. </p>
              <p>Need a netbook? I would recommend at least a 10' screen. My favourite is the ASUS N10Jc, 1.6GHz Atom , 2GB RAM, 320GB HDD and 9300M GS 256MB graphics in a 10.2' netbook. Vista Home Premium, I think, as well, or was it Basic?</p>
              <p>Another Netbook/Notebook is the HP Pavillion DV2. 12.1' screen, 1.6GHz Athlon Neo, 4GB? of RAM (Need comfirmation), 256/512MB ATi Radeon HD3410, Vista Home Premium, but again, like all HP laptops, this gets HOT.</p>
              <p>Laptops, I would recommend at least 2GHz, which most pass. Centrino 2 for Intel, or Turion X2 for AMD. 320GB HDD is recommended, though 250 GB should suffice in most cases. At LEAST 2GB RAM,but 4GB recommended and Vista 64-bit, since Vista is a memory hog. GPU, not that important, since it is a study notebook, but again is based on what you do. </p>
              <p>Sorry if very long winded, 1 AM very sleepy, and I'm used to typing like this anyway.</p>

              <p>Usually when they say 'Intel Dual Core', they refer to the Intel Pentium Dual Core processors. These are lower spec Core 2 Duos, with slower FSB, L2 Cache and clock speeds. For typing reports, powerpoint and spreadsheets, the Pentiums are perfect.</p>

              <p>Err, 14-inch is the best for studies. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to carry a 17-incher all the way to school? </p>
              <p>Those are entertainment laptops, and battery life is gonna suck. My 14-inch laptop is not that heavy, small, portable (It fits in almost all laptop bags), and you get the best of both worlds - Easy to carry, easy to use, easy to understand. If you going Uni, go for their laptop fair or their IT store. Their laptops all 14-inch or smaller.</p>

              <p> i carry a 17 incher before, and its not too bad depends on the the parts how heavy or bulky they are, but interestingly i had a 14 incher which was more heavier than the 17 inch! ( the generation of laptops before 2007). it is because of the 14 incher's battery which was heavy like hell and its charger and everything about it was heavy.  My newer 17 inch was lighter than it and it also depends on how u carry it, if u use a sling laptop bag, whether 14 or 17 incher will still give u pain in shoulder after some time.</p>
              <p>17 incher is entertainment laptop but will not mean batt life will suck, most 17 incher come with 8 cell  above ad some dont have those dedicated GFX card (but intel ones) will have better battery life and less heat. dedicated GFX card is also of no use for very demanding games.</p>
              <p>Good thing is that 17 incher is better for eyes because they are bigger and higher resolution. 17 incher will also have 2 hard disk slots in them which can give u extra storage for your movies, games and videos</p>

              <p>get 17 inch and there are 16 inch now too. 17 inch can be bought foraround $1800-$2000 , sometimes cheaper online i seen 17 incher around $700-1000 before .</p>
              <p>17 incher has variably priced. if it comes wit dedicated GFX nd HDMI, blue ray, its price will be quite high, but if it comes with intel GFX,  or not as gaming laptop, u can get it at a cheaper price because 17 incher market i always watching , it is a strange pricing</p>

              <p>Which 17-incher you using? Seriously, you don't know my experience with using huge-ass laptops. I have used many of them (Projects, gaming, etc.), most of them 18-inchers. Battery life was terrible, even with a 12 cell bettery. That was with the entry-level GPU, standard dual-core, HD screen. My hands were sort of struggling to carry it, which was weird, since I  can carry a desktop very easily. Also your second point: Best not to show off. I saw one person use a 16-inch Compaq, he was getting stares - from the wrong crowd. You might be getting the wrong eyes, remember that. The flashier it is, the more unwanted attraction you are gonna get.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We recommend 14-inch, because they are a hybrid. Not so small, yet small.Plus, they are damn cheap.Remember, students, no matter in Sec School, JC, Poly or Uni, they don't have a huge budget. They don't have much strength to lug the laptop day in, day out. Must consider everything also.</p>

              <p>Study purposes, any laptop will do, actually. Unless, of course, you intend to do 3D modelling/programming, in which case a middle-high end laptop is required.</p>
              <p>I would recommend the Acer Aspire series over Lenovo, unless its the Lenovo Thinkpad series. Both me and my sis use Acer Laptops, ~14'. Both of us never had a problem with our laptops, and she had hers for quite a few years. HP is also quite ok, but they overheat easily, even those using lower-end CPU and integrated graphics. Gateway laptops are quite stylish, actually, like ASUS, and both are quite powerful. Both have excellent warranties, but ASUS comes out above. </p>
              <p>Need a netbook? I would recommend at least a 10' screen. My favourite is the ASUS N10Jc, 1.6GHz Atom , 2GB RAM, 320GB HDD and 9300M GS 256MB graphics in a 10.2' netbook. Vista Home Premium, I think, as well, or was it Basic?</p>
              <p>Another Netbook/Notebook is the HP Pavillion DV2. 12.1' screen, 1.6GHz Athlon Neo, 4GB? of RAM (Need comfirmation), 256/512MB ATi Radeon HD3410, Vista Home Premium, but again, like all HP laptops, this gets HOT.</p>
              <p>Laptops, I would recommend at least 2GHz, which most pass. Centrino 2 for Intel, or Turion X2 for AMD. 320GB HDD is recommended, though 250 GB should suffice in most cases. At LEAST 2GB RAM,but 4GB recommended and Vista 64-bit, since Vista is a memory hog. GPU, not that important, since it is a study notebook, but again is based on what you do. </p>
              <p>Sorry if very long winded, 1 AM very sleepy, and I'm used to typing like this anyway.</p>
