              <p>1. Usually, yes. Sometimes, the motherboard has no expansion slots that a graphics card can be installed in. In these rare cases, then you're pretty much stuffed. However, most, if not all, consumer PCs have suitable expansion slots.</p>
              <p>2. Yes, actually. Most graphics cards are installed into slots, while some are integrated. There are some helpful guides available on the internet, as well as How-to videos on Youtube. They offer a step-by-step detail of how to change you graphics card. You'll be surprised at how easy it is.</p>
              <p>3. The important factors to consider are:</p>
              <p>Age of system, CPU, Power supply, Expansion slots available and the games you play.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Age of system</strong>: It's usually not much use to upgrade a system that's over three years old. A Core 2/Athlon X2 based system usually still has some life in it, but anything older than that usually doesn't gain that much from upgrading, or severely bottlenecks the upgrade.</p>
              <p><strong>CPU</strong>: The CPU can be a potential bottleneck of performance, depending on what CPU you have. That $600 graphics card you wanted to buy might not be able to stretch it's legs and rear it's fire breathing head, ya' know?</p>
              <p><strong>Power supply</strong>: Is your power supply good enough to handle the increased power requirements of the new and more powerful graphics card? Does it have the proper connectors? It's a common thing to overlook, the humble power supply. Cheap and often low quality power supplies are a ticking time bomb. Don't risk your new investment to old dangers.</p>
              <p><strong>Expansion slots available</strong>: There are three types of slots that graphics cards fit in, PCI, AGP and PCI-E. PCI had been superseded by AGP in the consumer space for years, but still remains in the server realm where the PCI-E slots are reserved for network and storage connectivity. AGP itself has been deemed obsolute by the faster, more general purpose PCI-E. AGP slots are usually found in systems dating back 5 years ago or more. PCI-E, or PCI-Express, is the dominant slot in modern systems, and pretty much all new graphics cards are being released for the PCI-E slot. Determine which slots you have, and then choose the graphics card accordingly.</p>
              <p><strong>Games you play</strong>: No use buying a $300 graphics card for Minesweeper, right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The hot graphics cards, and definitely some of the best bang for the buck cards are the GTX460 / 560 Ti from NVidia, and the HD6850/70 from AMD. These cards cost in the $200-$350 range, and are guaranteed to run games smooth at high settings at 1080p.</p>
              <p>You can use a program like Belarc Adviser to check your system specifications.</p>
