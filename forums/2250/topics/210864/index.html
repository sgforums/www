            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Thinkpad bursts into flames at LAX, claim </strong><br>Sparks bomb scare<br><br>By INQUIRER staff: Sunday 17 September 2006, 14:30<br><br>ENGADGET reports that an IBM Thinkpad burst into flames <strong>at LA Airport</strong>.<br>The site has pictures from someone who it claims was an eye witness. Âµ<br><br><strong>ThinkPad explodes at LAX, ignites bomb scare</strong><br><br>Posted Sep 16th 2006 1:31PM by Ryan Block<br>Filed under: Laptops<br><br><img src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2006/09/lenovosplosion1.jpg"><br><br>In a time when you're not even allowed to say the word "bomb" in an airport (hey, it's for good reason), it's got to be like, really freaking embarrassing to have to run up the jetway at full speed, shoving other passengers out of the way as your flaming laptop explodes on the ground. (Sound familiar?) According to an eyewitness report on the Awful Forums, passersby stared aghast or fled crying terrorist, the ThinkPad (which was quoted to be an IBM, not a Lenovo) apparently had a number of death throes as the fire went through various phases, until eventually a United employee busted out the fire extinguisher and laid the laptop to rest. Apparently the machine's owner already checked its battery against the recalls and it was not listed -- and why would it be? IBM and Lenovo aren't flagged for bad batteries -- yet. (Sony, we're looking your direction.) But the coup de grÃ¢ce at LAX: onlookers apparently mumbling that "too many viruses on your computer" can lead to this horrendous fate. How true, indeed.<br><br>[Thanks, Peter]<br><br><img src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2006/09/lenovosplosion2.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/16/thinkpad-explodes-at-lax-ignites-bomb-scare/" rel="nofollow">http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/16/thinkpad-explodes-at-lax-ignites-bomb-scare/</a><br><br>Looks fake to me leh...and also hor...in airport sure got many people see wan...dun have opinions of other people? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ThinkPad confirmed as burning laptop </strong><br><br>Tom Krazit<br>CNET News.com<br>September 21, 2006, 10:50 BST<br><br>Lenovo has said that one of its laptops caught fire at Los Angeles International Airport, but it can't confirm yet whether Sony batteries were being used<br><br>A burning laptop that frightened passengers at Los Angeles International Airport over the weekend was a ThinkPad, Lenovo confirmed Wednesday, and that notebook ships with Sony's battery technology.<br><br>The incident, described by a poster at the Web site Something Awful, involved a passenger running back up the jetway as a plane was boarding with a smoking laptop that eventually caught fire. Lenovo dispatched a team of investigators to Los Angeles within 12 hours of the incident, <strong>and confirmed that the laptop was a ThinkPad T43</strong>, said Ray Gorman, a company spokesman.<br><br>Because the area of the computer containing the battery was severely burned as a result of the incident, Lenovo has yet to confirm that the ThinkPad T43 was using one of Sony's batteries, Gorman said. That model does ship with Sony's batteries, but some notebook users choose to use different batteries after they purchase the system, he said.<br><br>Lenovo has still not seen an unusual number of incidents involving its notebooks and Sony's batteries, Gorman said. PC and consumer electronics companies have always had problems with batteries on occasion, but Sony's batteries were at the heart of two huge battery recalls announced by Dell and Apple in August. That particular recall was caused by Sony battery cells that could potentially cause a short circuit if tiny shards of metal left over from the manufacturing process worked holes in the battery cells.<br><br>At the time of the Dell and Apple recalls, Lenovo took great pains to distance itself from its competitors, saying it uses a different charging voltage in its notebooks and has a different design for its battery casing.<br><br>Lenovo and Sony are working together to determine if the battery involved in last weekend's incident was one of the ones involved in the recall, and more information is expected over the next couple of days, Lenovo's Gorman said.<br><br><strong>Just for you, mayi!</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
