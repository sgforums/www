If you are not using the laptop, but charging it, be careful. Some Acer laptops have been damaged this way when the battery has been fully charged yet the owner doesn't know. It overheats and damaged the motherboard.<br><br>For your 2nd question, you can use the laptop for very long hours, but you better keep it in a cool room, because it will heat up significantly in room temperature after a few hours. A cool room will be able to keep the temperature down for a few more hours if you intent to play for long.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The areas beside the touchpad will heat up within a few hours, but not to the extent of it burning so no worries. Use it in a well-ventilated room and it should run nicely.
