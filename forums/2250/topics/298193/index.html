About the same as mine.<br><br>You've got the right impression. Wireless N products have a greater range. But like all wireless products, no walls please. Or anything that affects the signals like microwave or handphone, or it could just drop or totally disappear.<br><br>Even if they could go through thick walls, you can't be too far away from it or your network adapters can't "see" the signal.<br><br>There's also something called the line of sight. Put it in a simpler way. How well could you see with the corner of your eyes? Anything further than that, you can't see (unless you are an insect).<br><br>The same theory applies to routers. As long as it's within the sight of the router, it will be able to detect.</div>
