But since then, its fortunes have failed to improve.<br><br>BenQ suffered delays in getting its handsets to market, its market share dropped and sales prices remained weak.<br><br>Analysts believe BenQ's management must take the blame for the company's poor performance.<br><br>"Many of the product launches were fairly poor," said Windsor Holden at consultancy firm Analysis. "Even when the product seemed promising, the company failed to launch on time. It's been a mess, frankly."<br><br>In July, the vendor planned to cut 10 percent of its workforce in Germany, where its European operation is headquartered, and slash the salaries of its executives.<br><br>A new chief financial officer joined in late August to carry out "necessary" cost-cutting steps. But this proved to be far more severe than previously thought, and on Thursday BenQ said it would completely discontinue its European operations.<br><br><strong>Around 3,000 employees based in Germany are likely to lose their jobs.</strong> BenQ also said it would further review the operations of some of its other subsidiaries.<br><br>"Despite the progress achieved in reducing cost and expenses, widening losses have made this very painful decision unavoidable," said BenQ's chairman KY Lee.<br><br>The company said it would continue in the mobile business with operations in "selected markets", including Asia.<br><br>a sad piece of news actually, cuz i thought benq-siemens hp looks quite nice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
