            <div class='col-md body'>I guess what Intel has always been using to cudgel AMD with is that their processors (since Pentium4) have always been faster in clock speed, ghz by ghz. It all went well until heat management control. Every manufacturer will maintain or go for a smaller architecture and that adds more issues with heat build up and dissipation. I guess Intel also realised that their 'virtual' core design will still lose out to AMD's true physical core and that has long been proven with AMD's X2 processors.<br><br>Since the lauch of Intel's Core Duo series, they had dropped their Pentium naming of their processors and is trying to gain better performances with a much shorter/ moderate fined tuned thread length and generous L2 cache. Since Intel processor supported motherboards usually make the memory controller with their chipset (unlike AMD which has various chipset manufacturer on their processor supported motherboard, e.g VIA, nVidia etc), they now have more freedom to work on their processor core.<br><br>IMO, and truely in my very own opinion, Intel has duplicated AMD's concept and i feel that with DDR2 (and DDR3 and so on in future) a mature technology, AMD should also duplicate Intel's concept of removing the memory controller from within their processors so that they can now beat Intel in heat management and shrinking the architecture. But to do that AMD has to solve their mix and match of motherboard chipset makers first.<br><br>As for Gamers, there are some who like to mod and it can also range from intermediate to the extreme 'modding' gamers. Those who care not much for the case design but who want to have a hassle-free quick heat removal from their system (and if they too overclock intensively) will prefer watercooling. Before this, moderate overclockers or intermediate gamers may opt to forgo their stock cooling hardware and select their custom cooling solutions and fans. There were already HSF for CPUs, chipsets and GPUs. With the introduction of the heatpipe, it can combine with a rapid and silence fan to produce better results.<br><br>Depending on the size of your case and the number of actively running hardware in your case or the rate of heat generation, you may use the appropriate number of fans (intake and exhaust) and place them at the correct locations (front, rear,side and/ top) for better heat circulation and discharge. For better noise/ power consumption control, you can rig the fans to speed-controller units.</div>

When you asked, it shows that you have taken the first step (i.e is curiosity about DIY PC) to DIY.<br><br>Personally i feel that the most important thing to do prior to DIY is to get to know the various PC hardware makers and brands. At least when asked you can associate a few names. Understanding some basics of how the computer works can be found through books, magazines and the Internet. You can also ask any techie-friends you may know of.<br><br>Undersatnd from the processor type, maker and specification you want/ need, then choose an appropriate and compatible motherboard...down to supported ram types, graphics card, hard disks, power supply unit (PSU). optical/ floppy drives and the case. Keyboard and mouse (the user interfaces), speakers and display (monitor) comes later.<br><br>It all takes some planning and information gathering prior to parts sourcing if you want a PC setup that meets your requirements and look good.<br><br>You can also try to check forums or online feedbacks of any hardware conflicts and thrusted manufacturer names.<br><br>Then comes the budget and the money and going down to get your hardware.

            <div class='col-md body'>Confirm the floppy drive spoil? Or only the cablings from the PSU bared copper and not working?<br><br>If so isolate the problem. If the PC is new and was damaged due to handling from the qualified personel under the manufacturer's charge then you can make claims for it for hardware replacement.<br><br>Otherwise you may still use the PSU with the computer. If the PSU has only one compatible power cable to power up the floppy drive then you can get <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?C=SEO&amp;U=SiteMapByDept&amp;ModuleNo=37057" rel="nofollow">this</a> and fix it to the other free available 3-pin connectors with the PSU and power up the floppy drive. remove the burnt/ damaged cable by unplugging it from the floppy drive and do not use it for any other connection. cut away the bare ends and/ or tape it up proper to conver all gaps showing the bare copper strands. do a proper cable management or tie back by coiling up that affect length of cable.<br><br>Do the above with a pair of insulating gloves, unplug all power cables and disconnect all power connections from the wall supplier outlet prior to repairs/ modifications.<br><br></div>
