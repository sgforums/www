If he disconnects frequently, it's either some settings that are not right or there is some problems with the connections.<br><br>As for the ADSL LED light light kept blinking, it is an indication of connections problems.<br><br>Is he behind some proxy? Some websites are not able to detect proxy, that's why the IP address is not local.</div>
