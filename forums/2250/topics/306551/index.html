              <p>Learn PHP and HTML first, followed by CSS and Javascript to spice up the visual appearance and interactivity of your web pages. Borrow books from a regional library near you. I recommend those Visual Quickstarts (with a rabbit logo) and *something* in 7 Days or *something* in 24 Hours titles. Avoid the For Dummies series though. Publisher-wise go with O'reilly and Sams.</p>
              <p>For a starter, get Dreamweaver for all your PHP and HTML editing. They have a 30-day trial available downloadable from Adobe's site, and there is always an unofficial trial version out there as long as you spend time to search for it.</p>
              <p>Learn the examples in the books mentioned above by coding them by hand. You'll learn them much faster this way. If you don't wish to upload and test your PHP scripts on a remote server, you can always download Wamp (if you're on Windows) and run the server software directly on your computer instead.</p>
              <p>A good reference site for PHP would be the official PHP.net site itself. For HTML stuff, I would usually just do a Google search and find what I need.</p>

              <p>Yup, the W3Schools web site is another great site you can refer to while learning. Just a note that it's not endorsed or created by W3C themselves, but some Norwegian company, albeit the similarity in the names.</p>

              <p>Start with HTML first and make sure you are coding properly. HTML codes tend to be sub standard.</p>
              <p>I've seen a lot of HTML coders code this way - &lt; p &gt;This is a test paragraph. (remove the spaces)</p>
              <p>Most browsers will auto correct the wrong codes. With the web moving towards XHTML, this is not possible. Try something like this, you will see &lt; p &gt;This is a test paragraph. - in your webpage.</p>
              <p>Or perhaps start with XHTML to train you in writing good codes.</p>
              <p>A good resource which I like - <a href="http://www.html.net/">http://www.html.net/</a></p>
              <p>Books wise, I like the Beginning &lt;topic&gt; series by Wrox. It's a red book with human faces as cover page. Or The Complete Reference of &lt;topic&gt;. It's a white colour book. They are pretty thick, and usually cover more than 1 topic.</p>
              <p>Do not get cookbooks published by Oreilly. They are very summarized and served as a memory jotter for experienced users.</p>
              <p>All other languages, refer to documentation. That's the best help. If you need a web server for free, <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> is another to consider.</p>
              <p>For Microsoft coding, IIS can only be installed on XP Professional machines.</p>
              <p>A WYSIWYG editor that I prefer is <a href="http://www.w3c.org/Amaya">Amaya</a>. It's produced by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). All codes can be validated within the editor itself before you upload it to the web. Not as much features as Dreamweaver, but good enough as an alternative to Dreamweaver.</p>

              <p>Hmm...I had not much of a trouble using XAMPP to test my PHP scripts with some connecting to MySQL databases ever since the first time I came across it 2 years ago. A pretty simple installation process for the novice user actually. But I recently switched to WAMP because it offers some of the more advanced features I needed, though it is not updated as often as XAMPP.</p>
              <p>Till now, I still can't figure out how to install Apache + PHP (with all the extensions and modules I need) + MySQL on a Windows machine on my own. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>And oh no, no IIS please. I want to play with mod_rewrite as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>the key is to install MySQL first before Apache and then PHP .... a bit of sweating, but less cursing than using XAMPP for me ... you just need to set the right paths in the .conf file for it to read PHP ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
