              <p>Hey guys, need expert help again.</p>
              <p>1. Was told that 
              by DEFAULT, all mobo will detect 1866 &amp; above ram at the maximum speed of 1333 
              even if you install a 1866 ram, anything above 1333 will have to do the 
              oc in order to take its full advantage, is it true ?</p>
              <p>2. Window 7 
              Professional Edition, there is an XP mode included, was told that not 
              all my existing softwares will be able to run on my new Window 7 
              Professional, reason is becos some of my old softwares are designed on 
              32bit system, is it true ?</p>
              <p>3. Any good ram to introduce ? No Kingston pls, any stable &amp; reliable name to intro ?</p>
              <p>Pls advise, thanks guy !</p>

              <p>1. Wrong. All RAM are by default 800/1006/1333. actual default setting depend on the CPU you use. those RAM that say 1600/1866/2000 are those that "might be" better quality and can reach those speeds. To reach the speed, you must manually overclock the RAM.</p>
              <p>2. There's no XP mode. Just compatibilty mode.Just right-click any program and click properties. Under the compatibility tab, you can choose the compatibility type mode you want.</p>
              <p>3. Why no kingston RAM? they are as good as any other RAM. Don't let the ratings 1333/1600/1866 fool you into thinking kingston is lousy.</p>

Windows 7 has 32bit and 64bit operating systems.Thus most of your old softwares designed on 32bit should work on Windows 7 (32 or 64bit). However if those softwares are written to run in an earlier version of Windows (Such as Windows 98 for example) then there might be some issues and you can either choose to:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-Use XP mode (a virtual PC software) - that allows you to run more than one Window from Windows 7. Once launched it will be exactly the same as Windows XP (interface), with full network and usb options.You can just close it or alt tab to get back to Windows 7 easily. I don't exactly use it though, but it's an useful addition especially in the registering of my general elective modules where the only browser supported is Internet explorer (the IE9 on my W7, is alittle buggy) </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Xp mode isn't by default installed in Windows 7 professional. It's a free add on though. </p>

              <p>Need to clarify one issue regarding 32-bit, 64-bit and Windows 7.</p>
              <p>32-bit and 64-bit has no relation to XP mode in Windows 7.</p>
              <p>A
               bit of history for XP mode in Windows 7. When Vista launched earlier, 
              quite a lot of softwares could not work on Vista. Many companies thus 
              decided to stay with XP. Windows 7 is basically building on Vista, thus 
              to avoid this issue, Microsoft introduced XP mode. This would allow 
              softwares that could not work on Vista and above to continue working on a
               Windows 7 machine.</p>
              <p>By doing so, it has one main advantage - no 
              additional code just to maintain backward compatibility with XP. For 
              users, this would mean faster boot times, lesser errors encountered and 
              lesser bugs. Probably lesser security concerns.</p>
              <p>32-bit and 64-bit 
              are still software-related, but is dependent on your hardware. If you 
              buy a 64-bit hardware, you can run both 32-bit and 64-bit softwares. If 
              you buy a 32-bit hardware, you <strong>cannot</strong> run 64-bit softwares.</p>
              <p>Think
               of 32-bit and 64-bit as finite car lanes. Assuming that there's one car
               per lane, you can have 32 cars for 32 lanes (32-bit). Likewise for 
              64-bit (64 cars). 32 is smaller than 64, thus it fits in very well. But 
              64 is way larger than 32, it doesn't fit in, thus 64-bit softwares can't
               run on 32-bit machines. XP mode will not help you in this regard.</p>
              <p>If your software is designed to be run only on 64-bit machines, you will not be able to run this software on 32-bit machine.
               You need a 64-bit machine, with 64-bit Windows installed to run the 
              software. If it's designed to run on 32-bit machine, it may run on a 
              64-bit machine (no guarantee, you can try, if it doesn't work, you will 
              need to run it on a 32-bit machine).</p>

              <p>32-bit and 64-bit has no relation to XP mode in Windows 7.</p>

              <p>If you want to know if the particular software is 32-bit or 64-bit, you can do a check on the manufacturer's page or use Google. Though usually, consumer software tend to be 32-bit for maximum compatibility with all systems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You shouldn't have problems using 32-bit programs on a 64-bit system. I've been using 64-bit OSes for quite sometime, Vista/Windows 7 and Ubuntu, and the only problems I experience are stuff written for the age of technological dinosaurs: programs written in 16-bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And regarding your first questions:</p>
              <p>1. RAM sticks store their timings and speed information on a chip on the RAM. This chip stores their SPD data, or Serial Presence Detect. There are different types of SPD timings, namely JEDEC SPD (Industry standard), Intel Extreme Memory Profile (Or XMP), AMD Black Edition Memory Profile (or BEMP) and NVidia Enhanced Performance Profile (Or EPP).</p>
              <p>RAM sticks of 1333MHz and below use JEDEC timings, and are guaranteed to work at their rated speeds on any motherboard. Speeds of 1600MHz and above typically use one of the special memory profiles to reach their rated speed, but are guaranteed to work on any motherboard at the JEDEC timings.</p>
              <p>An example would be my Team Xtreem LV 1600. It has JEDEC timings of 1333MHz and 1066MHz, but also supports XMP speeds of 1600MHz on a compatible motherboard. However, my motherboard doesn't support XMP, so it runs at 1333MHz by default. If I had an Intel motherboard supporting XMP, the RAM would already run at 1600MHz.</p>
              <p>2: Answer above there somewhere :P</p>
              <p>3. Corsair is a trusted name out there, very reliable and high quality. Alternatively, you can go for Crucial, G.Skill or Team Group. These are the companies I trust and I'm happy with.</p>

              <p>It will be stated on the software box if it's 32-bit or 64-bit, or on the receipt. I believe companies keep a receipt or transaction somewhere, so you can check with your Accounting department if the software box has been lost.</p>
              <p>As a general guide, softwares that are meant for client PC (that means they are not servers) and bought before end of 2008 are typically 32-bit. As for servers, they tend migrate faster than PCs, so softwares bought after 2007/2008 could be 64-bit. Again, you can check with the Accounting dept if the software box is lost. Alternatively, if you can access the server, opening up the system properties will tell you which version of software has been installed. 64-bit installed --&gt; machine is 64-bit.</p>

              <p>Friend, I have been here for 5 years. You can read  how I
              deal with others. If I had made a mistake, I would admit.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Why should I try to push the blame on you?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">If you refuse to take constructive critisim on the way you interact
              with others from forumers, you get issues - step on the tails of
              others who are trying to help, trying to seek help. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Issues like your flamewar with SBS7484P. They don't happen all
              without a reason. </p>

              <p>There's a difference between correction and critism you know.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">by Context, 1333 is the default speed, while 1866 is the max speed.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The meaning of by context is towards the phrasing of the question. if you ask about the colour of the apples like a green apple (default), and green apple (max). I answer green is default speed, red is max - which is the way i explained and replied in the thread. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">However, I know that there ARE different types of apples which i will name them, 800, 1066, and 1333. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Further more you have already explained it above in your previous reply before mine, so is it wrong of me to explain by context then, rather than repeating almost everything what you said?</p>

              <p>It will be stated on the software box if it's 32-bit or 64-bit,
              or on the receipt. I believe companies keep a receipt or
              transaction somewhere, so you can check with your Accounting
              department if the software box has been lost.</p>
              <p>As a general guide, softwares that are meant for client PC (that
              means they are not servers) and bought before end of 2008 are
              typically 32-bit. As for servers, they tend migrate faster than
              PCs, so softwares bought after 2007/2008 could be 64-bit. Again,
              you can check with the Accounting dept if the software box is lost.
              Alternatively, if you can access the server, opening up the system
              properties will tell you which version of software has been
              installed. 64-bit installed --&gt; machine is 64-bit.</p>

              <p>If you want to know if the particular software is 32-bit or
                  64-bit, you can do a check on the manufacturer's page or use
                  Google. Though usually, consumer software tend to be 32-bit for
                  maximum compatibility with all systems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You shouldn't have problems using 32-bit programs on a 64-bit
                  system. I've been using 64-bit OSes for quite sometime,
                  Vista/Windows 7 and Ubuntu, and the only problems I experience are
                  stuff written for the age of technological dinosaurs: programs
                  written in 16-bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And regarding your first questions:</p>
              <p>1. RAM sticks store their timings and speed information on a
                  chip on the RAM. This chip stores their SPD data, or Serial
                  Presence Detect. There are different types of SPD timings, namely
                  JEDEC SPD (Industry standard), Intel Extreme Memory Profile (Or
                  XMP), AMD Black Edition Memory Profile (or BEMP) and NVidia
                  Enhanced Performance Profile (Or EPP).</p>
              <p>RAM sticks of 1333MHz and below use JEDEC timings, and are
                  guaranteed to work at their rated speeds on any motherboard. Speeds
                  of 1600MHz and above typically use one of the special memory
                  profiles to reach their rated speed, but are guaranteed to work on
                  any motherboard at the JEDEC timings.</p>
              <p>An example would be my Team Xtreem LV 1600. It has JEDEC timings
                  of 1333MHz and 1066MHz, but also supports XMP speeds of 1600MHz on
                  a compatible motherboard. However, my motherboard doesn't support
                  XMP, so it runs at 1333MHz by default. If I had an Intel
                  motherboard supporting XMP, the RAM would already run at
                  1600MHz.</p>
              <p>2: Answer above there somewhere :P</p>
              <p>3. Corsair is a trusted name out there, very reliable and high
                  quality. Alternatively, you can go for Crucial, G.Skill or Team
                  Group. These are the companies I trust and I'm happy with.</p>

              <p>Hi Raraken,</p>
              <p>tks for the lengthy explanation, appreciate that, btw do you have a webpage link whereby i can learn how to do oc ? Currently my ram is 1600MHz, I still have not maximise its full potential yet, keen to learn.</p>
