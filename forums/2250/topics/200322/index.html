Created by Microsoft and IBM, WAV was one of the first audio file types developed for the PC. WAV files are defined as lossless, meaning that files are large and complete; nothing has been lost. Professionally recorded CDs are also a lossless audio source.<br><br>In contrast, the three audio formats listed below are lossy-redundant and non-auditory data is removed to allow for more compact storage; in essence, some data has been lost. This process of removing data to shrink the file size is called compression.<br><br>The three file formats below must begin with a lossless format-such as a store-bought CD or a computer WAV file-then compress it. Most lossy formats boast little or no detectable change in sound quality. But because each compressing format selects the deleteable data differently, converting one compressed file into another lossy format will sometimes result in lower quality audio. Again, always start with a CD or WAV file, then compress.<br><br># MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (.mp3)<br>MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (.mp3) is a common, compressed WAV file. MPEG-1 files are about one-twelfth the size of WAV files. This is why MP3 players can accommodate hundreds of songs on a tiny chunk of storage space.<br><br># Windows Media Audio (.wma)<br>Windows Media Audio (.wma) was developed to compete with the MP3 format for Windows Media Player. Microsoft claims that the WMA files are compressed three times more than MP3s yet retain their original sound quality.<br><br># Ogg Vorbis (.ogg)<br>Ogg Vorbis (.ogg) is another compressed source code similar to MP3, but like WMA, more compressed. Ogg Vorbis is also open source (free to all, unlicensed, no strings attached). While MP3 compresses data at a constant bit rate, Ogg uses a variable bit rate. To illustrate-if you are copying chunks of silence into MP3 format, the compression bit rate stays the same as if you were compressing the sound of an entire orchestra. But if you are copying chunks of silence into Ogg, your compression rate will drop to nothing. The rate varies with the need.<br><br><a href="http://cd-burning-software-review.toptenreviews.com/audio-file-types.html" rel="nofollow">Source</a></div>

By contrast, uncompressed audio as stored on a compact disc has a bit rate of 1411.2 kbit/s</strong><br><br><strong>Some listeners accept the MP3 bit rate of 128 kbit/s and the CD sampling rate of 44.1 kHz as near enough to compact disc quality for them</strong>, providing a compression ratio of approximately 11:1.<br><br><strong>However, listening tests show that with a bit of practice many listeners can reliably distinguish 128 kbit/s MP3s from CD originals; in many cases reaching the point where they consider the MP3 audio to be of unacceptably low quality. Yet other listeners, and the same listeners in other environments (such as in a noisy moving vehicle or at a party) will consider the quality acceptable.</strong> Imperfections in an MP3 encode will be much less apparent on low-end computer speakers than on a good stereo system connected to a computer or, especially, through high-quality headphones. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3</a><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Book_%28audio_CD_standard%29" rel="nofollow">Red Book (audio CD standard)</a><br><br>i believe the lower the bit rate, the lower the sound quality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>one more:<br><strong>Microsoft claims that files in WMA format sound better than MP3 files at the same bitrate; however, a 2004 independent test conducted at a common bit rate showed it (at 128kbps) as inferior to AAC and Vorbis, roughly equivalent to LAME MP3, and superior to ATRAC3. Microsoft also claims that WMA files sound better than MP3 files at higher bitrates. Although claims about audio quality should be taken with caution, double blind tests have consistently failed to support Microsoft's claims about its superior quality.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Audio" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Audio</a><br><br>so next time pls use .mp3(although "lame" ) or .aac  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
