              <p>SAN FRANCISCO - Apple refreshed its line of Mac desktop computers,
              adding stronger capabilities and nudging some prices lower as consumer
              spending feels the pinch of the recession.</p>
              <p>Apple introduced on
              Tuesday new models of its iMac, Mac mini and Mac Pro desktops,
              following a refresh of its MacBook notebook PCs last year.</p>
              <p>The
              new line includes a flagship 24-inch iMac with twice the memory size
              and twice the storage of the previous generation 20-inch iMac, but is
              priced at the same $1,499. It also includes a 20-inch PC and two new
              24-inch iMacs priced between at $1,199 to $2,199.</p>
              <p>Oppenheimer
              analyst Yair Reiner said the new desktop PCs did not break new ground
              on form or aesthetics, but the new iMacs offered much more bang for the
              buck.</p>
              <p>"Nothing earth-shattering here but in a time when price and
              value are of increasing significance the refresh definitely puts Apple
              at the head of that comparison," he said.</p>
              <p>Calyon Securities
              analyst Shebly Seyrafi said the new desktops should be able to
              contribute meaningfully to Apple's March quarter, but he wondered
              whether their price points are still too high.</p>
              <p>"They increased
              the performance but didn't lower the price. I question whether that is
              the right business move in today's environment where I think customers
              want lower prices," he said.</p>
              <p>Sales of Apple's desktops, like
              those of competitors such as Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc, have been
              declining as consumers shift to notebooks.</p>
              <p>Apple's desktop
              shipments fell 25 percent in the December quarter as notebooks rose 34
              percent. Desktop revenue made up less a third of all Mac revenue in the
              quarter.</p>
              <p>The picture for desktops is only expected to become
              grimmer. Research group Gartner expects global desktop sales to fall 32
              percent in 2009, even as notebooks rise 2.7 percent.</p>
              <p>Apple also
              introduced a new Mac Pro desktop PC aimed at business users. The new
              Mac Pro starts at $2,499, $300 less than the previous Mac Pro.</p>
              <p>In
              addition, the company unveiled two new Mac Mini desktops, measuring 6.5
              inches by 6.5 inches by 2 inches, with the entry-level price unchanged
              at $599. The Mac mini also now features an Nvidia graphics processor,
              and the chip maker said its GPUs are now available in all Mac
              computers, both desktops and notebooks.</p>
              <p>Oppenheimer's Reiner
              noted that Apple's press release was something of a "non-event"
              compared to some of the company's other product launches that have been
              among the most eagerly anticipated events in the technology world.</p>
              <p>When
              Apple refreshed its line of Macbook notebooks in October, Chief
              Executive Steve Jobs -- currently on medical leave until June --
              introduced the new PCs with his typical showmanship at Apple's
              headquarters in Cupertino, California.</p>
              <p>Calyon's Seyrafi did not
              see Apple's somewhat low-key announcement as significant, noting that
              desktops are simply not as important as notebooks these days.</p>
              <p>Shares of Apple were up 1.7 percent to $89.41 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.</p>
