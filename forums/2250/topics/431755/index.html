              <p>Hi, I got this problem with my friend's pc... If anyone can help, would be grateful.</p>
              <p>Ok, the problem is... It can't totally load the OS. The comp is using Win 7 OS, when you turn it on, it load until only the bottom Toolbar (the one with the start sign at the bottom left side). All the icons on the desktop can't be seen, only a black screen. Then there is this window appear asking to fix some harddisk and ram errors...</p>
              <p>When i click the explorer, it can't connent to the internet, saying something with the telephone number kind of stuff... And when I click on the start (Bottom left) button, I go to the "All programs", I notice some of the programs are no longer there... only a few left... </p>
              <p>When all else cannot work, I tried to reformat the HD for my friend (Using a different harddisk) but after starting for a few seconds, it can't load the new OS and it turn into a blue screen saying something like to do a check harddisk, if you are installing a new HD, stop or it may get virus or something...</p>
              <p>Anyone know whats the problem? A friend told me it could be a ram problem cos sometimes, it can't load, only black screen then when 2 of the rams are taken out, it can load only as the same as what I mentioned at the top. It's a Dell desktop and It uses 4 x 512mb 667 rams.</p>
              <p>Any reason why I can't load a new OS and get a blue screen?</p>
              <p>Btw, any idea the cost of the rams if its causing the problem?</p>
              <p>Thanks...</p>

              <p>If the RAM is determined to be the cause, then you should replace the RAM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wait - you've already determined it by removing one pair and then the other pair runs the system just fine.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
              <p>The OS is installed on the hard drive, and because RAM is heavily used and a crucial system resource, you should realise that Windows will corrupt itself should it be unlucky enough to latch onto the bad spots of memory.</p>
              <p>That, or it will BSOD.</p>
              <p>Pick up a new pair of 1GB sticks - that'll solve the issue and give you more RAM too.</p>

              <p>Hey Thanks guys, just bought one 1GB ram from Sim Lim today for $28 bucks. Surprise it's quite cheap, realized I have been out of the loop for a while cos I thought it might cost me about $40 - $50+ for a 512mb... lol.</p>
              <p>Cos if it was very ex and he has to get 4, he thought might as well get a cheaper new PC in the $300+ range as it would be more cost efficient in the long run. </p>
              <p>Only got one today cos I want to test if it works or not first... If it doesn't, then I don't know what else to do liao... waste $28 lor...  </p>
              <p>Will go over to my friend's place tomorrow evening to see if it works after replacing the rams...</p>
              <p>I intend to remove all the current rams and try out only the one I bought today as I think it's better not to have anything to do with the old rams anymore as they have a history... Part of it is, his PC ever cannot load 2, 3 months ago then I asked him to take out 2 rams and it work, can load. Then he put them back in again on his own hoping to have more memory and surprisingly, it work, can load and it was back to as per normal again. Strange I thought but since it was working, just continue lor...</p>
              <p>Ok, just some info of the user... I notice my young friend seems to download quite an amount of torrent files... He said he watches movies on his PC. Those TV or cable comedies kind, don't play online games with it... Other usual stuff, Messenger, skype, open office software...</p>
              <p>The 2nd post asked if his window 7 is geniune? I notice it isn't and I asked if he have the OS, he said he don't as the PC was given to him by his elder bro some 2 yrs ago (2nd hand set)... It has a geniune windows xp licence sticker but he said his bro didn't give him any CD.</p>
              <p>So this being the case, I intend to give him my geniune Xp as I got a spare and I don't used or need it anyway...</p>
              <p>I am wondering should I just start with reformating and not let his Win 7 try to even load as the 1st post said... <strong>"Windows will corrupt itself should it be unlucky enough to latch onto the bad spots of memory" </strong></p>
              <p>Does it work both ways? Will the current Win 7 / Harddisk corrupt the new ram? </p>
              <p>Should I replace the Harddisk as well? I got a used one but it's good, I have tested it before and no problem... Cos I did mentioned on the first post at start up, a diagnostic scan will happen and said something like cannot fix some harddisk and ram errors kind of message...</p>
              <p>Thanks again guys... Will check back in tomorrow afternoon...</p>

              <p>No, no.</p>
              <p>Windows will NOT corrupt the RAM.</p>
              <p>It goes the other way round. Damaged RAM leads to corrupted Windows installation.</p>
              <p>Also, it is best to buy a pair of sticks rather than just one stick.</p>
              <p>1GB of RAM is slow as hell even on XP.</p>
              <p>That's assuming we're talking modern standards.</p>
              <p>Get a second stick of similar RAM, and place them in.<br>This, for more memory and dual-channel operation which is faster.</p>

              <p>Did what I said earlier, took out all the 4 x 512mb rams and replace it with the new 1Gb. The result, it didn't work!</p>
              <p>Very disappointed couldn't help my young friend... The moment I put in the new ram and turn on his PC, a beep beep sound starts... and the monitor can't even start off from its stand-by mode meaning the harddisk didn't even move a single bit... Changed the position of the ram on the slots also same story.</p>
              <p>In the end, my young friend said forget it lah... No choice, have to spend some money so went in search to get a cheap desktop lor...</p>
              <p>At the shop where he bought his new desktop, (the cheapest one in the store) I ask the sales man if the 2 rams (The new kingston 1gb ram and his own a 512mb Pro MOS) were the same kind? After looking at them, the salesman said they were. So I ask him any reason why they couldn't work on his old Dell PC, he said it's hard to say for sure... But maybe the new 1Gb may be faulty? Though that may not necessary be the case but he doesn't discount the possibility of a new ram, came sealed in a casing by an unbroken sticker, could be spoilt from his experience...</p>
              <p>I am now thinking could it be because it's a Dell set so they make it difficult for other hardware to match with their system? Or his motherboard can only used up to 512mb ram max on each slot?</p>
              <p>Now, don't know if the shop allow to do an exchange so that I can try it again? Cos otherwise, I end up having a new ram I am not sure working or spoilt and don't know what else to do with it... If they allow and it turns out this was really the case, it's really unfortunate as my young friend could have really saved his $ for better used rather than having to spend it on a new desktop...</p>

              <p>Just came across this page after doing a search on the Technical infomation on the blue screen above...</p>

              <p>It seems like this problem have been around for sometime... I have the same problem, the same Dell model Dimension E520... Looks like this problem is quite unique to Dell and this model... Any recourse for this set?</p>
              <p>It didn't give any indication what's the fault though the last post suggested to change the SATA configuration... How do you change sata configuration?</p>
              <p>And another guy said to disable anything that refers to AHCI / RAID, set everything to compatibility...</p>
              <p>Any other suggestions?</p>

              <p>There's a less complicated way... <br><br>Or rather, I think there is.</p>
              <p>That is, to install Windows 7 on the hard drive from another computer, then boot the Dell with the same hard drive, and finally activate Windows on the Dell.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

              <p>But I want to put my licenced win Xp in cos the current one from my friend is on win 7 but got no licence...</p>
              <p>Earlier, I did changed another harddisk with win Xp inside but when it came to the part when the Xp logo supposed to show, it couldn't boot also... I think it must be something to do with the bios settling cos other harddisk all cannot read only the original one can boot... Must be one of the problems Dell comes with... damn!</p>
              <p>I will try to work on it again in the next 2, 3 days when I got the time... Try to change something in the bios next time and hopefully it will work like for that guy in the link I put up...</p>

              <p>Ok, great news. I finally manage to get it pass the load drivers part and finally manage to load Windows Xp onto it... I followed one of the suggestion from the <span style="color: #000000;">penny-</span><span style="color: #000000;">arcade.com</span> post and switch the RAID On to something else and it finally work. No more Blue screen upon loading Xp...</p>
              <p>Everything went smoothly, updates after updates, install drivers after drivers. Though the Lan, graphic and sound all didn't work at first cos no drivers or Dell CD. So I needed to go online to search for them... Good thing I got my own pc to do so otherwise how to get them to work? If no Network connection, no updates...</p>
              <p>Everything is now good with only one minor problem... There is no sound coming from the pc cos I got the dreaded "error code 10" problem now for the sound system on the motherboard...</p>
              <p>I understand it's quite a problematic issue to solve... I guess it's not exactly the biggest problem compare to earlier... Tried to fix it a few times but nothing seems to work. New drivers, uninstall and re-install drivers all same problem... "error code 10" and no sound.</p>
              <p>If anyone has other ideas on solving this "error code 10" thing, I would appreciate. For now, I have plug in a usb sound system and there is sound coming from my speakers though would prefer if can fix the onboard sound system...</p>
              <p>And special thanks to sbs7484p and everyone else for your time and suggestions...</p>
