              </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">moving head<strong> </strong></span><span lang="EN">lights are very attractive and fantastic
              stand-alone units which spin, move and swivel in practically any direction,
              spreading coloured lights throughout the ceiling, walls, floors, the stage and
              the people. The fixtures are standard products in a lot of bars, restaurants,
              discos and nightclubs. As a light source, the moving heads use either arc lamps
              or the up to date LED (light emitting diodes) technology. Using the most recent
              LED lighting has its advantages, but there also are a couple of drawbacks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">When referring to benefits of LED Lights, its low energy consumption is the
              initial thing that should be started with. It is so small, because LED lights
              need less power than a standard light bulb, which, in the end, suggests that a
              lot of units could possibly be mounted and use the energy of a standard energy
              supply. This is wonderful for disco and DJ parties . So alongside being very
              convenient to work with, LED heads may save some money from your power bill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Another advantage of <strong><a title="moving head" href="http://www.artfoxlight.com">moving head</a>Â </strong>light is
              the low thermal radiation. In contrast to standard stage lighting lamps, moving
              head fixtures utilizing LED technology do not get very hot, that means that the
              light show might be run without any interruptions, because of equipment fault.
              And also, LED lights are very long lasting - the normal life of the LED is
              approximately 50 000 working hours, which makes the maintenance of the units
              less complicated and cheaper.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN">moving head</span></strong><span lang="EN"> spots benefit also from their colour effects. The 3 standard colours -
              Red, Green and Blue (RGB) - mixed together, secures millions of mixtures and
              colour choices. The mix of colours is very easily managed using the help of a
              DMX software installed on a normal computer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Moving heads DMX are also small, compact and portable. Because of their
              small dimensions and light-weight materials, it is very easy to set them up and
              aim them at any spot in the club or bar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">IF,<strong> LED moving head </strong>have some negative aspects too. They are coming
              primarily from limitation of the LED technology. LED beams cannot get a
              directed spotlight, because there are a lot of sources of light. It is also
              hard to get a "good" white light. In fact, many colours are nearly
              impossible to create, even using the boundless possibilities of colour mixing.
              Another difficulty of the LED moving heads is the fact that their depth drops
              off very quick in big ranges - a possible reason for this is the lack of lens.
              The result is that the light breaks and it cannot be excellent concentrated
              into a single beam. It also takes a bit more time to set up the DMX moving
              heads (establishing DMX addresses, light patterns programming, and so on.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Even with their limitations, LED moving heads controlled by a DMX software
              are crucial for the evolution of the stage and nightclub lighting technology.
              They are very versatile because of the big number of DMX channels being used,
              which helps make them nowadays inseparable component of any light show.</span></p>
