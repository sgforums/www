              <p>Hi techies, I have a Singtel Mio broadband 8Mbps subscribed in my home and using the provided 2wire router for wireless access. My first PC is wired to the router in the living room and a second PC on wireless connection in the study room. Problem is that the second PC downloads at max 300+ kbps (sometimes erratic connection) while the first PC downloads at &gt;1Mbps.</p>
              <p>I know wireless connections can get affected by walls and other objects. Can you guys suggest I can improve my wireless connection, without moving the second PC out of the study room? I'm thinking of getting a Linksys wireless Range Expander (<a href="http://www.linksysbycisco.com/APAC/en/support/WRE54G">http://www.linksysbycisco.com/APAC/en/support/WRE54G</a>); is it going to help? Or do you guys have better recommendations to a non-techie like myself?</p>
              <p>Any good suggestion is greatly appreciated.</p>

              <p>I think the wireless range of the 2wire is good enough for most HDB flats.</p>
              <p>Buying a range expander will only increase the range, and may not increase download speed(as the signal needs to be pass from your pc to the expander, and then to the router), unless your current signal is really very poor.</p>
              <p>Before everything, there are some stuff which i need to clarify:<br>1. Is your wireless adaptor very old? I remember old adaptors are capped at certain speeds.</p>
              <p>2. When you say both PC download at different speeds, do you download them from the same website? Try testing the wireless connection speed at <a href="http://www.speedtest.net">www.speedtest.net</a> and select the singapore server, if the speed is 8mbps, the problem maybe the website you are downloading from.</p>
              <p>3. How strong are the signals?</p>
              <p>If the speed is still slow, try this:<br><br>Method one:</p>
              <p>1.Open up internet explorer and type in "gateway.2wire.net" without the quotes into the address bar.</p>
              <p>2. Select Wireless setting from the menu on the left.</p>
              <p>3. scroll down to the bottom where it says " Additional Settings (defaults recommended)"</p>
              <p>4. Make sure that the "maximum connection rate" is set to 54mbps(maximum for wireless G), and the power setting set to max for maximum wireless signal</p>
              <p>5. Click save. Try not to change other settings.</p>
              <p>6. Try measuring your connection speed at speedtest.net</p>
              <p>Method 2(if it is not a hassle)</p>
              <p><br>1. Take the wireless adaptor from your 2nd PC and install it on your first PC.</p>
              <p>2. Temporary unplug the wire that connects the your first pc to the internet</p>
              <p>3. Try measuring your bandwidth from speedtest.net again</p>
              <p>If all else fails, wait for more replies, or call singnet about it. Sometimes they will send a technician down to check your connection for free.</p>

              <p>I highly doubt that there is any issue with the range. </p>
              <p>Before I moved out, I lived in a HDB executive maisonette (HDB apartments with 2 floors). My signal strength and speed is +/- the same when I'm in my room (which is on the 2nd floor) and when I m in the living room. </p>
              <p>Thus, I don't think it's necessary to get an extender.  </p>
              <p>I understand that the first PC is connected directly to the router (wired) and the second PC is connected via wifi. </p>
              <p>Wifi download speeds will be significantly slower as compared to wired. So it's not anything to be concerned about.</p>
              <p>Anyway try this. <a href="http://download.cnet.com/UnBlocka-Turbo/3000-2086_4-10495430.html">http://download.cnet.com/UnBlocka-Turbo/3000-2086_4-10495430.html</a></p>

              <p>Everyone There is nothing wrong and nothing can be done. You all just did not read clearly.</p>
              <p>He already say it - first PC is wired (connected via cable direct ) to the router in the living room and a second PC on wireless connection in the study room .</p>
              <p>There is a huge different in speed which wire and wireless. There is a limit in speed in wireless.</p>
              <p>There is only 2 solution if he want the speed to increase in study also.</p>
              <p>1)  lay network cable to study room, your second PC use wired also.</p>
              <p>2) Get Powerline Access Points.  Turns any electrical power outlet into a network connection. 2 access unit is needed.  1 into a power socket in connect to your router - 1 into the power socket in study connected to your notebook - challenger have them but not cheap - as 1 unit is from $75 -130</p>

              <p>I agree with you. </p>
              <p>It can be shown from speedtest. Though it's not accurate, it shows a rough gauge of the download speeds from servers. </p>
              <p>If you pick any server other than Singapore, you will see that the download speeds/ upload speeds are quite low. Worse if you pick a location further from singapore.</p>
              <p>A possibility would also be someone hogging your internet connection.. Torrents.. </p>

              <p>Thank you guys so much for your helpful replies.</p>
              <p>I've checked my settings in gateway.2wire.com and found that the connection rate is already set at 54 Mbps and power setting at highest. My download rate (wireless PC) at speedtest.net is measured at 8Mbps, correct to my subscription. The current adaptor model is 2701HGV-E (<a href="http://www.2wire.com/?p=106">http://www.2wire.com/?p=106</a>), not sure if it's too old though.</p>
              <p>I tried downloading videos from youtube with both PCs and the wired one receives at &gt;1Mbps while the WiFi PC usually goes at 100-200 kbps.</p>
              <p>To understand what my frustration is, please see this picture. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48794936@N06/4469647940/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/48794936@N06/4469647940/</a>)</p>
              <p>As you can see, the signal is poor, usually at one bar of connection, sometimes 2 bars. When I was still in school years ago, my laptop wireless connection is usually full. Maybe campus routers are more powerful?</p>
              <p>Kenneth, both my PCs are usually accessing the internet at the same time. So does the wired PC get priority over the WiFi PC in terms of download rate? I downloaded the Turbo software that you recommended but Windows 7 is not supported.</p>
              <p>Regarding Torrenting, I've given up on it using my WiFi PC because the download rates are 3 - 4 kbps, even with more than a thousand seeders.</p>
              <p>I tried playing Modern Warfare 2 on Multiplayer and the PC hangs for a while whenever I encounter firefights. When the PC recovers, my character is already dead. Please note I can run the game smoothly at the highest settings in Single Player mode. So I've pretty much given up online gaming using the WiFi connection.</p>
              <p>So guys, any good ideas on how to improve the WiFi signal? Or is the poor signal expected?</p>

              <p>Do this test - on your 2nd PC - note the signal and download speed.</p>
              <p>move the 2nd PC to the living room - with the signal full - note the download speed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if full signal - and the speed increase to what you are happy with, then good news - you can consider shopping for a signal booster or wifi extentor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If with full signal - and your download is still slow - then that prove to you that between your router &amp; you PC wireless card - the wifi at max - has reach its limit. Frankly changing any of them may not see much improvement - just have to accept - wifi limitation.  Then the only option for you to explore is Get Powerline Access Points. They make use of your house electrical wire - to transfer data like cable data, it is a proven technology which speed if faster if not comparable to cable.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thank you guys so much for your helpful replies.</p>
              <p>I've checked my settings in gateway.2wire.com and found that the
              connection rate is already set at 54 Mbps and power setting at
              highest. My download rate (wireless PC) at speedtest.net is
              measured at 8Mbps, correct to my subscription. The current adaptor
              model is 2701HGV-E (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.2wire.com/?p=106">http://www.2wire.com/?p=106</a>), not sure if it's too
              old though.</p>
              <p>I tried downloading videos from youtube with both PCs and the
              wired one receives at &gt;1Mbps while the WiFi PC usually goes at
              100-200 kbps.</p>
              <p>To understand what my frustration is, please see this picture.
              (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48794936@N06/4469647940/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/48794936@N06/4469647940/</a>)</p>
              <p>As you can see, the signal is poor, usually at one bar of
              connection, sometimes 2 bars. When I was still in school years ago,
              my laptop wireless connection is usually full. Maybe campus routers
              are more powerful?</p>
              <p>Kenneth, both my PCs are usually accessing the internet at the
              same time. So does the wired PC get priority over the WiFi PC in
              terms of download rate? I downloaded the Turbo software that you
              recommended but Windows 7 is not supported.</p>
              <p>Regarding Torrenting, I've given up on it using my WiFi PC
              because the download rates are 3 - 4 kbps, even with more
              than a thousand seeders.</p>
              <p>I tried playing Modern Warfare 2 on Multiplayer and the PC hangs
              for a while whenever I encounter firefights. When the PC recovers,
              my character is already dead. Please note I can run the game
              smoothly at the highest settings in Single Player mode. So I've
              pretty much given up online gaming using the WiFi connection.</p>
              <p>So guys, any good ideas on how to improve the WiFi signal? Or
              is the poor signal expected?</p>

              <p>It's pretty odd that it's only a bar. I'm a hubber, thus I have to admit I'm not really familiar with 2wire modems and routers. </p>
              <p>Do you currently torrent with your wired PC?  Any form of torrents regardless of which ever computer is used will reduce the speeds of your internet access. If yes, you should stop, and see the difference. </p>
              <p>I presume the wireless adapter on your 2nd PC is usb based?</p>
              <p>If so could you unplug it and connect it to your 1st PC?</p>
              <p>That would test if there is any problem with the adapter it self.</p>

              <p>guess could be some interference or something really "big" blocking the signal.</p>
              <p>usually i would try to put my wireless router and pc near the window. that way will get a good connection.</p>
