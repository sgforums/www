            <div class='col-md body'>I am posting it here cos i have no idea what is it about. Does anyone know if a wireless router can be controlled from the 1st computer? I am saying is my friend asked me and i am not aware if such a thing is possible.<br><br>You see, his home got 2 computers, his sister's room 1 set his 1 set. He is using starhub Max on line 65000 and a Linksys wireless router with 4 ports.<br>The modem and router is in his sister's room. His sister is using a network cable to connect to one of the router's port. His set is using a Linksys 2.4 GHz adaptor.<br><br>The problem he is facing now is, his connection used to be pretty fast. He could play online games without any problem. But lately, the past month he said his connection is very slow until he cannot stay connected to online games.<br><br>He used to be able to connect at 54.0Mbps when his sister never turn on her computer... but gets around 24.0Mbps if she turns on. The problem is, even at 24.0Mbps, it was still good enough But now, even if his sister don't turn on her computer, the most he see on the connection is 36Mbps. He said he even formatted his computer 2 weeks ago as he thought there may be some virus on his set... But now he thinks thats not the case as his com has Norton Security install even before he format his HD.<br><br>He asked me can his sister put a setting to limit the speed of the wireless router from her computer? That's why he is getting slower connection speed?<br><br>Do advise if anyone knows k. thank you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For Linksys routers, it's possible to do so. There's an option to set to either wireless B or wireless G. Wireless B is the slower counterpart of wireless G. The maximum speed is 11Mbps.<br><br>Theoretically, one would be connecting at 54Mbps. In practice, though, it's not possible, due to other factors like signals interference. His speed drop could be due to that there are more people around his area using wireless and could be using the same channel. He can try using another channel.</div>
