If it was writing to your hard disk and you did a reset, you could have damaged the hard disk.<br><br>That's why your Windows couldn't boot up. Your system files could have been damaged.<br><br>Check that your monitor cables are properly plugged in, with the power off ensure that the graphics card is properly slot in too and is the power supply to the graphics card plugged in.<br><br>How old is your graphics card?<br><br>If it's under 1 year, it might still be under warranty.<br><br>Can try clearing out your BIOS too.
