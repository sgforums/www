            <div class='col-md body'>To simplify, let's use CD ROM as example. CD ROM data can't be edited after it's been burned to a CD. That's the idea of a ROM. Yes, it means it <strong>can only be read, cannot be edited</strong>.<br><br>EPROM, is slightly different. It is still read-only, however, it can edited, only under certain conditions. That certain condition is: It must be exposed to UV Ray. After exposing it to UV Rays, all data will be gone. To prevent accidental data loss, they are usually covered by some foil.<br><br>How ROM works... well... exact details I don't know, I'm not an engineer.<br><br>You can check out <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/rom2.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a> on how ROM works.<br><br>A summary of what ROM is<br><br>1. It stands for Read Only Memory. Data may be read, but not edited.<br><br>2. It's a type of non-volatile memory. That means even if power is removed from it, the data will still be preserved.<br><br>3. Even if it can be edited, certain conditions have to be met. In the example of EPROM, it has to be exposed to UV Rays for data to be erased, re-programmed and saved.</div>
