              <p>isn't really that difficult to setup la...u have to install the drivers all these and that..just connect the LAN cable from the cable modem to the router's in port. then u'll also have to setup a password for ur router for the excryption for the network..DNS and IP will be automatically done itself.</p>

              <p>my modem is the motorola black one that stands up vertically.</p>
              <p>not at home now so i can't check...but it was installed earlier this year by a Starhub technician.</p>
              <p>the router is called TrendNet TEW-411BRP Wireless AP router (not those common Linksys ones).</p>
              <p>the modem should be connected to the web (all lights working), and the router also properly setup (able to access router's setup page).</p>
              <p>i'll check again in the router setup page for something like DHCP setting, heard others on other forum talk about this.</p>
              <p>btw, after this whole thing is setup, my laptop can go wireless and no need forever connect to the router right?</p>

              <p>Save the thanks; I haven't done anything yet.</p>
              <p>As for options for the wireless network:</p>
              <p>Leave the mode as "b+g" for backward compatibility or set it to "g" if you're sure that your wireless adapters are all 802.11g (b is really old though).</p>
              <p>Channel number doesn't really matter unless you're running more than one wireless networks in close proximity. Think of it as the frequency channels used by radio stations. Eg. Two radio stations can't use the same frequency of 92.4 Mhz unless they're located far apart, otherwise they would interfere with each other's signals.</p>
              <p>Leave domain as ETSI, which allows you to choose between Channel 1 - 13 (FCC allows Channel 1 - 11).</p>
              <p>SSID: Your network name, which will appear in a list of wireless networks when a user within the range of your router is trying to connect to a wireless network. You can try setting something funky there, like:</p>
              <p><img src="http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/epic-fail-wifi-network-fail.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>SSID Broadcast: whether to broadcast your network name in public. I've never used this option before, but I assume that:<br>1. Your SSID will not appear in wireless network lists.<br>2. Users who want to connect to your wireless network will need to enter the network name manually.<br>Just leave it enabled but make sure you set a password for your wireless network, which leads us to...</p>
              <p>Security: Leave it enabled. It probably means whether a password is required to connect to your wireless network (though it's pretty ambiguous to just call it "Security"). There's probably a password field or two just nearby that option where you'll enter the network password. There might be a restriction which requires the password to be at least 8 characters long as well.</p>
              <p>Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
