Linux is completely different from Windows. If you aren't comfortable, use XAMPP for Windows. Everything is just click and click.<br><br>Q3 - Don't really get it. You mean you want everybody to read those mails that are sent to company@singnet.com.sg ? If yes, I don't know how. If one mail client (Outlook Express) has downloaded it, the other one won't be able to download them. The only way that I know will be to read everything would be via a web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc)</div>
