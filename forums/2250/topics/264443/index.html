The tech asked her if she was "running it under Windows." The woman then responded, "No, my desk is next to the door. But that is a good point.

            <div class='col-md body'>General Motors doesn't have a "help line" for people who don't know how to drive, because people don't buy cars like they buy computers --but imagine if they did...<br>HELPLINE: "General Motors Helpline, how can I help you?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "I got in my car and closed the door, and nothing happened!"<br><br>HELPLINE: "Did you put the key in the ignition and turn it?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "What's an ignition?"<br><br>HELPLINE: "It's a starter motor that draws current from your battery and turns over the engine."<br><br>CUSTOMER: "Ignition? Motor? Battery? Engine? How come I have to know all of these technical terms just to use my car?"<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>HELPLINE: "General Motors Helpline, how can I help you?"<br>CUSTOMER: "My car ran fine for a week, and now it won't go anywhere!"<br><br>HELPLINE: "Is the gas tank empty?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "Huh? How do I know?"<br><br>HELPLINE: "There's a little gauge on the front panel, with a needle, and markings from 'E' to 'F'. Where is the needle pointing?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "I see an 'E' but no 'F'."<br><br>HELPLINE: "You see the 'E' and just to the right is the 'F'.<br><br>CUSTOMER: "No, just to the right of the first 'E' is a 'V'.<br><br>HELPLINE: "A 'V'?!?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "Yeah, there's a 'C', an 'H', the first 'E', then a 'V', followed by 'R', 'O', 'L' ..."<br><br>HELPLINE: "No, no, no sir! That's the front of the car. When you sit behind the steering wheel, that's the panel I'm talking about."<br><br>CUSTOMER: "That steering wheel thingy-- Is that the round thing that honks the horn?"<br><br>HELPLINE: "Yes, among other things."<br><br>CUSTOMER: "The needle's pointing to 'E'. What does that mean?"<br><br>HELPLINE: "It means that you have to visit a gasoline vendor and purchase some more gasoline. You can install it yourself, or pay the vendor to install it for you."<br><br>CUSTOMER: "What? I paid $12,000 for this car! Now you tell me that I have to keep buying more components? I want a car that comes with everything built in!"<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>HELPLINE: "General Motors Helpline, how can I help you?"<br>CUSTOMER: "Your cars suck!"<br><br>HELPLINE: "What's wrong?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "It crashed, that's what went wrong!"<br><br>HELPLINE: "What were you doing?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "I wanted to go faster, so I pushed the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor. It worked for a while, and then it crashed -- and now it won't even start up!"<br><br>HELPLINE: "I'm sorry, sir, but it's your responsibility if you misuse the product."<br><br>CUSTOMER: "Misuse it? I was just following this damned manual of yours. It said to make the car go to put the transmission in 'D' and press the accelerator pedal. That's exactly what I did -- now the damn thing's crashed."<br><br>HELPLINE: "Did you read the entire operator's manual before operating the car sir?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "What? Of course I did! I told you I did EVERYTHING the manual said and it didn't work!"<br><br>HELPLINE: "Didn't you attempt to slow down so you wouldn't crash?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "How do you do THAT?"<br><br>HELPLINE: "You said you read the entire manual, sir. It's on page 14. The pedal next to the accelerator."<br><br>CUSTOMER: "Well, I don't have all day to sit around and read this manual you know."<br><br>HELPLINE: "Of course not. What do you expect us to do about it?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "I want you to send me one of the latest versions that goes fast and won't crash anymore!"<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>HELPLINE: "General Motors Helpline, how can I help you?"<br>CUSTOMER: "Hi! I just bought my first car, and I chose your car because it has automatic transmission, cruise control, power steering, power brakes, and power door locks."<br><br>HELPLINE: "Thanks for buying our car. How can I help you?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "How do I work it?"<br><br>HELPLINE: "Do you know how to drive?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "Do I know how to what?"<br><br>HELPLINE: "Do you know how to DRIVE?"<br><br>CUSTOMER: "I'm not a technical person!

            <div class='col-md body'>"Hello, Welch Hall, computer assistant; may I help you?"<br>"Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect."<br>"What sort of trouble?"<br>"Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away."<br>"Went away?"<br>"They disappeared."<br>"Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?"<br>"Nothing."<br>"Nothing?"<br>"It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type."<br>"Are you still in WordPerfect or did you get out?"<br>"How do I tell?"<br>[Uh-Oh. Well, let's give it a try anyway.] "Can you see the C:\ prompt on the screen?"<br>"What's a sea prompt?"<br>[Uh-huh. I thought so. Let's try a different tactic.] "Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen."<br>"There isn't any cursor: I told you, it won't accept anything I type."<br>[Ah, a least he/she knows what a cursor is. Sounds like a hardware problem. I wonder if he/she kicked out his/her monitor's power plug.] "Does your monitor have a power indicator?<br>"What's a monitor?"<br>"It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on?"<br>"I don't know."<br>"Well, then look at the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?"<br>[Sound of rustling and jostling] [Muffled] "Yes, I think so."<br>"Great! Follow the cord to the plug and tell me if it's plugged into the wall."<br>[Pause] "Yes, it is."<br>[Hmm. Well, that's interesting. I doubt he/she would have accidentally turned it off, and I don't want to send him/her hunting for the power switch because I don't know what kind of monitor he/she has and it's bound to have more than one switch on it. Maybe the video cable is loose or something.] "When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cable plugged into the back of it, not just one?"<br>"No."<br>"Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable."<br>[Muffled] "Okay, here it is."<br>"Follow it for me and tell me if it's plugged securely into the back of your computer."<br>[Still muffled] "I can't reach it."<br>"Uh-huh. Well, can you see if it is?"<br>[Clear again] "No."<br>"Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?"<br>"Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle - it's because it's dark."<br>"Dark?"<br>"Yes - the office light is off and the only light I have is coming from the window."<br>"Well, turn on the office light then."<br>"I can't."<br>"No? Why not?"<br>"Because there's a power outage."<br>A power !@#$%^&amp;*!?!"...[AAAAAAAARGH!!!] "A power outage? Aha! Okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?"<br>"Well, yes, I kept them in the closet."<br>"Good! Go get them, unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from."<br>"Really? Is it that bad?"<br>"Yes, I'm afraid it is."<br>"Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?"<br>"Tell them you're TOO STUPID TO OWN A COMPUTER!!!"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just in case you think you are TC ("Technologically Challenged" , the following is an excerpt from an article in the Wall Street Journal:<br><br>1. Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to Press Return Key" because of the flood of calls asking where the "Any" key is.<br><br>2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her Mouse was hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.<br><br>3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old diskettes. The customer had stuck labels on the diskettes, then rolled them into his typewriter to type on the labels.<br><br>4. Another customer was asked to send a copy of her defective diskettes. A few days later, a letter arrived from the customer along with photocopies of the floppies.<br><br>5. A Dell technician advised a customer to put his trouble floppy back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room.<br><br>6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything. After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the tech discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the "send" key.<br><br>7. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them individually.<br><br>8. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged because his computer had told him he was "bad and an invalid". The tech explained that the computer's "bad" command and "invalid" responses shouldn't be taken personally.<br><br>9. A confused caller to IBM was having troubles printing documents. He told the technician that the computer had said it "couldn't find printer". The user had tried turning the computer screen to face the printer, but that his computer still couldn't "see" the printer.<br><br>10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get her new Dell computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button. Her response, "I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happened." The "foot pedal" turned out to be the computer's mouse.<br><br>11. Another customer called Compaq Tech Support to say her brand-new computer wouldn't work. She said she'd unpacked the unit, plugged it in and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she answered, "What Power switch?"<br><br>12. True story from a Novell NetWire SysOp: Caller: "Hello, is this Tech Support?" Tech: "Yes, it is. How may I help you? Caller: "The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my warranty period. How do I go about getting that fixed?" Tech: "I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?" Caller: "Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer." Tech: "Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, it's because I am. Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at a tradeshow?" Caller: "It came with my computer. I don't know anything about a promotional. It just has '4X' on it." At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't stand it. He was laughing too hard. The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive!<br><br>13. Another IBM customer had trouble installing software and rang for support. "I put in the first disk, and that was OK. It said to put in the second disk, and I had some problems with that disk. When it said to put in the third disk - I couldn't even fit it in.." The user hadn't realized that "Insert Disk 2" meant to remove Disk 1 first.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
