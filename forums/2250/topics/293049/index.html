Any others, the product goes to the trash bin.<br><br>In XP, Windows Firewall only blocks incoming connections, not outgoing. In other words, you won't know what things are being sent out when you are connected to the Net. A properly configured firewall will prompt you about programs connecting to the Net.<br><br>In Vista, the firewall works both way, but by default, outgoing connections are not monitored. In effect, it's about the same as XP Firewall... you need to configure Windows Firewall in order for it to block certain programs connecting to the outside world or let it notify you that something is trying to connect.<br><br>Whether to download 32-bit or 64-bit will depend on your OS version. Most of us are using 32-bit OS.<br><br>If unsure, download the 64-bit and run it. If you get an error, means your OS is 32-bit. 32-bit programs can't run a 64-bit program, but a 64-bit program can run a 32-bit program (generally, some programs can be very idiotic).</div>
