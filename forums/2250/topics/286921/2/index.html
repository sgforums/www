            <div class='col-md body'>Increase SATA drive performance.<br><br>This tip Â“enhancesÂ” drive performance by allowing the drive in question to perform more write caching to system memory. The danger is if your system loses power and you do not have a backup power source (UPS), whatever data is cached to system memory will be lost. If youÂ’re the adventurous type and want a bit more responsiveness out of your system, click Start, type Device Manager in the Search box, click the Device Manager, open up the Disk drives tree, right-click a drive, and select Properties. Go to the Policies tab and check Â“Enable Advanced Performance.Â” Click OK.<br><br><img src="http://enthusiast.hardocp.com/images/articles/1176752624JiyjYpmD8o_1_1_l.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Use ReadyBoost.<br><br>ThereÂ’s been a lot of talk about VistaÂ’s ability to use Flash drives to Â“boostÂ” system performance. Traditionally, Windows will cache files both to system memory and to your hard drive. The cached files on your hard drive reside in the Page File, which is also known as Â“virtual memory.Â” The problem with this approach is that even the fastest hard drives are sluggish when compared to flash drives, at least when it comes to seek times, which are nearly instantaneous on solid-state memory. Readyboost tries to address this situation by allowing Vista to use the Flash drive for its Page File, rather than the slow hard drive. ItÂ’s important to note that the actual Page File is still cached on the hard drive, but is being accessed from the Flash drive - which means that you're not at risk for losing your data.<br><br>So, how do you enable it? Simply insert a Â“Readyboost capableÂ” Flash drive that is 1GB or larger in capacity into one of your systemÂ’s USB ports, and when the pop-up box appears asking what you want to do, scroll down to find the option, Â“Speed up my system using Windows ReadyBoost.Â” You can then specify how much space to make available on the device.<br><br>This is a hotly-contested feature in Vista as some users claim a decent performance gain (mostly people with less than 1GB of RAM), but others say the benefit is negligible. If youÂ’ve got a spare USB drive laying around, why not give it a shot? We didn't notice a profound difference in performance, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you won't.<br><br><img src="http://enthusiast.hardocp.com/images/articles/1176752624JiyjYpmD8o_2_1_l.gif"><br><br><img src="http://enthusiast.hardocp.com/images/articles/1176752624JiyjYpmD8o_2_2_l.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stretch your wallpaper across two displays.<br><br>We love our dual displays, but we donÂ’t like staring at two instances of the same image all day. Thankfully, Vista lets us stretch our wallpaper across both displays quite easily. This was also possible in XP, but it was not an intuitive process. Keep in mind, however, that stretching an image across two displays obviously requires a picture that is large enough to stretch all the way across both displays, so youÂ’ll need to add up the resolution of both displays and find an image that is of those dimensions.<br><br>Right-click the desktop, select Personalize, and then Desktop Background. Select your image, and then select the middle option for Â“tileÂ” to stretch it across both displays.<br><br></div>
