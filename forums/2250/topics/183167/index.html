Those using wireless especially. Wireless signals can be strong or weak, and sometimes they are so weak that they will be disconnected. Also check for viruses and spywares.<br><br>There's no need to close and open a new one, unless you are having mass chat. For one to one chat, just repair the wireless, then sign in again.<br><br>For those using wired connections, check for spywares and viruses. They may be clogging up the connections to the extent that it may disconnect.<br><br>For Singnet users, there's been a lot of intrusion attacks lately. They are recommended to paste their firewall logs and send to Singnet. For those using ZoneAlarm firewall, go to C:\Windows\Internet Logs\ZALog.txt<br><br>Open up this log and copy the whole thing. For users of other firewall, they have to find them out themselves.<br><br>The website: <a href="http://www.singnet.com.sg/tou/misc/ia_incidentreport.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.singnet.com.sg/tou/misc/ia_incidentreport.asp</a></div>
