I am hoping to sell this used lappie so that I can use the money to buy a 12'' sotec lappie which prob costs less than 1k. (Is this a wise idea?) So now I have 2 options, 1 is to sell this tm and buy a new lappie or just continue to keep and use this lappie at home. Personally I have nv tried selling things online b4 to strangers (oop dun laugh at my suakuness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) and dun really have alot of trust in this kind of online transaction.<br>One thing though, the acer tm i wish to get off has no more warranty. Plus it is heavy-weight for mobile usage. Think veri carefully if u want this lappie.<br></div>

I'm sure u all know that they will sell off this lappie at a much more higher price if I had sold to them.<br>Will discuss with my parents and seek their opinion whether to sell or not. But my guess is that their ans will prob be : Wat, siao arh? few hundred bucks for a laptop bought at 2k plus 1yr plus ago? might as well keep it at home and buy a brand new cheap one better lar.<br><br>One of the posts mentioned abt using this old lappie as a media laptop, add ram wat lar, guess i will consider that.<br><br>And nope, i need 2x 2.9kg lappies for both arms to become muscular. haha, i think now one arm more muscular than the other haha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ok lastly, I wanna ask if intel Pentium M considers better/advanced than intel celeron M or otherwise? Pardon me for being a noob here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Thanks for ur time and attention.<br>Regards<br><br></div></blockquote>its is norm for the buyers to quote a much lower price since they wan to make profits out of it too. that's why i hope u can let it go with buyers who intend to use the hardware on their own. even if you buy a unit and use it for a day, the unit will still be considered as second hand used to another buyer. you get to sell what that can be bought brand new and get back some cash...while the buyers pay lower at the risk of the unit being faulty/ not functioning at tip top condition. u can't convince them the truth and the buyers have to take the chances of the unit working under 99% efficiency.<br><br>if u wan to use it as a media PC why not try it out running for hours first. using a notebook for media function is unlike a desktop and u have to keep it real cool. furthermore you may need more ram, a decent sound output (speaker), and a USB TV tuner/ PCMIA TV reception card. its good if u can add another 512MB but decent ram modules can be had from eBay. a brand new USB TV tuner will at least set u back sgd100 ++ while 2.1 speakers can be had for much less than sgd100. if you intend to record TV programs your hdd MAY be slow and 40gig is not enough unless your notebooks USB ports are high speed and you can transfer them to an external hdd or use your CD-writer to burn them.<br><br>Celeron consumes less power and in this case are preferred in smaller size notebooks.<br><br>my best suggestion is still for you to use the notebook as it is. since you have to even consult your parents when u sell your own stuff i bet you are a student. why not wait up after you start working before getting a new notebook?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiz,<br><br>Troublemaker2005, thx alot for ur valuable input. Yep, since the laptop is still working fine, i will continue using it and buy a new one when I join the workforce in future. Technology changes so fast haha, I had better stick to my current laptop to make the most out of it. Buying a new laptop so soon mean spending more hard-earned money again haha.<br><br>R3SsH|n, wow man, u sold ur xbox. I oso own a xbox but din even think of selling it away cos I can at least still  play with it when i feel bored.<br><br></div>
