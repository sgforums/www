            <div class='col-md body'><p>Android system has been taken into our memory early, many friends favor Smartphone input more energy to concern and discuss. The operating system of mobile Google was just come in, many firms are involved in its ranks. At the same time, Windows phone 7 systems recently has become hot topic. But what are the differences between the different mobile systems? Today is for everyone to collect several typical phones of the different phone system, if you are focused on a new system, so might as well see below, which can allure you?<br><br>Nokia N8 - The Nokia N8 is easily one of the most eagerly anticipated devices on the year. It has the new Symbian^3 OS, a 12-megapixel camera, an HDMI port, huge processing and graphical display power and a massively overhauled UI – basically, it’s meant to be pretty damn good. The Nokia N8, while being something of a departure from Nokia’s usual design, is still very much a ‘Nokia’ device in terms of aesthetics. The handset features a unibody design made from Anodised Aluminium, which gives it a solid, durable, feel in the hand. The Nokia N8 also features a non-removable battery, like the iPhone, and two side slots for both your SIM and microSD cards, which are located on the device’s left side. On the right, there’s a volume rocker, lock switch and the camera activation button. The top of the device features a 3.5mm jack slot, HDMI port and the power button. It’s still very much a Symbian OS, both in terms of the way it looks and feels, it’s just received a massive overhaul and has been dragged kicking-and-screaming into the 21st Century with multiple homescreens, widgets and live tiles.<br><br>Windows Phone 7 - Windows Phone 7 came together in about 12 months, though a hard reset of the OS started about two years ago. When creating Windows Phone 7, the team focused on visual design and a more integrated experience for the user. Interestingly, OEM partners will be able to customize the user experience but won't be able to replace it. In other words, you won't be seeing the likes of HTC Sense on future Windows phones. Microsoft wants the same user experience on all its phones. The design team created Windows Phone 7 on a number of principles, including user typography, elegance and simplicity, authentically digital, motion, and a mobile OS that's clean, light, open, and fast. Windows Phone 7 has a chromeless user interface, meaning you no longer have borders or a Start button. Microsoft stripped everything it believed the user didn't need and only presents the content you want. Microsoft is not talking about multitasking today, though it did say the phones will have the capability to play music in the background while you're working in other apps. The company is also not officially commenting on Flash support, though Adobe announced on Sunday that it is working closely with Microsoft to bring Flash to future Windows phones. However, it most likely won't be ready by the time the phones ship during the holiday season. <br><br>Motorola Droid2 – it don’t have more high technology then Droid X, but get more attention from people, mainly because of it will be running on the newest Android platform. The Motorola Droid 2 has been snapped in the wild and it looks very similar to the first Motorola Droid. The Motorola Droid 2 which is set to come out this month runs a 750 MHz processor with a 3.7 inch touch screen. Internal storage is at 8GB, augmented with the addition of another 8GB on a flash card. Verizon are set to be the first carriers of the Droid 2, but still no word if other carriers will come on board.<br>Samsung Galaxy S - The good news is that this handset will come equipped with Android 2.2 Froyo out of the box. As reported from BGR, the information has come to us courtesy of MobileCrunch. Specs of the GSM-based Galaxy Q include a 3-inch Super AMOLED display screen with multitouch, an 8 megapixel camera with separate 1.3 megapixel camera on the front, a 1 GHz Hummingbird processor and 16GB of internal memory.
