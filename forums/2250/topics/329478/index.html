              <p>Hi everyone, hope someone will be able to answer some of my questions regarding my internet connection at home.</p>
              <p>My contract with Singnet has ended in July and I just came to know about it. I'm currently on the 3mbps plan and paying about $41 per month.</p>
              <p>Do you guys think it is worth doing a re-contract with them and pay $32.90 per month for 24 months?</p>
              <p>If it is a re-contract, I won't be able to downgrade my line to 1mbps plan right?</p>
              <p>Lastly, there's another option for me which is to pay $36.90 per month for the wireless modem. Is it better for me to get a modem outside or just get this wireless? Anyone knows if it is good? Asked this because the previous one which they gave had caused me lots of problem and I had to literally throw it away after the 1 year warranty.</p>
              <p>Hope you guys can enlighten me on these! Thanks.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure how I could advice you, but for me, I do not like being tied down to a contract, thus did not renew the contract after mine ended a few months ago, though I'm still with Singnet right now.</p>
              <p>Regarding the 2Wire Wireless Gateway from Singnet, it's pretty good in my opinion (my sis is using it), but the additional $4 x 24 you pay could get you one from Netgear or D-Link out there as well. It's pretty much a matter of preference here, since to me, 2Wire's products are on par with those of popular brands such as Netgear and D-Link in terms of performance and stability.</p>

              <p>If I'm not mistaken, Singnet only allows you to upgrade, not downgrade. I think you need to pay a price to downgrade. More if your contract is still valid, but since it's no longer valid (seems to me like you're posting this 2 months late?) , the price to pay is lower.</p>
              <p>The modems that Singnet offers are stable, I've never experienced problems with them. The only problem is documentation. They are very poorly documentated on the web. If you lost the manual, good luck to you to re-configure everything...</p>
