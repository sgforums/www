However, you must use the right cable. It is called a crossover cable. It's a little bigger than those telephone cables, called RJ-45 cables. To tell the difference between a crossover cable and straight-through cable, hold the heads side-by-side and compare. If the wiring of the cables are the same, it means that the cables are straight-through. If the wiring is different, then it is a crossover cable.<br><br>Straight-through cable<br><img src="http://www.incentre.net/incentre/images/ethcable568a.gif"><br><br>Crossover cable<br><img src="http://www.incentre.net/incentre/images/ethcablerj45cr.gif"></div>
