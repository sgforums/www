Runs smooth, but i guess it will not be the case if not for my AMD Athlon Dual.<br><br>My friend's cousin got some kind of degree for Windows and MAc in the states, and what i heard from him is that since Vista is built from Server 2003 which is based on the framework and codes of the original Windows, the security glitch is still there. And no one in Microsoft has the nerve to try rewriting millions of lines of codes. So if you are buying Vista do expect the same old irritating problem with XP: always has to do security update, update and update...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>microsoft is cunning when it comes to forcing people to upgrade. for example, they are forcing gamers to upgrade as future new games will most probably only be playable on the new OS. for instance Halo 2, it is only playable on Windows Vista.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
