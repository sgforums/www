              <p>hi i've a laptop, it's window vista and i've set up a user account which is password protected.</p>
              <p>today i lent my laptop to a friend and my friend removed the user account password without letting me know. i didn't even tell my friend what the password was, in fact. i only found out that my friend had removed the password when i switched on my laptop earlier on and realised that it didn't ask for my password at the start. i was quite pissed off and questioned my friend about it, to which my friend said <em>"haha! remove only what. you should be glad that i didn't change the password lor!"</em></p>
              <p>anyone has any idea how my friend had managed to remove my pass word and how do i prevent the user account password from being changed by others so easily? thanks a lot!</p>

              <p>actually i think my friend used the command prompt window to remove the password leh... hm anyway the situation is like this, i keyed in the user account password into the laptop. while in my user account, i lent my friend my laptop and my friend did something to it and removed the password. as long as my friend is in my user account already (since im the one that keyed in the password to let him into my account), he can just changed/removed the user account password easily. so can this method really prevent him from doing so? erm, i hope im making sense here. oops.</p>
