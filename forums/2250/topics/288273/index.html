            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, if you guys are going to buy any gadgets from yahoo auctions, do take note of this guy called Melvin, his number is 92226664. He actually sold me this ipod mini that has a clickwheel not working.<br><br>i gave him the money andh e passed me the goods, however his stuff was not charged. I told him that when i get home i will change a battery and charge it.<br><br>After I opened it up, i noticed that the connecting strip of the clickwheel is coming out and i still went out to change the battery. However the clickwheel is not functioning after charging up!<br><br>So i quickly change another workable clickwheel and it was still no use.<br><br>I called him and told him that his set is faulty. He rejected my advise to have a half refund, since i already changed a clickwheel.<br><br>He even asked his girlfriend to talk to me! He did not know what to do of it, so he consistently gave his phone to his girlfriend to talk to me. And the girlfriend claimed that I bought the ipod to spoil it, and refused to give me a reasonable explanation, claiming that it was of good condition when he passed to me. (his set was already pryed open before).<br><br>If you guys were to trade with this guy called Melvin, do take note of it, just in case this wonderful brainless gigolo uses his girlfriend to talk to you again. Anyway his girlfriend is a fierce talker. She does not give you face when you talk to them peacefully.<br><br>What a lousy deal!</div>
