              <p>For those who haven't seen my earlier posts, I have recently
                  upgraded my computer with a new hard disk drive and a pair of RAM
                  modules. Everything was working fine before the hardware upgrade, just
                  that it was a little slow and I thought it would be a good time to do
                  an upgrade and a Windows re-installation. It seems not after all.</p>
              <p>I need help in
                  identifying the source(s) of all these issues so I can send the faulty
                  component(s) for RMA or exchange. But in any of the cases below, if you
                  think it could be caused by software (anti-virus, firewall etc), please
                  let me know. I'm using Kaspersky AV 7 and Comodo Personal Firewall
                  (coincidentally abbreiviated as CPF) 3.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. At random
                  times, usually after a system shutdown, the system won't boot up (no
                  beep, no display output, disk activity lasted a few seconds before
                  stopping) unless I repeatedly power up and power down the system a few
                  times. From Google, it was said that this could be due to an
                  insufficient power supply or a bad HDD. Which is more likely to be
                  happening? I have listed my specs below.</p>
              <p>CPU: Intel E2200<br>Mobo: GA-965P-DS3<br>RAM: 2x DDR-800 1GB<br>HDD: Hitachi SATA 500 GB, 16 MB cache<br>Optical drive: LG IDE 18x DVD-RW<br>Graphic card: Asus X1900XT 256MB<br>PSU: Enhance 460W</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. File transfers become very slow on random occassions. When it
                  happens on a folder move (aka cut-and-paste), the folder and one single
                  file will be created on the destination folder, but this file is
                  inaccessible while the original one at the source folder remains there
                  (remember, this is not a file copy but a file move).</p>
              <p>After
                  that, it either takes a damn long time before a "Preparing to move..."
                  dialog window appears, or that window doesn't appear at all with both
                  windows displaying the list of files and folders for the source and
                  destination becoming "Not Responding". The disk activity LED light on
                  the casing only lit up occasionally, meaning that the HDD is not "busy"
                  at all. I can't help but to wonder wtf is actually going on within the
                  drive.</p>
              <p>When the files are not moved and I try to shutdown the
                  system, a popup window will appear and warn me that Windows is busy
                  doing something.</p>
              <p>So, could the cause simply be the HDD? I was
                  actually thinking the culprit is my motherboard,  because I have a
                  very similar issue with the optical drive as well (see #3).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Unable to read discs at random (again) times. A few nights ago,
                  my second sis wanted to watch Death Note: The Last Note, so I inserted
                  the disc which I burned the movie on, and double-clicked on the drive.
                  It showed me this error instead:</p>
              <p>"The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error."</p>
              <p>Right-clicking
                  and selecting Explore gave me the same error as well. I was quite
                  fed-up with the computer, and my sis ended up watching it on
                  Crunchyroll instead.</p>
              <p>Then just yesterday morning, I was
                  desperately trying to install a printer to print out a medical form
                  from TP's site. After I popped in the disc that came along with the
                  printer, I tried to access it but nothing happened. The My Computer
                  window became "Not Responding" instead and I just kept waiting until I
                  couldn't be any more patient and did a restart.</p>
              <p>Issue #1 came
                  back and this time, for some weird reason, the LED light on the optical
                  drive kept blinking every time I power the system up, even though I
                  have set the first boot device to be the HDD. And it just won't boot, while the LED light remained blinking. What is my computer thinking
                  exactly?
                  Pressing the eject button wouldn't work as well until I tried to do so
                  between the time the power button is pressed and the time the LED light
                  starts to blink. After the disc was out, the system finally booted up,
                  and I then decided to Google and download the driver online instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hardware
                  experts, if you can tell what is going on within my computer, please
                  cast your verdicts, and I shall exile the guilty ones back to their
                  distributors for RMA or exchange as soon as possible. And if any more info is needed, just post back and let me know.</p>

              <p>Well, for the powering up issue, you can check that the battery is properly inserted, by kicking your case hard a few times, which the better alternative is to open up to see your battery. After kicking your case a few times, check that all the wires are connected properly....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From what i see, the 460w seems to be enough</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Test the Power supply</p>
              <p>remove the grphic card, and also remove the power plug that is plugged into ur grphic card(if im nt wrong, the one u using is plugged into a PCIx16, and needs a power?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If after removing the graphic card and u still can't power up, it might be the HDD, since the Power supply gt enough power...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>at random times it would not boot up....maybe is the HDD already.... download speedfan(freeware), open the program, on the top there is a lot of tabs, click on S.M.A.R.T, then select ur HD from the dropdown box, click the "?" on the right to see wad everything means, and also look at the performance/fitness level... or click the 'perform an indepth anal-ysis on the HDD</p>

              <p>File transfer slow.....have a feeling it is the HDD liao....</p>

              <p>BTW, ur mobo may also be the culprit...if possible test with some other HDD if u have....</p>

              <p>Issue 1 - 460W PSU may seem enough. But no harm adding more.</p>
              <p>Issue 2 - Good ole Windows. If you ever crash it or if it ever crashes, the first few times it starts up, it will give problems.</p>
              <p>Issue 3 - The last I had this issue, it's because the darn optical drive spoilt, not motherboard. And I wasted a good few hundred on replacing one. -_-</p>
              <p>And almost all the cases I had had a spoilt optical drive rather than spoilt motherboard. I've learn this hard, I never replace mobo unless nothing works. So far, other than the bad lesson, such issues have been fixed successfully without an expensive mobo replacement.</p>
              <p>I suggest you replace the optical drive first, before replacing the mobo. If you suspect HDD problem, backup your files, install Linux over it. Copy over some big files and see if the same issue occurs. Most likely if it hangs for Linux, your HDD is facing problems.</p>
              <p>Although Linux is technically different from Windows, if copying and pasting can fail in Linux, you can guarantee that your HDD is nearly gone case. Backup while it's working.</p>
              <p>If Linux has got no issues with moving files, it would be Windows. It's not uncommon for Windows installation to fail <strong>WITHOUT</strong> warnings. I had a few... and went ahead to reinstall again. Which solves it fine.</p>
              <p>And the HDD LED light is a pretty bad indicator for Windows. If Windows is ever stuck without warnings, nothing in the world will know until something tries to end it. In this case, a rebooting or shutting down will produce that error that you experienced.</p>

              <p>And the HDD LED light is a pretty bad indicator for Windows. If Windows is ever stuck without warnings, nothing in the world will know until something tries to end it. In this case, a rebooting or shutting down will produce that error that you experienced.</p>

              <p>Hmm...I didn't think the problems could be caused by the optical drive before. In fact, I forgot to mention that it was detached from the motherboard before the upgrade because my IDE cable was not long enough to connect both my old IDE HDD and it. Maybe it's the sources of all these issues after all. I'll try removing it along with Pillow's suggestions and see how it goes once I'm free from work and games.</p>

The place to RMA my current graphics card (Ban Leong) is so ulu and hard to locate, I had to take a taxi and walked for 10 - 15 mins on the previous occassion.

              <p>That happened to my laptop. But after a month, by not doing anything at all, my laptop became all right by itself when I put back the optical drive.</p>
              <p>Then I realised it wasn't the optical drive at fault (the only difference heh heh), cuz I tested it on my friend's IBM laptop. I was thinking that it might be the driver's problem for my case.</p>
              <p>Anyway, yup, just try unplugging the optical drive and see if it helps in all 3 issues. In my case, it just displayed Internal Power Error and refused to start up...</p>
