Minnear said that he first smelled fire at about 5am but after checking the house, returned to bed. About 45 minutes later, he re-awoke and found his couch engulfed on fire.<br><br>In 20 minutes the fire destroyed the house leaving the family without a bean. So far the State Fire Marshal's Office in South Venice, Florida has not decided what caused the fire.<br><br>Assistant Fire Chief Paul Dezzi, said there had been a computer on the couch but did not know if that caused it.<br><br>Minnear bought the Latitude D500 notebook two years ago and had heard about the Dell battery recall, but said he hadn't had a chance to act on it.<br><br><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33847" rel="nofollow">http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33847</a><br><br><strong>Dell laptop linked to house fire</strong><br><br>Louisa Hearn<br>August 22, 2006<br><br>According to the Florida Herald-Tribune newspaper, home-owner, Louis Minnear, 36, was "convinced" the fire was started by the computer battery in his wife's Dell laptop that was sitting on papers on the family's sofa.<br><br>In just 20 minutes the blaze caused severe damage leaving the house uninhabitable, and the family lost almost all of its possessions.<br><br>The State Fire Marshal's Office in South Venice, Florida said it had yet not ruled on the cause of last week's fire.<br><br>Assistant Fire Chief Paul Dezzi, said he was aware there was a computer on the couch, but told the Herald-Tribune: "None of us know what the cause is."<br><br>The fire comes a week after Dell announced a safety recall of 4.1 million notebook computer batteries manufactured by Sony that were sold between April 2004 and July 18 of this year.<br><br>"Under rare conditions, it is possible for these batteries to overheat, which could cause a risk of fire," Dell warned last week.<br><br>Mr Minnear said he had bought the Latitude D500 notebook two years ago, which is one of the models on the list with potential battery problems. He told the Herald-Tribune he had heard about the Dell battery recall, but hadn't had a chance to act on it.<br><br>He said he first smelled fire at about 5am but after checking the house, returned to bed. About 45 minutes later, he re-awoke and found his couch engulfed in flames.<br><br>Dell said last week it had been investigating a few reports of notebooks overheating or catching fire, and the most well-known case happened in Osaka, Japan two months ago when a laptop computer was photographed as it burst into flames.<br><br>A number of other reports of laptop fires have also been widely circulated on online forums and news sites in recent weeks, including that of an Arizona man who claimed that sparks from his laptop computer ignited a box of ammunition that caused his truck to explode in the heart of the Mojave Desert.<br><br>The report on CBS11 news site claims that Thomas Forqueran's 1966 vintage Ford pick-up was completely destroyed soon after a Dell laptop computer was placed in the glove box.<br><br>None of the incidents reported to date have resulted in injury or death.<br><br><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/biztech/dell-laptop-linked-to-house-fire/2006/08/22/1156012527870.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theage.com.au/news/biztech/dell-laptop-linked-to-house-fire/2006/08/22/1156012527870.html</a><br><br><img src="http://imgsrv.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=SH&amp;Date=20060818&amp;Category=NEWS&amp;ArtNo=608180446&amp;Ref=AR&amp;MaxW=580&amp;title=1"><br><br><strong>Man blames Dell laptop for house fire</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060818/NEWS/608180446/-1/Help0530" rel="nofollow">http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060818/NEWS/608180446/-1/Help0530</a><br><br><strong>Sorry folks, not i biased against Dell, but its in the news again. </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

When the Allens came in to see how it was doing, the machine blew up.<br><br>"There are six batteries inside a compartment, and they were shooting out like fireworks, like rockets," Shaun Allen, 39, told the paper. "They even bounced off the ceiling, they went up that high."<br><br>The exploding batteries set fire to the sofa and the carpet, the paper reports.<br><br>Curiously, the computer had not been bought from Dell but from an unnamed shop in Coventry a year ago. Mr Allen said he paid Â£500 for the machine. Dell told the paper it believes the battery that burned was not one supplied by the company, but a third-party product. However, it said it would give the Allen's a new machine as a gesture of goodwill.<br><br>Last month, Dell formally requested 4.1m customers around the world return batteries shipped with its notebooks sold between 1 April 2004 and 18 July 2006. The recalled lithium-ion batteries were made by Sony, Dell said. A week later, Apple also insituted a recall of batteries manufactured by Sony.<br><br>Separately, the Japanese giant today said it was appoint the head of its TV division, Makoto Kogure, to take charge of the company's product quality and safety assurance efforts, a role that will oversee firm's battery manufacturing. However, the company was keen to stress the move was not solely the result of the Dell and Apple recalls.<br><br><a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/09/01/dell_laptop_combustion_uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/09/01/dell_laptop_combustion_uk/</a><br><br><strong>CRASH, BANG!  </strong><br><br>BY SHIRLEY ELSBY<br><br>10:15 - 31 August 2006<br><br>A family today revealed how they narrowly escaped injury when a laptop computer exploded in their home.<br><br>The incident, at a house in Eskdale Road, Hinckley, sent small batteries from the device around the room, setting fire to carpets and a settee.<br><br>The family of six, including a 12-year-old boy who had suffered a scalding accident a few days previously, were terrified.<br><br>Computer manufacturer Dell recently recalled a range of their laptops after overheating incidents.<br><br>Dad Shaun Allen, 39, said the drama experienced by him, his wife, Lyndsey, 29, and their children Nicholas, 12, Joshua, 10, Sophie, six, and Jacob, two, happened weeks before the recall. The offending laptop was a Dell Latitude C600 bought from a shop in Coventry, about a year before for about Â£500.<br><br>Nicholas had been trying to play a game on it but had problems with it.<br><br>Mrs Allen then put it on charge on a table while it loaded the game, and all the family went outside.<br><br>Mr Allen said: "As we all decided to go back in, the laptop exploded.<br><br>"There are six batteries inside a compartment, and they were shooting out like fireworks, like rockets.<br><br>"They even bounced off the ceiling, they went up that high.<br><br>"I tried to extinguish the laptop and cover it over with a towel. I tried to carry it outside, but it was still exploding and I let go of it.<br><br>"As I dropped it, more batteries came out like fireworks. A couple of them hit the ceiling then bounced on the floor. Another one hit the ceiling and set fire to the carpet. My wife was jumping on it to put it out.<br><br>!I chucked the laptop outside and went in to put the settee out as that was burning, too."<br><br>Helped by a neighbour who is a police officer, Mr and Mrs Allen were able to extinguish the flames themselves.<br><br>They said the incident had frightened them all, especially Nicholas, who had spent the previous week being treated at Nottingham City Hospital after being scalded by a kettle of boiling water on holiday on July 18.<br><br>He had been allowed home on July 24 and the explosion took place on the following day.<br><br>The family's insurance claim has now been settled, enabling Mr and Mrs Allen to talk to the Mercury about the incident.<br><br>Dell recently recalled various makes of computer, saying that Dell branded batteries with cells manufactured by Sony could, under rare conditions, overheat.<br><br>An investigator examined the Allens' laptop.<br><br><strong>A Dell spokesman said that although they believed the battery which exploded was not the original supplied by Dell, the company was supplying a new laptop as a gesture of goodwill for the family's co-operation with the investigation.</strong><br><br>Good news is that i think Dell service is getting better, at least they supply a new laptop.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is bad for Dell, every headlines starts with "Dell laptops explode/catch fire... AGAIN" when their batteries are supplied by Sony. Even though its partly Dell's fault, but everyone will blame it totally on Dell instead, with only the techies who surf tech news sites understand that Sony should be responsible for it as well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
