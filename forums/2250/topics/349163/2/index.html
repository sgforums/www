              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Btw, I have some questions for those of you working in computer-related fields:<br> <br> I'm at age 25 yrs now and even if I complete that Diploma in InfoComm
              Technology from PSB Academy, I'll be 27 yrs by the time I graduate.<br> <br> At 27 years, I was thinking it would be near-impossible to find any IT
              job, right (further more, I've no working experience in IT)?<br> Because it's just a basic diploma, not even advanced diploma.<br> And companies would rather hire a young poly grad with a local poly cert, obviously.<br> <br> So, all the odds are against me. Unless maybe I study all the way to
              bachelor degree and by then, I'll be like 31 yrs old, then with a bach
              degree, I'll settle for a lower-paying entry-level IT job?<br> <br> I'm also looking at an alternate path, which is learning and
              specializing in web programming and building up my portfolio, then find
              a job as web programmer.<br> I'm pretty a lot of companies will hire a guy with no certs but a good
              portfolio compared to a guy with some certs but no portfolios?<br> <br> This way, I don't need to waste years of time getting diploma / degree which would hardly get me a job.<br> <br> Pls advise! I feel so lost and contradicted now.</span></p>

              <p>First of all,this is an IMPORTANT news so read this clearly.If you want to study for an Diploma related to Web Programming, Diploma in Engineering Informatics from Nanyang Polytechnic is the best choice you can get.I would list down the point in the advantage and the disadvantage and you can weight them yourself :<br><br>Advantage :<br><br>1) Firstly nowaday, except for the final years examaination, most Practical test are "open-booked".In fact there is a saying in Nanyang Polytechnic that "Unless you tried very hard to fail, then you will fail".However if you don't understand a thing in the lesson, even when you bring an encyclopedia it a waste of time.<br><br>2) If you are not the type who can memorized fact and scored in written examination, you can still survived by scoring well for the quiz, assignment and Project to pass your module.<br><br>3) Finally, do you know that it is VERY CHEAP To study in NYP? This year 2009, for 6 months,or 1 semester, it only cost about S$616.32 and 1 year is S$1283.44.This is due to the WDA subsidy and if you apply and is successfully accept which is usually no problem,then this the best budget you can find for your education.<br><br>4) For the benefit of those who are NTC-2 Holder, you can apply as well as they will accept you regardless of GPA Point.<br><br>The disadvantage :<br><br>1) It is long, need 4 years to complete part-time.<br><br>2) Don't expect that if you have any doubt, you can still back after 9:30 p.m to consult your teacher as all the PC in the lab will be closed actually at 9:30 P.M.<br><br>3) If you are "O" level, you need 1-7 Grade for English, for Science and Mathematics it is 1-6 Point.If you are not at this category, the only choice is Ngee Ann Poly whereby you have to pay $20 to take an enterance test for Part-Time diploma, but mind you, I heard that currently they dropped the part-time for IT diploma due to poor respond.<br><br>For more info : http://info.nyp.edu.sg/ptd/EI/index.htm<br><br>If you are looking for the Commerical IT Training type, I will recommend you Excom Education Singapore. This company has just been set up not long and they offer IT training Package like Microsoft Certified Application Developer (MCAD),<br>Novell SUSE Linux Certification Training, CCNA and many more.Their part-time training can take as long as 9 Months depend which you choose (That the fastest you can find).Most important, they also offered IT Express which is an program that "guaranteed" can help you to find an IT job after their training within 2-3 Months.The only set-back is that their training package is "quite expensive", depend on which training package you choose, it can reach up to $10000.They even offered education loan from Citibank to help 'finanical difficulty" student.Their link : http://www.excom.com.sg</p>
              <p>Finally another "better" option, have you thought of pursue an America online/distance learning Bachelor degree from Accredited Universities if you want an degree and don't like the above 2 choice ? The university offered online degree must be "recognised" by these unaccredited degree, the 7 reliable bodies are:</p>
              <p>1. Middle State Association of colleges and Schools<br>2. New England Association of Schools and Colleges<br>3. North Central Association of Schools and Colleges<br>4. Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges<br>5. Southern Association of Colleges and Schools<br>6. Western Association of Schools and Colleges<br>7. Distance Education and Training Council (for Universities that only offers distance learning programs)<br><br>You can find out more on : http://www.petersons.com/ .You can also go to an local USA Education development company called America Academic Alliance in Sunshine Plaza,Singapore to apply for distance learning degree : http://www.americanacademicalliance.com/<br><br>Correct me "Old Birds" if I am wrong that an accredited online degree cannot help you to find a better career and go for further study.Hopely all these suggestion can help you to secure your "bright" future.Cheer!</p>
