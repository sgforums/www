            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I am facing a problem now. I canÂ’t set my MIDI music playback to the Microsoft GS Wavetable. This is what I have done, I use the drop down list to select it, and also untick the Use only default devices box and after I click Â‘ApplyÂ’ and OKÂ’, when I reopen the Sounds and Audio Devices, nothing will be selected, the box will be ticked again. I tried to reinstall the Soundmax drivers but the same problems occur. Also, my volume icon canÂ’t be show although I have tick the box to place it in the taskbar.<br><br>There are sound when I play mp3 or music files. But there is no sound when I went to youtube to play the videos. Have try on a laptop to play the same youtube video and there is sound from the video, so canÂ’t be the videos problem. Also the sound scheme canÂ’t be play at all, the play button is unclickable.<br><br>I have searched over the net but I canÂ’t find a solution to my problem. Was wondering if any people here experience the same problem before? I suspect the registry is corrupted at some areas, but I did not edit anything. Is it possible that some programs prevent the changing of the options?  If there is no solution, my last resort is to reinstall XP again.<br><br>Thanks<br></div>

Are you able to access Volume Control?<br>2. Does it only apply to Youtube videos?<br>3. Were you using the default Windows Theme with the sound scheme before all these happened?</div>

I am able to access Volume Control, its only the that whenever I have choosen the default midi devices and appiled it, when I reaccess volume control, it will show that no midi devices is selected.<br><br>2. I have only test on youtube website. Have test using on other pc to view the same video and there is sound. I have search ard youtube to see if there are any option to change but nope could be found.<br><br>3. No problem with that, cos when Xp is booting into windows, there will be the sound, but now there isn't.<br><br>Just a note, a few weeks back, I have reinstall windows xp as the hdd was unable to boot up. Kept showing Bsod on some error. When reinstalling, I did not format the hdd, meaning I choose the option to keep intact the system files. Everything was fine for a few days.<br><br>I suspect its either some programs is config to stop the changing of midi devices or somewhere the windows regisitry is corrupted. The 1st thought is highly impossible, as I never heard it before yet. I have try reinstalling the on board sound card drivers(soundmax) , but it is still the same<br><br>PS: the pc is my gf de.</div>
