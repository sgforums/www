              <p>Hello, guy.</p>
              <p>Hope that i can give my opinion about your topic, perhaps this nifty one can give you some help, actually i also did this by using some audio recording programs, the one combines with two main functions: Burning and recording. That's to say you need record online songs from youtube and then burning to an audio CD.</p>

              <p>    I am not sure the many other methods (like Browser plugins) out there that may suit you more,  but since I do not install any plugins,  I suggest this method:</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>Open the website, :&gt;  <strong>www.keepvid.com</strong></li>
              <li>Copy your Youtube address (and exclude whatever it is after the "<strong>&amp;</strong>" sign) and paste it into the blank space in www.keepvid.com</li>
              <li>Click "download"</li>
              <li>Click "Run" or "Allow" whenever a dialog-box appears saying whether do you want to authorise your computer to run the application</li>
              <li>After the process,  the website will show many options, including "<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">&gt;&gt; Download MP4 &lt;&lt;</span></strong>"   and  "<strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">&gt;&gt; Download MP3 &lt;&lt;</span></strong>".   Choose the mp3 that you need (i choose "mp3" if you want songs only,  not the video)</li>
              <li>Click "Run this time" or "Run" whenever a dialog-box appears saying whether do you want to authorise your computer to run the application</li>
              <li>You can click the "<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">&gt;&gt; Download MP3 &lt;&lt;</span></strong>" now to download and save your mp3 onto your computer now  (don't anyhow click "Save",  choose a appropriate folder first,  preferably onto the desktop if you want to do a quick one)</li>
              <li>After you downloaded several songs that way,  you would want to start burning them onto a CD,   so here I use <strong>iTunes</strong> to do my stuffs,   although I have many other programs,  this is the one I prefer</li>
              <li>If you don't have iTunes you can go to <strong>http://www.apple.com/itunes/</strong> to download iTunes</li>
              <li>In ITunes, pull the MP3s that you have converted into the Main empty space</li>
              <li>Create a new playlist by going to "<strong>File</strong>" menu and click "<strong>New Playlist</strong>"</li>
              <li>Rename the new playlist to whatever you want</li>
              <li>Go back to the Main empty space window and select those relevant songs that you want,  and hold down your mouse and pull them into your new playlist</li>
              <li>After you finish with that, right-click mouse on your new playlist on the left and select "<strong>Burn Playlist to Disc</strong>"</li>
              <li>When the dialog box pops-up, click "<strong>Audio CD</strong>" and "<strong>Gap Between Songs</strong>" according to your relevant needs,  and insert an empty new CD upon prompting,  and your job is done.    (<em>only choose "MP3 CD" if you do not want the CD to be played on most normal CD players</em>)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Ok, if iTunes cannot try again,  now you try <strong>RealPlayer</strong>.   (I only recommend programs to you that are Free,  so it should be ok for you)</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>Follow the mp3 conversion as above for your songs.</li>
              <li>Go to <strong>http://sg.real.com/?mode=rp</strong> and download the Realplayer.</li>
              <li>Look for a <strong>Burn/Transfer</strong> tab on top,  if no have, then go to <strong>View</strong> menu, select <strong>Burn/Transfer</strong>.</li>
              <li>Go to left side panel, click "<strong>(1) Select CD Type</strong>",  choose "<strong>Audio CD</strong>" that can be played on most CD players   (<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">only choose "MP3 CD" if you are very sure you only want to play it on computers,  or only on MP3-enabled CD players</span></em>)</li>
              <li>Go to left side panel, click "<strong>(2) Add Tracks from My Library</strong>",  choose the folder where you placed your songs,  and confirm.  Pull those songs from "<strong>Clip Name</strong>" window into the right-hand side empty panel,  and rearrange the song order according to your needs.</li>
              <li>Go to left side panel, click "<strong>(3) Edit Options</strong>",  select some of the features that you like ,  example "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2-second gap between tracks</span>" or "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Make volume equal across all tracks</span>" or "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Write CD information text to your CD</span>"  to customise to your best experience.</li>
              <li>Click "<strong>Burn Your CD</strong>" button and insert an empty blank new CD, and your job is done.</li>

              <p>Correct.  So do not burn into a CD-RW which is not user-compatible in all types of players.</p>
              <p>Choose "Audio CD" so that it can be played in all CD players.  And buy CD-ROM for burning,  not CD-RW if possible.</p>
              <p>You mean you have completed burning?</p>

              <p>The CD RW is 700MB and my mp3 song properties show the song is 1.401KB, 1.36MB. I am not sure if my mp3 is too big and can only save 1 song. I tried to burn another song but it prompted me to erase the 1st song before I can proceed.</p>

              <p>The CD RW is 700MB and my mp3 song properties show the song is
              1.401KB, 1.36MB. I am not sure if my mp3 is too big and can only
              save 1 song. I tried to burn another song but it prompted me to
              erase the 1st song before I can proceed.</p>

              <p>Ok, so you can convert songs liao.</p>
              <p>Maybe CD-RW can one lah,  it is just that for CD-ROM is confirm 100% can,  so that's why I suggest CD-ROM.</p>
              <p>It is <strong>not</strong> the size of your song that your CD-Player cannot play.  It<strong> </strong>should be because you did not burn it in an <strong>Audio CD</strong> format thus you cannot play it on your CD-Player.</p>
              <p>Also, if you closed the session (or sealed the session) after burning CDs, you will not be able to burn any more songs into a CD again.  You must confirm everything that you want to burn,  and you cannot do any changes to it again (example, in a CD-ROM, you cannot delete anything, cannot rename anything, cannot add a new file)</p>
              <p>Therefore, whether you use iTunes or Realplayer,  you must do it properly in order of the songs that you want,  before you click "<strong>Burn</strong>".   Treat this piece of CD-RW that you burn as an experience lah.</p>
              <p>An <strong>Audio CD</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not calculate it's size by the file size</span> of your songs (eg. 1.36MB) ;  an <strong>Audio CD</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">calculates by the length of a song</span> that can be fitted into a Audio CD.  <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The original file-size of your MP3s does not matter at all</span></strong>.  Therefore, an Audio CD can keep about 80 minutes of songs.</p>

              <p>I cannot really advise you on CD-RW as I have never tried to burn an <strong>Audio CD</strong> onto a CD-RW before,   I have only burned songs on CD-ROM in <strong>Audio CD</strong> format,  which I know confirm can play one.</p>
              <p>Posting here is better than email lah,  because everyone of the internet will benefit from our exchanges.  Some more people also can advise you here on more types of burning tips.  I do not declare that I have the best method,  therefore it is good to keep this as an open topic for discussion.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">just bought a packet of 50 CD-Rs each 700mb. managed to burn 1 song (size on disk  2.00 KB , 2,048 bytes) and can hear in CD player.

              <p class="MsoNormal">If so, isn't it only can burn 1 song PER CD-R ? If so, no wonder they sell in packet of 50, 100 pieces. Pls advise. Thanks.</p>

              <p><strong>Congratulations to you for successfully burning one Audio CD !</strong></p>
              <p>However, a piece of Audio CD can burn as long as 80 minutes of songs in total.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the problem might be,  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you did not pull about 15 to 17 songs into iTunes or Realplayer before you burn</span>.   I think you just only pulled ONE song into iTunes or Realplayer,  and you started burning.</p>
              <p>This closes the CD session (or seals the CD session),  and I have told you in my previous post that you cannot add or edit your CD-ROM after you burn.  So now, please try to convert more songs first,  and pull into iTunes playlist or Realplayer.  A normal CD-ROM can contain about 16 to 18 pop songs.  You can see the total time in iTunes or Realplayer, make sure it is below 80 minutes,  can already.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></p>
              <p>You must pull 16 to 18 songs (or sometimes even 20 songs or 22 songs are possible) into iTunes playlist or Realplayer or any other burning program,  before you click "<strong>Burn</strong>".  [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Means,  prepare all your songs before you burn,   cannot burn one by one,   must burn altogether at once</span>]</p>
              <p>If you already "<strong>Burn</strong>" one song,  you will not be able to more 2nd time.</p>
