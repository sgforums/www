            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Power 6 pegged for 5GHz+ </strong><br><br>IBM clock ticking faster<br><br>By Martin Veitch: Friday 29 December 2006, 17:51<br><br>INTERESTING sleuthing over at news.com where Stephen Shankland has been peering at plans for the International Solid State Circuits Conference in February. The scoop: IBMÂ’s Power6 is now expected to ship with over 5GHz clock speeds.<br>As Shankland has said, Power6 had been pegged in the 4-5GHz range but documents now suggest numbers north of 5GHz. Of course, we all know clock speeds are far from being the be-all and end-all of processor performance but the Power architecture has taken plenty of knocks in the past for not keeping up, most notably from Steve Jobs. Way back in 2003, Jobs promised hard-core Apple folks that the IBM chips would be at 3GHz within 12 months. The failure to hit that spot is seen by some as a contributory factor to the eventual Intel switch.<br><br><strong>A peek at faster Power6, Cell chips</strong><br><br><strong>At a chip show, IBM to tout 5GHz-topping Power6 and next-gen 6GHz Cell. Intel to detail a 4GHz, 80-core prototype. </strong><br><br>By Stephen Shankland<br>Staff Writer, CNET News.com<br><br>Published: December 29, 2006, 8:14 AM PST<br><br><strong>Judging by details revealed in a chip conference agenda, the clock frequency race isn't over yet. </strong><br><br>IBM's Power6 processor will be able to exceed 5 gigahertz in a high-performance mode, and the second-generation Cell Broadband Engine processor from IBM, Sony and Toshiba will run at 6GHz, according to the program for the International Solid State Circuits Conference that begins February 11 in San Francisco.<br><br>Chipmakers have run into problems increasing chip clock speed--essentially an electronic heartbeat that synchronizes operations in a processor--because higher frequencies have led to unmanageable power consumption and waste heat.<br><br>To compensate, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have turned instead to the addition of multiple processing cores on each slice of silicon. That's effective when computers are juggling numerous tasks at the same time, but increasing the clock speed means an individual task can run faster.<br><br>The first-generation Cell Broadband Engine chip, co-developed by IBM, Sony, and Toshiba, has just appeared in Sony's PlayStation 3 game console and can run at 4GHz. The second-generation chip will run at 6GHz, according to the ISSCC program. In addition, the new chip will have a dual power supply that increases memory performance--a major bottleneck in computer designs today.<br><br>For servers, IBM has said its Power6 processor, due to ship in servers in 2007, will run between 4GHz and 5GHz. But in the ISSCC program, Big Blue said the chip's clock will tick at a rate "over 5GHz in high-performance applications." In addition, the chip "consumes under 100 watts in power-sensitive applications," a power range comparable to mainstream 95-watt AMD Opteron chips and 80-watt Intel Xeon chips.<br><br>Power6 has 700 million transistors and measures 341 square millimeters, according to the program. The smaller that a chip's surface area is, the more that can be carved out of a single silicon wafer, reducing per-chip manufacturing costs and therefore making a computer more competitive. Power6, like the second-generation Cell, is built with a manufacturing process with 65-nanometer circuitry elements, letting more electronics be squeezed onto a given surface area.<br><br>Intel isn't standing idly by, though. In September, Intel showed a glimpse of a prototype chip with 80 cores that can perform a trillion mathematical calculations per second. At ISSCC, the company will shed more details on the design, including an updated speed measurement of 1.28 trillion calculations per second.<br><br>The chip measures 275 square millimeters--smaller than the 303-square-millimeter area indicated in September--and runs at 4GHz, according to the program. The chip, which Intel describes as a "network-on-chip architecture," has 100 million transistors and dissipates 98 watts of waste heat. Intel called each core a tile and said each has network switch features to route packets of data.<br><br>"It was designed as a research tool to test interconnect strategies for many-core processors," Intel spokeswoman Erica Fields said. Research goals for the project included testing new chip design methods and investigating "how to move terabytes of data rapidly between cores on-chip and between the cores and memory." She added that the prototype can't run conventional software for Intel chips.<br><br></div>
