            <div class='col-md body'><strong>S'pore slips to No 13 in e-readiness rankings</strong><br><br>By Winston Chai - 01 May 2006<br>The Business Times<br><br>AS other countries ramp up efforts to drive Internet and wireless adoption, mature markets like Singapore have slipped in an annual ranking of the world's most technology-savvy nations.<br><br>Singapore, which took 11th spot last year, dropped two places to No 13 in a study jointly undertaken by IBM and the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).<br><br>Published last Thursday, the survey seeks to measure the so-called e-readiness of a country by assessing how its government, businesses and consumers use IT to their benefit.<br><br>According to the EIU, various factors are taken into account, such as a nation's connectivity and technology infrastructure, legal and business environment, as well as the availability of e-services.<br><br>The study revealed that Singapore's dip in placing is synonymous with the downward spiral witnessed by the Asia-Pacific region as a whole.<br><br>The exceptions are Japan and South Korea, retaining the 21st and 18th spots respectively, and Australia and New Zealand, which moved up a few notches.<br><br>'This (the downward movement) owes less to a lack of digital progress in Asia than to the comparatively larger growth steps taken in other regions,' the EIU said in its report.<br><br>North America and Western Europe were singled out as the two regions that have fared well when it comes to translating infocomm investments into economic returns.<br><br>A key factor in Europe's favour this year is that businesses there are increasingly transacting with their governments over the Internet, with some countries like Denmark even making the requirement compulsory.<br><br>As a result, European countries took six of the top ten spots in this year's EIU rankings, with the US hanging on to second place.<br><br>In addition, the survey showed that broadband penetration, which used to be a key attribute of e-readiness forerunners, is now becoming less of a differentiating factor.<br><br>'North Asian leaders had stolen a jump on other OECD countries with a rapid acceleration of broadband adoption. Over the past two years, however, broadband growth rates in the likes of South Korea and Japan have stabilised, while other e-readiness leaders such as Norway and Switzerland have made up ground,' the EIU report said.<br><br>'Broadband connectivity is becoming less of a distinction among e-readiness leaders, and other criteria - such as innovation, information security and governments' commitment to digital development - have emerged as more telling differentiators.'<br><br>Australia and Hong Kong were the only two countries in Asia to make the EIU's top 10 list. And while Hong Kong and Singapore were on par in areas like e-services and technical workforce skills, the former stood out across several heavily-weighted criteria in the study, Denis McCauley, the EIU's director of global technology research, told BizIT.<br><br>These include broadband penetration, the traditional legal framework, as well as laws covering the Internet, he said.</div>
