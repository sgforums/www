              <p>Anyone knows how to track other's IP address to their home address? Is it illegal?</p>
              <p>Is there a way to track other's IP address from emails, IRC, MSN, blogs or whatsoever?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another last question, is the IP address in IRC of the user the same as their home one? If it is different, is there a way to find out the real home IP address?</p>
              <p>Thanks for the help. Im not trying to find out people's address, but others say they have a way to do it. I want to know of the ways to prevent people from spying me.</p>

              <p>It's not illegal to track, but the methods used are obviously illegal.</p>
              <p>To track IP addresses via email addresses, set your email to show headers.</p>
              <p>MSN - Your famous netstat</p>
              <p>Blogs - Unless you own your own domain or you host your blog on a sub-domain. As long as you can download the blog software, upload it to somewhere and get it hosted, you just need to run some scripts and get the details. Examples of such blogs are Wordpress and Movable Type.</p>
              <p>Kindly note that it's not possible for Blogspot users to do that. For Blogspot users, there are free stats tools around which collect data, but the easiest way to fool them is to disable JavaScript.</p>
              <p>IRC - I'm not familiar with them, but IRC itself is quite a big hole. Users are known to be able to dig out history as far back as 1995. Explore and you'll know.</p>
              <p>Through any other methods - yes, but all are illegal. It involves exploiting a machine or program to reveal details. Try joining security mail lists, you will find a couple posted. Mozilla mailing list is very open, and is one of the most exploited programs around.</p>
              <p>Your home IP address (the 192.168.x.x range or the 10.0.x.x range or 172.0.x.x range) shouldn't be exposed to outsiders unless the router/switch/hub is badly configured.</p>

              <p>Erm, it's possible to trace right to the door step. The police have the tools, otherwise that stupid fake bomb message poster wouldn't have been caught. While it's easy to have ISP cooperation and trace, but it's not fool proof. In that case, the bugger was using somebody's else network to post the message. Trace to an innocent person's house, but evidence showed that she is innocent.</p>

              <p>Hmm... lots of confusing replies here.</p>
              <p>Let's be very clear what can and cannot be done.</p>
              <p>The only way to determine the location of an IP address is to do a whois lookup. This whois lookup will tell you who the IP address range is registered to.</p>
              <p>Let's take an IP address as an example. Let's say you are on IRC. You are chatting with a guy who is using IP address 203.117.154.215. You do a whois lookup.</p>
              <pre>% [whois.apnic.net node-2]<br>% Whois data copyright terms    http://www.apnic.net/db/dbcopyright.html<br><br>inetnum:      203.117.154.128 - 203.117.154.255<br>netname:      HotelMarinaCityPteLtd-SG<br>country:      SG<br>descr:        HotelMarinaCityPteLtd-SG<br>admin-c:      NS110-AP<br>tech-c:       NS110-AP<br>status:       ASSIGNED NON-PORTABLE<br>changed:      ******@starhub.com 20070625<br>mnt-by:       MAINT-AS4657-AP<br>source:       APNIC<br><br>person:       NOC SHI<br>nic-hdl:      NS110-AP<br>e-mail:       ***@starhub.com<br>address:      19 TaiSeng Drive<br>address:      Singapore 535222<br>phone:        +65 6825 7878<br>fax-no:       +65 6821 6012<br>country:      SG<br>changed:      *******@starhub.com 20060607<br>mnt-by:       MAINT-AS4657-AP<br>source:       APNIC<br></pre>
              <p>This is all the information you can get. So you know that he is in Singapore, the ISP he is using is Starhub and the IP block is registered to Hotel Marina City Pte Ltd. So there's a high chance he's staying at one of the hotels in Marina. As it so happens, the IP is used by Pan Pacific Singapore but you need to dig a bit deeper to get that information.</p>
              <p>Let's say you are working for Tan Ah Kow Pte Ltd and you are connected to IRC from work. TAK Pte Ltd has registered it's IP range as well so if someone does a whois lookup on your IP, he will see the registration information. Let's say Tan Ah Kow Pte Ltd is not very big and has only one office. So now, the person pretty much knows where you are.</p>
              <p>However, let's say TAK Pte Ltd has no requirement to register it's own IP range - they are just given an IP block by Starhub. If someone looks up your IP address, they will only see that you are using Starhub.</p>
              <p>So now let's get back to your question - the only party who can trace your IP address to your home address is your ISP. Everyone else can only trace your IP address to your ISP.</p>
              <p>Some people try to hide their IP addresses by connecting to proxy servers of one kind or another (BNC, Socks proxy, VPN, etc.). In those cases, if you lookup the IP address, you will find the location of the proxy server. You would then have to contact the owner of the proxy server to find out the IP address you were connecting from, and then continue to trace.</p>
              <p>So I would say unless you are the ISP, it's quite hard to find out your home address.</p>

              <p>That's true. But the point is that it is a non-trivial task to obtain the home address. You need the ISP, or have access to the ISP customer database and connection logs to obtain the information.</p>

              <p>I'll like to clarify that hubs are _NOT_ configurable devices. Switches generally are not either but there are instances when it is a layer 3 switch which can be configured to do routing within a CAN. Higher end layer 2 switches can also be configured to work with a multitude of vlan trunking protocols/encapsulation and redundant links without loops which will potentially down a switch because of how the ethernet frames will transverse the loop without getting dropped until a switch reset or the broadcast storm just brings it down. That being said, people need to use managed switches in a switched CAN, especially if it's deployed in the distribution/core layers and of course, run some form of STP/rstp/mstp/rstp+</p>
