            <div class='col-md body'>I needs some urgent help with some problems on my laptop... FYI my laptop is using windows XP...<br><br>It seems like my laptop is being 'controlled' by someone else... Even though I did not right click my right mouse things like this <img src="http://img454.imageshack.us/img454/9586/1238wc.jpg"> keeps coming out automatically and most of the times the options there were being clicked automatically... Also, the cursor of the mouse in the windows moves without me controlling the mouse...<br><br>I tried system restore but my computer doesn't allow me to do so and my anti spyware and anti virus tools detected nothing... So are there anyways that I can solve this problem? Also what caused it to happen? Thanks!</div>

You need a complete reinstall of the OS and perhaps something done to the hardware to clear some settings which will help clear the Hacktool.</div>
