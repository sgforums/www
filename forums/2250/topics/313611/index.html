              <p>Sorry i know this is really basic but may i ask,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) what's the different between intel pentium and duo core?</p>
              <p>2) what's GHz? example would be 1.73 ghz. i know the higher it is the better i will be. What is it for actually?</p>
              <p>3) Graphic cards. what are the top few graphic cards now. Mine is ATI MOBILITY RADEON X700 with 128MB, is it very old already? How to see a good one?</p>
              <p>4) 60 GB HDD. I think i know this one. The higher it is, the more storage for files</p>
              <p>5) 512MB DDR2 533 also known as ram i think. I know the higher it is the better it is too. But what is it for? Why the higher it is the better it is?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, i'm thinking of getting a laptop that is fast enough for me to open 20 firefox tabs without lagging. The above specs, which is my current laptop, lags badly when i try to open multiple windows or tabs. The screen will get stuck even when i sign in msn. Went to shop for laptops today and got all the brochures for different brands. Would like to know how to see the specs inorder for me to get the most suitable notebook. Thanks!</p>
              <p>p.s Do tell me if there are still other important factor/specs to look for when purchasing notebook if you know of any! really appreciate it thanks!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>1) what's the different between intel pentium and duo core?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #578ef9">Processors from the Pentium series have one  processor core while those from Core 2 Duo has two.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) what's GHz? example would be 1.73 ghz. i know the higher it is the better i will be. What is it for actually?</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz#Computing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz#Computing</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #578ef9">My interpretation would be that it's the theoratical maximum number of calculations that the processor can do in one second, though that number doesn't really has much meaning other than to be used for comparison among processors of the same series.</span></p>
              <p>3) Graphic cards. what are the top few graphic cards now. Mine is ATI MOBILITY RADEON X700 with 128MB, is it very old already? How to see a good one?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #578ef9">I use the list below for reference whenever I need to compare between graphics cards. That card should do fine as long you don't run the latest FPS games on it.</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.overclock.net/graphics-cards-general/270292-graphics-card-ranking-3rd-time-s.html">http://www.overclock.net/graphics-cards-general/270292-graphics-card-ranking-3rd-time-s.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) 60 GB HDD. I think i know this one. The higher it is, the more storage for files</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) 512MB DDR2 533 also known as ram i think. I know the higher it is the better it is too. But what is it for? Why the higher it is the better it is?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #578ef9">Like the HDD, it's also a form of storage or memory (RAM stands for Random Access Memory), but much faster than it. Think of RAM as short-term memory and a HDD as long-term memory. It's easier to study on the day right before an exam and dump all those text into your "RAM", and simply vomit them out on the papers on the next day, than to spend days committing them into your "HDD". The downside is, in comparison to a HDD, that all those information start disappearing from that "RAM" once you "switch off" from exam mode.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #578ef9">Anyway, if you want to do something like opening 20 tabs in Firefox without lag, get Windows XP and  2 GB of RAM.</span></p>

              <p>Since latercomer  did most of explained most of the terms to you. I shall answer this unanswered question.</p>
              <p>Price factor:</p>
              <p>THe cost of an higher-lower end  laptop nowadays is about $1600 to about $1800. Although there are a few exceptions from certain brands selling it at a lower cost of $1.2k to 1.3k. The lower end ones are normally selling for sub $1000 prices. Before committing to one, it's best to check the specs carefully. Do also check the freebies given, the dealer and the brand reliability, opinions, how long has the product been on the market. These few factors decide the pricings of the laptop. There is a tendacy for an average consumer to go "woo ah" over freebies given from buying of the laptop. Things like a free printer, 8gb thumb drive ect.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free gifts</span></p>
              <p>From a harvey norman dealer: " These factors are countered in the selling price of the laptop, and the price of laptop is marked up due to the <strong>FREE</strong> gifts. so you are actually buying the free gifts indirectly</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brand reliability</span></p>
              <p>This factor is quite hard to tell. However information is easily available on the net</p>
              <p>A few notebook brands to name:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Fujitsu</li>
              <li>HP</li>
              <li>Toshiba</li>
              <li>Nec</li>
              <li>Sony</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Specs:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Average spec ($999 to $1400)</span></p>
              <p>Core2 duo, 1.6ghz  / Amd Turion 64x2 TL58</p>
              <p>512mb to 1.5gb or 2gb ram 667 mhz</p>
              <p>802.11a/b/g/ 802.11a/b/g/n</p>
              <p>80gb to 100gb hdd 5400rpm</p>
              <p>Card reader (most laptops of this spec has them)</p>
              <p>Bluetooth (most laptops do have them too)</p>
              <p>Intel integrated x3100 graphics card</p>
              <p>Os: vista home basic/ business</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Higher-lower end spec</span></p>
              <p>Core 2 duo 1.8ghz to 2.0ghz/ Turion 64x2 Tl62</p>
              <p>2gb to 4gb ram 667mhz</p>
              <p>802.11a/b/g/n</p>
              <p>120gb to 160gb hdd 5400rpm</p>
              <p>card reader</p>
              <p>bluetooth</p>
              <p>Dedicated graphics from ATI/ Nividia. At least 128mb</p>
              <p>Os: vista home premium/ business</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Higher end spec</span></p>
              <p>Core 2 duo 2.2ghz to 2.6ghz/</p>
              <p>3gb to 4gb ram 667mhz</p>
              <p>802.11a/b/g/n</p>
              <p>120gb to 160gb hdd 5400rpm</p>
              <p>card reader</p>
              <p>bluetooth</p>
              <p>Dedicated graphics from ATI/ Nividia. above128mb</p>
              <p>Os: vista home premium/ business/ultimate</p>
              <p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>The specs of the Average line might seem impressive. ( i agree it does)</p>
              <p>However, vista requires a higher spec pc for it to run smoothly. Thus you can see the variations of operating systems offered in different ends</p>
              <p>Acer (an exception) offers a lower higher end variant of it's laptops at cheap and attractive prices. if you are constrained budget wise, you can go for that however it is not reccommended</p>
