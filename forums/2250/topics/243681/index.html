            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks to all who replied my earlier thread. It certainly helps.<br><br>There are few more questions which I hope the IT experts here can advise me:<br><br>a) Can I run SpySweeper and AVG Antispyware together in the background? My spysweeper is in 'Real-Time' mode. Can my AVG be in 'Resident Shield' mode too? Will it clash?<br><br>b) I just dl AVG antispyware free version which has all the components until 30 days trial later. Anyone knows what are the components that will be removed once the 30 days trial end? Is the shredder still around?<br><br>c) With regards to insufficient RAM, I saw from some websites that adding RAM will not help in Internet browsing? Is that right? E.g. If I click on a link, it takes slightly longer to change to another webpage. Will adding RAM improves the upload of the webpage? Just to reconfirm.<br><br>d) Under the AVG Antispyware, I can see that there is a 'quarantine' section. For those infected files that have been sent to 'quarantine', do we just leave it there (since it mentions that no harm can be done as file encrypted) or do we permanently delete it? What's the difference?<br><br>Regards  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

No. However, you will face computer slow-downs, as they can use up quite a bit of memory resources.<br><br>2. It will be around. Only auto update and real time protection is turned off.<br><br>3. No. It depends on your ISP and the website's server itself. But with more RAM, you can expect your browser to open faster.<br><br>4. You can leave it there. It does no harm. The difference between them is that quarantining them will leave the files on your hard disk, but the viruses won't be able to run. On the other hand, permanently deleting it will mean deleting it. If the virus turns out to be using a system file and you set it to delete, your computer could basically be gone case.</div>
