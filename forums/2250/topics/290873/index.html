            <div class='col-md body'>Erm... if the school giving out free software... doesn't matter whether you buy from the school or outside. As for the configurations and such, you can always ask your school to set it up for you.<br><br>Like reinstalling the OS and such. Cos the school package lappies are all installed under the school requirements. like this lappie that I got at school initially is only xp home edition but come really in xp professional and other stuffs that school provide. So, just buy and ask your school to set it up for you then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
