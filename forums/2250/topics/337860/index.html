              <p>Hey guys, would really appreciate any assistance on this matter :)</p>
              <p>I cant on my computer:- when i on the power supply, the screen remains black. There is a constant clicking sound inside my CPU system, which I am suspecting that it came from the DVD drive. DVD drive seems to be busy as well, with its green light flashing continuously. When I tried to open the DVD drive, sometimes it can open, sometimes it cant. I took out and rescrewed the hard disk inside the computer already so i dont think the hard disk is a problem.</p>
              <p>Quite weird leh, never experienced this before. The computer was still working fine in the afternoon, but then there was an apparent electric shock for no reason, so my computer restarted, but when there was an electric shock for the second time, my computer seems dead.</p>
              <p>Help!</p>

              <p>When you switch on the PC, listen and note down the frequency and number of beeps from the PC.  Eg, 11 short beeps or 1 long beep 2 short beeps.  Then google for "bios beeps" and search the websites for symtoms similar to your PC.  It helps your search faster if you know your PC bios manufacturer.  This will tell you what is ailing your PC.</p>
              <p>If you are more adventurous, you could do the following:</p>
              <p>1. Swap monitor to another PC.  If problem not solved, go to step 2</p>
              <p>2. Swap your graphics card with another PC.   If problem not solved, go to step 3</p>
              <p>3. Swap your ram with another PC.    If problem not solved, you might have a spoilt processor or motherboard since your PC suffered "2 electric shocks."</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for your reply :)</p>
              <p>The hard disk doesnt light up, but I could feel a little vibration coming from it. Upon close examination, there doesnt seem to be a place where the hard disk could be lighted anyway.</p>
              <p>I tried very hard to hear where that clicking sound came from and I'd like to think the clicking sound came from the DVD drive, which has been behaving weirdly as well. It seems to be "busy", with its flashlight blinking every 2-3secs.</p>
              <p>Apart from that clicking sound, there is this whirling sound, which is completely random. Sometimes its so soft, but sometimes its audible. No frequency whatsoever.</p>
              <p>How do I test which is part is faulty? The graphics card (which gave me a fair bit of problems last time), motherboard or hard disk? haizzz.</p>

              <p>When the screen is black, we need to check the booting up process.</p>
              <p>First step in the booting process when you switch on the power supply for the monitor and computer, the screen can black out if the monitor is spoilt, power cable is damaged or lossen. There are cases where a change for the power cable solves the problem.</p>
              <p>Second, the computer will check the BIOS ie the basic input output operating system. The computer will check/signal on the hardware parts ie the ram, clock battery, motherboard, harddisk, dvd drive, printer, modem,graphic card and so on.</p>
              <p>If the computer detects any problem, it will stop the booting up process or issue error messages by the beeping sounds ie how many beeps, short or long to indicate the type of error.</p>
              <p>If your computer does not show the BIOS and there are activity in the DVD drive and harddisk, then the problem will not be on the DVD drive or even the harddisk as these show that your DVD drive is active not spoilt.</p>
              <p>So, you will need to use the check part by part method used by the computer repaireman ie take out one part eg ram and put in a working ram and restarts the computer. If this solves the problem, then the ram is spoilt. If this does not solves the problem, take out another part eg harddisk and put in a working harddisk and restarts the computer ie keep changing the part one by one until the problem is identified and solved. </p>

              <p>The hard disk doesnt light up, but I could feel a little
              vibration coming from it. Upon close examination, there doesnt
              seem to be a place where the hard disk could be lighted anyway.</p>
              <p>I tried very hard to hear where that clicking sound came from
              and I'd like to think the clicking sound came from the DVD drive,
              which has been behaving weirdly as well. It seems to be "busy",
              with its flashlight blinking every 2-3secs.</p>
              <p>Apart from that clicking sound, there is this whirling sound,
              which is completely random. Sometimes its so soft, but sometimes
              its audible. No frequency whatsoever.</p>
              <p>How do I test which is part is faulty? The graphics card (which
              gave me a fair bit of problems last time), motherboard or hard
              disk? haizzz.</p>
