              <p>Sony is known for it's quality, power depends on the series. Though i can assure you. most vaios now come with pretty good specifications. it is the first manufactuer to come up with switchable graphics. and blue ray </p>
              <p>Acer laptops have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quality control issues. </span></span></p>
              <p>I recently attended to 1 Gemstone<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> series. with a faulty entertainment touch pad.</span> </p>
              <p>Steps i did:</p>
              <p>-Drivers update ( useless)<br>-Took out the battery and pressed the power button (to drain out remainding power),</p>
              <p>-this is a step few people will do, but many professionals will. </p>
              <p>In summary: faulty part.</p>
              <p>this is not an isolated case. i have seen power adaptors burning out after 6 months.</p>
              <p>People can argue how good they are, and that they use parts made by nvdia and other companies (intel, msi ect). The fact of the matter is, their inhouse manufacturing, which creates the casing, the touch pads, ect, have QC issues. - Balding keyboards, Hard keyboards, casings that are easily chipped, faulty power adaptors.... </p>
              <p>HP/Compaq warranty is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just normal</span>. Due to the location of the service centre, they just offer this service to send your laptop to you after servicing. </p>
              <p>You will be shocked at how long it will take for you to get back your laptop. 3 - 5 days? nah, it will be 1 - 2 weeks. Unless you make a hooha. You will have to call and rush them. I had a failed hdd. It took more than the specified 3-5 days. I called them up. and they said that they have not accessed the laptop. I then called them 2 days later, they have accessed but they dont have the part. When i said i need it in a rush, out of the blue, in a day, the part came and they said my laptop was ready for collection.</p>
              <p>I sent my pavilion laptop only to get it back scratched at the casing and with lots of finger prints smudged at the screen. and they dare tick machine is cleaned. The pavilion laptop i sent in was checked and there were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no scratches</span>. The cso, did not tick the scratches column. </p>
              <p>oh and i sent <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 HP laptops.  One for faulty hdd and one for faulty keyboard.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IBM/Lenovo</span> is not the company it was. Don't ever go for a Lenovo series. The thinkpad series is still alright, but if you go google it up, it has flex on it's plastics (when you depress some force, the plastics on the laptop wrist area will sink down) showing the quality of the plastics used.  Thinkpad has good specifications. Switchable graphics (dedicated and integrated graphics) and on top of that spill proof keyboards (though u would not want to try spilling things). Lenovo/IBM laptops have problems with  the 5300A/G/draft N wireless card. - a search on plenty of online forums and search engines will show to u the extend. - it's most probably driver issues, but somehow, even after updating, problems still persist.</p>
              <p>I wont comment about fujitsu. it's about portability and it has great battery life. It is still the only one which makes it's l<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ifebook series </span>in Japan. Note,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> lifebook</span> and not other series. like the L series. which is made in china.</p>

                  Though i can assure you. most vaios now come with pretty good
                  specifications. it is the first manufactuer to come up with
                  switchable graphics. and blue ray </p>
              <p>Acer laptops have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quality control
                  issues. </span></span></p>
              <p>I recently attended to 1 Gemstone<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> series. with a faulty
                  entertainment touch pad.</span> </p>
              <p>Steps i did:</p>
              <p>-Drivers update ( useless)<br> -Took out the battery and pressed the power button (to drain out
                  remainding power),</p>
              <p>-this is a step few people will do, but many professionals
                  will. </p>
              <p>In summary: faulty part.</p>
              <p>this is not an isolated case. i have seen power adaptors burning
                  out after 6 months.</p>
              <p>People can argue how good they are, and that they use parts made
                  by nvdia and other companies (intel, msi ect). The fact of the
                  matter is, their inhouse manufacturing, which creates the casing,
                  the touch pads, ect, have QC issues. - Balding keyboards, Hard
                  keyboards, casings that are easily chipped, faulty power
                  adaptors.... </p>
              <p>HP/Compaq warranty is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just normal</span>. Due to the
                  location of the service centre, they just offer this service to
                  send your laptop to you after servicing. </p>
              <p>You will be shocked at how long it will take for you to get back
                  your laptop. 3 - 5 days? nah, it will be 1 - 2 weeks. Unless you
                  make a hooha. You will have to call and rush them. I had a failed
                  hdd. It took more than the specified 3-5 days. I called them up.
                  and they said that they have not accessed the laptop. I then called
                  them 2 days later, they have accessed but they dont have the part.
                  When i said i need it in a rush, out of the blue, in a day, the
                  part came and they said my laptop was ready for collection.</p>
              <p>I sent my pavilion laptop only to get it back scratched at the
                  casing and with lots of finger prints smudged at the screen. and
                  they dare tick machine is cleaned. The pavilion laptop i sent in
                  was checked and there were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no scratches</span>. The cso, did not
                  tick the scratches column. </p>
              <p>oh and i sent <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 HP
                  laptops.  One for faulty hdd and one for faulty
                  keyboard.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IBM/Lenovo</span> is
                  not the company it was. Don't ever go for a Lenovo series. The
                  thinkpad series is still alright, but if you go google it up, it
                  has flex on it's plastics (when you depress some force, the
                  plastics on the laptop wrist area will sink down) showing the
                  quality of the plastics used.  Thinkpad has good
                  specifications. Switchable graphics (dedicated and integrated
                  graphics) and on top of that spill proof keyboards (though u would
                  not want to try spilling things). Lenovo/IBM laptops have problems
                  with  the 5300A/G/draft N wireless card. - a search on plenty
                  of online forums and search engines will show to u the extend. -
                  it's most probably driver issues, but somehow, even after updating,
                  problems still persist.</p>
              <p>I wont comment about fujitsu. it's about portability and it has
                  great battery life. It is still the only one which makes it's
                  l<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ifebook series</span> in
                  Japan. Note, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lifebook</span> and not other series.
                  like the L series. which is made in china.</p>

              <p>I am familiar with Acer's reputation for terrible quality. I'm using a Gemstone, and like the problem above, my volume touchpad isn't as sensitive as it should be, the fingerprint reader sucks (My friend's sister has my exact same model, he managed to log in with HIS finger) and the fingerprint reader agin disconnects. The HD webcam lags, like hello. So, it actually depends on what you use the laptop for. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Acer: Powerful/Cheap laptops, but not very good lasting</p>
              <p>HP/Compaq: Good quality, but laptop cooler required or *ahem*, I have experienced problems with their DV series, the metallic finish stains quite easily, actually. Quite fast.</p>
              <p>Lenovo: MIC. No need say</p>
              <p>IBM (Business Division, still under IBM): Very good, reliable, not too powerful, but enough for basic tasks, portable</p>
              <p>Fujitsu: Portable, good service (My friend repeatedly bricked his laptop, they fixed it), but only the Lifebook series. More towards basic tasks (I don't see the point of putting a 2.4GHz proc with X3100 GPU)</p>
              <p>Toshiba: Cheap, but gets quite warm. Acceptable performance. Very good build quality on their Qosmio series.</p>
              <p>Dell: I qouldn't suggest Dell's Inspiron and XPS line, though XPS warranties are some of the best I've seen. Vostro and Latitude lines are business, though from what I see on the Latitude, you might as well get an Acer.</p>
              <p>ASUS: King of the kings, very good build quality, very innovative features (N10Jc anyone?), high performance. Expensive, but warranties are some of the most covered. Accidental, travel, they have a warranty for everything, I think.</p>
              <p>Sony: Expensive, price-to-performance ratio may not be par with other makes, but high end models are very powerful, stylish, thin, most boast dual graphics. Warning: Gets hot!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's from my experiences with these brands, Axioo, never seen anyone with it. MSi, BenQ, never used one, except for the MSI Wind netbook. </p>
              <p>I think we should make another thread for laptop recommendations....</p>
