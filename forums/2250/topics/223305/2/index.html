Since you were at 85 threshold and the processor can hit that range when you encode multi-task and play games, there's no telling if it can even reach boiling point!<br><br>Arctic if you are very sure that the processor temperatire is causing problems then i have a suggestion. You may want to look into more advanced cooling solution like a 3rd party processor heatsink fan. Use that instead of the stock HSF provided with the prescott processor.<br><br>But before you do that can you do some spring cleaning on the overall of your computer assembled parts and blow out the dust gathering in between the fins of the processor fan and heat sink?</div>
