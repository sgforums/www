For example you have let's say one pc2100 and the other one is pc2800. It is obvious that the pc2800 is faster than the pc2100. PC2800 is 333mhz while 2100 is 266mhz. and ddr2 is always faster than a ddr.<br><br>If you wanna check which one is giving you problems, simple take out both rams. Then you plug in one stick at a time. If the ram is faulty, you should be able to hear several beeps. If it starts normally, try doing the same for the other stick.<br><br>My advice to TS, update your graphics card driver. That might help.</div>

So you played W3 and the comp hang or you played W3 and run all those programes and the comp hang? Recording or re-encoding or encoding songs using CDex?<br><br>To test the ram is easy just like what the guys above pointed out. Shut down power down PC take out one piece of the ram module and start up and let it run, better run a memtest (its a freeware can download from internet) for a few hours to check for any errors or problems. Power down and take down the current one and plug in the other and test again.<br><br>But when the 2 ram used together just let it idle without any programs running will there be an issue?<br><br>The 2 ram did you just added one of them you bough new from the shops or you have been using them and the above problem was observed sometime later like now? Are you using 2 ram with diferent latency or what?<br><br>Many things and situation leading to what happened has to be answered.<br><br>As for graphics card some tough games are picky and ATI based chip may need some adjustment on anti-aliasing so that they can be played well. Updates, patches and graphics drivers should be looked into first if the problem is not due to incompatible ram modules.<br><br>As for the encoding and multi-tasking, what is your computer system specifications? A sub-2Ghz processor with Intel 8xx chipset board should fare well with hyperthreading enable, enough to match an A64 3800+ single core in audio and video encoding. When they does that, much of the system resources are diverted and in use. If you computer specs are not in that minimum range and you try multitasking you may get problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Initially my com shutdown while I was playing W3. I thought that it might be my graphics card giving me problems, but later...<br><br>My com shuted down several times while I was re-encoding songs while running WinAmp and iTunes. I never encountered such problems until lately. I tried running W3 after removing the 256 RAM, and my com still shut down =\<br><br>While on idle, it doesn't shut down. Most of the times it auto shuts down only when I'm running W3 because at other times I only use my computer for websurfing, online chatting and listening to music.<br><br>My 256 is kinda old, bought in 2004, and the 512 (Kingston PC3200 DDR400)was added sometime during 2005.<br><br>My processor is a 2.4A GHz, not too sure about the chipset though.</div>

You can search the net with keywords and you will see lots of people experiencing the same or similar problems.<br><br>Most users writing in with problems here uses OEM computers or similar computers with pieces and parts replaced here and there. Its unlike modded or assembled PC entusaits where all the hardware specifications and software version are always printed in their help/ problem threads.<br><br>If TS can give us all the minor details and more perhaps each one of us can work in different ways and suggest a solution. Right now and always in situation like this the best thing to do is to take the problem one step at a time. Narrow down the possibilities.<br><br>Of course TS can get a new card and use it and maybe things will be fine but its not a luxury everyone has or are willing to spend on spare parts for testing and replacement. That's why they are here for.</div>
