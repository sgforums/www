              <p><br> For this, reason alone, you really ought to get a Windows
              machine.</p>
              <p>Bootcamp and all that crap is marketing fraud... running a
              Windows OS ontop of a middleware like Bootcamp ontop of a Mac OS
              ontop of hardware is so fundamentally ridiculous.</p>
              <p>The overhead on system resources is so bad even a high end
              system will be crawling, if not hanging all the time. Its Apple's
              marketing fraud to tackle the consumer dissonance that I mentioned
              - anxiety about not being able to function with the rest of the PC
              world.</p>
              <p>The only implementation I know that will work well on a Mac to
              play Windows games is using VMware, which works at the
              virtualisation level, basically taking the place of any OS. That's
              why Microsoft is so afraid of VMware and now beginning to offer
              products undercutting VMware's prices, while the likes of HP an IBM
              are investing so much in virtualisation technologies at the
              enterprise level.</p>
              <p>But its the cost and the technicalities lah... not worth it
              unless you really need to function in both OS worlds.</p>

              <p>boot camp runs natively on any intel mac. it runs as fast as any windows laptop. (i remember an article in the past that declared the macbook pro the best laptop to run vista)</p>
              <p>VMware is just virtualization. it will never be as fast as running native. </p>
              <p>anyway, boot camp and the virtualization software are just software to help smoothen the transit from windows to mac. there are still some software/website that only runs on windows/internet explorer. it's not there for people to use windows on mac. (why would anyone do that in the first place? people buy a mac to use a mac, not to run windows)  </p>

              <p>it is rather expensive to get a macbook to run XP though. if you want a laptop but want XP, get a Sony one or something. if you want a laptop to run Mac OS, get a macbook. you won't usually switch the OSes around anyway, and you can find programs on either OS to run whatever you want. except games, that is. </p>

              <p>Running natively or not can be quite irrelevant, its the stability ultimately of the system that matters over time. No point having a paper weight when it acts up even though its fast when working on an initially clean installation.</p>
              <p>Opinion aside, just google say "Bootcamp problems" and you can see the problems that users face.</p>
              <p>VMware is way more versatile and offers functionality and features far greater than anything that Bootcamp can offer, which merely dual boots from different partitions and supplies drivers to the Windows OS. I've seen implementations of VMware to run the latest PC games and other apps really fast. Simultaneous access to both OS offers far more utility and productivity. Of course, its difficult to say if future problems will crop up. As I always say its the drivers that always seem to be the problem with system reliability, if not immediately then eventually, as the Vista problems show. Suffice to say, we're all in agreement that its not cool to run OS on hardware not meant for each other.</p>
              <p>As for the article you saw, no lah. Its not the best, just that its benchmark test scores happened to be the highest at that point in time. There are new benchmark champions every other week depending on who has the latest Intel CPU or graphics card or RAM chip or HDD. If ASUS launches the latest Calpella quad-core Intel CPUs onto its gaming lappies with the latest monster nVidia 3-D graphics cards, dual SSDs etc. it'll be the new champion wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>Apple has a habit of paying premium prices to Intel for exclusive rights to the first batch of any new Intel CPU. Then they charge premium prices to consumers lor. That was how they could make the Mac Air, using the latest ultra low voltage Core 2 Duos b4 anyone else. But 3-4 yrs prior to Mac Air, Sony used generally available components to create the super razor thin carbon fibre lappies weighing less at 900g-1.1kg WITH/without optical drives and swappable batteries.  The world's lightest Toshiba Protege is like 800g with optical drive. That's engineering R&amp;D and expertise.</p>

              problems show. Suffice to say, we're all in agreement that its not
              cool to run OS on hardware not meant for each other.</p>
              <p>As for the article you saw, no lah. Its not the best, just that
              its benchmark test scores happened to be the highest at that point
              in time. There are new benchmark champions every other week
              depending on who has the latest Intel CPU or graphics card or RAM
              chip or HDD. If ASUS launches the latest Calpella quad-core Intel
              CPUs onto its gaming lappies with the latest monster nVidia 3-D
              graphics cards, dual SSDs etc. it'll be the new champion wouldn't
              it?</p>
              <p>Apple has a habit of paying premium prices to Intel for
              exclusive rights to the first batch of any new Intel CPU. Then they
              charge premium prices to consumers lor. That was how they could
              make the Mac Air, using the latest ultra low voltage Core 2 Duos b4
              anyone else. But 3-4 yrs prior to Mac Air, Sony used generally
              available components to create the super razor thin carbon fibre
              lappies weighing less at 900g-1.1kg WITH/without optical drives and
              swappable batteries.  The world's lightest Toshiba Protege is
              like 800g with optical drive. That's engineering R&amp;D and expertise</p>

              <p>http://www.adamobydell.com/</p>
              <p>There are so many stunning designs by laptop manufacturers, if only you are willing to pay premium prices. Mac's price point isn't even considered a premium brand you know, that's why students buy it ... Even if OS etc. isn't an issue, I'd still think twice cos its so student-ish. Even my Panasonic Toughbook is classed as a premium corporate brand.</p>
              <p>Maybe we should start a new and more interesting thread called the most desirable lappies - must cost at least S$3k or S$4K and above with really unusual capabilities/features? Maybe people with money to burn, like Parn, can buy them and show them off to us.</p>

              <p>It's to prove that VMWare can be crap if you turn off the wrong option, which is true.</p>
              <p>By the way, not all applications are compatible with that acceleration option. Some VMs can crash or hang or even cause a memory leak on the host machine itself. Most work fine, but is still very much dependent on why you install a VM.</p>

              <p>I got to admit Dell Adamo is probably the only Dell laptop that I find it nice though I find the metal texture at the bottom (monitor part) kind of out of place. Than there is another problem, the Adamo is only look nice but comes with a rubbish processor. Hence probably, this kind of laptop really for people who have lots of money to burn.</p>
              <p>Mac itself is not premium but rather people make it premium. If you really want to run XP, I really recommend you to think twice, cause you are afterall still running on a hardware that is configured to run best on Mac hence you may find problems here and there. Thus it is wiser to get a PC laptop, there are nice ones such as Sony (premium price though).</p>
              <p>Also bootcamp was put inside OS X not because Apple thinks that they are hopeless but rather to help users dual boot without the needs of complicated procedure that some people cannot understand.</p>

              faster than running natively.</p>

              <p>Stability of Windows in the long run: I'd say Apple. Not to be bashing Apple, but Macs were meant to run OSX, and even though you might have installed the drivers using the OS X DVD, quite a few problems probably will occur, seeing as the components were built for OSX. For example, I have heard reports of MBP users unable to use their dedicated video card in Windows, and the Hardware automatically used their integrated solutions instead. Sometimes, the Wireless adapter isn't recognised, even with the drivers.Or maybe it just plain crashes. Some have reported overheating in their Macs, not surprisingly an Apple-only chip. There are many problems, and you better hope, its not you.</p>
              <p>Well sure, performance won't really be optimal after a few months, but with enough know-how, you can keep it up there somewhere.</p>
              <p>And yes, though cost is a factor, usually its the bugs that keep users from getting Windows to run on a Mac. Isn't that the reason why most Mac users got their Macs for? I would still not recommend Boot Camp unless it is a must. Windows can run on a Mac, and vice versa, but both implementations are buggy as hell. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So my opinion is: It's up to you. Do you really need Windows, or is there an alternative to Boot Camping your Mac?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fun Fact: It takes Apple longer to acknowledge a flaw exists in their products than it takes Microsoft to release a new OS. (iBook series flaws)</p>

              <p>It's to prove that VMWare can be crap if you turn off the wrong
                  option, which is true.</p>
              <p>By the way, not all applications are compatible with that
                  acceleration option. Some VMs can crash or hang or even cause a
                  memory leak on the host machine itself. Most work fine, but is
                  still very much dependent on why you install a VM.</p>

              <p>Isn't it obvious that you are supposed to have technical knowledge of what you are doing before doing it? I can name you a million and one ways you can crash any OS, Mac, PC, lappie or server. Even say a Sun Solaris Unix server.</p>
              <p>I've said all along, you want to dual boot or run multiple OS on funny hardware not built for it, u'd jolly well be technical! &amp; that was what I said about VMware too - most people ain't technical enough, especially the Mac demographic.</p>
              <p>Surely you didn't google VMware just to find that paragraph to nitpick? Who says that it is crap if you turn off the acceleration, its whether a feature is supported or not and whether performance or stability is favoured. You're not doing the same thing blaming the OS layer again are you? Ever occurred to you that such crashes are due to the software not supported by VMware being buggy? Ever considered that it is no party's fault even cos it isn't within the normal design parameters?</p>

              <p>Heh, it's not difficult to screw up, especially with non-technical users. They will find a million ways to screw it up, no matter how idiot proof a program is.</p>
              <p>I don't think it's obvious that you are supposed to have technical knowledge of X to do X. You have no technical of how you breathe, but yet you do know how to breathe. If that's the case, we are all long dead.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that doesn't matter. If someone feels that they can do something without ever needing to read the manual, then go ahead and do it.</p>
              <p>Assuming that you are used to Windows habits... VMWare would most likely suit you.</p>
              <p>VMWare is very straightforward. Install it as per usual, create a new VM, insert the CD and everything goes on as normal.</p>
              <p>I've no experience for Bootcamp, so I won't touch on that.</p>
              <p>To summarize everything, habits and other stuffs that's present naturally in you will move you to do something, no matter how daunting it seems.</p>
              <p>If parn can run a Mac + Windows in a Mac without much reading of the manual, then good for her (? your gender I'm not sure).</p>
              <p>Nothing much to argue here.</p>
