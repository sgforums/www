              <p>100% compatible, not quite. Which Macbook did you get? Cause IIRC, some Macbooks had some issues with Windows installations.

              <p>And then you want to install Windows? Try CrossOver instead. Its free, and works quite a bit faster than Paralells, and it runs in the Mac OSX itself, so no need to reboot when you need to use Mac apps. It solved the problem with my friend's Mac, anyway.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, I cannot understand why you would want to buy a Mac to run Windows, although I have seen some people (friends doing it). But how much detail do you want to delve into?</p>
              <p>Ask yourself - Why do you want a Mac? The responses are typically as follows:</p>
              <p>a) To look cool, cos u think / other ppl think it is cool</p>
              <p>b) It has functions that you cannot find in Windows?</p>
              <p>c) It makes financial sense (u got a good bargain?)</p>
              <p>d) u feel Mac represents some kind of choice (anti-establishment)</p>
              <p>e) some other reason I missed out on</p>
              <p>f) all of the above</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you share with us the reason, perhaps I can debunk in greater detail any misconceptions.</p>
              <p>I really dun want to be involved in one of those Mac versus Windows flaming war threads again but I can really debunk those myths encapsulated in (a) - (f). There are at least 50 myths associated with Windows that Apple perpetuates and does not want potential Mac owners to know.</p>
              <p>As a brief taster:</p>
              <p>1) Price wise - No its not worth it to do so. All laptops and PCs have the cost of the OS bundled into the purchase price. So you are actually paying for a copy of the Mac OS that you will not be using.</p>
              <p>Then you have to pay for another copy of Windows OS to run on the Mac. Unless you intend to use a pirated copy, which is not advisable from a security standpoint. I've seen many cases and helped one friend clean out her Mac running Windows which was chock full of viruses and trojans.</p>
              <p>2) How technically inclined are you to even consider running Windows on Mac?</p>
              <p>The best implementation I would recommend is using VMware. It gives server class / enterprise reliability, plus the ability to dual boot, among others. Not BootCamp, nor anyother stuff. Which means another license cost though.</p>
              <p>If you have not heard of VMware or dunno how to do it... er... think again.</p>
              <p>3) Running cost - reliability etc.etc.</p>
              <p>4) Choice - the widely held misconception is that you get a lot of choice with Mac.Not necessarily. There are only 5 models (based on 3 chasis).</p>
              <p>EACH of Dell / HP / IBM Lenovo / ASUS / Sony / Fujitsu / Samsung / LG have wider and deeper product lines to choose from!</p>
              <p>Unless there is some compelling reason why you need a Mac, such as u being in the design and multimedia industry and your office/industry uses it predominantly, there's little reason to do so. Given that you want to run WinXP, you do not belong to that category.</p>
              <p>I guess yours is a want, not a need.</p>
              <p>5) Much as I love to continue... I need to koon, mebbe part deux tomorrow.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for taking time to reply my post with sincere good details, really appreciated it heaps! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Hmm....I'm just toying with the idea of getting a macbook ever since my last SONY lappie decide to go and be with the LORD. And because I'm used to windows and not familiar with a mac, I would like to know if it is possible for me to still rely on windows on a macbook. (I still have my old original genuine windows xp professional disc to use it on the macbook)</p>
              <p>Looking cool is not really an important point because I don't believe by lugging around a cool-looking 2kg computer is going to make me look "cool". I look better without the macbook.</p>
              <p>Space-saving is also one factor why I picked a lappie over a desktop, I also did considered getting a mac mini which I think will save my room plenty of spaces but unfortunately at a ridiculous price once I've added all the desired options in it. It's going to help me in my plan to re-decorate my bedroom, yes...it's my bedroom from where my previous mobile phone flew out of my bedroom window.</p>
              <p>I have heard it's more difficult for a pc to run a mac operating system than to make a mac to run windows. &lt;--- This is one factor why I am looking at the mac now, despite the price of the macbook isn't as features loaded as compared to those pc lappie.</p>
              <p>I  mean I could buy a pc lappie with the same price and it is value for money if I compared the specifications that I will be getting against the mac of the same value.</p>
              <p>I have a desktop at home already, but I travel often together with my parents...so I don't really have my own portable computer to use when I'm away from home. And since I got the budget for it, I would like to get a light-weight, small, but also powerful enough in the video/graphics for me to play some games. I don't mind if the processor is only 2.0GB and the harddrive is only 160GB, but the ram must be 4GB and I must have a good graphic card for me to run anything not-so-insane applications to entertain me.</p>
              <p>I know the newer macbooks that are coming out next will have SD slots to replace maybe the DVD drive? So don't know if I should wait or buy now or what.........cos I don't want to buy a technology that is going to be replaced soon!</p>
              <p>What would you have done in my situation? Would love to hear about it and maybe I might do the same. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Parn,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You are facing a classic case of consumer dissonance. You
                  see all the fancy ads and the Apple marketing and you question whether you
                  should consider it as an option. But marketing doctrine will say that you will
                  face even more dissonance once you have bought it cos you will wonder whether
                  you have made the right choice in joining the minority 8-10%. You might face dissonance called regret if you have insurmountable compatibility problems.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Like I said, the cost doesn't add up, you've observed it
                  yourself in that you can get better price/features on Windows laptops. Its
                  called competition among retailers and manufacturers.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Regarding the Windows OS that you own there's a common
                  misconception. What you have, if its from another lappie, even if it is genuine
                  and paid for, is an OEM license. Meaning that its Windows serial number is tied
                  to the specific lappie it came with. How does Microsoft know? In the
                  registration process (either by you or the manufacturer), its supposed to have
                  noted the specific hardware configurations in the BIOS. That's why PC DIY-ers
                  who purchased genuine OEM licenses but who perform major upgrades to their
                  system guts subsequently, (eg. new CPU or motherboard) may find that their OEM
                  license doesn't work! OEM licenses live and die WITH the lappie/PC it was
                  installed on, that's why its much cheaper than a retail box set, which is truly
                  perpetual and owned by a person. That's why some choose to buy it if you're
                  wondering. You would technically be in breach of licensing by reusing it on
                  another PC. You may find yourself having problems getting Microsoft updates
                  after installing on a Mac.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Its better value to buy another Windows lappie lah. Right
                  now, due to the impending Windows 7 launch, competition among the
                  retailers/manufacturers entail that any new Vista lappie should qualify for
                  free upgrade when it comes out in October. According to most experts in the
                  field, Windows 7 will be a significant breakthrough.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The SD thingie replacing a DVD optical drive? Dun think that
                  is possible, they perform separate functions. Many laptops have SD / memory
                  card readers built in. My previous ASUS already had that SD card slot, so does
                  my present Toughbook. Mac is always late to the game, perhaps that's what you
                  meant, they dun have SD readers yet?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Yeah, lap top is the way to go lah. Unless you are very tech
                  inclined and know how to tear the guts out of a PC to upgrade and mod, lappies
                  offer more utility, even if you only occasionally bring it out. But just a
                  point to note... if u want a gaming capable lappie, it'll have to be quite
                  powerful, with a dedicated video card, biggish screen and substantial battery.
                  It sure ain't gonna be ultra-portable already which is what I swear by.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I'm in need of a visit to Sim Lim / Funan soon cos just came
                  back. Dad wants a new LCD / Plasma TV too. Am thinking of this weekend, but there's the Pulau Ubin thingie with Bak
                  &amp; gang leh, if anybody is interested, we can make it an SGForum informal
                  trip one of these days.</p>

              <p>Since you haven't bought it yet, just buy a regular Windows Laptop. Like Preternatural.stuff said, the costs of installing Windows on a Mac is prohibitively expensive and not worth the cost. It is harder to install the OSX on a Mac because Apple optimized their OS for specific hardware. It is easier to code for just a few types of CPU, GPU's etc rather than the whole range, right?</p>
              <p>IMO, the OSX was such a failure that they had to implement Boot Camp so users could install Windows.</p>
              <p>It is up to you. A good Windows Laptop with superior specifications usually costs as much as an entry level MBP. </p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">How can an OS program run an OS program. Make some sense, use proper English  or substantiate pls. Else u're just mis-informing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I find this aspect of SGForums truly tiring.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you mean that the Leopard OS can run on Intel hardware, what are u offering that is new? Mac OS on Intel hardware from Sim Lim? Can but again u face many driver issues and compatibility problems, if not now then surely sometime down the road.</span></p>
              <p>SexyChin,</p>
              <p>I initially thought like you that it appears counter-intuitive to want to install Windows on Mac hardware. But on 2nd thoughts, it can represent some form of hardware choice, its just whether it is justifiable. There's actually a lot of <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">misinformation and misconceptions/myths about this topic ever since Apple recently jumped ship to Intel. The marketing hoopla is really quite ridiculous and needs to be given a real wallop. Hence this thread is quite useful. If everybody can be constructive, this thread could be of useful reference to a lot of folks so that they dun make the wrong decisions.</span></p>

              <p><br>For this, reason alone, you really ought to get a Windows machine.</p>
              <p>Bootcamp and all that crap is marketing tactics to tackle the consumer dissonance that I mentioned - anxiety about not being able to function with the rest of the PC world.</p>
              <p>The only implementation I know that seems to work well on a Mac to play Windows games is using VMware, which works at the virtualisation level, basically taking the place of any OS. That's why Microsoft is so afraid of VMware and now beginning to offer products undercutting VMware's prices, while the likes of HP &amp; IBM are investing so much in virtualisation technologies at the enterprise level.</p>
              <p>But its the inherent cost and the technicalities lah... not worth it unless you really need to function in both OS worlds.</p>
