              <p>Stability of Windows in the long run: I'd say Apple. Not to be
                      bashing Apple, but Macs were meant to run OSX, and even though you
                      might have installed the drivers using the OS X DVD, quite a few
                      problems probably will occur, seeing as the components were built
                      for OSX. For example, I have heard reports of MBP users unable to
                      use their dedicated video card in Windows, and the Hardware
                      automatically used their integrated solutions instead. Sometimes,
                      the Wireless adapter isn't recognised, even with the drivers.Or
                      maybe it just plain crashes. Some have reported overheating in
                      their Macs, not surprisingly an Apple-only chip. There are many
                      problems, and you better hope, its not you.</p>
              <p>Well sure, performance won't really be optimal after a few
                      months, but with enough know-how, you can keep it up there
                      somewhere.</p>
              <p>And yes, though cost is a factor, usually its the bugs that keep
                      users from getting Windows to run on a Mac. Isn't that the reason
                      why most Mac users got their Macs for? I would still not recommend
                      Boot Camp unless it is a must. Windows can run on a Mac, and vice
                      versa, but both implementations are buggy as hell. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So my opinion is: It's up to you. Do you really need Windows, or
                      is there an alternative to Boot Camping your Mac?</p>

              <p>Raraken is right but before anybody misconstrues it again, google and see the full picture of possible problems. With every subsequent Windows update/patch or Bootcamp version, or even VMware enhancement, the compatibility issues can widen.</p>

              <p>Its not the reading of manuals, its the problems that will come later (eventually?) with updates and patches. At the enterprise level, all patches and updates are tested vigorously on development/test servers before being applied to production/live servers. With consumer computers, you apply them first and think (regret?) later. Windows on Mac exposes one to higher than normal risk of driver-OS-hardware conflicts.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">Myth 2 - Windows stability<br><br>Again, ur ignorance shows through. Not very good with Windows are you? But nevertheless trying to give advice here?<br><br>Windows systems are perfectly stable in the long run, that's why 90% of computer users, and nearly all of China's 120-150million users, the largest internet country in the world, and all corporate fleet orders I know are on Windows. Its the minority idiots who dunno what they are doing who whine and complain and then blame it on everything else and/or jump ship. Empty vessels make the most noise geddit? Why is somebody obviously not qualified to comment (cos you obviously struggle with Windows), dishing out comments?<br><br>Why is it that I once had a lappie that ran Win 98 for more than 3 yrs WITHOUT once having to reformat and re-install? Ppl used to say u hv to do so every year or so. In the 4th year, I doubled the RAM to 256MB and then installed XP over the Win 98 using the upgrade option. Despite wise arses' conventional wisdom saying you have to reformat the harddisk and install XP on a clean harddisk, it ran for another couple of years, including ghosting the entire XP partition from the old 6GB  harddisk to a 20GB one.<br><br>On my current lappie, NOW , I have 4 x Firefox windows open, (20 Firefox extensions installed) with a total of 37 tabs, plus Windows internet explorer (1 window and 2 tabs), Live Messenger, 3 Windows explorers, 1 x xplorer² lite, Open office full suite, 4 x Word docs, Outlook,  PDF-Exchange Viewer with 5 PDFs, Ditto, IDM, IObit, Mozyhome, Secunia, AVG, InCD etc on the sys tray, all running for a week now using only hibernation when away?<br><br>&amp; I'm actually a high risk user cos I install/uninstall all sorts of beta software and freeware/shareware all the time - stuff that are notoriously buggy. That's why such (in fact all) software have disclaimers and their version release notes specify the inherent flaws and bugs they address/rectify. Nobody blames the developer - it comes with the territory. Notice how the developers <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never </span>blame the OS too - that's the domain of the ignorant user.<br><br>Wow, I must have a higher IQ than you or something to make all that work? Much as that is a tempting thought, overwhelming evidence shows that people with Windows problems or people with such perceptions  often choose to remain ignorant, that's all.<br><br>If you have any PC problem, what makes you think you are the only one doing something wrong? Thousands would have encountered it before, realised the problem (often due to their own mistakes/actions) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SOLVED </strong></span>it already.<br><br>If you have any issues with a PC, u dun even need to visit technical websites nowadays with the number of blogs that have sprung up. All u need is to read basic tips, download simple freeware to run (see my list for a start, though there are much more) and develop good, safe, sensible habits when online.<br><br>Understand the power of the Windows community and platform. Because there are so many users, developers would always rather develop software for it than Mac.That's why 10 yrs ago, there were hardly any virus for Macs, cos there weren't as many computer users, so Windows users were the only meaningful demographic to target - minimum effort for maximum reach kinda logic. Not because Mac was any better, even though its based on Unix. That's why hackers target UNIX server vulnerabilities, cos they are typically high value assets, not because UNIX is crap. That's why Unix servers are usually highly protected by firewalls, IDS, &amp; subjected to security audits too despite being robust in nature. All OS hv to release patches for vulnerabilities and version updates as a result, its a cat and mouse game.<br><br>U'd be busy enjoying the benefits of the Windows platform - Limitless software to download and run, limitless hardware components to try pushing thetechnical envelope, if you weren't complaining so much.<br><br>Dun believe? I can even teach you how to buy a lappie with its OEM Windows (and indeed this applies to Windows Pocket PC too) and NEVER have to spend a single cent on software again - by using freeware alone. Without ever resorting to pirated software or jailbreaking crap too. Try doing that on a Mac.</div>

VMware is robust enterprise level stuff and I've seen it run stable and fast, even to run games, that's why I mentioned it. Though I stated all the caveats and my reservations still.<br><br>Native is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>IRRELEVANT</strong></span>. Its driver compatibility G.E.D.D.I.T.? You think native means speed? You think Bootcamp just let's u choose partition of OS to run and that's it? Ridiculous! It has to supply all the drivers for Windows to run the Mac hardware, cos Apple's history and ethos is such that it never reveals its hardware details to others, certainly not to Microsoft to incorporate into Windows.<br><br>Do I need to give you a history lesson on Apple's fall from grace in the 80s?<br><br>In the 80s, nobody dared to take on the challenge of making an OS work with ALL hardware manufacturers and their dodgy drivers. Only Bill Gates dared to. IBM wasn't stupid, just that they were aware of the scope and passed the buck (literally) and sold it to Microsoft.<br><br>Bill Gates is often painted as satan in disguise or the one with the smallish flaccid dick (Microsoft get it?). But the truth is that old Bill understood what Steve Jobs didn't in the 80s - the concept of specialisation. Something all business schools and textbooks now preach. Sadly many Apple fans, including iPhone fans, still dun understand this concept in the 21st century.<br><br>Apple took the easy (and greedy) approach of saying that only they have the divine right to make both the hardware and software for computers. &amp; that's how Apple fell from grace. Its not my opinion or yours, check the historical stock market indices for the facts. In the early-Mid 80s, Apple were the leaders by virtue of their 1st mover advantage but they blew it with their greedy mantra - Steve Jobs decided that only Apple can make hardware and OS. All manufacturers had to subcontract their products to Apple and let Apple put their logo on the hardware. <br><br>That's why he got ousted from the Apple board when they lost the plot in terms of market share.<br><br>The entire PC industry said bollocks to Apple and went with Microsoft which not only will not compete with them on hardware but also promised to make Windows compatible with their hardware. That's how you got best of breed players in the IT industry that we have today. That’s how Dell, HP, IBM et al <span style="text-decoration: underline;">each </span>became many times bigger than Apple. Thats how Creative came about geddit?<br><br>That's why most of the time with Win XP, you don't even need to install any drivers when you connect hardware to it - its got generic drivers built in to run natively (since you like the word so much). Even now, Apple will never provide its drivers to its enemy, Microsoft, cos it must make all hardware itself geddit? Why bother, so that Microsoft can sell more Windows? Hence it requires that Bootcamp be its representative middleman to do it.</p>
              <p>But how much commitment do you think Apple has? You think they will maintain an entire division of engineers to ensure that Bootcamp is always updated and compatibile with the enemy's OS after every Patch Tuesday when Microsoft releases patches and updates? You think Apple has the means or inclination to reverse engineer Windows to make sure Bootcamp is any good? Michael Dell can just shake hands with Bill Gates and you will have an iron clad corporate will to ensure all Dell hardware and Windows are interoperable.<br><br>Similarly, why would Microsoft bother to find out what drivers Mac hardware needs? Mac needs Windows users, but Microsoft doesn't need Mac sales.</p>
              <p>Imagine the comedy when you encounter problems running Windows on Mac hardware. You have problems, call Microsoft tech support. The tech guy will probably fall off his chair laughing before saying, sorry, its Mac's problem.<br><br>Then you call Mac and they will tell you its Windows' problem, then give you the standard line that Mac OS is better. Incidentally, note one of the pet peeves of Mac users during the PowerPC era. Everytime Mac users wanted to upgrade their older machines to newer OS, Mac tech support and sales staff will always give the standard canned message - "I dunno whether G3s will run well with Leopard, or Pussy or watever, but if you buy the latest G4, it will be good with the latest OS".<br><br>But that's the risk with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL </span></strong>OS upgrades. U need commitment from all parties.<br><br>Ask Linux users, the most technically inclined demographic, running Ubuntu, Redhat, FreeBSD etc. on Intel machines or even to dual boot, you will see it too. The devil is with the drivers G.E.D.D.I.T? That's why Linux struggles for market share. They do not have the volume nor central authority for software certification and testing that Microsoft does so well with.<br><br>Perversely, the whole Vista problem also illustrates the flip side of the coin - hardware manufacturers couldn't be bothered to update their drivers quickly. Hint: Its about economic realities. Driver development/upgrading is cost, they'd rather you buy new hardware with Vista drivers, which is profit.<br><br>If a piece of software is buggy, it can be shut down or uninstalled. But when the driver is buggy and there is driver-OS-hardware conflicts, it is perpetual from the moment you power on. Its game over G.E.D.D.I.T? How to tweak the registry or mod the driver when you'd have to reverse engineer the silicon chips and printed circuit boards of each hardware component to know how it works?<br><br>VMware is robust, feature packed and offers incredible possibilities, but you can only harp perceived speed?  It can run Mac, Linux, Windows, Unix etc. what do you know about its possibilities when you do not understand the OS-driver-hardware complexity?</p>
              <p>Check all the problems running Windows on Bootcamp, ultimately a middleware, b4 you make irresponsible comments.</p>

Plus, I do have a 'Hackbook Pro', and I have assisted some of my friends with their Boot Camp installs (1 iMac, 2 Aluminium MacBooks) and the iMac and 1 MacBook both had problems and compatibility issues, with XP SP3, Vista SP1 and/or the Win 7 RC1.

              <p>Where the hell did the other core go? We gave up trying to solve the problem, and as usual, Apple support was no help, telling us to contact Microsoft. The Microsoft support dude tried to help us, even though we told him it was an iMac. No fix there.</p>

              <p>The MacBook display stuck itself at 800x600, even with the Apple-supplied drivers (Which, according to Apple themselves, should be used for maximum stability), and the DVD drive wouldn't eject the disks. Add to that the USB ports not working properly (USB 1.0 speeds, or not detected at all), and you have a headache.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh, and the Apple-only chips may have 2 different speeds for the same model. Is it Intel's doing or Apple's? You might have been cheated XD.</p>

              <p>The Apple-only chips are some of the the E8XX5 series, and some mobile T-series (though I think it's just that some manufacturers don't want to use some of the T-series, like the T9900).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, for the support side, yes, but isn't it APPLE'S duty to help and to render any assistance required should any problems arise due to a function THEY included? Sounds like Boot Camp is a marketing ploy to get people to buy Macs, since they think, "Hey, I can run Windows on a Mac. Sweet!" and then Boot Camp doesn't work as expected. </p>
              <p>The chips used on the Air are similar to the ones being used on the Acer Timelines. SU9XXX and SL9XXX CPUs. A problem I encountered on the E8135 iMac was that a core was somehow disabled on Windows, but not in OS X. Really odd. </p>
              <p>The display problem was probably due to the chipset glitch or something. Disk Utility WAS used, and so were some other partitioning S/W (Gparted, Acronis, Easeus, and to varying degrees of success. None fully working though). I'm not sure if using </p>
              <p>Just because you know how to use Boot Camp, doesn't mean you know how to fix problems. Hands-on with the problem itself is still the best way. </p>

              <p>Goodness sakes, its not the same! Even if you use similar chipsets, the drivers for the parts needed to run with Mac OS and to run Windows are totally different!</p>
              <p>By your logic, then I should be able to install Linux on any of my PCs, use the same Windows drivers? Ask Linux users and u'll see!</p>
              <p>The drivers needed by Macs and incorporated into Bootcamp are probably closer to Linux and Unix ones, but unlike open source or open license ones such as FreeBSD etc. which are openly reviewed, developed, released and published, nobody knows for sure what Mac does with them or will do with them tomorrow! Its their cultural ethos. I have no problems with it, that's their choice and they can prosper or die by it.</p>
              <p>But this is Windows OS on Mac hardware! U're repeating the same fallacious mantra that is perpetuated by marketing brochures and ignorant/irresponsible fanboys repeating them ad nauseum.</p>

              <p>That's so simplistic a sweeping statement! You make it sound like anybody should do it!</p>
              <p>Running Hackintosh on PCs is one of the most demanding things to do and not worth it cost-benefit wise. Compared to just driver issues to debug running Windows on Mac hardware, you have so much more code to pore through (the entire Mac OS). Each time you want to add/change hardware, you gotta rehack the entire OS? Why create a Bootcamp for Windows hardware, when Windows already has the most comprehensive set of drivers built in on the planet.</p>
              <p>It defeats the whole purpose/benefit anyway - using Mac OS. If u're so desperate to use it, u'd pay the premium and get Mac hardware already, rather than investing so much time and effort on hacking the OS.</p>
              <p>The whole purpose of people being so desperate to use Windows is because of the endless software and hardware possibilities - versatility and cost effectiveness - the the benefit test is easily made out.</p>
              <p>That's why the no. of folks doing hackintoshing is really few, extremely technical and mainly hobbyists.</p>

              <p>Fun fact: Know what Vista is good at and what its not meant for before you chime in.</p>
              <p>If you get the drivers right, Vista is actually the best right now for certain high end tasks - like playing the latest high end software - typically virtual reality games. Microsoft wanted to push the boundaries of technical development - ActiveX for gaming etc. Which unfortunately, Mac cannot even aspire to reach.</p>
              <p>That's why if you dun need the features (clearly you dun), you've always got Windows XP. I activated the Win XP option on my Vista license cos I didn't need Vista features (no time for games) and I've already modded my XP to near Vista capabilities. Vista is bloated - there's a reason why - but without going into the history of things again, that's cos they'd rather incorporate features and drivers IN CASE the ignorant user needs them. But that's for another day.</p>

              <p>There is no crap and misinformation as far as I can see. If there is, I will correct it. Prime example is the XP licensing issue.</p>
              <p>Or if there's anybody who insists on a certain fact, I will tell you to break that. You said earlier can install Windows on VMWare and run almost as well like it is on a real machine. I've told you that because acceleration is enabled in VMWare and the effects of disabling it.</p>
              <p>There will definitely be people who will run into problems when running Mac + Windows. There will definitely be people who has no problems running Mac + Windows.</p>
              <p>I don't see any point in arguing who's right or wrong. Whether or not something crashes, it's ultimately how you use it. I can crash Mac and Windows in a matter of minutes by doing stupid things to them. Just observe users do things and you will get some ideas to crash them.</p>
              <p>I can tell you that everything here is verifiable with a Google search. Right terms used will lead you to the proof that you want. You want to prove that Mac + Windows can run smoothly, it's not hard. You want to prove that Mac + Windows can't run smoothly, it's not hard either.</p>
              <p>On facts and figures:</p>
              <p>Figures, or should I say statistics, can be twisted by an individual to support a certain opinion. Same for facts. However, it's twisted in another way. Known facts are used to explain certain behaviour of humans, which then leads to one recommending an action for or against it, which is happening in this thread.</p>

              <p>Professional experience - Please elaborate and explain this. I have quite a few interpretations about this professional experience thingy and is not in a mood to type out everything on what I think.</p>

              <p>Missed this:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Surely you didn't google VMware just to find that paragraph to
                                      nitpick? Who says that it is crap if you turn off the acceleration,
                                      its whether a feature is supported or not and whether performance
                                      or stability is favoured. You're not doing the same thing blaming
                                      the OS layer again are you? Ever occurred to you that such crashes
                                      are due to the software not supported by VMware being buggy? Ever
                                      considered that it is no party's fault even cos it isn't within the
                                      normal design parameters?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>LOL, I must be damn bored. I didn't Google for VMWare just to nitpick. It's a known fact. Do you use VMWare? If you don't, I'm not going to say much. Get real hands-on experience on VMWare first.</p>
              <p>By the way, turning off VMWare's acceleration option, which in turn causes bad performance, it's not because of the OS. It's a problem of communication between both VMWare and the OS. Without this communication, performance is expected to take a hit.</p>
              <p>Also, crashes are not due to VMWare being buggy until otherwise proven, but a case of programs being buggy or just some feature. Some programs have certain functions that detect a virtualization environment and will purposely cause problems to it, which can cause funny problems to both the host OS and virtual OS.</p>

              <p>I'd suggest just getting a laptop than a mac. It's like wanting to buy a Ferrari and fitting it with a Toyota engine. I'm in the design field and most prefer a mac to do the job, but I prefer having an all-rounded machine for my needs, cheaper too.</p>
              <p>But again, it's your choice and it's just my opinion, since it's within your budget and you like the design of a macbook/m.pro and want to use Windows on it, it's pretty stable if you're just doing basic stuff like office programs, surfing the net and whatever. I say go for it!</p>
              <p>And to answer you question, regarding the worth to buy a mac to run WinXP. I'd say it's not worth it. You'd be wasting the extra cash.</p>

              <p>Using Vista atm on my PC, but I still prefer WinXP. Even though I dislike Mac in general, between the Macbook and the Macbook Pro. The metal casing may also be a hindrance due to the fact it overheats easily. It can get really hot after long usage.</p>
              <p>Again, if you want to bring worth into the picture, then it's still better to use a laptop with WinXP than a Mac. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Not true. I just got a Macbook Pro 15" 2.4GHz (Late '08 model) with 250GB HDD and 2GB DDR3 RAM @ $2,488 (usual price $2,788). I have to say it's a good deal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Chew on this well-know fact - Nobody claimed that VMware's acceleration feature works for everything, only when its supported and compatibile. How is that VMware's fault? Ever considered that many software simply were not meant to operate in such difficult environments with otherwise incompatible OS and hardware? That's why there's an on/off button (as with all things like your lightbulb). So what's your point again?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>By the way, turning off VMWare's acceleration option, which in
                                  turn causes bad performance, it's not because of the OS. It's a
                                  problem of communication between both VMWare and the OS. Without
                                  this communication, performance is expected to take a hit.</p>
              <p>Also, crashes are not due to VMWare being buggy until otherwise
                                  proven, but a case of programs being buggy or just some feature.
                                  Some programs have certain functions that detect a virtualization
                                  environment and will purposely cause problems to it, which can
                                  cause funny problems to both the host OS and virtual OS.</p>

              <p>Which is precisely the irrelevance of your post about the acceleration option.</p>
              <p>The whole point of this thread is about compatibility issues. But you paint it like its VMware's fault that the acceleration option "doesn't work all the time" with all things. Like the way people blame the OS when there's a million and one factors that are more likely at fault. What's your point then?</p>
              <p>My only conclusion is that this thread has posts that offend your Mac sensibilities and you want to dismiss things being said here. Typical.</p>

              <p>For that specs, you'd be paying half the price for a laptop. And with the same price you pay for that MBP, you'll prolly get waaaaay better specs. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Lots of truly stunning choices if you google say "White colour Laptops"? Especially since they are getting slimmer and lighter.</p>
              <p>My previous ASUS was white, loved it, constant conversation topic, still working great after 4-5 yrs but one word of caution. It stains and smudges easily over time. That's why my current is silver grey instead.</p>

              <p>Where did u read about Windows 7 usage? Even the experts are talking about feature sets only. Nobody's got any real inkling of usage yet. I've only heard of some using pre-release, pre-beta versions but hardly authoritative stuff.</p>
              <p>But already the signs are good enough to say wait and see. I agree on the general assessment in the industry, its a difficult time to make a decision now best hold off a short while more.</p>
              <p>Consider reading something authoritative like:</p>

              <p>Good deal vs which other choices as comparators? Can be more specific? For what kind of usage requirement? If anything, its what the very entertaining Laptop Hunters saga highlights consumers shld consider.</p>
              <p>That spec sheet at that price isn't that overwhelmingly cool to me. I just saw a Sony at IMM on Sunday barely $2K with better specs.</p>
              <p>BTW, 15" laptops are supposed to be dirt cheap. Cos there are no
              miniaturization requirements such as special components, nor space/volume/weight constraints nor heat dissipation
              issues.</p>

              <p>U've only "just" got your laptop and gushing about your purchase? Quite typical. Can u come back after say 6 mths of updates, patches and security fixes? Remember its not the OS or the hardware... its the interaction based on market forces and dynamics (not just Apple or  Windows'  updates but also 3rd party software vulnerabilities, includign L4D patches). In your report, include what else you have tried using the system for, what are the software you install and re-install.</p>
              <p>If you only use it as a glorified typewriter and reader, I certainly wouldn't expect any problems.</p>

              <p>There will definitely be people who will run into problems when

              <p>I don't see any point in arguing who's right or wrong. Whether
              or not something crashes, it's ultimately how you use it. I can
              crash Mac and Windows in a matter of minutes by doing stupid things
              to them. Just observe users do things and you will get some ideas
              to crash them.</p>
              <p>I can tell you that everything here is verifiable with a Google
              search. Right terms used will lead you to the proof that you want.
              You want to prove that Mac + Windows can run smoothly, it's not
              hard. You want to prove that Mac + Windows can't run smoothly, it's
              not hard either.</p>
              <p>Professional experience - Please elaborate and explain this. I
              have quite a few interpretations about this professional experience
              thingy and is not in a mood to type out everything on what I
              think.</p>
              <p>Also, crashes are not due to VMWare being buggy until otherwise
              proven, but a case of programs being buggy or just some feature.
              Some programs have certain functions that detect a virtualization
              environment and will purposely cause problems to it, which can
              cause funny problems to both the host OS and virtual OS.</p>
