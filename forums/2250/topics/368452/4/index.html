              <p>Very obviously i'm saying it's a very good deal when compared to it's original SRP. The spec sheet might not look cool to you, and that's your own personal opinion. You can keep that to yourself, but thanks for telling me. The thing is not about specs, it's about the OS. Give the kind of specs i have to a pc/laptop running vista and see how it falls, and HARD.</p>

              <p>The best example of your truisms and crap is that above line that I take issue with. One/two liner throw away comments that mean zilch and a waste of everybody's time.

              <p>With that kind of crap contribution, of course you can't see the amount of misinformation, myths and issues inherent in this thread. By claiming that only you are able to
                  see crap and correct them, you're disavowing the whole purpose of a public forum where people
                  participate. Really you ought to lurk in your own self-created
                  blog then, and moderate or allow/disallow comments on your own - not on
                  a public forum.</p>
              <p>The fact that you repeatedly claim that (1) You're not prepared to
                  type, (2) You can't be bothered to explain, (3) can't be bothered to
                  care etc. means that you should just stay out until you either gain
                  some knowledge or know enough or you finally bother enough. Like I
                  said, dun dive in like you're afraid you are missing out on a party.</p>
              <p>I also dun see any issue whether Parn needs to tell us anything. Why r u in such a hurry to end this thread? Its obviously a "want driven" issue, not a "need driven" issue but I've seen more cases of people making expensive purchases for things they dun need.</p>
              <p>But threads like this are far more useful in dispelling myths and misinformation than your superficial perceptions that prompt you to want to dismiss it. Lots of people are confused by the title of this thread. Few really know.</p>

              arise due to a function THEY included? Sounds like Boot Camp is a

              can run Windows on a Mac. Sweet!" and then Boot Camp doesn't work

              <p>The chips used on the Air are similar to the ones being used on
              the Acer Timelines. SU9XXX and SL9XXX CPUs. A problem I encountered
              on the E8135 iMac was that a core was somehow disabled on Windows,
              but not in OS X. Really odd. </p>
              <p>The display problem was probably due to the chipset glitch or
              something. Disk Utility WAS used, and so were some other

              the best way. </p>

              <p>And? If it's a "need" issue and they are asking for advice, all the points are valid. If it's a "want" issue, the points are still valid, but the point of a discussion?</p>
              <p>Studied Home Economics before? About the planning and buying of things? The wants vs the needs?</p>
              <p>I will still say the same thing - advice is advice. Changing one's opinion or decision is a no-no, especially if it's a "want", not a "need". We are not salesmen. We don't run a business. I have no gain from them making a certain choice. I don't lose anything because they make a certain choice. We are only here to give correct advice and our opinion; the users will decide themselves.</p>

              <p>Certainly, but it's definitely the wrong topic to discuss in. It's a want, not a need. Same issues are present, but really, the point of discussion other than costs?</p>

              <p>You're pretty ignorant. YES, I admit I installed Windows XP just for one game. But I was a Windows user since Windows 95. I know perfectly well how XP works and everything about it. So after installing it on my MBP, I tried it out to see whether is there any limitations (in terms of usage and not your continuous ranting about stability and interoperability.) and I found that there's none.</p>
              <p>You are complaining about interoperability simply because you are scrutinizing macs. You sound like you are some uber tech savvy guy that needs to be at the fore front when it comes to technology (and security/software updates and patches). Like I've said, I don't mind and won't care if future software updates for XP/Vista aren't compatible on my mac because Windows XP will no longer be the main OS I'm using.</p>
              <p>Obviously I also know that a guy is better off using a PC if Windows is all he uses. But you are also kinda blind? Parn wanted to run Windows on a MacBook because it looks nice and if Windows runs normally on it, that would be a plus point. So I was answering to his question, yes windows can run normally on a MacBook. But I wasn't implying running Windows on MacBook is better than running Windows on a PC. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>10% discount seems little in isolation, but please factor in the fact that Apple has and will always be rigid with their pricing. And I don't see where I've changed my tone at all. <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">Yes, I love my MBP and I don't see what's wrong with that. I love it because I can use a safer, faster and more stable OS (Mac OS X) and still be able to run XP on it. Unlike PCs, without a hack you cannot put Mac OS X in it. At least Apple is kind enough to provide Boot Camp Assistant as a legal way to install Windows OS on a Mac.<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></span></span></p>
