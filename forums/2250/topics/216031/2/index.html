Most of these have been addressed in Internet Explorer 7, but IE6 is still in widespread use.<br><br>Security<br><br>Much criticism towards Internet Explorer is related to concerns about security: Much of the spyware, adware, and computer viruses across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer, sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves. This is known as a "drive-by download": an attempt to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software's true purpose in the description section of an ActiveX security alert.<br><br>While Internet Explorer is not alone in having exploitable vulnerabilities, its ubiquity has resulted in many more affected computers when vulnerabilities are found. Microsoft has not responded as quickly as competitors in fixing security holes and making patches available. Not only are there more security holes discovered in Internet Explorer, but these vulnerabilities tend to remain unpatched for a much longer time, in some cases giving malicious web site operators months to exploit them before Microsoft releases a patch. Several companies maintain databases of known security vulnerabilities that exist in Internet Explorer, for which no fixes have been published by Microsoft. As of May 28, 2006, Secunia reports 104 vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. 19 are unpatched, of which the most severe is rated "extremely critical". In contrast, Mozilla Firefox, the main competitor to Internet Explorer, is reported to have only 36 security vulnerabilities. 3 remain unpatched, of which the most severe is rated "less critical".
