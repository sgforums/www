              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>An ace ball cannot be returned, so is Acer service. I bought an Acer PC
              end January and there was a problem optical disc writer. It couldn’t write to UDF
              ruining my CD-R and CD-RW discs, making them useless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>On Mar 14, I called helpdesk which was like more than 20 minutes waiting
              in line to speak with a human being. They couldn’t give me a solution and
              requested some time to investigate. The next day I got a call that an engineer
              would come to site to check. The appointment was to be an embarrassing week
              later.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>At the appointment date, I waited and waited but nobody showed up; not
              even a courtesy call. In the night, I put in an email at their website to
              complain for the no show.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Nothing happened the next day, no calls or emails. In fact nothing
              happened, not until when I called their helpdesk 5 days later. It was only then
              they FOUND OUT THAT THEY DID NOT ATTEND TO ME. This revelation triggered off the
              usual ‘Dear John’ apologies and a top-priority re-appointment but there was no
              mention of what if I hadn’t call and what my loss was for all the time wasted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>I told them firmly that I wasn’t going to accept all these ‘Dear John’
              apologies. The last authority I spoke with promised me her immediate boss was
              to call me but he didn’t, obviously because he didn’t make that promise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>At this top-priority re-appointment, an engineer came and spent more
              than an hour testing the optical disc writer but failed to find a solution. The
              other option of replacing the disc writer couldn’t be carried out as he didn’t
              have any with him. In the meantime, I got email addresses of his superiors and
              sent them complaint emails but they chose to ignore and not reply. So another
              appointment was set to replace the drive. The drive was replaced with another
              of the same make and model. After more than half an hour of testing the problem
              still remains. He said he had to pass this on to their technical department.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Later he called saying that a service pack software upgrade would solve
              the problem. I did and ruined some more CD-R and CD-RW. A couple of days later
              he called to check and another appointment was fixed. He came and tested ok
              using his discs but failed using mine. As he was more prepared he replaced the
              drive with another after the failure, a different make and model. This time it
              solved the problem but my dead discs remained dead.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">This clearly shows poor service and
              responsibility. They did not solve the problem on their own. In fact they
              didn’t know of such problem that the OS had a software problem or their original
              installed drive had a compatibility problem. I was their R&amp;D guinea pig who
              had to sacrifice my own time and discs for their benefit. What difference or
              benefit do we find in a branded Acer PC and a no-brand self-assembled one? The
              next question is why buy Acer? Is it because Acer Serves Aces?</span></p>

              <p>they said servicing my laptop will be around 3  - 5 days.</p>
              <p>i still don't have it back, its almost 2 and a half weeks.</p>
              <p>reason: they do not have the parts that my laptop carry, and delivery will take 2 weeks. i am very amazed. later they called again and told me another part is faulty. expected arrival date is end of this month.</p>

              <p>What i dont like about HP laptops is the service centre's location. Although It took 5 days for hp to fix my keyboard (my fault cause i send on friday) cause no part, but they kept apologising and they send to my home address, and the keys to the keyboard were new =D</p>
              <p>The best sv i got was from Sony, i once had a problem with their keyboard, the attachment holding the keys of the keyboard broke, although it's stated in the warranty that exterior parts are not covered by the warranty, they still replace it FOC and on the spot, the other time when i had problems with my touch pad, then 2 days alr, i call them say i need it urgently, they say no part, but on  the 3rd day afternoon, they say that the fix alr and ready for collection ( dunno if they use another part from another laptop or what) and they change my screen for me.</p>

              <p>every brand's service has its bad side. i have yet to see lenovo's bad side though.</p>
              <p>HP used to be good to me but recently 1 of my client's printer was unable to print the company logo properly. whenever the printer prints a graphic, there will be a vertical line. pure text document will be fine. called up HP, diverted to their tech support, tried a whole lot of things, still unable to rectify. given a case ID to follow up because the problem was put on hold while the tech support look elsewhere for solutions. 2 months and no reply. called them up again, told the CSO the problem and gave them the case ID. the freaking CSOs (i hung up and called thrice because they just refused to listen to me even when i explained to them the situation) kept asking me to do the standard troubleshooting steps. pissed off, i followed the steps and was eventually given another case ID for the unsolved problem. </p>
