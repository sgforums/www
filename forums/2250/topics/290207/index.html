People also want to come and live here from all over the world,' he said.<br><br>The firm wants international and local workers experienced in product development, operations and infrastructure design, engineering, and engineering support.<br><br>They would not just walk into a job, however. The hiring process begins with an engineering test taken over the Internet and then a further test where applicants must solve an engineering problem on a whiteboard in front of the company's best boffins.<br><br>And that is just to get to the interview stage.<br><br>There are more than 164 million PayPal accounts in the world from 190 markets. These transacted more than US$12 billion (S$17.4 billion) in the third quarter of this year.<br><br>The 17 currencies supported by PayPal include the Singapore and US dollars, Japanese yen and Czech koruna.<br><br>Making online purchases<br><br>PAYPAL is an online service that allows individuals, online vendors and businesses to transact payments securely over the Internet.<br><br>Users can link their PayPal accounts to their credit card or bank account to pay for purchases online at supported businesses.<br><br>This means that they will not have to give out credit card information to the vendor.<br><br>It facilitates payments in 17 different currencies.<br><br>For example, a Singaporean can buy goods from a Swedish business and pay for them using his Singapore bank account. The payment is automatically converted to Swedish kronors.<br><br>PayPal was acquired by eBay - the world's largest auction website - in 2002, and is a common method of payment for auction winners.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
