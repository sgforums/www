Or will DHCP prevent that?<br></div></blockquote>The solution is to use a static IP outside of the DHCP range. For example, if your DHCP server is configured to issue 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.253, use 192.168.1.99 as your static IP.<br><br>Let's say if you have a static IP that's within the DHCP range. If you are already plugged into the network, the DHCP server will not issue your static IP as it already exists on the network. However, say you turn off your PC and another PC joins the network and obtains that IP. Once you rejoin the network with your static IP, there will be an IP address conflict.<br><br>However, it's best to avoid this issue completely by using an address outside the DHCP range.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Will there be issues if I leave both DHCP enabled on the router and the computer while using a static IP address to connect to the router?

There should be no problem leaving the DHCP server enabled on the router.<br><br></div>

What you are doing is taking the chance that your DHCP server won't issue up to the end of the range. It will probably work for him in this example because it's unlikely he will have 90+ laptops connecting to his router but it's still better to do it properly and use an IP address that OUTSIDE of the DHCP range. Then there's NO chance of conflict.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>How about trying without the DNS servers? It's kind of crazy at times.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>You MUST have DNS set in your laptop. if you do not, your laptop will not be able to resolve domain names. It's up to you whether you want to enable the DNS relay server in your router. This usually just acts as a DNS proxy for your ISP DNS server (unless you have a really advanced router). Personally, I prefer to manually configure the ISP DNS like he has done.<br><br>If you think you have problems with your DNS, try flushing the DNS cache on your laptop.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ipconfig /flushdns</span></div>
