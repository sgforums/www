            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Dell replacement batteries have limited warranty </strong><br><br>By The Letterman: Friday 29 December 2006, 09:02<br><br>Dear Inquirer,<br><br>I wonder if you can help?<br><br>Are you aware of any problems with the replacement batteries that Dell have recently supplied under their battery replacement program?<br><br>When Dell recalled batteries earlier this year, my Inspiron 6000 model (out of warranty - about 14 months old then), was affected and I needed the battery replacing. I went through the Dell website to establish this and eventually received my new battery. I sent the old one back, as requested.<br><br>Well, would you believe it! Two days ago, the new battery packed up and died. It is four months old. The Dell software clearly states that my battery is in need of replacement.<br><br>When I informed Dell of this, they cheerily told me that the replacement battery only had a warranty of three months and that I would have to buy a new one.<br><br>Helpfully, they did give me the number to call, where I would be relieved of the extra cash.<br><br>Do you know of any other situations like this? Are you interested at all?<br><br>sincerely<br><br>Name and address supplied<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/policy/en/policy?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;~ck=lf&amp;~section=010" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/policy/en/policy?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;~ck=lf&amp;~section=010</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quite bad, since if the warantee is for 3 months for the replacement batteries, then the 4th month you got to buy a new set of batteries.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Better off if you dun replace them in the first place? but risk fire?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dell limited battery warranty is a swindle<br><br>Letters The boys in blue need to be called in<br><br>By The Letterman: Tuesday 02 January 2007, 17:42<br><br>SUBJECT: Dell replacement batteries have limited warranty<br>American Law is virtually the same as English Law on things like this. Your correspondent will be delighted to know that this type of case has already been tested. Where a product is faulty, whether formally declared or not, and a replacement issued, the warranty clock starts ticking again as if the product were brand new and purchased as of the date the replacement is received (NOT posted by Dell!).<br><br>Attempts for suppliers to limit replacement warranties in this way (which is common and relies on ignorance of Law), whatever they wish to say in small print, renders them doubly guilty, also on seeking to impose 'unfair terms', maybe even fraud, which could be a criminal offence. Your correspondent should trot along to his small claims Court with offending product, full documentation and allow the judge/magistrate to adjuducate the extent as well as the quantum of penalty Dell should be served with, and whether the boys in blue need to be called in.<br><br>Subject: Dell battery Warrenty<br><br>The 3 months thing seems typical of most companies. I know with new laptops for example...you may get the 3 year super warrenty but the battery is only covered for a year.<br><br>Batteries die. Sometimes it takes years, sometimes not. S#it happens right?<br><br>E<br><br>Subject: replacement batteries<br><br>Three months warrenty on a battery, thats a disgrace. I take it then the replacement batteries were brought as cheap as possible to minimize Dells profit loses.<br><br>chris<br><br>Subject: replacement batteries<br><br>Dear Letterman!<br><br>When the Battery of my 11 month old Acer Laptop died they told me that the battery only has a warranty of 3 months. The annoying part was that the battery was perfectly fine one day and refused to work the next day. Anyway I had to shell out 120Â€ for a new battery - which funnily enough died after 4 months again...now I'm enjoying a laptop without the portability. Sincerely,<br>Michael<br><br></div>
