              <p>Hi, In most cases where a DIY PC ended up cannot booting at all, crash and only to find that there is no default settings in BIOS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have ended up reset using the default settings, but the problem is that since then i have saved and find that the computer totally crashed, no response and the only way is to pluck out the battery (After forced shutdown and days of cooled down) and reset (Put back the battery after hours --- And the process continues where the next bootup with the BIOS screen prompt for no settings etc.....).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this a batt issue? PSU is brand new.</p>

              <p>It sounds like a battery issue to me.</p>

              <p>Most probably it is the battery issue. The reason is that the use of the battery inside the motherboard is to give the electronics inside some charges, so that when you power down the computer, the clock still runs</p>

              <p>Yes, at first, there is no setting. So I reset it and the date is like 2000 or so. But then after I reloaded the default settings, when I pressed save and exit, this is time where the computer hangs, monitor with no inputs but PC is running (I am not sure whats then going on).... and to solve that is to pluck out the battery which reset the setting (Switching off by forced shutdown and then later reopen the computer days later does not help)....</p>

              <p>Oh ya before I forgot, my pc has a problem of a "faulty ram slot". Currently it has 2X 256MB RAM (DDR 400) but the BIOS only showed 256MB RAM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given that I have extras and tested, I find that it is one of the particular slot is not functioning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: This ram issue come first before this BIOS not saved. Are they interconnected issue?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you  very much and help is appericiated.</p>

              <p>Hard to troubleshoot..hmm</p>
              <p>I will say try to change the battery first, just get the battery that is the same type</p>
              <p>THose battery that look like watch batteries shouldnt cost very expensive, if your watch uses the same battery i think it is fine to reuse them, as long as the type and voltages are the same</p>
              <p>Anyway i thnk those batteries are cheap.</p>
              <p>After you change the battery, i think the hanging should not continue, as the info should be saved directly onto the mobo instead of going to the ram, then back to the motherboard again.</p>
              <p>Faulty ram might cause hanging as well.</p>
              <p>When your PC didnt detect the ram, it may be that the ram was of higher speed than the one your motherboard can support, if the ram is supported, than the slot is faulty.</p>

              <p>O i see, the RAM slot was not upgraded at all. (I have 2 PC, one is this mentioned, the other was spoilt for long time ago where I kept my RAM as spares).</p>
              <p>Out of the 4 sticks of RAMs (2 from each PC), 3 of them are 256MB. The remainder is 128MB. All 4 of them are DDR 400 and the speed difference should be CL2(2.5) - 3(3.5).</p>
              <p>PS: Not very sure the CL now, but the range should be within the number without to within bracket.</p>

              <p>made so many mo and have yet to encounter problem like samuel.thinks if its crashed then motheboard might have been damaged from overheated components if its overclocked.but i did come across quite a few times computer mysteriously booted itself up while i was doing autocad.</p>
              <p>but eversince i found that a brand new laptop was even cheaper than the cheapest components mo ,ram etc at sim lim......i stopped building my own computers.</p>
