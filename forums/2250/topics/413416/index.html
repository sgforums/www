              <h1>The SGForums laptop brand guide</h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This guide is aimed at the first-time laptop buyer who can’t
                  make a prompt decision due to the wide range of brands available.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Let’s do this in descending alphabetical order.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Acer: </strong>One of the
                  most popular laptop brands in the market. Products are priced affordably, and
                  thus gained them wide recognition. Build quality, on the other hand, leaves
                  more to be desired. If you need some ample computing power on a budget though,
                  Acer is the brand to get. The keyboards have nice and big keys but typing feel
                  is average only. Sound quality is decent.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Alienware: </strong>A
                  division of Dell. Produces gaming laptops which are frankly overpriced. The
                  only model thus far that offers great value is the company’s M11x gaming
                  notebook. For an 11” laptop, it packs a lot of punch. If LED lights all over the laptop is your thing, then this
                  is the brand to get. On the other hand, if what you need is a no-nonsense gaming monster, you’re
                  better off with ASUS’ G-series. They offer much better performance at a price
                  that rivals or equals Alienware’s. Sound quality is average – loud but lacking.
                  Keyboard and typing comfort is average.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Apple: </strong>Their
                  notebooks are probably the most outstanding amongst all others. Easily spotted
                  from a mile away due to the unique all-Aluminium chassis. Apple is often
                  considered a premium brand. What you pay for here is the design, the Apple OS X
                  as well as the sturdiness of the chassis in particular. Performance is average
                  for a notebook, build quality is excellent and the keyboard is reasonably
                  comfortable to type on. The multi-gesture trackpad is also one of the best out
                  there. As far as sound quality goes, they sound rather tinny.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>ASUS: </strong>Notebooks
                  range from affordable to otherwordly expensive. Products also span a wide range
                  from basic Netbooks to premium gaming laptops like the G73. Build quality
                  ranges from decent to excellent, and the keyboards are generally awesome to
                  work on. You can set your mind at ease purchasing an ASUS laptop as they have
                  one of the lowest failure rates amongst all brands. ASUS laptops have the best
                  keyboards I have experienced thus far. Audio quality depends on the model you
                  get. The worst ones sound muffled at best, and the best ones (N series) are a
                  joy to listen to. Most of them are equipped with Altec Lansing branded audio, but since the speakers
                  are lap-firing, audio is muffled when you use the notebook on your lap. Some
                  models though, offer an Altec Lansing or Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEPower soundbar
                  that is located in the traditional position – above the keyboard. The sound
                  quality from those setups are excellent, and contend with HP’s Beats/Altec
                  Lansing and trade blows with similarly excellent sound setups from Toshiba and
                  Lenovo that utilise JBL or harman/kardon speakers.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Axioo:</strong> A small
                  Singaporean startup company, producing low-end laptops and netbooks. Definitely
                  recommended if all you need is a spare computer to use in case your main laptop
                  or desktop PC breaks down. Reliability and build quality are questionable
                  though – we often see these notebooks with flexing keyboards and panels that
                  don’t exactly fit properly. Their netbook keyboards are also rather awkward,
                  and makes comfortable typing an almost impossible feat.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Clevo:</strong> Maker of
                  fine custom gaming laptops. Also known as Sager. Price of those laptops scale
                  nicely with the power they provide. A fine alternative to Alienware and ASUS.
                  Sound quality is above average, and the keyboards are reasonably nice to type
                  on. Nothing special. Durability is excellent, just like Asus.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Compaq:</strong> A
                  subsidiary of HP. Laptops share the same chassis and same problems as HP’s, and
                  also come from the same factory line. The ProBook lookalike range from Compaq
                  perform; and have build quality that is on par with HP’s best. Sound quality
                  from Compaq is also excellent in general – thanks to good placing of
                  high-quality Altec Lansing speakers. The keyboards are quite a joy to type on.
                  The drawbacks are that Compaq is plagued by the very same problems that plague
                  HP – namely a tendency to overheat, abysmal battery life per charge, and
                  generally unreliable hardware for their mainstream products.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Dell: </strong>Parent
                  company of Alienware. As far as my experience with Dell goes, laptops are
                  rather well-built and last much longer without needing repairs than compared to
                  their desktop counterparts. Specifications are on par with other brands, as far
                  as mainstream laptops go. Sound quality for most of them is above average.
                  Keyboard is a joy to clatter on – comparable with HP laptops.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>eMachines: </strong>A
                  company bought over by Acer. As such their laptops are built upon the same
                  chassis as Acer laptops. Performance is generally lacking as eMachines caters
                  to the budget category. Keyboard is disappointing just like Acer, sound quality
                  is average. Durability is also questionable.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Fujitsu:</strong> Generally
                  considered a premium brand. Specifications are average, and design is outdated
                  so to speak. The premium price comes from the durability and build quality of
                  these laptops. The keyboards are average in terms of feel, and sound quality is
                  tinny. Virtually indestructible under normal use.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Gateway:</strong> Yet
                  another company bought over by Acer. Durability is also questionable, with a
                  high failure rate reflected in polls. Specifications range from average to
                  above average. Shares a chassis with Acer and eMachines products. Keyboard is
                  different, however. Typing comfort is average – on par with Fujitsu.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>HP:</strong> One of the
                  biggest laptop companies out there. Products span a wide range just like ASUS.
                  Particularly outstanding is the company’s business-targeted ProBook and
                  EliteBook range. Build quality and typing comfort is excellent, and sound
                  quality is on par with the best of the best, thanks to well-positioned Altec
                  Lansing speakers. HP’s mainstream Pavilion range though, are disappointing
                  performers. They share the same chassis as a large majority of Compaq’s
                  laptops, and suffer from a slew of hardware problems and plagued by
                  overheating. HP is also let down by below-average battery life for most of its
                  models, hence falling far behind the competing brands in this aspect. On the other hand, the Altec Lansing speakers never seem to
                  disappoint. HP’s newly launched Envy series however, is worth
                  consideration. Battery life has been
                  improved significantly, though still weak compared to laptops from other
                  manufacturers. The Beats audio offers excellent sound quality on par with the
                  Altec Lansing models, and the Envy series comes with specifications your
                  friends will, uh, envy. Those who dislike the design of Apple’s laptops though, may
                  want to stay away from the HP Envy. They are styled very similarly to Apple’s
                  MacBook lineup, with the exception that HP does not have a monocoque chassis.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>IBM/Lenovo:</strong> Makers of the legendary ThinkPad series. Very sturdy laptops and virtually
                  indestructible just like Fujitsu. The ThinkPad series ranges in specification
                  from entry level to workstation-class. Keyboards are very comfortable to type
                  on, and I must really emphasise the stability of the keyboards here. Little to
                  no flex at all upon heavy hammering. Sound quality is average for these.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Lenovo: </strong>Bought
                  over some part of IBM, and along with the purchase was IBM’s ThinkPad line.
                  Lenovo ThinkPads work just like the description above. Lenovo also introduced a new line called the IdeaPad – these
                  are laptops with more powerful hardware and are aimed towards the casual user
                  who is looking for more entertainment features and/or gaming capability over
                  the durability of the ThinkPad series. Build quality of IdeaPad series
                  notebooks are above average, battery life is good and most models offer switchable
                  graphics to help conserve battery power. Employed in these laptops are speakers from JBL, thus
                  enhancing your audio experience. The sound quality is excellent and contends
                  with solutions from HP and ASUS (Altec Lansing), HP (Beats), Toshiba (harman/kardon)
                  and ASUS B&amp;O ICEPower.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>LG:</strong> The company
                  isn’t a newcomer to the notebook scene, but they usually stay out of the
                  limelight. Reliability is decent, except for the fact that most LG users
                  complain of high operating temperatures.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>MSI:</strong> A newcomer to
                  the notebook scene, just like Asus. Notebooks are usually geared toward the
                  gamer or power user, with powerful graphics and large screens. Reliability and performance is on par on Asus. Just like with Asus, if you
                  can’t justify forking out that much cash for an Alienware gaming notebook, go
                  for Asus or MSI as well.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Panasonic:</strong> Makers
                  of the Toughbook rugged laptop line. Those things can survive just about any
                  condition. Great choice if you’re forced to work in extreme conditions. Besides the Toughbook line though, Panasonic doesn’t really
                  make anything else, and power users or gamers won’t be expressing interest in
                  the Toughbook as they lack gaming performance.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Samsung:</strong> A
                  newcomer in the notebook scene. So far, they haven’t really offered anything
                  geared toward the enthusiast or gamer, but as far as business, entertainment or
                  domestic use notebooks are concerned, Samsung offer pretty well-rounded models
                  that will cater nicely to such users. Screen quality is one of the best, seeing
                  how Samsung’s excellent panel technology makes its way into its notebooks as
                  well.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Sony:</strong> Sony’s
                  notebooks always go by the ‘VAIO’ moniker. Often competing with Apple on the
                  pricing scale, Sony puts out laptops that, while aren’t very technologically
                  advanced, offer a very nice ergonomic computing experience. Keyboard feel is
                  among one of the most comfortable, and build quality is nothing short of
                  excellent. If classy isn’t your thing, Sony also offers models that come in
                  shiny lacquered colours that stand out in any situation. If you’re looking for
                  cost-effectiveness though, Sony isn’t the vendor to approach. Despite the
                  excellent build quality, problems arise every now and then – the most prominent
                  being the mass-recall of overheating Sony laptops.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Toshiba:</strong> Known
                  for making really reliable laptops. Their products tend to run on the warm side
                  though. Excellent choice if you want an entertainment or gaming notebook that
                  will last for years. Just like Fujitsu, Toshiba does charge a small premium,
                  and this is what you pay for quality.</p>
