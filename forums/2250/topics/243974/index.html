            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about Vista, Vista definitely handles resources much more better than the other versions of OSes MS has produced. It's the way they handle startup programs that greatly improve the performance of Vista.<br><br>Although Vista has lots of process starting, only a few are under startup, so memory resources could be given priority to them, rather them to all processes that are listed in the Task Manager.<br><br>Vista fancy looks is what kills this good memory management. The aero looks of Vista, is actually very similar to the KDE desktop in Linux. KDE desktops in Linux has a glassy look, which MS has copied (not entirely, just the idea and named it Aero). Some Linux users will tell you that KDE does in fact slow down the PC a lot, and GNOME, Xfce or IceWM is preferred. I myself prefer Xfce, looks nice and doesn't use up of resources.<br><br>Compatibility issue wise, it's a step backward because not many are as enthusiastic when compared with XP. When XP was released, it was supported by most hardware. Drivers were also readily available. Same for software. The reason for this is because it's based on Windows NT and Windows 2000. Programs that work on these platforms will work on XP.<br><br>On the other hand, Vista is being completely rewritten. It's being completely overhauled. Hardware wise, the minimum is based on 2002 PC standards. Since Vista is being overhauled, drivers have to be rewritten as well. Softwares have to be completely rewritten since Vista is being rewritten as well. It takes time to write and test the programs, so don't expect everything to be in order until at least the mid of this year.<br><br>Coming to the issue on Mac laptops, I would hardly agree on viruses. Those who surf carefully, practise safe hex should have no problems. This applies to those using Windows as well. As long as one practises good computer practices, nothing will hurt your PC. Windows is more vulnerable because it has the majority of the market share, and it makes sense to attack them. As Mac starts gaining popularity, the number of critical fixes have also been found. Same for Linux, as it's also a Unix-based OS. If something can attack Mac, Linux won't be spared.<br><br>Compatibility issues on Mac isn't a great problem, as most companies will release a Mac compatible program. Books on using Mac are widely available, same for resources. This is not quite true for games, as not all games are compatible. Since Mac has moved over to use Intel chips, expect game support to improve, at the same time, keep your fingers crossed. Programmers cater to the majority, not minority, so if the games situation on Mac doesn't improve, just install Windows on Mac, using Boot Camp.</div>
