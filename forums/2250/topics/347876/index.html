              <p>6th Feb - Experienced severe lag from 10:30pm to 1am</p>
              <p>8th Feb - Same thing happened</p>
              <p>10th Feb - Same thing happened but lag continued beyond 2am</p>
              <p>12th Feb - Same incident as the 10th</p>
              <p>13th Feb - Exactly midnight experienced the same severe lag</p>
              <p>The lag i experienced is not total disconnection due to some of my internet applications still being able to connect but unable to fully utilise. Web browsing felt like back when i first bought a 14.4bpps Modem in 1995...</p>

              <p>I experience the same and even more problems than you.</p>
              <p>STARHUB SUCKS BIG TIME, they don't care about providing good service.   They are very nice and diplomatic on the surface but IN ACTUAL FACT THEY CANNOT BE BOTHERED TO PROVIDE GOOD INTERNET SERVICE.</p>
              <p>Now I have enough people complaining about them having problems surfing starhub land and mobile broadband.</p>
              <p>Please pass the word around to tell people not to use Starhub, don't wish to let them suffer like us.    Please do them this favour.</p>
              <p>My worst, the technical team even came down to do some network a couple of times and i upgraded my firmware version but still have lots of problems.    ONce the <span style="color: #ff0000;">technician told me there is nothing they can do to solve the problem.  I told him it is not my problem at all as I have no problem surfing singnet broadband on mobile and land line.</span>   Even upgrading the firmware is also a prob.    </p>
              <p>PEOPLE, FOR YOUR GOOD PLEASE DON'T USE STARHUB.</p>

              <p>I am aware alot of people do indeed complain about Starhub services but on my end disruption rarely occurs. So i am not too sore about it that i would cancel my subcription</p>
              <p>But i am very disappointed they cant give me a straight answer and telling me to check my cables as if they magically disconnected themselves and to check my modem and router. I used to work in IT so i told the operator i already did before i called.</p>
              <p>If there is a service disruption, its totally fine if they inform me and maybe i wont be so pissed off and if they compensated me accordingly i would also be happy about it.</p>

              <p>I have been a long time user of singnet since i signed up for a 256 kbps plan almost 8/9 years ago, and had been getting free upgrades till the current 8 Mbps plan.</p>
              <p>Never had any problems with the connection, this could be due to the fact that the telephone exchange is just next to mine house, resulting in a very low attenuation level and high nose margin level in mine line. You might want to consider the red pipe, even though the customer service is equally bad, at least you will have a stable connection.</p>

              i am at the west side...the maxonline was down for 2 days after a maintenance by starhub...this disconnection thing is not new, months ago i suffered almost 4 days with no internet...there was a faulty component at their junction box at the foot of my block....i suspect the same thing this time round or it must be their sub-con who screwed up during the maintenance....i also saw m1 doing cabling works and since they are riding on starhub network for their broadband service, that may also be another possibility....
              
              what was irritating was their sop, having been with them for more than 6 years, i am more than familiar with their protocol and their insistence on me during a whole host of test irks me when i've already done so before calling them....'could be the splitter, or the router, or the modem and blah blah....then they send down a sub-con tech guy who usually cannot resolve the issue but you are still charged the $30....
              
              i do have max mobile as a backup during such times...
              
              as for singnet, had used them years ago, but didn't like their less than stellar speed then...anycase, the problems seem random too, i know of folks with issues for either isp....

              <p>i am at the west side…the maxonline was down for 2 days after a maintenance by starhub…this disconnection thing is not new, months ago i suffered almost 4 days with no internet…there was a faulty component at their junction box at the foot of my block….i suspect the same thing this time round or it must be their sub-con who screwed up during the maintenance….i also saw m1 doing cabling works and since they are riding on starhub network for their broadband service, that may also be another possibility….</p>
              <p>what was irritating was their sop, having been with them for more than 6 years, i am more than familiar with their protocol and their insistence on me during a whole host of test irks me when i’ve already done so before calling them….’could be the splitter, or the router, or the modem and blah blah….then they send down a sub-con tech guy who usually cannot resolve the issue but you are still charged the $30….</p>
              <p>i do have max mobile as a backup during such times…</p>
              <p>as for singnet, had used them years ago, but didn’t like their less than stellar speed then…anycase, the problems seem random too, i know of folks with issues for either isp….</p>

              <p>call billing dept and request for bill adjustment.    YOu need not pay for the days you can't surf, it is not your fault you cannot surf.</p>
              <p>STarhub internet sucks big time.    I believe they take cost into consideration whether to go ahead to solve all these probs or not.    I believe the cost of doing so must be very high so they not willing to do it and the ones who suffer are people like us.</p>
              <p>Don't sign up with starhub after contracts ends.</p>
              <p>I have non stop prob and it is not my fault but they are not willing to allow me to terminate my contract.</p>
