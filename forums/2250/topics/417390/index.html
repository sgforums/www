              </p><div>There's nothing to be alarmed about Windows not being genuine. I can't give you an explanation as to why it happens, but<strong> I have experienced this issue on my friend's and my own laptop.

              <div><br></div>
              <div>If you are still unsure if anyone has done something to your laptop, do this. Refer to your Toshiba user menus/ support website that come with your laptop OR search your model number on the web on how to reformat it. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>You do not require <strong>any discs to reformat your system. It's a matter of pressing some F-x keys during start up to access the option to reformat your system.</strong></div>

              <p>The title of this thread is quite defamatory in my opinion, but I will still let it be like this. </p>
              <p>What I can say from my experience is it's normally a driver or hardware issue that's causing your laptop to have memory dumps, which will affect this. I have said earlier I do not know the reason as to why it happens, a good guess from me would be a corruption of files- thus the dump. </p>
              <p>the second thing is when you first got your laptop,<strong> you would have gone through the setup process where Windows would have asked you to type in your user name and password.</strong> There would also be a screen that would ask you to activate your laptop (which you could delay after you finish your setup and till you get an internet connection.)</p>
              <p>If you have done all that, <strong>without windows asking you for any activation keys</strong>, then <strong>it's definitely an OEM pre installed operating system</strong>, and there is nothing to worry, and that Harvey Norman did not meddle with your operating system.</p>
              <p>However, if you bought a set which has already gone through the pre setup phase (aka most display sets), and if you want a peace of mind, please do back up your laptop and reformat it (You will be bought to a screen like I have said above, and it will NOT ASK YOU FOR ANY ACTIVATION KEY.) </p>
              <p>Commercial operating systems differ from OEMs as they do ask for the product key or aka the activation key. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I don't see any fault Harvey Norman have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First crash dump message - has more to do with driver compability - which most likely you have install something that is not very comparable to window 7.  <br><br>Next most laptop are pre-prepared at the factory and boxed and sealed. Unless you buying a used or displayed set - I don't think anyone in Harvey Norman is so free or hardwork to take it out to mettle with it and put it back.</p>
              <p>Your old fujitsu - running on what OS ?  not window 7 !!! You are here like complaining about your DVD player cannot play blue-ray disk !!!</p>

              <p>If windows wasn't genuine in the first place, its not possible that you manage to use for 2-3 months as a non-genuine can only last for 30 days if i'm not wrong. So highly likely is corruption issue.</p>
              <p>There should be some recovery options you can use to format your disk during startup. if not you could try the BIOS.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I purchased a Toshiba Satellite L635 from
              the Harvey Norman booth at the recent Comex show on Sept. 2010 held
              at Suntec Covention Hall. Thinking I got a very good deal, I
              brought it home happily. Little was I to know that the following
              2-3 months was more like hell for me. Firstly, when I started the
              Laptop and did my work, after a few minutes I get a “crash dumping
              message” interrupting my work. Thereafter, I get a message that
              warned me that my <strong>Windows 7 is not genuine</strong>. How is
              that possible? I thought all new laptop set sold through the
              retailers come with pre-installed genuine Windows operating
              system?<span> </span> My several calls to Toshiba and
              even Microsoft yielded no satisfactory replies. I can only conclude
              that the Harvey Norman staff must have done ‘something’ to the
              operating software or else how can such a thing happen? My old
              Fujitsu, when I first purchased it , till now has never given me
              such a problem. <span> </span>Should this problem
              happened in the first place?</span></p>

              <p>The best is to bring notebook with the proof of purchase to Toshiba service centre and make a complain with microsoft singapore if service centre find the the windows 7 is not original. And you can ask the service centre to reinstall the windows 7 for you.</p>
              <p>The windows 7 recoverly program should in the first place can be find in the hard disk. If you cannot find it there means HN staff has remove it or they put in a hard disk for testing but forget to put back the original hard disk from the notebook. </p>

              <p>yes Court is the worst place to buy.<br><br>The price may sometime look a little cheaper then others ! But if you check the model carefully you understand why !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because they selling older model at the price a little low then people new model only.  On price they may seem cheaper by little but in real - it is not worth it.</p>
