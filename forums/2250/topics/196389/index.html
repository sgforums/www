            <div class='col-md body'>I recently replaced my aged XDA II with the XDA IIs, and am quite delighted by it's speed and robust built.<br><br>Now with Windows Mobile 2003 SE installed, it seems much better.<br><br>However, it still hangs now and then. It hangs about 2 to 3 times a week, but it depends on how much I used the PDA during the day. But I usually do a soft reset at the end or start of each day, this clears up its memory of any misbehaving applications.<br><br>I am generally pretty pleased with the unit, and would just like to hear from your expreience and solutions discovered.<br><br>I have changed all of its ringtones to custom made ones, in that every contact is given a specific ringtone - by the way, the ringtones are all voice overs done by a local female DJ. Installed is a Kingstone 1Gb SD Card, and several paid downloaded programs from Handango. So far, everything is dandy.<br><br>At present I'm curious to know if I can upgrade its internal memory from its paltry 128Mb to perhaps 512Mb? I have a hunch that more internal memory may shorten battery standby or talk time?<br><br>Your inputs on this will be most appreciated.<br></div>

All these while, I know it is Windows' memory management algo that causes the hangs, not so much the device.<br><br>I find the sliding keyboard just ok, although I NEVER use it all - you see I have bad eye-sight (long sighted).  I never looked at another mobile phone again since I started using O2 in 2004, because the phone buttons in XDA II &amp; IIs, is VERY visible. Those new phones in the market are so small these days, they should come packaged with a mini magnifying glass!<br><br></div>
