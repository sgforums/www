It definitely looks promising, but it will only make an impact similar to Flash during the pre-DHTML era, in my opinion.<br><br>Indeed, it's easier on the web developers as they don't have to pick up another few more languages to code a desktop application, and Adobe solves the OS platform compatiblity issues for them as well. But the barrier of having to download and to install the application for the users remains. The HTML and JS code may not be rendered in the exact same way as on web browsers unless it's WebKit-based such as Safari. So it's just as good as pushing everyone to use Safari to surf the web. And even if this AIR thing gets popular, Microshyt is simply going to come out with a clone and replaces the technologies within with its own proprietary ones (say, instead of WebKit, they use their own IE rendering engine), just like Flash and Silverlight. So at the end of the day, the web developers are simply getting more headaches with all these new, emerging technologies.<br><br>To add on, due to the difference how security issues are handled by web browsers and AIR, a moderate to large-scale web application will probably not be able to fit into both platforms without major editing required to adapt to one of them.<br><br>Furthermore, if a programmer only needs to create a cross-platform desktop application, that dear old coffee-flavoured Java will always be there.<br></div>

In the case of Comet, the connection initiated by the client remains open until there is a data transfer triggered by a modification of data on the server, so in a way it is event-driven.<br></div>

I doubt I'd get the chance to since I'm moving out of this industry. =)<br><br>One thing I've noticed ever since XML and Web Service.  When a transmission is "read friendly" for humans, like how XML and its Schemas are, its seldom efficient.  I'm a strongly advocate letting machines read XML and improve its transmission efficiency to reduce the amount of de-compiling and recompiling as possible.  No human should need to be able to read XML.  If its needs to be readable, build a separate application to do so.  There is no point receiving performance penalties of being "human friendly" when hardly anyone looks at what goes between web service applications, or what is being updated in an AJAX standard page.</div>
