            <div class='col-md body'>July 30th, 2007<br><br>Posted by Mary Jo Foley @ 8:07 am<br><br>Worthwhile?   MicrosoftÂ’s next version of its small-business/home productivity suite, due imminently, will be free and ad-funded.<br><br>Microsoft Works 9.0 Â— which will be the new productÂ’s name, if Microsoft opts to stick with its current nomenclature Â— might also debut at some point as Microsoft-hosted low-end productivity service, as many have been speculating. A hosted version of Works would give Microsoft a head-to-head competitor with Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheets and other consumer- and small-business focused services, analysts have said.<br><br>For the time being, however, the new version of Works will be ad-funded, according to Satya Nadella, the newly minted Corporate Vice President of MicrosoftÂ’s Search &amp; Advertising Platform Group. Nadella told me during an interview on July 27 that Microsoft recently released the new ad-funded version of Microsoft Works.<br><br>If Works 9.0 is out, I havenÂ’t found it yet Â— other than a couple download links on torrents and other sharing sites. Anyone else seen it?<br><br>(IÂ’ve asked Microsoft for more information on the new ad-funded Works suite. No word back yet. Update:  Even though MicrosoftÂ’s own vice president discussed the product, no one will talk. The official comment, via a Microsoft spokeswoman: Â“WeÂ’re always looking at innovative ways to provide the best productivity tools to our customers, but have nothing to announce at this time.Â”)<br><br>Nadella added that Works will be just Â“the first of the ad-funded software we are going to do.Â” When I asked for other examples of products might decide to make free and ad-funded, he mentioned Office Accounting Express Â— a product which is currently available as both a free download and as a component of certain Office Live paid subscriptions. He also said software downloads/shareware was another category ripe with products that could be free and ad-funded.<br><br>The decision to make Works ad-funded is not coming out of the blue.<br><br>Microsoft Works 8.0, which Microsoft introduced in 2004, sells for $49.95. It introduced the 8.5 OEM update to Works in 2006. Microsoft Works includes an address book, calendar, database, dictionary, PowerPointÃ® Viewer, basic Word, and templates. Traditionally, a number of PC makers have preloaded the Works product on low-end PCs. But with its Office Ready PC program, Microsoft has begun pushing PC makers to preload higher-margin Microsoft Office rather than the cheaper Microsoft Works, on new machines.<br><br>In his October 2005 Â“Internet Services DisruptionÂ” memo, Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie noted that Â“(p)roducts must now embrace a Â‘discover, learn, try, buy, recommendÂ’ cycle Â– sometimes with one of those phases being free, another ad-supported, and yet another being subscription-based.Â” He added: Â“Groups should consider how new delivery and adoption models might impact plans, and whether embracing new advertising-supported revenue models might be market-relevant.Â”<br><br>Even before Ozzie outlined his marching orders, Microsoft was mulling an ad-funded version of Works. According to a document seen by News.com in 2005, Microsoft was already running the numbers on what it would take to do an ad-funded version of its low-end suite. According to that report:<br><br>Â“If ad revenues exceed 67 cents per year, we could actually give Works away and still make more money,Â” two Microsoft researchers and one person from MSN stated in a paper presented to Chairman Bill Gates at a Thinkweek brainstorming session earlier this year.Â”<br><br>Do you think a free, ad-funded version of Microsoft Works Â— even if itÂ’s not a Â“serviceÂ” Â— will help Microsoft fight off Google and other Web-based productivity suite vendors? Do you still expect Microsoft to release a non-ad-funded, paid version of Works as a subscription service at some point?<br><br></div>
