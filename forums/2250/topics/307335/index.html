              <p>packet sniffer,tcp request, udp request, http requests, ftp respests... all can be tracked as long as u have the necessary program.</p>
              <p>Only thing is that the ISP usually dont track unless they have a very good reason to cos tracking is tedious and time consuming. even if its logged in their db it still means they have to retrieve them. corporate backends are usually less glamourous and intuitive to use than their client-side cousins.</p>
              <p>encryption just makes it a little bit harder.</p>
              <p>and torrents are not even using any form of encryption. they announce themselves to the seeds and peers throughout the peer list. go read the api/ wiki yourself.</p>

              <p>Unless you own your own routers and DNS servers, of course it can be tracked.</p>
              <p>Routers - not your home routers.</p>
              <p>Before you are able to surf, you need to connect to your ISP. Through your ISP, you get on the Net.</p>
              <p>When you connect and disconnect, there's always a log. For those own a router, you can quite easily tell it.</p>
              <p>Log in to your router. Look at the Status or Logs page. There, you will find some details like</p>
              <p>Own home network IP address - 192.168.x.x (where x is anything between 1 and 254)</p>
              <p>Public IP address - 121.x.x.x (Singnet)</p>
              <p>116.x.x.x (Singnet)</p>
              <p>220.255.x.x (Singnet)</p>
              <p>202.x.x.x (Starhub)</p>
              <p>The other ISP ranges I'm not so sure. That's how they track down. All they need is your ISP cooperation. That's why a lot of people are not happy when ODEX could get ISP logs. And... encryption doesn't help. Your first step to the Net is your ISP. You can't possibly encrypt this part. Unless you own your own ISP. That, you gotta ask APNIC. The chance of APNIC granting you this request is near zero, from experience.</p>
              <p>After your ISP, you can do anything want to hide your identity. Proxy, encryption, IP address changers, MAC address changers, whatever to hide yourself.</p>
              <p>Those people that were charged - is to send a stern warning to all illegal downloaders. Don't think because our telecommunications indicates that all ISPs must do something to protect your privacy, the laws can't harm you. There's an extra line which states with a court order, ISPs will have to release details. However that line is going to be abused, is not up to us discuss. If you intend to find out, you can read the whole ODEX thread.</p>
              <p>Downloading illegal stuffs won't increase your chance of being caught. But rather, it depends on two factors.</p>
              <p>1. Amount</p>
              <p>2. Uploads</p>
              <p>The more you download, the higher chance you expose yourself for getting caught. Coupled with a fixed price for unlimited usage, the chances of you leaving a computer on to download stuffs 24/7 isn't very slim.</p>
              <p>Plus, some people tend to download a lot at one go. A few movies, a few albums in less than one day. What ya think?</p>
              <p><strong>Uploads</strong></p>
              <p>With P2P technology, to get good download speeds, you have to learn to share. Uploading is P2P way of sharing. More downloads via P2P, more uploads.</p>
              <p><strong>How are people caught</strong></p>
              <p>The most common way I've heard of is through tip offs. But I believe this is a lie. Simply because the tip off is actually supplied by the people who wants these people to be caught (copyright association such as RIAS)</p>
              <p>Another way is through tracking. Various companies have developed several ways to catch downloaders, in particular P2P downloaders.</p>
              <p>How these programs work, you need an understanding of how P2P works. And there's a few kind of P2P networks, which doesn't make it easy.</p>
              <p>Torrents is probably the easiest, due to trackers and seeders.</p>
              <p>But Gnutella, eDonkey, etc use another type. Gnutella has a tree, leaves and sub leaves.</p>
              <p>Another method is through fake torrents. But this is easily fooled since P2P clients these days are able to tell if a torrent is real or fake.</p>
              <p>The last method that I know of is what some may term as espionage. This is particularly for private trackers.</p>
              <p>Skilled people are sent to sign up (if available) or share files with the P2P downloaders. This type of activity typically goes on for months or years before authorities finally make a kill.</p>
              <p>Based on what? Simple. Your IP address and other details through sniffers. As long as they are in the P2P network, that is. The last method isn't common, but is one of the most successful one. Sniffers are able to tell a lot of details just based on the headers alone. IP address is pretty reliable as most don't connect via any secure protocol, and as far as I know, not many P2P clients offer any secure connection of any sort.</p>

              <p>Not really. You can always connect to a VPN or a SOCKS server to act as a proxy for data transfer via a secure, encrypted connection and the most they could do is to log the gibberish chunks of data without the slightest hint of what you are sending or receiving, since data is encrypted from the point it leaves your computer when it is sent, until it reaches the other end, and vice versa. Not even an ISP can know what you are doing, unless you are some big-name spy from Russia and the ISP you are on have set up some super-duper-computer to brute-force decrypt the encrypted data within your internet connection. Anyway, here's one of the many VPN services available out there.</p>

              <p>If you are using bittorrent, your ISP doesn't know exactly what you are downloading. Your ISP doesn't really care what you are downloading as much as they care that you are utilizing large amounts of bandwidth.</p>
              <p>ISPs only 'know' what you are downloading when they receive a complaint. The evidence is usually gathered by third parties hired by content providers. They bascially just join the torrent and just capture the IP addresses of all the people downloading.</p>
              <p>This is why no one has received a letter for downloading porn. The porn industry hasn't done anything to address P2P. They are very concerned but at the same time, they don't want to draw too much attention to their industry so they are still carefully weighing their options.</p>

              <p>That's for deterring normal users from recovering any deleted stuffs. And it's sufficient enough.</p>
              <p>If you got someone who would pay thousands and thousands just to recover your data, the stats from DOD is wrong. In fact, it has updated. From previously 40++ times to now 100++ times.</p>
