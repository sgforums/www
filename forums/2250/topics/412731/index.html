I listen to online radio, and playing online games simultaneously. Then, my radio would stopped buffering and i get disconnected from my game. The DC only happens for like 5 secs? Then my radio start to play again and i can play my game.</p>
              <p>But, it is VERY frustrating as i keep gets disconnected.. i have dc-ed once just now too.</p>
              <p>I've called starhub, they told me to switch off for 1min and on again..problems still persists..bypassing the splitter (i told him that a starhub technician have already changed before) while the other told me to use direct connection to modem.</p>
              <p>But, i couldnt be using the comp at my living room to check the status right?!</p>
              <p>so please brothers..help me if possible! Thank You</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>You cant be using permanently at the living room, yes.</p>
              <p>But i recommend you to test out wired to determine whether the problem is due to wireless. Ethernet cable is quite common, so you should be able to borrow one even if you dont have it.</p>
