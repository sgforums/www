Where is your kitchen? Is it important that you receive your internet in the kitchen? As usual, try to find a location that is centralised and minimal obstruction for your router.<br><br>The poor man's method (as with all my methods) of finding where to place your booster:<br>Since you have a laptop, detect your wireless signal with your lappy. Walk around and keep track of where the signal drops to 3 bars or less (less than half of maximum strength). Take note where signal strength is erratic, weak and not present. From there, you can see where to place a booster to provide signal to all those places. Bear in mind that your booster needs the signal too, so don't put your booster in a place where the signal is erratic or not present.</div>

If your network is invisible, people would need more effort to find your network. Use the latest encryption that is available on your router. Even an old WEP is better than nothing.<br><br>Don't forward your ports unless absolutely necessary. Don't use DHCP. Use static IP addressing instead. If others can't guess your IP, they can't log into your network. Separate your wired and wireless networks. Linksys has this feature. Your wireless is less secure than your wired network and thus it is a good idea to separate them. Also, only allow your wired computer to access your router. This prevents hackers from accessing your router wirelessly.<br><br>Use strong passwords that is not subceptible to dictionary attacks. Estimate the maximum number of computers that will access the internet at any 1 time. Set the max connections to the router as such. ie. If you have 5 computers, but only 3 would be connected at any 1 time, then the router should only allow maximum of 3 computers to connect to the internet.<br><br>Also, some routers can set timings for the internet to be switched off. If you know that between say... 4am to 8 am everyday, no one would be using the internet, then keep set your router to disconnect from the internet at those times regardless of if its in use or not.<br><br>Of course all these does not guarantee that you'll be secured, you'll just be better protected.<br><br>If I made any mistakes or missed out anything, feel free to point it out.
