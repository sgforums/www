              <p>hi all.</p>
              <p>i wanna get a gaming PC at the current PC fair, but i am lost as in there are so many of them, and i don't really know which is the real deal, which one is not worth the buy.</p>
              <p>i always look out for those "package" CPU because i am not a tech pro, so i don't go DIY my cpu.</p>
              <p>seems like HP only sells printer and inkjets at this fair, leaving acer and dell to sell CPU.</p>
              <p>i don't really need the monitior i only want the CPU can i like tell them and change the monitior into sth else for example extra RAM or bigger C drive or lower the price ?</p>
              <p>my budget for the CPU is lesser or equal to 1k.</p>
              <p>i am also looking for the anti-virus called "ESET smart security" are they in the fair also ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many thanks in advance !</p>
              <p>cheers :)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>@Kyutake: 1k for gaming CPU is no joke. Casing and everything, Quad core, good graphics card (Mid-range like GTS 250/HD 4770/HD 4850 etc.). Of course, must build yourself lah. 2.5k gets you a Core i7+Multiple GPU system.</p>

              <p>ya self built is definately better.</p>
              <p>Nowadays most games require high performance type.</p>
              <p>1k really no joke.</p>
              <p>set your budget higher. Computers last pretty long if used properly.</p>

              <p>if you are looking to crossfire</p>
              <p>Bring up ur budget, get a X38, X48, or X58.</p>
              <p>When i am not trying to clear stock when im in shop, i will tell my customers:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">if you cf 2 4850 on a p45, might as well dun do it. If you run 2 gpus on a p45 mainstream chipset mobos, the pcie slots will go back to x8, x8 when on crossfire</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you are running</span> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">on a x48,x38,xsth sth , both slots run at x16,x16, even when on crossfire</span></p>
              <p> However, if you are going to store lots of data, take the p45, as i think it has the  new ich10 southbridge, it supports more hdds</p>
              <p>If you arereally on a approx 1 k budget, go with the p45, it is sometimes better to invest on a faster gpu</p>
              <p>Even if running one card, the x series will run abiiit faster than the p45s</p>
              <p>Rumours says that x series clock better than the p series. Actually it depends on the stepping of the processor, diff chip perform differently on different board, it really depends. My friend using the same x48 board as me reach 3.5ghz on a q9550 with just a little voltage adjustments</p>

              x48,x38,xsth sth , both slots run at x16,x16, even when on
              crossfire</span></p>
              <p> However, if you are going to store lots of data, take the
              p45, as i think it has the  new ich10 southbridge, it supports
              more hdds</p>
              <p>If you arereally on a approx 1 k budget, go with the p45, it is
              sometimes better to invest on a faster gpu</p>
              <p>Even if running one card, the x series will run abiiit faster
              than the p45s</p>
              <p>Rumours says that x series clock better than the p series.
              Actually it depends on the stepping of the processor, diff chip
              perform differently on different board, it really depends. My
              friend using the same x48 board as me reach 3.5ghz on a
              q9550 with just a little voltage adjustments</p>

              <p>The problem with mainstream chipsets: The makers never put enough PCI-E lanes. Always, for like, Nvidia 750(i)(a), 650(i)(a), P45, P35, 780G/V, x8/x8 or x16/x1 (Never heard of anyone using this config though).</p>
              <p>And as for the X vs P series thing, I think it's more on Vendor/manufacturer quality thing. I'm getting more speed out of my 630i than on a P35 board. Foxconn FTW!</p>

              <p>i also work in simlim, but at the shops at the back, sometimes i also go to bell systems to play games on their demo machine</p>
              <p>Bell systems is a nice place lah, maybe sometimes they are just having a bad day</p>
              <p>Normally the policy is that if you encounter any problem with the purchase over 7 days, they will turn you to the distro</p>
              <p>Corbell is not too bad when it comes to RMAing products. but the located at the techpark 1 is not very easy to go for some people</p>
              <p>I heard some stories about banleong, could not confirm true or not, but they should be fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually there is not need to go till 1kw of power, unless you really need it, but i use that for my friend also<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. But a strong PSU have it's good point.</p>
              <p>Imagine u are running a high end set up with many accesories and fans and those whatnots.</p>
              <p>I heard that if you overclock with playing with the voltage it is fine. But when you up the cpu voltage to 1.27 on a quadcore, and up the memory, northbridge volts, the 500watts might not take it</p>

              <p>I know, cuz I'm also in the market for new mobo XD. My current 630i is only PCI-E 1.1, my 4770 is PCI-E 2.0. However, not much difference in performance (only a frame or 2 per second diff mah). Less PCI-E lanes = Cheaper to manufacture = Higher profit margin.</p>
              <p>But if you no money to buy the X series, which is like the enthusiast segment, then the P is good enough. Never go for the G series, is my advice. I'd rather go for ATi/NVidia chipsets than go with Intel G series chipsets XD</p>

              <p><br>For now 1.0 is enough, but if you are those who are buying a new system, of cos wont get a mobo with 1.0 if you have the budget, maybe in the future cards will full utilise the 2.0 speed.</p>
              <p>Speaking of mobo, i start to realise after working that they actually did not bring in alot of mobos to sg. Haerd that they say sg market is still small. Some shops started to bring in their own. China have all their brands of mobos, if i go to china now, i dont even know what to choose</p>
              <p>The P series is good enough , but we are all enthusiast in our heart right?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>@MPT: Here in SG where got big market for mobo? Bring in all kinds of mobo who will buy? Right now, the small selection is enough for novices to keep track of, later they all confused, then GG liao. More work for you XD. To SG people, I think that as long as got good performance, good quality, they won't mind the small selection.</p>
