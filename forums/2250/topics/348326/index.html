              <p>If you are a buyer, you can use paypal, if you are a seller, avoid it, paypal is actually no different from a scammer, below is my own story for your reference.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New;">I sold some laptop computer parts in ebay during 12/2008—01/2009, two of the buyers from USA claimed that they did not received the parts which they have paid through paypal, they openned dispute in paypal, paypal then on hold the payment that these two buyers have paid from my paypal account and requested me to submit <span id="lw_1240073324_4" class="yshortcuts">proof of delivery</span>, after a tedious procedure of submitting documents, paypal rejected my documents and claimed that the documents I submitted is insufficient to proved the receipt by the buyers, after that, I approached Singpost to endorse its stamp on both the shipping labels and upload to paypal, I also counter requested paypal to check again the tracking numbers for both items that I submitted, I told them to login </span><a href="http://signpost.com.sg/"><span id="lw_1240073324_5" class="yshortcuts"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399; font-family: Courier New;">signpost.com.sg</span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Courier New;">, click Track &amp; Trace, key in the tracking number(both the tracking numbers are ER330747832SG and ER330833275SG), the shipping info will immediately appear on the screen, the info include the date and time received by the addressee, but with no surprise, their reply is still the same, “info submitted is insufficient to prove the delivery”, I even sent paypal the mail from one of the buyers who indicated on his mail that he has received the parts I sent, but paypal still rejected my appeal, finally, the payment paid by both the buyers are reversed back to them, it means that the buyers(scammers?) received the items free of charge, now one thing is that, is the payment really reversed back to the buyers? If yes, what is the reason for paypal to make such a decision since all evident solidly proved that both the buyers have received the parts, but I strongly believe in another scenario that my money is actually scammed by paypal.<br>Secondly, besides the so called “reversed back of my money”, my paypal account is also frozen by paypal for 180 days with no reason, meaning that I can not access to my paypal account anymore, I can not transfer my money out from paypal account to my bank account, do they have the right to do that? Can I get back my money after 180 days? I am having over USD7000 in paypal account.<br>Please login “</span><a href="http://aboutpaypal.org/"><span id="lw_1240073324_6" class="yshortcuts"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399; font-family: Courier New;">aboutpaypal.org</span></span></span></a> and paypalsucks.com<span style="font-family: Courier New;">”, there are thousands of real stories brought up by paypal account holders, all stories were about people being Robbed, Abused, Unfairly Treated, Lied To And Scammed By Paypal, you can also search “paypal fraud” on </span><a href="http://youtube.com/"><span id="lw_1240073324_7" class="yshortcuts"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399; font-family: Courier New;">youtube.com</span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Courier New;"> for the same stories.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New;">I went to their regional office in neil road in order to clarify with them, the final email sent by paypal to me, asked me to fax the same materials that I uploaded to them several times, the fax number is in singapore, but I didn't do that because the result will be no different, I asked to meetup with a customer service personnel, the receptionist claimed that they have no customer service personnel to meet up with me, after I insist, she called the security guard, the guard approached me and asked me to leave or else he is going to call the police, paypal operates like a secret society, their guard also behaved like a gangster, their regional telephone answering centre is located in China, beside "I Am Sorry", they can help you nothing, I approached police, police said that their practise are not against the low and asked me to complain to CASE, but CASE said that this is considered a B2B issue, they only handle C2B issue, I seached arround the Small Claims Tribunals but with no service on this kind of issue, I then compalined to MAS, MAS replied and provide me with the email address of paypal's regional Compliance Director, I have not yet reply MAS as well as this director, because what I want right now is not to get back the 400 over USD, I hope there is some mechanism or regulation in Singapore to restrict paypal from doing thing with thier own preference, anyhow hold up people's money for their own use. Anyone got any suggestion or idea about this please bring up. </span></p>
