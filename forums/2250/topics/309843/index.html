              <p>Last Sunday I went to SLS to get my HP Pavilition T548d fixed. There was some problem with the power supply (?) and I went to get it fixed(the uncle changed the "box thingy" at the top part of the CPU and it's called iCute. The one that has a three pin thingy coming out on the outside) and got an upgrade of ram and hard disk space. It was okay for a few days and it died on me suddenly.</p>
              <p>I can on my CPU and there's power going into the CPU but it doesn't show anything on my monitor. There's no signal on my monitor. And when I tried to dock my ipod to my CPU, it does not show that its charging. I suppose there's no power going out of the CPU.</p>
              <p>I don't know what the problem is but I called some techies up and they told me it was a ram problem from my description of the problem and they told me to take the RAM out and clean the gold coloured part with a tissue. I did that and my computer is still dead.</p>
              <p>Can somebody help me? I don't think I want to go back to that shop again because some disagreements with that shop uncle.</p>
              <p>And does anybody know of any cheap and reliable on-site repair services?</p>
              <p>Edit: Oh yeah and I read on some websites that the RAM has to be a pair? Before changing my RAM that shopkeeper told me that mine wasn't in a pair so he asked me if I wanted to change and upgrade it. But it worked well when it wasn't a pair leh.</p>

              <p>U see the groove in the middle of the gold contact points?That is to prevent U from plugging in the wrong way.</p>
              <p>And U can try using a soft eraser to rub on the gold contacts...confirm better than that tissue-wipping U did...but whether ur PC will work is another thing...as in...the method is solid...but ur PC problem may not be due to RAM.</p>

              <p>Erm, I've no idea what's a motherboard. Took two separate photos instead. Do let me know if you need a zoom in version of it.</p>

              <p>According to HP...U have an onboard VGA output and I think I see a graphics card in the AGP slot....so U have 2 places to have monitor output....</p>
              <p><img src="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf-JAVA/Doc/images/c00411508.gif" alt="" width="530" height="514"></p>
              <p>can U plug in ur monitor cable(should be blue in colour) to either the AGP slot's graphics card or the onboard VGA output?</p>
              <p>and put back ur RAM since mayi says it will not boot without it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The onboard VGA output is number 9.</p>
