            <div class='col-md body'>1) Did you adjust the monitor colour settings? Old monitors allow you to change the colour accordingly. If there is too much red, it would look reddish. Too much green would be greenish. Too much blue would be bluish. Too much of red and green would appear yellow. Too much of red and blue would be purple. Too much of green and blue becomes cyan. If it's balanced, it would be white in colour.<br><br>2) As for the flicks, it could be the refresh rate. Old monitors have to refresh constantly and it normally would return to normal after a while.<br><br>3) Press the Zoom button on the monitor to adjust it to 0 or as you deem fit.<br><br>4) You probably don't have enough RAM, that's why your system is lagging. Don't run too many programs at one time. If you are not using it, close the programs. Open it when you need it.<br><br>If your monitor is spoilt, it would flicker every few seconds and give you some funny sizes. For example, this moment it fits your monitor, next moment too small to be seen, another moment later it would too big for your monitor. A temporary cure to it is to adjust your screen size as small as possible, by using the buttons on the monitor. It would last you for a while, but not long. A few days later, the problem would return.<br><br>Spoilt TV ask repair man to repair TV, I don't know how to repair TV.</div>

My monitor has a function that allows user to reset the settings to default. First, after reading, I thought I changed the color settings so I play with the colors..can't get white..then i use the function, it goes back to the same yellow color again..so quite sure it isn't due to my itchy hand..<br><br>2. I didn't explain very clear lol. The "flick" sounds is always accompanied by irregular, fast(half a sec?) and sudden distortion of the screen image..then return to the squary/rectangular form..<br><br>3. My monitor has no zoom function..i think.<br><br>4. I know how computers with low amt of RAM can have quite similar effect coz i have another 256RAM com..when alt-tabbed, it goes black very long. My 'lit' here means the screen light <span style="font-style: italic;">fades</span> in..from black to dim light to stronger light then finally the original light power.</div>

It would turn out white. If it is still yellowish, then perhaps your monitor is too old. You can change it if you wish to, but usually bringing it to a repair shop to change the tubes inside should solve this.<br><br>2) Did someone accidentally hit the monitor?<br><br>3) The Zoom function usually accessible by pressing the settings button. On Philips monitors, it's the OK button, then you use press down until you reach Zoom. For ViewSonic monitors, you have to press 1 and the settings screen would come out. Use the left and right buttons to navigate to Zoom. Then hit on button number 2. Press the left button until it reaches 0 or the desired screen size you want. Other monitors I'm not too sure.<br><br>4) It could mean your monitor is dying.</div>
