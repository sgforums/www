              <p>Ok the title might be Misleading, but personally that's how i see it. And this problem might have been posted here or somewhere else, but problem is, i either</p>
              <p>1) Can't Seem to Find it.</p>
              <p>or </p>
              <p>2) Couldn't Find it.</p>
              <p>My computer can work Just Fine. Just Fine. But I normally game a lot. like, A Lot.</p>
              <p>Ever since *can't remember* after *can't remember* happened, My computer started shutting down. Somewhere around last year, i think, early Spring, or something... i don't know... but my Computer was since 2007, so it can't be any earlier. </p>
              <p>The Problem is... My Computer seems to shut down itself as if someone pulled out the power plug, but only when it's under a lot of stress(e.g.: Extracting from a large winrar file, playing Fullscreen games&lt;Stepmania works fine, though; but i can't even play Half Life&gt;, playing some large flash games, watching some videos on fullscreen&lt;even youtube videos on fulllscreen&gt;, etc...). I can't determine whether it's my Motherboard, CPU, PSU, or Video Card. Can't be my RAM cuz i recently upgraded and changed it. Checked the Temps. from Speedfan results and it seemed to be temp 3(dunno which this is, probably my Video Card) and Core(the first one. think this is my CPU, since it's the fastest to shoot up when running stuff. and stuff...) that appear to be out of place. my HDD's have ticks right beside them so they should be fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now i could either fix my computer or buy/build a new one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Things to note: </p>
              <p>-I have a budget of $1650, and i can only do stuff next Month/Year(Jan). Unless cost &lt; 200.</p>
              <p>-I'm a Student, if that helps in any way.</p>
              <p>-I have no idea what info you need from me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's running on:</p>

              <p>My computer can work Just Fine. Just Fine. But I normally game a
              lot. like, A Lot.</p>
              <p>Ever since *can't remember* after *can't remember* happened, My
              computer started shutting down. Somewhere around last year, i
              think, early Spring, or something... i don't know... but my
              Computer was since 2007, so it can't be any earlier. </p>
              <p>The Problem is... My Computer seems to shut down itself as if
              someone pulled out the power plug, but only when it's under a lot
              of stress(e.g.: Extracting from a large winrar file, playing
              Fullscreen games&lt;Stepmania works fine, though; but i can't even
              play Half Life&gt;, playing some large flash games, watching some
              videos on fullscreen&lt;even youtube videos on fulllscreen&gt;,
              etc...). I can't determine whether it's my Motherboard, CPU, PSU,
              or Video Card. Can't be my RAM cuz i recently upgraded and changed
              it. Checked the Temps. from Speedfan results and it seemed to be
              temp 3(dunno which this is, probably my Video Card) and Core(the
              first one. think this is my CPU, since it's the fastest to shoot up
              when running stuff. and stuff...) that appear to be out of place.
              my HDD's have ticks right beside them so they should be fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now i could either fix my computer or buy/build a new
              one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Things to note: </p>
              <p>-I have a budget of $1650, and i can only do stuff next
              Month/Year(Jan). Unless cost &lt; 200.</p>
              <p>-I'm a Student, if that helps in any way.</p>
              <p>-I have no idea what info you need from me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's running on:</p>
              <p>-AMD Phenom x2 ...</p>
              <p>&lt;To Be Continued&gt;</p>
              <p>*I'm not at home right now, so i guess i'll update it when i
              reach home. Meanwhile, if anybody could post their experiences or
              any suggestions, tips whatever, please do*</p>

              <p>i know what hardware to buy, i just want to find out what's wrong and at least attempt to rectify the issue before saving up a little bit more for a new computer later on. I'm still going to have to focus on my studies for a few years, so i wouldn't be using my computer for too much gaming. thus all i need is for the problem to disappear, even if just for a while. And at that i also intend not to use too much money during these few months, since i don't have much savings and my parents can't give me their full financial support.</p>

              computer started shutting down. Somewhere around last year, i
              think, early Spring, or something... i don't know... but my
              Computer was since 2007, so it can't be any earlier. </p>
              <p>The Problem is... My Computer seems to shut down itself as if
              someone pulled out the power plug, but only when it's under a lot
              of stress(e.g.: Extracting from a large winrar file, playing
              Fullscreen games&lt;Stepmania works fine, though; but i can't even
              play Half Life&gt;, playing some large flash games, watching some
              videos on fullscreen&lt;even youtube videos on fulllscreen&gt;,
              etc...). I can't determine whether it's my Motherboard, CPU, PSU,
              or Video Card. Can't be my RAM cuz i recently upgraded and changed
              it. Checked the Temps. from Speedfan results and it seemed to be
              temp 3(dunno which this is, probably my Video Card) and Core(the
              first one. think this is my CPU, since it's the fastest to shoot up
              when running stuff. and stuff...) that appear to be out of place.
              my HDD's have ticks right beside them so they should be fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now i could either fix my computer or buy/build a new
              one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Things to note: </p>
              <p>-I have a budget of $1650, and i can only do stuff next
              Month/Year(Jan). Unless cost &lt; 200.</p>
              <p>-I'm a Student, if that helps in any way.</p>
              <p>-I have no idea what info you need from me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's running on:</p>
              <p>-AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4600+, ~2.4GHz</p>
              <p>-Gigabyte GA-MA69VM-S2<br> -3326MB RAM</p>
              <p>-Windows XP Professional (5.1, Build 2600) Service Pack 3
              (2600.xpsp_sp3_gdr.091208-2036)</p>
              <p>-NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT(512.0 MB)</p>

              <p>Run GPU-Z and SpeedFan and turn on logging. They would log the current temperatures into a text file every minute, so that after your computer goes down, you can refer to the logs later and see what is really overheating.</p>
              <p>Reminder to all: keep discussions civil and stay on-topic.</p>
