Since he was standing next to his mum, Amin decided to whisper out of the corner of his mouth that it was a "pump". The guard misheard it as "bomb", with inevitable consequences.<br><br>That, at least, was the version offered yesterday by Amin's defense attorney, Eileen O'Neill-Burke, in the Cook County courtroom where the pneumatic defendant sought to clarify the misunderstanding. As "snickering police officers watched the court proceedings", O'Neill-Burke explained: "He told her it's a pump. He's standing with his mother. Of course he's not going to shout this out."<br><br>The guard, however, insisted Amin had said "bomb". On the basis of this testimony, Judge Gerald Winiecki declared there was enough evidence for the case to move forward, and Amin is accordingly due back before the beak on 13 September.<br><br>After the hearing, a "mostly jovial" Amin - who works for a "janitorial service" - insisted he'd never use the word "bomb" while passing through airport security. Regarding the offending device, he added: "It's normal. Half of America they use it." Â®<br><br><strong>It was a "bomb".  </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

While we have doubts about all three of these, we do know that a lot of the problems come from management giving impossible tasks to new teams, and other related oversight issues.<br><br>Senior Intel people have asked to study the costs of closing the Bangalore office, but it is not 100 per cent dead yet. Possibilities include moving it, downsizing it, or both.<br><br>In either case, it looks like the employees are going to suffer for (mis)management problems. Our sympathies go out to them.<br><br></div>
