Their online store is currently down, but I have checked it out a few weeks ago and it's 20 Euros (around 40 SGD) if I remember correctly.<br><br><blockquote><br>In July 2006, DD-WRT Shop started offering a pay-only "special version" of the router firmware.[1] <strong>It includes increased functionality such as per-user bandwidth control.</strong> Since then, DD-WRT has been accused of violating the GPL provision against binary-only public distribution of derivative works.[2][unreliable source?][3]<br></blockquote>- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD-WRT#Accusations" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a><br><br>More info:<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G#WRT54GL" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G#WRT54GL</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD-WRT" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD-WRT</a><br><br>Edit:<br>Errr ok nvm.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>about the wireless N card and wireless N router, what so special about it that it will suck all the bandwidth?</blockquote>Wireless N changed the way how bandwidth is being used. Wireless N introduced a technology called MIMO (although it's now compatible with some wireless G routers as well).<br><br>MIMO increases the bandwidth channel without additional bandwidth or transmitting power.<br><br>Older wireless products don't use MIMO at all. With MIMO products nearby, they can effective affect these products, thus reducing the bandwidth and transmitting power of these older products.<br><br>Most of the time, you will either notice a drop in signal or a drop in speed. This indicates that MIMO routers are nearby.</div>

In the context of Vonage and VoIP, a QoS capable router like the WRT54G or WRT54GS allows you to set the VoIP traffic from your Vonage adapter to have a higher priority than traffic from websurfing, downloading or uploading files, or other activities. So, if you're doing many things on your internet connection at the same time, it will make sure that your Vonage calls still happen without choppiness or cutouts, even if it means slowing down your file transfers or the speed at which you are surfing and loading webpages.<br></blockquote>- <a href="http://vonage-forum.com/ftopic9685.html" rel="nofollow">DallasFlier of Vonage Forums</a><br><br>And I don't think it is as difficult as you imagine. As how one of the users have described, it seems like you're just a cut-and-paste job away from getting it working.<br><br><blockquote><br>You simply run the tool, cut the output and paste it into your routers firewall rules screen.<br></blockquote></div>
