Remove all startup items under the Start &gt; Run &gt; msconfig &gt; Startup tab and try booting into Windows normally again. If it still doesn't work,<br><br>1. Run an anti-virus scan on safe mode.<br>2. Wait for anty's reply. She would probably have a better solution for you.<br>3. Wipe out your disk and do a reformat, and reinstall Windows. (last resort)<br><br>P2: I have done some googling and it was said to have something to do with the CMOS battery which may require replacement in this case.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the reply everybody. Great suggestions.<br><br>Problem 1 :<br>- Like LatecomerX n manyu882 said, I've just tried booting the computer in "Safe Mode". I still get to the User account page and still not able to log-in successfully.<br>- I've tried all 3 Safe Mode but still won't work. It still keep Logging Off instantly.<br><br>Problem 2 :<br>- LatecomerX , u said something bout the battery being faulty. So it seems that i still have to go the service centre.<br><br>ndmmxiaomayi , i believe u r refering to problem 2 right?? I've just reformatted my laptop when this thing happens.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> (still waitin for other suggestions)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm referring to Problem 1. Not problem 2. Problem 1 has been known to be caused by malware and some people who go about using self help fixes after some Googling or searching in some other search engines.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh...Ok...slight misunderstanding....<br><br>I believe the problem isn't cause by the "self help fix".<br>I have never tried doing does stuff..There were no problems before that, so theres no reason for me to go around looking for self-help fix.<br>Anyway, the computer is only used by my younger brothers to play games. I will only touch the computer when ever they claim there is a problem.(!Like Now!) It could not have been possible for them to be lookin for FIX without me knowing that there is a problem like malware in the 1st place.<br><br>I think i will look into the possibilities of reformatting the computer. Is there any way i could back-up important files 1st.??</div>
