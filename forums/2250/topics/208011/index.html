            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Intel to decimate workforce - report</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>The AMD effect</strong></span><br><br>By Ashlee Vance<br>Thursday 31st August 2006 22:10Ã‚ GMT<br><br>CNET has come out as the first organ willing to put a firm number on Intel's alleged upcoming mass layoff. <strong>The online rag reckons that up to 10,000 workers will be cleaved from Intel's payroll</strong>. Word of the layoffs should arrive next Tuesday after the stock markets close their regular trading sessions.<br><br>Rumors of large layoffs at Intel have swirled ever since CEO Paul Otellini said he would examine all possible cost cutting options. <strong>So far, Intel has relieved itself of two business units and fired 1,000 managers. According to CNET, things will get worse for the Intel regulars next week when the company decimates its 100,000 strong workforce.</strong><br><br>The company has scheduled an internal web cast for Tuesday, which doesn't seem like an encouraging sign. "Intel CEO Paul Otellini will present employees a summary of IntelÂ’s structure and efficiency analysis," the company told its staff, according to a note seen by El Reg.<br><br>"We have said before that we will disclose the results of our structural review sometime in the third quarter," Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy told us. "We won't comment on specific dates or plans or results."<br><br>European papers as well as dailies in states such as Oregon have speculated that Intel would make large cuts in the next couple of weeks. Workers have apparently sensed that the axe is about to fall and fall hard.<br><br>The reality of the situation though is that Intel cannot support its current workforce and expect to post glossy financial results. AMD has came out of nowhere to claim 25 per cent of the x86 server chip market and increased its desktop processor share. If these trends continue, Intel can expect to own 60- to 70 per cent of the x86 market as opposed to the 80- to 90 per cent that it's used to.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Intel sharpens axe for layoffs </strong><br><br>Thousands, thousands<br><br>By INQUIRER staff: Friday 01 September 2006, 05:04<br><br>CHIP GIANT Intel could cut as many as 10,000 personnel, news.com reckons, and as early as next week.<br>We reported last month that thousands of jobs could go, worldwide, as CEO Paul Otellini completes the 90 day plan to get Intel back into shape.<br><br>In July, he cut 1,000 managers out of the Intel loop, but news.com reckons that the marketing staff will take the brunt of the layoffs. Marketing people, it is a sad but true fact, are usually the first branches to be lopped off the corporate tree.<br><br>The Wall Street Journal's take is that as many as 20,000 jobs could go. The current headcount stands at about 95,000 or so - surely there can't be 20,000 marketeers at Intel? The firm has fabs and other factories all over the place and these institutions are people heavy<br></div>

It follows dissatisfaction at board level with the performance of the chip firm over the last couple of years.<br><br>Figures for the number of layoffs are not yet known, but as we reported last month, they're likely to be in the 10s of thousands.<br><br>* THE IRISH Post said that some cuts have already happened at Intel's plant in Leixlip, with staff already going.<br></div>
