              <p>Currently, I own VAIO <strong>CR 323</strong> which has really incompetent specifications, if compared to all these recommended ones. (Duo-core processor 1.86ghz, 200GB HDD, 1GB RAM) I bought it at Suntec IT Fair on June 2008, so it's approximately nine months old and has 3 year warranty. Hence I don't think I qualify for the Self-Cert Post-Configuration process for students who buy or own other notebook PC.</p>
              <p>So now, I have a few questions to ask.</p>
              <p>1) Which laptop should I buy, and why?</p>
              <p>2) Where can I sell my CR323 and the best price range offered?</p>
              <p>I am in need of advice, since SP Roadshow is only 6 days long.</p>
              <p>Thank you very much! :)</p>

              <p>Hey, I'm from SP too. If you are going for that course, i would reccommend that you to get the MacBook Pro, - creative media design probably needs lots of designing right?</p>
              <p>Sp will dual boot for you to have vista and mac os. However, it costs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$4588.16</span> with GST. (yes, it's the SP promo price.) </p>
              <p> it's not worth buying it =(</p>
              <p>Alternatively, go for the Fuji S6420. it's a good buy, and it's of better built quality as compared to let's say an Acer</p>

              <p>Yeah, I'm choosing between the Acer and the Fujitsu one.  I guess they are good in different ways. I heard that Acer uses lousy parts for notebooks and their batteries spoil easily.</p>
              <p>Any idea where to sell laptops? :) I had suggestions like Ebay, Forums and Cash Converter. But there are people telling me that it's best to keep it as spare, since it's not gonna worth a lot.</p>

              <p>keep it as a spare and load SP's image in it. If that's possible that is Hehe =) thus you can be assured of a backup in case of downtime</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go for the Fujitsu. I went down to have a look at this set this morning, it's well built, just that it's abit dull looking :D</p>
              <p>The internal parts in an ACER are all sourced from different manufactuers. HP/Sony blah blah sources the parts from these manufactuers too. Thus it's safe to say, things like hard disks, graphic cards ,motherboards are all of a certain QC standard. It's only the exterior components that are not really that good. Things like the casing, it still feels like cheap plastic to me. Yea, the power adaptors burnt easily too. As such, you can see why Acers have fairly high specifications at lower unit costs. (yes, there's a hidden meaning behind the last sentence).</p>

              <p>yeah, went down to check with the SP helpers this morning.</p>
              <p>as stated earlier your course requirements, require - a high end range. Thus,  the laptop you get should be from that range of models and specifications, as stated in the brochures. The models offered under these brochures is suffice for your course and as such, you do not need to ring up the school for enquiries. </p>
              <p>As for the image, it would be the software and the settings needed for the laptop to run in SP. Settings refer to wireless internet settings ect ect. and it ensures that the laptop can connect to the SP network. Softwares  are probably course specific. So for eg: xx course will require xx software amongst the basic bundle that's offered for all students (like microsoft office 07). </p>

              <p>It's quite far off. It's best not to use. If you are to use it, you definitely have to increase your ram to 4gb. </p>
              <p>then you will have to think - can it last for 3 years of your study? (remember that you bought it in 08 and your course will end in 2012) will you be fed up using it ( probably it runs too slow or it lags, whilst your fellow course mates don't, if i m not wrong, creative media requires lots of designing and vid editing? so that means lots of laggy softwares&gt;&lt;).  </p>
              <p>Yep, the software will be preloaded. so when you get your new laptop, just login with your user name (made during the online enrollment) and password. Everything should be there. If you are to use your own laptop you will have to go through one briefing which willl tell u the steps to install the software. </p>
              <p>Erm, not really, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> I m more general. there are loads of people here who really specialise in a certain aspect of electronics.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I'm choosing between the Acer and the Fujitsu one.  I guess they are good in different ways. I heard that Acer uses lousy parts for notebooks and their batteries spoil easily.</p>
              <p>Any idea where to sell laptops? :) I had suggestions like Ebay, Forums and Cash Converter. But there are people telling me that it's best to keep it as spare, since it's not gonna worth a lot.</p>

              <p>...Ouch, everything related to electronic is just so hard to comprehend. Thanks for all your advices! I still have more questions.</p>
              <p>My friend recommended me to upgrade my current laptop, or just buy the Fujitsu one for work and try not to install anything else inside. According to <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=3807">http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=3807</a>, it's possible to upgrade the memory. What about the ram and processor? Is it advisable to upgrade?</p>
              <p>I really hate the idea of having two laptops. Like one good laptop just for work? Eeek.</p>

              <p>everything is possible. But it will not be worth it.</p>
              <p>It's possible to upgrade the hard disk, but it's pointless. you will have to transfer everything from ur current hard disk to the new one. - hassle and expensive.</p>
              <p>Ram is the cheapest to upgrade. - at most $75.</p>
              <p>No, it's not possible for the processor though. you will have to change the whole motherboard - which is might as well get a new laptop.</p>
              <p>and from my understanding you will void your warranty if u ever try to change the harddisk youself.</p>
              <p>ram can be changed without any void or warranty.</p>
