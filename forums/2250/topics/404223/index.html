            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>You may ask yourself "What are the symptoms of Computer Addiction?"</p>
              <p>The answer is: "They can vary according to the extent of the
              addiction". For instance, some people may be only addicted mildly to
              the internet and computer, therefore, they display little nor no
              symptoms other than the constant desire to be using the internet or
              computer.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, those suffering from severe computer
              addiction may display a variety of symptoms, some of which can be
              hazardous to health. There are some symptoms of acute computer-related
              addiction outlined below with a brief description of each.</p>
              <p><strong>*Mood swings and irritability when not at the computer.</strong></p>
              <p>One of the first, and the most pressing signs of computer addiction is
              when the person shows anger, irritability and mood swings when not at
              the computer.</p>
              <p>Very often, all lifes' situations become insignificant
              and they feel they must get back to the computer. The person seems to
              be completely preoccupied and focused on nothing else other than
              getting back online or back to the computer. If the person displays
              this sort of symptom, then it is a sure sign that this person is
              completely addicted to the computer.</p>
              <p><strong>*Showing signs of a lack of interest in offline activities.</strong></p>
              <p>This is a huge indication that computer addiction has taken hold. A
              computer addict may totally ignore their offline friends in favor of
              forming online relationships.</p>
              <p>It could even reach the extent that they
              sever relationships with their family as well. This is one of the most
              tragic symptoms, and when this happens, the computer addict needs to
              seek professional help as they are showing severe computer addiction
              symptoms.</p>
              <p><strong>*Loss of sleep and the abandoning of commitments to spend time at the computer.</strong></p>
              <p>This has a drastic effect on the health of a computer addict. They will
              often lose all track of time and will stay up all night to be at the
              computer with little or no sleep. They rarely go outside for fresh air
              and sunshine which will obviously affect their health.</p>
              <p>Another tragic
              computer addiction symptom is when the sufferer abandons their
              commitments to work, school, college, study and family to favor
              computer time. The abandoning of commitments will have a long-term
              effect on the life of the sufferer. Loss of their job, poor grades and
              failure of courses.</p>
              <p><strong>*Not eating balanced meals and lack of personal hygiene.</strong></p>
              <p>A person suffering from computer addiction, will very often miss meals.
              This is because it takes time to prepare a proper meal, time which
              would rather be spent at the computer. A computer addict will often
              favor snacks, fast food and soda.</p>
              <p>Another thing to bear in mind is the
              fact that a severe computer addict will not spend time for their
              ablutions. Again, these fundamental actions take time and some
              important conversation or a bad guy on the game who needs to be watched
              and could be missed if the addict were completing his or her ablutions.</p>
              <p><strong>*Lack of concentration and motivation for anything other than the computer.</strong></p>
              <p>The lack of motivation for any sort of activity outside of the
              computer environment. Computer addiction will cause lack of
              concentration, which could be very dangerous for those operating
              machinery or driving. This could have an obvious tragic effect on
              theirs - and others - health.</p>
              <p>Sadly, these computer addictions
              are obviously very dangerous and should serve as a dire warning to the
              family and friends of addicts that the person needs to seek
              professional help before they crawl deeper into a virtual reality world
              with disastrous consequences. All these symptoms are due to computer
              addiction.</p>

              <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk factors for Internet addiction and computer addiction</span></h2>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>If you suffer from anxiety</strong>.
              You may use the Internet to distract yourself from your worries and
              fears. An anxiety disorder like obsessive-compulsive disorder may also
              contribute to excessive email checking and compulsive Internet use.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>If you are depressed.</strong> The Internet can be an escape from feelings of depression, but too much
              time online can make things worse. Internet addiction further
              contributes to isolation and loneliness.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>If you have any other addictions</strong>. Many  Internet addicts suffer from other addictions, mainly to drugs, alcohol, gambling,  and sex.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>If you lack social support. </strong>Internet
              addicts often use chat rooms, instant messaging, or online gaming as a
              safe way of establishing new relationships and more confidently
              relating to others.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>If you’re a teenager</strong>, you might be  wondering where you fit in and the Internet might feel more comfortable than  real life friends. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>If you are less mobile or socially active than you are used to</strong>.
              For example, you may be coping with a new disability that limits your
              ability to drive. Parenting very young children can make it hard to
              leave the house or connect with old friends. </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Self-help tips for breaking your Internet addiction</h2>
              <p>If you see you might have a problem with Internet usage, you’ve
              completed the hardest step towards a more balanced online life.  It’s
              very easy to rationalize or deny Internet addiction, and commitment
              towards a healthier balance will take you a long way.</p>
              <p>The following are
              some tools to get your Internet use under control. While you can put
              many of these in place yourself, make sure you get some outside support
              as well. It’s all too easy to slip back into old patterns of usage,
              especially if you use the Internet heavily for work.</p>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>Identify any underlying reasons that need treatment.</strong> If you are struggling with depression or anxiety, for example, Internet
              addiction might be a way to self-soothe rocky moods. Have you had
              problems with alcohol or drugs in the past? Does anything about your
              Internet use remind you of how you used to drink or use drugs to numb
              out? Take a hard look at whether you need to address treatment in these
              areas, whether it is therapy for depression or going back to 12-step
              meetings.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>Increase your coping skills.</strong> Perhaps blowing off steam on the Internet is your way of coping with
              stress or angry feelings. Or you have trouble relating to others,
              feeling excessively shy or feeling like you can never read people right
              in real life. Building skills in these areas will help you weather the
              stresses and strains of daily life without resorting to compulsive
              Internet use. Related Helpguide sites can be found below. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>Strengthen your support network. </strong>The
              more relationships you have in real life, the less you will need the
              Internet for social interaction. Set aside dedicated time each week for
              spouse or other family. If you are shy, try finding common interest
              groups such as an exercise class or book reading club. This allows you
              to interact with others in a non-threatening way and allows
              relationships to naturally develop. </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Modify your Internet use step  by step:</h3>
              <ol>
              <li>To
              help you see problem areas, keep a log of how much you use the Internet
              for non-work related activities. You might find this challenging if you
              interweave recreational Internet use with work, but try to get a clear
              idea of when you use. Are there times of day that you use more? Are
              there triggers in your day that make you stay online for hours at a
              time when you planned for 5 minutes?</li>
              <li>Set
              goals for when you can use the Internet. For example, you might try
              setting a timer for usage, scheduling use for certain times of day, or
              making a commitment to turn off the computer at the same time each
              night.</li>
              <li>Replace your Internet usage with
              healthy activities. If you are bored and lonely, resisting the urge to
              get back online will be very difficult. Have a plan for other ways to
              fill the time, such as going to lunch with a coworker, taking a class,
              or inviting a friend over. </li>
              </ol></div>
              <h2>Internet addiction treatment,  counseling, and support</h2>
              <p>Having trouble cutting back? It is not because you are weak willed.
              Compulsive behavior like Internet addiction can be hard to break. The
              more support you have during the process of cutting down, the more
              successful you will be.</p>
              <h3>Therapy and counseling for Internet addiction</h3>
              <p>Therapy can give you a tremendous boost in stopping excessive Internet use. <strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</strong> gives you step-by-step ways to stop compulsive Internet behaviors,
              working with a therapist on changing your thoughts and behaviors
              surrounding Internet use.</p>
              <p>Therapy can also help you learn healthier
              ways of coping with uncomfortable emotions. And if depression or
              anxiety is contributing to your excessive Internet use, therapy can
              also address that problem.</p>
              <p>If your Internet use
              is affecting your partner directly, as with excessive cybersex or
              online affairs, marriage counseling can help you work through these
              challenging issues. Marriage counseling can also help you reconnect
              with your partner if you have been using the Internet for most of your
              social needs.</p>
              <p>Although Internet addiction is
              not recognized as a formal psychological disorder, ask if your
              therapist or counselor has experience in treating compulsive Internet
              use.</p>
              <h3>Group support for Internet addiction</h3>
              <p>Since
              Internet addiction is relatively new, it can be hard to find a real
              life support group dedicated to that issue like Alcoholics Anonymous or
              Gamblers Anonymous. If that is a simultaneous problem for you, however,
              attending groups can help you work through your alcohol or gambling
              problems as well.  Sex Addicts anonymous may be another place to try if
              you are having trouble with cybersex. However, there may be groups that
              you can join to work on social and coping skills, such as for anxiety
              or depression.</p>
              <p>There are some Internet
              addiction support groups on the Internet. However, these should be used
              with caution. Although they may be helpful in orienting you and
              pointing you in the right direction, you need real life people to best
              benefit from group support.</p>
              <h2><a name="helping"></a>Helping a child or teen with an Internet addiction</h2>
              <p>It’s
              a fine line as a parent. If you severely limit a child or teen’s
              Internet use, they might rebel and go to excess. But you can and should
              model appropriate computer use, supervise computer activity and get
              your child help if he or she needs it. If your child or teen is showing
              signs of Internet addiction, there are many things that you as a parent
              can do to help:</p>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>Encourage other interests and social activities.</strong> Get your child out from behind the computer screen. Expose kids to
              other hobbies and activities, such as team sports, Boy or Girl Scouts,
              and afterschool clubs.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>Monitor computer use and set clear limits.</strong> Make sure the computer is in a common area of the house where you can
              keep an eye on your child's online activity, and limit time online,
              waiting until homework and chores are done. This will be most effective
              if you as parents follow suit. If you can’t stay offline, chances are
              your children won’t either.  </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>Talk to your child about underlying issues.</strong> Compulsive computer use can be the sign of deeper problems. Is your
              child having problems fitting in? Has there been a recent major change,
              like a move or divorce, which is causing stress? Don’t be afraid to
              seek professional counseling if you are concerned about your child. </li>
              </ul>
