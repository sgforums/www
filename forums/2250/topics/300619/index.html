            <div class='col-md body'>I have managed to find this paragraph from a wiki article which I vaguely remember reading it a few months ago. It says that for Quads, 533 is actually better than 667 as it matches the FSB speed.<br><br><blockquote><br>Unlike the previous Pentium 4 and Pentium D design, the Core 2 technology sees a greater benefit from memory running synchronously with the Front Side Bus (FSB). This means that for the Conroe CPUs with FSB of 1066 MT/s, the ideal memory speed for DDR2 is PC2-4200 or PC2-8500 (twice the speed of PC2-4200). In some configurations, using PC2-5300 can actually decrease performance. Only when going to PC2-6400 is there a significant performance increase. While expensive DDR2 memory models with tighter timings do improve performance, the difference in real world games and applications is negligible.[48]<br><br>Optimally, the memory bandwidth afforded should match the bandwidth of the FSB closely. The AGTL+ PSB used by all NetBurst processors as well as current and medium-term (pre-QuickPath) Core 2 processors provide a 64-bit data path. Current chipsets provide for two DDR or two DDR2 channels.<br><br>**Table**<br><br>On jobs requiring large amounts of memory access, the quad-core Core 2 processors can benefit significantly[49] from using a PC2-8500 memory, which runs exactly twice as fast as the FSB; this is not an officially supported configuration, but a number of motherboards offer it.<br><br>The Core 2 processor does not require the use of DDR2. While the Intel 975X and P965 chipsets require this memory, some motherboards and chipsets support both the Core 2 and DDR memory. When using DDR memory, performance may be reduced because of the lower available memory bandwidth.<br></blockquote>But then, it says this:<br><br><blockquote><br>Only when going to PC2-6400 is there a significant performance increase.<br></blockquote>So does it mean that if I'm getting Q6600 soon, I should go ahead with DDR2-800 instead? Is anyone able to comment on this article?<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q6600#Synchronous_memory_modules" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q6600#Synchronous_memory_modules</a><br></div>

There are still quite a number of stores selling DDR2-533 afaik.<br><br>And regarding DDR3, I have read a few articles on it for the past few months and it seems like it would be better to stick with DDR2 for this year at least in terms of performance and price, more of the latter.

(or even all of the above?) Mind sharing some personal experience with these HDDs?<br><br>For me, I didn't like Seagate because it died on me years ago. I was using it as an external HDD and malfunctions during disk writes quite regularly, which would require me to switch it off and on and re-transfer the files. Then came the day when it happened thrice for a file transfer, then I got bloody impatient with it and switched on and off repeatively for a few times. A loud beep followed and I was stunned. Off and on again, it just beeped. I just went cursing for about 10 minutes before I was able to face the fact that all my data had just went six feet deep.<br><br>Maybe that HDD was an exception and I was unlucky or something - I don't know. But that experience left me with a really bad impression of Seagate.<br></div>
