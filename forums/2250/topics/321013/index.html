              <p>8800GT 1GB is pretty enough .. As for processor if u are looking at intel go for 9420 (U gotta confirm with MyPillowtalk, that was my dream processor) AMD i dunno cos i am not into AMD. PSU go 650w .. I guess its more than enough .. As for monitor its up to u ya. As for chasis .. I am using CM690 not bad ya .. Or Antec 900. Ram hmm go 1080 02 x 1gb. And dun go Vista imho hogging too much sys. resoucres .. Go XP.</p>
              <p>Dun get 4gb ya.. cos xp 32bit could onli detect up to 3gb. As for mobo.. I am not sure.. I am using Asus P5kpro.</p>

              <p>AMD is not recommended as they do not perform as well as Intel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I advise that you go for Intel Core 2 Wolfdale E7/E8 series processor for the best performance.For the graphics card i believe that if u wait a while,the 98 series may come out soon and replce the 88.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do bear in mind to make sure that your DIY PC is future proofed(newest mobo etc) as the upcoming sucessor to Core 2 is due to be released around 09.Nehalem is quite a good deal since in addition to 4 cores for mainstream variant,there is HyperThreading to double their logical number.<br></p>

              <p>thing is how much u want to spend...like my own DIY which i set up 3 months ago spend around 2k+...actually not bad for gaming..u can use for reference if u like....</p>
              <p>- Gigabyte Ga-P35-DSR intel Motherboard</p>
              <p>- Intel Quad Processor 2.4Ghz</p>
              <p>- 2 x Hitachi 160GD Sata Drive ( For me extra one is for backup...so actually for gaming 1 is more than enough)</p>
              <p>- XFX 8800GT 512MB 600Mhz Alpha Dog Graphics Card</p>
              <p>- Asus DVD R Drive (Again i think 1 DVD drive more than enough...got two only becoz easier to copy stuffs...lazy to change discs....lol)</p>
              <p>- LG Sata DVD RW Drive</p>
              <p>- Creative SB X-FI Xtreme Gamer Card</p>
              <p>- Coolmaster 690 Casing + Side Windows</p>
              <p>- 4GB Corsair Memory</p>
              <p>- Corsair 550W ATX Power Supply</p>
              <p>- Samsung 223BW Wide Screen 22inch Monitor</p>
              <p>- Edifier E1100 w/Sub woofer ( Sound not bad not top notch...thing is i like the looks which represent an alien head)</p>
              <p>- Windows Home Vista Ultimate edition ( A bit regret should have use XP...but then again vista is ok if u upgrade to SP1 )</p>
              <p>Anyway for gaming 8800 series is good enough liao....unless u ready to spend big bucks for dual 8800 card...which is not realistic..unless again if u no place to offload ur cash lol.....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>xp32bit? is it the standard for all XP? that mean if i plan to use XP... no point buying 4gb ram right? 2gb is enough...</p>

              <p>AMD is not recommended as they do not perform as well as Intel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I advise that you go for Intel Core 2 Wolfdale E7/E8 series processor for the best performance.For the graphics card i believe that if u wait a while,the 98 series may come out soon and replce the 88.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do bear in mind to make sure that your DIY PC is future proofed(newest mobo etc) as the upcoming sucessor to Core 2 is due to be released around 09.Nehalem is quite a good deal since in addition to 4 cores for mainstream variant,there is HyperThreading to double their logical number.</p>

              <p>AMD still so good i know.. but is it more value for money? i'm going for it's 64bit... intel using 64bit now? too long never play with pc already so not updated.</p>
              <p>any news when 98 coming out? is it already out in usa?.. i am thinking once it's officially out the price of 88should go down right? but how long more should i wait??</p>
              <p>intel core...any more detail intro? model?</p>
              <p>and yes... for mobo... i am also thinking for a future proofed one... any intro? thanks</p>

              Windows x64 doesn't offer a 32-bit Windows upgrade option; you'll need

              install the system. If you're planning to upgrade from a 32-bit Windows

              and reinstall all of your utilities and applications later. Though most
              of your applications will work fine within Windows x64's 32-bit
              compatibility mode, if the software includes its own device driver, you
              may encounter difficulties. For instance, when we tried to install
              iTunes, we were greeted with an error message saying that one of the
              drivers included with the software wasn't compatible with Windows x64.
              Though the application launched and appeared to work, there's likely a

              <p>In addition, each piece of hardware in your system needs a 64-bit
              driver to work properly. Though Microsoft includes many common device
              drivers with Windows x64, older or less common pieces of hardware won't
              work without a driver supplied by the manufacturer. Vendors such as
              Brother, Canon, Epson, Lexmark, Ricoh, Samsung, Wacom, Xerox, and Zoran
              currently offer driver support for the new OS, with other vendors

              <p>Actually,i think u got a little confused by the defination of 64 bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>64 bits for processors means native dual core processors.Not logical cores as with pentium 4 HT but true dual core.By right virtually most and even all processors from Intel and soon for AMD is fully dual core, like for instance even the celeron budget processor is turning dual core now.</p>
              <p>Intel Core is the latest microarchitecture in use now,suceeding the Pentium era.The processors that use the Core microarchitecture is Core Duo and Core 2 Duo.The former is now obsolote/aging since the sucessor is Core 2 Duo.</p>
              <p>Depending on your budget, you can take the E7,E8(both Wolfdale) or the E4(Allendale) series.They are the same processor only that the L2 cache size vary.</p>
              <p>The Wolfdale 8 series has 6MB L2 cache while the Wolfdale-3M 7 series has 3MB.</p>
              <p>Do bear in mind that even though the Allendale(E4 series) is cheaper,it is the older generation 65nm chip.It has only 2MB L2 cache</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>64 bit for OS is different.There is only a small performance gain in using 64bit OS for 64bit processor so dont worry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: For the Wolfdale 8 series Core 2 Duo + a average mobo - expect to shell out abt 300-500+</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And i do stress future proofing your set now.Nehalem is a worthy processor to switch too once it is out in 09/10</p>

              <p>Actually,i think u got a little confused by the defination of 64 bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>64 bits for processors means native dual core processors.Not logical cores as with pentium 4 HT but true dual core.By right virtually most and even all processors from Intel and soon for AMD is fully dual core, like for instance even the celeron budget processor is turning dual core now.</p>
              <p>Intel Core is the latest microarchitecture in use now,suceeding the Pentium era.The processors that use the Core microarchitecture is Core Duo and Core 2 Duo.The former is now obsolote/aging since the sucessor is Core 2 Duo.</p>
              <p>Depending on your budget, you can take the E7,E8(both Wolfdale) or the E4(Allendale) series.They are the same processor only that the L2 cache size vary.</p>
              <p>The Wolfdale 8 series has 6MB L2 cache while the Wolfdale-3M 7 series has 3MB.</p>
              <p>Do bear in mind that even though the Allendale(E4 series) is cheaper,it is the older generation 65nm chip.It has only 2MB L2 cache</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>64 bit for OS is different.There is only a small performance gain in using 64bit OS for 64bit processor so dont worry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: For the Wolfdale 8 series Core 2 Duo + a average mobo - expect to shell out abt 300-500+</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And i do stress future proofing your set now.Nehalem is a worthy processor to switch too once it is out in 09/10</p>

              <p><br>hmm mi still lost hahaa.. anyway.. did some reading..... so core 2 duo also 64bit now right? but not core or core duo right?? like i said.. long long never play with pc already.. last time i remember only AMD using 64bit design... so now intel also using lah.. and all future one right? ..... ok.. so if i am using core 2 duo.. that my xp also dun need to be xp64bit u were trying to say right? 32bit also ok ok... tio bo??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what other part u suggest?? anyway... 22" lcd monitor... can use for wii or ps3?? what should i look out for if i wan to do that? .. my tv down for few mths already.. dun plan to buy yet... but thinking to pay wii or ps3 in future maybe</p>
