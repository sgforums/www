            <div class='col-md body'><strong>M1 enters the Wi-Fi game with 3G router</strong><br>By AMIT ROY CHOUDHURY<br><br><span class="small">MOBILEONE (M1) has launched what it says is Singapore's first 3G router, enabling users to set up their own Wi-Fi hotspots using 3G wireless connectivity. Currently, M1 is the only one of Singapore's three major telcos which does not offer Wi-Fi hotspot services on the island. According to P Subramaniam, M1's director for enterprises and alliance, the 3G router works together with the Vodafone Mobile Connect 3G data card, which is also available from M1. The data card connects to the router that provides the wireless local area network (LAN) coverage for users.<br><br>One of the big advantages of this service is its portability. Since it does not depend on fixed lines, the Wi-Fi hotspot can be set up anywhere, then quickly dismantled and taken to another spot.<br><br>SingTel, the largest telco here, uses its telephone wires to deliver the broadband connection for its Wi-Fi services while rival StarHub uses its cable network for its Wi-Fi hotspots. M1's use of its 3G network for Wi-Fi hotspots will be a first for Singapore. While not very common in Asia, the use of 3G as a data pipe for Internet browsing is more pervasive in Europe.<br><br>Mr Subramaniam told BizIT that with the 3G router, customers will be able to set up Wi-Fi hotspots anywhere in Singapore. 'This highly portable, cost effective and simple-to-use product is ideal for both office and home use,' he said. However, industry watchers have pointed out that while the use of a 3G router for public Internet access via Wi-Fi hotspots is technically a sound concept, the bandwidth (or backhaul pipe, as it is called) is much smaller than is available with cable or copper wire. While both StarHub and SingTel broadband connections can go up to speeds above 10 megabits per second (Mbps), the 3G network that is currently used in Singapore provides sharply lower speeds, in the region of 384 kilobits per second.<br><br>Industry watchers say that the bandwidth provided by 3G would be sufficient for a small group of people, but several devices attempting to access the Internet at the same time could cause bandwidth problems to occur.<br><br>This will change when high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) technology is introduced by M1 by the end of this year. M1 says HSDPA, also known as 3.5G, theoretically allows access speeds in excess of 3.6 Mbps.<br><br>M1 said that customers who will most benefit from this solution include:<br><br>- Mobile teams from the accounting, insurance, legal, IT, media sectors working away from their main offices and needing easy access to high-speed Internet services.<br><br>- Outdoor or field teams in the construction and engineering industries which need Internet connectivity to connect to their corporate networks.<br><br>- Customers who wish to set up wireless connectivity at home.<br><br>- Coffeehouses and retailers who wish to provide free Wi-Fi services to their customers.<br><br>'The 3G router is another innovation in M1's effort to bring wireless broadband connectivity to business and consumers . . . Without the need for any fixed line broadband connectivity, enterprise teams and field forces on the move will be able to create Wi-Fi hotspots anywhere in Singapore using M1's 3G network,' Mr Subramaniam added.<br><br>According him, Ya Kun Kaya Toast's outlets at Tanjong Pagar and Suntec City are currently offering free broadband access in a trial run by Ya Kun and M1.<br><br>Key features of the 3G router include:<br><br>- Group connectivity: up to five users can connect simultaneously to share files and Internet access on the 3G/GPRS network without any need for fixed broadband connectivity.<br><br>- Portability: It's a mobile 3G/GPRS wireless solution that can be taken anywhere.<br><br>- Security: Wi-Fi protected access and a powerful firewall provide security for Internet and network access.<br><br>- Ease of use: It's quick and easy to set up, 'just plug and go'.<br><br>- Additional devices, such as printers and faxes, can be connected using Ethernet or wireless connections.<br><br>The 3G router with 3G Vodafone connect card bundle is available at $338 with M1's 3G SunSurf Unlimited Data plan at $68 a month at selected M1 Shops.</span><br><br><a href="http://business-times.asiaone.com/sub/bizit/story/0,4574,204686,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://business-times.asiaone.com/sub/bizit/story/0,4574,204686,00.html?</a></div>
