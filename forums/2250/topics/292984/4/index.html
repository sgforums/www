            <div class='col-md body'>If he/she is caught, either ODEX is not saying or the media didn't report. Why it's not reported... god knows. But I'm betting there's some sensitive info on the hacked server, which was why there's no news of anybody being caught yet.<br><br>Usually if there's sensitive info around and this happens... the most logical thing is to shut up. You notice that ST reported the hack... it's not because ODEX called up ST and said they were hacked...<br><br>If they have no sensitive info on the server... they wouldn't be quiet. Their website should have been up by now.<br><br>Unless their server was rooted. If that is so... they probably have to wipe everything...<br><br>If he/she is not caught... it's probably more than a kiddie that did that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not suggesting that their internal network was cracked (but I wouldn't rule out that).<br><br>I'm only thinking if the dumb ODEX has put the sensitive info on a public server... but protected it (probably using Chmod and other protection).<br><br>If that was the case... then I say they are owned big time. Because once a server is rooted... chmod will not protect the documents. The whole group of Singaporeans can gang up and sue ODEX for not protecting documents...<br><br>If it's on the internal network... then all I have to say is... don't use open-source products if you don't have the know-how. Obviously, the protection is bad enough and they hire a half-pail admin. Use MS servers... at least most of the admins out there are trained in it...</div>
