              <p>AMD is cheap, but fast. Intel cannot beat on
                          Price-to-performance! But Intel wins in pure performance lah.</p>
              <p>Lets take the Phenom II 955, $265</p>
              <p>And Intel's closest priced chip: Q8400 and E8400.</p>
              <p>A quick check on Anandtech reveals that the 955 is superior.
                          Also, the 955 is FULLY UNLOCKED. Easy overclocking.</p>
              <p>I will suggest Gigabyte, 790FX/GX or 785G mobos. Asus tends to
                          be very expensive. I'm planning to get the GA MA785GT-UD3H,
                          apparently it has very good overclocking even with locked
                          chips.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want 6GB kit? That is Intel i7 memory. Look for a 4GB kit.
                          Or 2 kits :P</p>
              <p>I can suggest Team Group RAM. Their Team Xtreem and Team Xtreem
                          Dark kits are pretty good. OCZ is excellent as well.</p>

              <p>What I understand from Gigabyte's models, suffix -UD/US means the board has their Ultra Durable technology, with a lot of copper in the board.</p>
              <p>So, lets say the board MA785GPMT-UD2H,</p>
              <p>785G - Chipset, G means board has integrated graphics</p>
              <p>P -Integrated graphics has its own, small amount of memory (Typically 128MB) &lt;-I think so, anyway</p>
              <p>M - microATX form factor, smaller board than ATX.</p>
              <p>T -Unsure</p>
              <p>UD2 - Ultra Durable, 2oz of copper</p>
              <p>H - Unsure</p>
              <p>This is what I observed though.</p>
              <p>Frankly, no one needs 2000MHz RAM right now, but compared to other types of RAM, they aren't too expensive. They're just up there somewhere. You don't need a 950W PSU to run them, the specifications was what Team Group tested the RAM on. Any decent PSU will run them just fine.</p>
              <p>By decent, I mean brands like AcBel, OCZ, Seventeam, Corsair, PC Power and Cooling, just to name a few. Not that PowerFlower Hippy Zeta 450W that came with your casing, that will probably just blow up the whole system, and when a PSU blows, it probably will take a few of your components with it. Trust me, I have countless power supplys blow on me, ain't pretty. Nor is it some aromatic thing too.</p>
              <p>Modules are generally vendor-agnostic. That means it will work regardless of the CPU involved, as long as the motherboard and chip support the RAM standard. Any AM3 CPU will support DDR3. Yes, those are motherboards. You can use these RAMs on any motherboard that supports DDR3. Remember though, some boards are very picky about RAMs. I remember some ASUS boards had issues with Corsair Dominator RAM, and refused to boot. Also, there's an issue with some high-speed RAM built on chips known as the Elpida Hyper IC. They fail VERY fast.</p>

              <p>It might be able to go further, but that involves overclocking the CPU and increasing the memory multiplier so I don't recommend you to do so. Corsair Dominator memory is good, fast, but may have incompatibility issues with some boards.</p>
              <p>Yes, DIMM 3 and 4 refer to the slots on the board. DIMM 1 usually refers to the slot closest to the CPU cocket, so 4 would be the furthest. I would recommend OCZ RAM instead, not as much compatibility issues as Dominator memory. The Gold/Titanium RAMs are good, plenty fast without oversized heatsinks.</p>
              <p>650W is more than enough, depending on the graphics card involved. Dual GPU cards might works fine. Dual-card set-ups would work too, if they aren't too power hungry.</p>
              <p>I would recommend primarily Bell Systems, though I've had good experiences with Best Price beside it.</p>

                      you to do so. Corsair Dominator memory is good, fast, but may have
                      incompatibility issues with some boards.</p>
              <p>Yes, DIMM 3 and 4 refer to the slots on the board. DIMM 1
                      usually refers to the slot closest to the CPU cocket, so 4 would be
                      the furthest. I would recommend OCZ RAM instead, not as much
                      compatibility issues as Dominator memory. The Gold/Titanium RAMs
                      are good, plenty fast without oversized heatsinks.</p>
              <p>650W is more than enough, depending on the graphics card
                      involved. Dual GPU cards might works fine. Dual-card set-ups would
                      work too, if they aren't too power hungry.</p>
              <p>I would recommend primarily Bell Systems, though I've had good
                      experiences with Best Price beside it.</p>

              <p>Max supported speed of 1866MHZ means that the board will not support any frequencies above that without overclocking. So, your memory can be those high-speed 2GHz RAM, but can only run at 1866MHz. So yes, you got that right. As for DIMM 1 and 2, I'm not sure about their maximum supported speeds. They can either support the native 2GHz speed, or not at all. I'm not very sure. Also, somehow I can't access the pdf file, it keeps corrupting.</p>
              <p>What is your monitor resolution? Budget for graphics card?</p>
              <p>On the box, they will usually list the power supply requirements. I would suggest getting a power supply that is at least 50W over the required amount. So if the box says 550W minimum, I would recommend at least a 600W power supply, or better still, 650W.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT: When they says "Only support DIMM 3 and 4", they really mean it. That means the sticks WILL NOT operate on DIMM 1 and 2.</p>

              <p>The motherboard wont, but the graphics card will. Let say, my HD4850. It lists a 500W PSU requirement. That requirement is, say, based on a Quad-core, 1 DVD Drive and 2 hard drives. Of course, people have used good quality 380W PSUs to power it XD</p>

              <p>Looks like I have to go sls today to stock up fast. I think Core i7 is just too expensive thus many are switching to AMD, I guess so.</p>
              <p>How come you are not getting Gigabyte's mobo ? Is it because it is expensive compared to MSI brand ? I just want to get your expert opinion on this. Its a 128bit width right ?</p>
              <p>If I can't get the Phenom ll 955 or 965 from Best Price or Bell Systems, I may go to PC Theme Technology eventually. </p>
              <p>Casing &amp; the rest will get it some other day, CPU, motherboard &amp; the rams are more impt to me at this juncture.</p>

              <p>I'm not a gamer &amp; i think AMD is more than enuff for me at this juncture, in future I may buy i7 and DIY another set. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>With that monitor, a HD4850/HD5750 is enough. Or a HD5770, if

              <p>Price wise, about $50 to $100.</p>

              <p>The motherboard wont, but the graphics card will. Let say, my
              HD4850. It lists a 500W PSU requirement. That requirement is, say,
              based on a Quad-core, 1 DVD Drive and 2 hard drives. Of course,
              people have used good quality 380W PSUs to power it XD</p>

              <p>About $560 from Cybermind. Note that quite a few shops don't
              stock the components anymore. Best Price has no more 955 CPUs, and
              Bell Systems doesn't have the Xtreem kit.</p>

              <p>Since I'm going to be overclocking, I need some heatsinks on the VRM or Voltage Regulator Modules (those tiny chips above the CPU socket). I tried the Easy OC switch. It's easy. It took my 955 to 3.84GHz stable at stock voltage, and as soon as I get a better cooler, I'm going to push that past 4GHz :D</p>

              <p>Technically, just connect everything, HDD, DVD drive, graphics card, cables, wires etc. and power on. You can configure things in the BIOS, if needed, but usually will work perfectly out of the box. Install Windows, drivers etc. Then, just tweak it here and there (Increase bus speed/multiplier, changing memory ratio) and you're set. If you got the MSI board, just use the Easy OC switch and everything will be configured for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not sure what you mean by pointers. As in, how to assemble the computer? How to tweak it? Its a very wide topic.</p>
