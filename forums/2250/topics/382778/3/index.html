              <p>Hi Raraken,</p>
              <p>Finally I've bought all the stuff to DIY myself. Spent the last 2 days trying to figure out how to put those pieces together &amp; finally I've assembled almost 80% of the entire system.</p>
              <p>Now the biggest problem is the PSU, I bought Antec True Power New 550W for $146, actually thought of buying the 650W but the price $185 puts me off so decided to stick with 550W, didn't know that PSU is so expensive :-(</p>
              <p>I've managed to assemble the PSU, GPU, rams, HDD, DVD writer except the AMD CPU. Yesterday went to sls to buy one of the cpu cooler, Xigmatek - Balder SD1283 at $78, was told that its a direct heat touch thus able to dissipate the heat quite quickly. You know i know nuts about computer so dun know whether to trust the salesman or not, and now still trying to figure out how to mount the cooler on the cpu.</p>
              <p>Firstly the psu, I've managed to connect one 24pin &amp; one 4 pin onto the board, now left with one 8pin connector, dun knw where to connect to ?</p>
              <p>Now the psu still left with 2 bunches of wires, 1st bunch, 2 x 3 molex connectors, 2 x 3 Serial ATA connectors, 1 x 1 PCI express connector 6pin, so how ? Pls see the PSU picture in PDF <a href="http://www.antec.com/Believe_it/index.php?page=ProductManuals">HERE</a>. I believe the Serial ATA is for the HDD, DVD writer &amp; eSATA connections right ? What abt the 3 molex connectors  &amp; the PCI Express ?</p>
              <p>Another bunch I've is 5 extra wires with different 4-6 pins, SATA &amp; 4-6 holes connectors, dun know which is for which ? Me afraid of connecting the wrong wires &amp; end up like what you've said, entire board burnt.</p>
              <p>Besides, behind the power unit, there are 4 more sockets, 2 red in colour (8 &amp; 6 pin holes) whereas the other 2 are 6 holes black in colour. What is it for, connect to where ? Quite confusing here.</p>
              <p>Also I bought the same mobo board as yours, MSI 785G-E53, I also bought the Cooler Master casing model CM 690 which comes with 4 fans. I believe those fan connectors are to be connected to the psu cables right instead of onto the mobo board ?</p>
              <p>In fact the PSU manaul don't say much about connection that's why I'm stuck now, pls advise, tks.</p>

              <p>Sure 550W enough for HD5800? I hope its 550W constant, not 550W peak. Peak and constant are 2 different wattages.</p>
              <p>Edit: It should. ATI recommends 500W for 1.</p>
              <p>The S1283 uses backplate attachment. You will have to fix the backplate (those flat metal pieces) onto the back of the mobo. Requires disassembly of the mobo from the casing. If the board has a backplate, unscrew it off, then fix the AM3 backplate onto the back of the socket area. If you need, I can upload pics of the process (I'm getting a cooler as well, and I need to take down serial no. so I can register warranty :P)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 8-pin cable is the EPS 12V cable. Mainly used for power-hungry CPUs. an EPS 12V connector is just 2 of the 4-pin CPU combined. Or 1/2 the EPS connector is the 4-pin. You either plug in 1 or the other into the mobo, depending on the socket connector on the mobo. I assume you refer to the hard-wired 8-pin? Not the 6-pin+2-pin?</p>
              <p>The cables you mentioned, which connectors go to which plug? You purchased a semi-modular PSU, meaning most of what you need is hard-wired into the unit. If you need more, then use the modular cables. I understand that one has a red 8-pin on one end, and a black 6-pin on the other. This is your PCI-Express power connector. Plug in the red end into the red 8-pin connector on the PSU and connect the black 6-pin into your graphics card. </p>
              <p>The cables with SATA and Molex, I'm not so sure. Are they all wired into black 6-pins? So you have 2 cables with 3 molex each and 2 cables with 3 SATA each? SATA power cables are for devices using the SATA transmission interface. Basically, HDD, ODD. Molex connectors are for older peripherals, HDD or ODD, or fan controllers (Sometimes. Some controllers use floppy power instead) To use these cables, plug the 6-pin end into the 6-pin plugs. Do you have any other cables that can plug into the other red 8-pin? Seems odd, I'm not sure if the black 6-pins can plug into the red 8-pin socket. Does the users manual mention anything about this?</p>
              <p>Plug in the cables only if you need them, anyway. </p>
              <p>EDIT: Yes, yes it does. Whoops. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those fans, it depends. If you want to be able to control the speed, connect them into the mobo's 3-pin headers. But be aware that the header nearest to the SATA ports will only power the fan, and won't allow fan speed control. The other 2 near the back IO ports can. I would suggest connecting the rear and side fan into the headers near the IO ports, and the rest via Molex.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Actually
                  I just noticed that my CPU requires 140watt, I should have bought the
                  PSU 650W come to think of it. Don't know whether 550W is enuff for me
                  since I'm not a gamer, but I opened abt 5 applications to multi-task,
                  wonder the power is enuff :-(</span></p>

                  appreciate if you could put up the pics (step by step) to guide me

                  combined. Or 1/2 the EPS connector is the 4-pin. You either plug in
                  1 or the other into the mobo, depending on the socket connector on
                  the mobo. I assume you refer to the hard-wired 8-pin? Not the
                  6-pin+2-pin?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, its the 8-pin hard-wired, so this should
                  be a additional wire to me right  since I mentioned earlier in my
                  posting that I did manage to plug in a 4 pin onto the mobo. Yes or No ?</span></p>
              <p>The cables you mentioned, which connectors go to which plug? You
                  purchased a semi-modular PSU, meaning most of what you need is
                  hard-wired into the unit. If you need more, then use the modular
                  cables. I understand that one has a red 8-pin on one end, and a
                  black 6-pin on the other. This is your PCI-Express power connector.
                  Plug in the red end into the red 8-pin connector on the PSU and
                  connect the black 6-pin into your graphics card. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I
                  can plug in the red 8 pin into the back of psu but there isn't any 6
                  pin hole on my graphic card, where sholud I plug the 6 pin connector ?
                  You can see my picture card <a href="http://www.legitreviews.com/article/1011/1/">HERE</a> from this website.</span></p>
              <p>The cables with SATA and Molex, I'm not so sure. Are they all
                  wired into black 6-pins? So you have 2 cables with 3 molex each and
                  2 cables with 3 SATA each? SATA power cables are for devices using
                  the SATA transmission interface. Basically, HDD, ODD. Molex
                  connectors are for older peripherals, HDD or ODD, or fan
                  controllers (Sometimes. Some controllers use floppy power instead)
                  To use these cables, plug the 6-pin end into the 6-pin plugs. Do
                  you have any other cables that can plug into the other red 8-pin?
                  Seems odd, I'm not sure if the black 6-pins can plug into the red
                  8-pin socket. Does the users manual mention anything about
                  this?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ok
                  I understand what you mean, the modular cables you mentioned is my
                  additional bunch of wires wrapped in another pakage, so lets not talk
                  abt the additonal wires for now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now
                  I left with 1 cable with 3 Serial ATA connector (sorry my apology I
                  mistaken it as SATA cable thus you are confused),  1 cable with 3 molex
                  connector, 1 cable with 1 PCI-E &amp; the last cable 8 pin which I
                  believe is the additional connector to the mobo which I earlier used
                  the 4 pin to connect to the mobo. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">OK,
                  now I got it already after examining for a while, the 1 cable with 3
                  Serial ATA should be connected to the HDD &amp; DVD writer whereas the
                  cable with 3 molex connector should be meant for my additional fans in
                  the casing or other peripherals right, Raraken ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And
                  with 1 cable left with PCI-E, I think it is meant for any additonal gpu
                  card since my HD 4670 doesn't come with any connector, right ?</span></p>
              <p> Plug in the cables only if you need them, anyway. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>EDIT: Yes, yes it does. Whoops. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">?</span></p>
              <p>Those fans, it depends. If you want to be able to control the
                  speed, connect them into the mobo's 3-pin headers. But be aware
                  that the header nearest to the SATA ports will only power the fan,
                  and won't allow fan speed control. The other 2 near the back IO
                  ports can. I would suggest connecting the rear and side fan into
                  the headers near the IO ports, and the rest via Molex.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So what you are trying to tell me is that the
                  rear &amp; the side fans connect into the 3-pin headers nearer to the
                  I/O ports so that I can control the speed ? May I ask why the rear
                  &amp; side fans need controller ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now
                  I have 4 fans, 1 front, 1rear &amp; both sides 2 fans. So the rest of
                  the fans or additional fan can connect via molex thru the psu right ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You
                  can take your time to load those backplate pictures because tommorow I
                  may not have the time to login here thus I will talk to you again on
                  Monday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thank you Raraken for being so helpful, appreciate that &amp; have a nice weekend. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Sure 550W enough for HD5800? I hope its 550W constant, not 550W
              peak. Peak and constant are 2 different wattages.</p>
              <p>Edit: It should. ATI recommends 500W for 1.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hi Raraken,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tks for the reply. How do you
              check whether if its a constant or peak 550W, damn me dun even know
              have such wattages exist :-(</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It should say so on the label. If they put MAX Combined Wattage, it means peak output. Peak output means the maximum load the PSU can handle for a brief period of time, and cannot sustain that amount for very long. Say, when you have multiple hard drives, and during spin-up, they can consume massive amounts of electricity but ONLY during initial spin-up. Constant power is what the unit can handle 24/7 for its lifespan.</span></p>
              <div class="quote_body"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I bought the ATI Radeon HD 4670 &amp;
              it stated system requirement is 400W, I believe it requires 400W
              only if I play hardcore game right.</span></div>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">400W is overkill. Manufacturers overestimate power requirements, since many people like to buy generic power supplies like that Chengquan Zhonggua Industrial Ltd 400W PSU (I love making names up like these XD) you saw on sale for $18 :P It requires 400W only if you have an i7 at 4.5GHz or a similarly powerful CPU. I ran my 9500GS (Slightly lower power requirement than the HD4670) and Q6600 with a 300W PSU.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Actually I just noticed that my
              CPU requires 140watt, I should have bought the PSU 650W come to
              think of it. Don't know whether 550W is enuff for me since I'm not
              a gamer, but I opened abt 5 applications to multi-task, wonder the
              power is enuff :-(</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Heh, I'm using X4 955, HD4850, 3 HDD and a DVD Super Multi on a PSU rated at 500W MAX (Vantec ION 2+). The 955's TDP is only 15W lower than the 965's. Sure enough. You could run your system with a good quality 380W.</span></p>
              <p>The S1283 uses backplate attachment. You will have to fix the
              backplate (those flat metal pieces) onto the back of the mobo.
              Requires disassembly of the mobo from the casing. If the board has
              a backplate, unscrew it off, then fix the AM3 backplate onto the
              back of the socket area. If you need, I can upload pics of the
              process (I'm getting a cooler as well, and I need to take down
              serial no. so I can register warranty :P)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you dun mind the hassle, I
              really appreciate if you could put up the pics (step by step) to
              guide me along how to install the back plate &amp; the cooler on
              the cpu. Sorry to you because I'm a newbie, need some
              guidance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I don't mind, I've done it with the CM Hyper 212 before, I just need to get a cooler first. </span></p>

              6-pin+2-pin?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, its the 8-pin hard-wired, so
              this should be a additional wire to me right  since I
              mentioned earlier in my posting that I did manage to plug in a 4
              pin onto the mobo. Yes or No ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yep, additional. Try and hide it as best as you can. No one likes to see wires dangling about.</span></p>

              connect the black 6-pin into your graphics card. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I can plug in the red 8 pin into
              the back of psu but there isn't any 6 pin hole on my graphic card,

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ok I understand what you mean, the
              modular cables you mentioned is my additional bunch of wires
              wrapped in another pakage, so lets not talk abt the additonal wires
              for now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now I left with 1 cable with 3

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And with 1 cable left with PCI-E,
              I think it is meant for any additonal gpu card since my HD 4670
              doesn't come with any connector, right ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yep, the SATA (Or Serial ATA) power cables are connected to any HDD or DVD Burner, while the molex goes to any peripheral or fans that aren't connected to headers. The PCI-E is meant for a more power hungry card, your 4670 is quite tame.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></p>
              <p> Plug in the cables only if you need them,
              anyway. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>EDIT: Yes, yes it does. Whoops. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I was referring to the modular cables being able to plug into any socket on the PSU itself, if the black 6-pins can connect to the red 8-pins</span></p>
              <p>Those fans, it depends. If you want to be able to control the
              speed, connect them into the mobo's 3-pin headers. But be aware
              that the header nearest to the SATA ports will only power the fan,
              and won't allow fan speed control. The other 2 near the back IO
              ports can. I would suggest connecting the rear and side fan into
              the headers near the IO ports, and the rest via Molex.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So what you are trying to tell me
              is that the rear &amp; the side fans connect into the 3-pin headers
              nearer to the I/O ports so that I can control the speed ? May I ask
              why the rear &amp; side fans need controller ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's best to be able to control fan speed, since high speed fans at full speed can be pretty annoying. Typically, the fans that come with CM casings spin at 1k rpm, which isn't loud. Control is needed when dealing with more powerful fans though.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Also, this reduces cable clutter, since you don't have the PSU cables extending down to allow the fan cables to connect to it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now I have 4 fans, 1 front, 1rear
              &amp; both sides 2 fans. So the rest of the fans or additional fan
              can connect via molex thru the psu right ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you have 1 rear, 1 front and 2 side, I would suggest the rear and 2 side fans be connected to headers, and the front be connected via Molex. So,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rear fan uses Fan Header 1</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Side fan 1 uses Fan Header 2</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Side fan 2 uses fan header 3</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Front fan via PSU molex.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I will try and make it clearer when I fix the cooler.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You can take your time to load
              those backplate pictures because tommorow I may not have the time
              to login here thus I will talk to you again on Monday.</span></p>

The metal frame of the clip should fit neatly in the grooves at the base of the heatsink. After applying the thermal grease, position the base on top of the CPU, then, just like the original stock cooler, hook both ends of the retention clip onto the mounting mechanism and push the locking pin down.</p>

              <p>Basically, you should have 2 sets of retention in the package.
              Push-pins and a clip. The clip is for AMD platforms. The metal
              frame of the clip should fit neatly in the grooves at the base of
              the heatsink. After applying the thermal grease, position the base
              on top of the CPU, then, just like the original stock cooler, hook
              both ends of the retention clip onto the mounting mechanism and
              push the locking pin down.</p>

              <p>Hi bro,</p>
              <p>Yes finally I can fix the cpu cooler, actually the metal frame is meant for Intel mobo cos the frame doesn't fix into my mobo irrespective of what direction I placed it, somehow the hole on the metal frame doesn't fix the mobo at all.</p>
              <p>The black plastic plate on the mobo (shld be the back plate usually what you guys called) should not be dismantled, I just have to use those clips provided by the cooler &amp; placed the base of the cooler on top of the cpu like what you've just explained above.</p>
              <p>Now all done, I guess next will be the BIOS settings the loading of OS. Let me see the manual if I'm able to do the settings, if I can't, I'll post it here again, thanks Raraken.</p>
              <p>BTW dun bother to upload those pics, assembly all done now <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>That's an Intel platform. Its just the way that AMD chooses to mount its coolers that we have to mount it like we do. Intel platforms have no problem.I don't mind the blocked DIMM slots. If you really find the need for 8GB of RAM, there exist low-profile DIMMs to allow users to use these large cooler as well as use the slots underneath the cooler.</p>

              <p>Hi Raraken,</p>
              <p>Sorry for the late reply. If we were to mount it the AMD way(blocking those 2 DIMM slots), the cooler fan &amp; the casing fan will not be facing the same direction, one will be facing west &amp; the other facing north &amp; I wonder whether the casing fan is able to draw out the heatair within the casing itself. It looks strange to me if both the fans are not facing the same direction, just my personal opinion though.</p>

              <p>If your casing has intake fans on the side panel, there shouldn't be any problem. The air comes in via the side fan, and cools the northbridge/GPU, and is either vented out via the rear exhaust or gets taken in by the Balder's fan before getting exhausted by the PSU (If top mounted).Kinda strange to me too, but Xigmatek designed it to be used in conjunction with a side intake fan situated near the cooler.</p>

              <p>Power on the computer, and install OS, everything etc. Then after that you can go fiddle with BIOS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing to note: If you don't know what things do, then leave it like that. I've got a somehow dead board/CPU after a BSOD. Not to say overclocking shouldn't be done, just that you need to fully know the risks that come with it. If you have RAM that is certified to run at 1600MHz, and you have a good cooler, just use the Easy OC switch. The board will automatically configure itself and it will be stable, since voltages are taken care of. Yep.</p>
              <p>If you use the same RAM as I do (Team Xtreem 1600MHz), after using the Easy OC switch, you will need to configure the memory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After you are in the BIOS, select Cell Menu, then scroll down to Memory Configuration or whatever is underneath Memory-Z. Select the first option, and select DCT 1. A whole line of options should now be available to you. </p>
              <p>The things you will want to take note of is CAS Latency (CL), tRCD, tRP and tRAS as well as Command Rate. On the RAM box there is a sticker about the speeds of the RAM in the format CL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS CR(eg. 7-7-7-21 2T)</p>
