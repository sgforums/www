              <p>Power on the computer, and install OS, everything etc. Then
                  after that you can go fiddle with BIOS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing to note: If you don't know what things do, then leave
                  it like that. I've got a somehow dead board/CPU after a BSOD. Not
                  to say overclocking shouldn't be done, just that you need to fully
                  know the risks that come with it. If you have RAM that is certified
                  to run at 1600MHz, and you have a good cooler, just use the Easy OC
                  switch. The board will automatically configure itself and it will
                  be stable, since voltages are taken care of. Yep.</p>
              <p>If you use the same RAM as I do (Team Xtreem 1600MHz), after
                  using the Easy OC switch, you will need to configure the
                  memory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After you are in the BIOS, select Cell Menu, then scroll down to
                  Memory Configuration or whatever is underneath Memory-Z. Select the
                  first option, and select DCT 1. A whole line of options should now
                  be available to you. </p>
              <p>The things you will want to take note of is CAS Latency (CL),
                  tRCD, tRP and tRAS as well as Command Rate. On the RAM box there is
                  a sticker about the speeds of the RAM in the format
                  CL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS CR(eg. 7-7-7-21 2T)</p>

              <p>Hmm, I thot I've to configure the BIOS first then load the OS, btw what is BSOD &amp; why have to take note of the RAM latency ? Is it becos I've to configure the RAM latency inside the BIOS ?</p>

              <p>Usually i load OS, then config BIOS, since usually no need change anything from default.</p>
              <p>BSOD is the BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH. Which isn't really as scary as OS X's Kernel Panic. At least you know what caused the problem if you get BSOD. You get kernel panic, GG liao. You have NO IDEA what causes it unless you have OS running in verbose mode, and even then that is only for boot sequences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take note of RAM latency is because RAM that says Core i5/i7 compatible is configured for a special thing called XMP, or eXtreme Memory Profile (Intel fails at spelling, EMP sounds better). It will run at 1333MHz on any platform that doesn't know XMP (Like any AMD/NVidia chipset or Intel's low-end offering). To get the RAM to run at full specification, one needs to manually configure the timings.</p>

              <p>Ah, that's ya Base Clock (BCLK)</p>
              <p>Since you got the 965 @ 3.4GHz, you would have a CPU multiplier of 17x (200 x 17 = 3400). RAM multiplier would be 1:3.33, or 3:10 FSB:DRAM, which means your RAM is running at 1333.</p>
              <p>And since you have a nice cooler with good airflow in your casing, up the BCLK to 240.</p>
              <p>This will result in CPU speed of 4GHZ, DRAM speed of 1600MHz (240/3=80. 80*10=800. 800*2=1600). If you feel this is too dangerous, lower the CPU multiplier to 15x or something. If you feel confident in your ability, do it manually. If you are scared, turn off your PC, switch off the PSU, and trigger the Easy OC switch, where both jumpers are in teh OFF position. Voltages will be adjusted automatically, and you will get a BCLK of 240.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then, after that, configure your memory. Use 1.63V under VDIMM or Memory Voltage or something. I've gone through 3 sets of RAM so far, and me setting it at 1.67V may have been a contributing factor (I shouldn't think so). This 4th set is working beautifully, but I'm leaving it at stock for now. Leave the timings to auto and press F10 to save and exit.</p>

              <p>Since you got the 965 @ 3.4GHz, you would have a CPU multiplier
              of 17x (200 x 17 = 3400). RAM multiplier would be 1:3.33, or 3:10
              FSB:DRAM, which means your RAM is running at 1333.</p>
              <p>And since you have a nice cooler with good airflow in your
              casing, up the BCLK to 240.</p>
              <p>This will result in CPU speed of 4GHZ, DRAM speed of 1600MHz
              (240/3=80. 80*10=800. 800*2=1600). If you feel this is too
              dangerous, lower the CPU multiplier to 15x or something. If you
              feel confident in your ability, do it manually. If you are scared,
              turn off your PC, switch off the PSU, and trigger the Easy OC
              switch, where both jumpers are in teh OFF position. Voltages will
              be adjusted automatically, and you will get a BCLK of 240.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then, after that, configure your memory. Use 1.63V under VDIMM
              or Memory Voltage or something. I've gone through 3 sets of RAM so
              far, and me setting it at 1.67V may have been a contributing factor
              (I shouldn't think so). This 4th set is working beautifully, but
              I'm leaving it at stock for now. Leave the timings to auto and

I guess some settings are incorrect, can help to rectify the problem ?</p>
              <p>Next Question :-</p>

              <p>2. Adjust CPU FSB Frequency - <span style="color: #ff9900;">default setting is 200</span>. You advised to give it a try to up to 240. My question is how would you know when we reach the max ? (eg. maybe 280 followed by 300, 340, 400 etc...) (is it refer to processor manual ?)</p>
              <p>3. Adjust CPU Ratio - <span style="color: #ff9900;">default setting is AUTO</span>. If I press enter, I can see a list of multiplier ratio up to 30 something. My question is how far can we go ? (is it refer to processor manual ?)</p>
              <p>4. What is the meaning of <span style="color: #ff9900;">Adjust CPU-NB Ratio</span> ? Default is AUTO.</p>
              <p>5. Advanced Clock Calibration - <span style="color: #ff9900;">Default is Disabled. The manual states that it is for overclock. Setting to ENABLED allows you to set the CPU Ratio higher provided the processor supports this function.</span> My question is even if I left it as default DISABLED, I'm still able to adjust the FSB speed to 240 &amp; increase the multiplier ratio to a higher figure but will it work if I left it DISABLED, or do i have to change to ENABLED ?</p>
              <p>6. Auto Overclock Technology - <span style="color: #ff9900;">Default is DISABLED. The manual states that  setting to MAX FSB allows the system to detect the maximum FSB clock and to overclock automatically.</span> BTW our MSI system FSB speed is 5.2 GT/s which is approx 2000+ MHz, why default is DISABLED, it should be ENABLED so that we can enjoy the full speed right ?</p>
              <p>7. Multistep OC Booster - default is DISABLED. Manual states that is used to avoid the BIOS might crash with overclocking.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Disabled - Dsiable this item, apply OC settings during POST. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Mode 1 - Slight OC during POST &amp; then apply full OC when loading the OS</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Mode 2 - Load the OS then apply the OC settings.</span></p>
              <p>My question is what is POST &amp; should I leave it as DISABLED ?</p>
              <p>8. You also mentioned about ram latency &amp; should be manually configured in order to achieve the full speed. Should I follow the latency speed on the ram &amp; configure it ?</p>
              <p>9. You said used 1.63V under VDIMM
                                          or Memory Voltage or something, but it is grey out, I can't change the setting at all. I guess if I make some changes to those CPU &amp; multiplier ratio, I think it might allow me to change the voltage setting right ?</p>
              <p>Sorry if its a bit lengthy, thanks.</p>

              <p><strong>I wouldn't trust this. I tried it for fun and gave me a Base Clock of 215.</strong></p>
              <p>7. Multistep OC Booster - default is DISABLED. Manual states
              that is used to avoid the BIOS might crash with overclocking.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Disabled - Dsiable this item,
              apply OC settings during POST.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Mode 1 - Slight OC during POST
              &amp; then apply full OC when loading the OS</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Mode 2 - Load the OS then apply
              the OC settings.</span></p>
              <p>My question is what is POST &amp; should I leave it as DISABLED
              ?</p>
              <p><strong>POST, or Power-on-Self-Test, is when the system starts up and checks every component installed to verify that they are working fine. If the system fails to POST, something in your system just f**ked up. I usually select Mode 2, so that I instantly know if the OC fails. Also, you might encounter a time where the OC is stable in Windows, but your system just doesn't want to POST.</strong></p>
              <p>8. You also mentioned about ram latency &amp; should be manually
              configured in order to achieve the full speed. Should I follow the
              latency speed on the ram &amp; configure it ?</p>
              <p><strong>Don't go immediately to 7-7-7-21. That RAM was meant for Intel i5/i7. Go slow, try 8-8-8-23 first. Then lower each field until you get an unstable memory. Then you either stick with the last known good configuration or leave that setting at 8 and lower the next one.</strong></p>
              <p>9. You said used 1.63V under VDIMM or Memory Voltage or
              something, but it is grey out, I can't change the setting at all. I
              guess if I make some changes to those CPU &amp; multiplier ratio, I
              think it might allow me to change the voltage setting right ?</p>
              <p><strong>Page Up/Down bro. </strong></p>
              <p>Sorry if its a bit lengthy, thanks.</p>

              <p>I just purchased the CoolerMaster Hyper TX3 HSF for my new build. Will be replacing the stock, gay CM fan with a Delta EFC0912BF that I bought second hand. Pretty clean and low-mileage fan, from my observation.</p>
              <p>I also bought another Nidec Beta V B35502-35 TA450DC for my casing exhaust, because the old one (I got the old one second hand) squeaked loudly at a certain speed. The new ones squeak, but not that loudly.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LN2, AKA liquid Nitrogen. </strong></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>RAID, or Redundant Array of Inexpensive/Independent Drives. Allows you to do stuff with your hard drives like "stripe" them or "mirror" them.</strong></p>
              <p>So to summarise what you have explained in your last posting,
              may I say that everytime when we want to do OC, there are 4 steps
              that we need to change/configure :-</p>
              <p>1. Increase the CPU FSB, right ?</p>
              <p><strong>Depends. Need not be done if you CPU is multiplier-unlocked. Many things are based on FSB, like memory speed. Since your RAM is supposed to run at 1600MHz, you need to increase it if you want to run it at 1600MHz.</strong></p>
              <p>2. Adjust the CPU ratio which means increase the multiplier
              right ?</p>
              <p><strong>Increase or Decrease depending on the situation.</strong></p>
              <p>3. Increase the ram latency right ?</p>
              <p><strong>No. You want to DECREASE latency. Latency is bad. Higher latency=Longer time to access data</strong></p>
              <p>4. Increase the voltage right ? Ram voltage or CPU voltage, a
              bit confuse here. To what voltages, how do we know ?</p>
              <p><strong>Depends on which component needs to be overclocked. Overclocking the CPU means raising CPU voltage. Overclocking memory means raising RAM voltage.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>To raise CPU Voltage, increase the CPU VID. The base CPU voltage should increase as well. To increase RAM voltage, increase VDIMM, but no more than 1.65V.</strong></p>
              <p>BTW do we have to configure 4 things SIMULTANEOUSLY or one at a
              time ? One at a time means increase the CPU FSB first, the rest
              leave it as default &amp; see whether if the system is stable, if
              it is, then follow by steps 3 &amp; 4 ?</p>
              <p><strong>Basic steps I took:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Lower multiplier to 12x or something, as long as it is lower than stock.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Raise FSB to desired speed (I'd suggest 240MHz)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Set VDIMM to 1.65V (Or around there)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Disable CoolNQuiet</strong></p>
              <p><strong>F10 to save.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Boot into Windows, then reboot.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Raise CPU VID (I would suggest 1.45V for PIIX4)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Save BIOS</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Raise CPU multiplier 1x at a time (12x - 13x, 13x - 14x and so on)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>After increasing CPU multiplier by 1x, F10 to boot into Windows</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Run Prime95/LINX </strong></p>
              <p><strong>If pass stability tests, reboot and enter BIOS</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Increase multiplier by another 1x</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Boot into Windows and stress test again.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Repeat until you fail a test/you can't boot into Windows</strong></p>
              <p><strong>From here, 2 options:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Reduce CPU Multi by 0.5x and test Or Increase CPU VID (NOT MORE THAN 1.5V!)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
