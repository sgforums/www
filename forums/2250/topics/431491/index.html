              <p>Just to check a few things. How is the external hard disk connected? from an external casing  via usb? or is it internally connected to the cpu but used only as a secondary storage drive?</p>
              <p>Did you drop it? </p>
              <p>Is there any clicking sounds emitted by the disk.</p>
              <p>Is there any error led/ busy lights on your hdd? - For example the led might turn red and just stay there. </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I used this to recover files from my dying hard disk.</span></strong> </p>
              <p>Here's how you use the programme. </p>
              <p>1) Download and install PCi file recovery.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.pcinspector.de/default.htm?language=1">http://www.pcinspector.de/default.htm?language=1</a></p>
              <p>2)After installation you will come to a screen which asks you to select your languages.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.pcinspector.de/images/FileRecovery/manual_1.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="292"></p>
              <p>Select english of course and click on the green tick arrow.</p>
              <p>3) You will come to 3 options as shown in the screen shot below</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.emergingtechs.com/wp-content/uploads/older/filerecovery1.gif" alt="" width="400" height="315"></p>
              <p>click on the first option. "Recover Deleted files"</p>
              <p>4) You will then come to this option called "select drive" </p>
              <p>Select your hard disk</p>
              <p>5) You wil come to an option here like this: </p>
              <p><img src="http://alvinintheweb.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/pc-inspector-file-recovery.png" alt="" width="513" height="410"></p>
              <p>by default it will open the deleted option (which means the files that you have deleted over the years).  What you want to do is to recover the full file. So at the left side, <strong>click on "ROOT" to expand it</strong> and click on the small '-'  to close the deleted.<strong> </strong></p>
              <p>Next. once there right click over the folder that you want and click <strong>save to</strong>. <br>Locate the place that you want to save the folder and save it there. </p>
              <p>Give it a shot. It certainly helped me. </p>
