              <p>Anyone using M1 mobile broadband ?</p>
              <p>Don't be cheated by the promotion where M1 increases the speed from 512kbps to 1Mbps recently.</p>
              <p>I am one of the unlucky fellows who subscribed to M1 mobile broadband and feel very very disappointed by their quality of service.</p>
              <p>The connection is NOT stable at all, always go down to 0kbps. Man, 0kbps means no data between my laptop and M1 backbone !!!</p>
              <p>The vodafone modem kept changing from 3G to 3G+ and vice versa. Not stable at all. All my colleagues had switched to Singtel Mobile Broadband due to the same problems. This M1 mobile broadband is crazy. M1 just care about $$$, but doesn't care about their subscribers. That's why, compare to ST and SH, M1 losses majority of their mobile subscribers !!!</p>
              <p>I have therefore made up my decision to switch to Singtel. M1 sucks. Please don't follow my fool step by subscribing to M1 mobile broadband. I suggest you choose either Singtel or Starhub. My colleagues subscribe to these 2, and so far, never encountered problem similar to M1. In fact, ST and SH's connection are surprisingly very stable.</p>
              <p>M1 sucks, not only its mobile broadband, but also it's prepaid and postpaid services. That's why they can't maintain their customer base compared to ST and SH.</p>
              <p>This upcoming June 13 is the rollout date for Mobile Number Port. It means subscribers can port their number between 3 operators. I am 100 % sure majority of M1 subscribers will move out from it and port over to ST or SH.</p>
              <p>Blame on their super bad quality of services.</p>

              <p>I just feel very disappointed with M1 mobile broadband. Every month I pay $$$ to M1, and I get the unstable connection. =(</p>
              <p>Today, I went to Bugis to subscribe to ST mobile broadband. ST shop got so many people, the queue can up to 1 hour. Yet, the opposite shop (guess who ? M1 lor), nobody there !!!</p>
              <p>And one thing is, ST offers more money worth promotion. I subscribe for 12 months and get 6 months free, 1 samsung Z800 modem free, and free sim card fee and registration.</p>
              <p>How about M1 ? Nothing. The device is rented. No 6 months free subcription. And you have to paid about 30+ $ for the one time sim card registration.</p>

              <p>I give up....gonna terminate my M1 Broadband V2000 plan and go back to Suntalk and Sunsurf...$30 voice sub + $30 data sub is still cheaper than ridiculous M1 Broadband V plan. At least I'll have some free talktime and smses.</p>
              <p>M1 Broadband V is a hoax! My monthly data usage is less than 500mb so I just stay with Sunsurf and make do with the thoeretically slower connection speed. Considering M1 Braodband is the speed of 56k on my mobile, they can go 'everywhere' and find other subcribers!!!!</p>

              <p>Then this is cheating. It's not my fault that they cannot provide or cope with the subscription- they did their feasibilty planning. I am paying good money every month since the start of the launch. I have feedback to them often enough.</p>

              <p>Yo everyone, I have been using ST broadband on mobile  for about 2 weeks. Initiatially the connection always hang. Then I went to ST to complaint, but unfortunately I can't reproduce the hang problem. So, I conclude that it is because of the signal strength in my area.</p>
              <p>But the sales person told me to use the extension cable instead of directly plug my device into the USB port. Surprisingly after I use the extension cable, it is so stable already. Now I can watch video from the internet already. Sometimes it lags, but I don't mind so long the connection is stable. I think it is also depends on the plan I subscribe, which is 512 (the lowest). That could be the problem as well. Another reason could be the server itself.</p>
              <p>But so far, I am quite satisfied with ST, compare to M1 before. My friend uses Starhub 2 Mbps mobile broadband, and his speed is the fastest and most stable.</p>

              <p>Then this is cheating. It's not my fault that they cannot provide or cope with the subscription- they did their feasibilty planning. I am paying good money every month since the start of the launch. I have feedback to them often enough.</p>

                                      <p>Totally ridiculous, i'm on the broadband 3600 service plan (paying
                                      $60.30 per month) and even in the city, speeds like this are pretty
                                      much the average (max i had seen was a little more than 1000 KB/S).
                                      Considered it lucky that i even manage to get a connection without
                                      timing-out.</p>
                                      <p>This issue had been feedback to M1's customer service
                                      and the reply was always, "<i>actual transfer rate vary depending on

                                      <p>Forget 'bout M1 broadband unlimited data-rate, with transfer speed at this rate, you wouldn't be able to utilise much anyway.</p>
