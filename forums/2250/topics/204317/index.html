MS word is easy but to work with Pro-E you need to have Pro-E installed in your home/ local computer too if your friend wanna work like at home at company like dat. you must have the software (in the form of binary codes/ password) to gain access to your company via an approved service provide and ensure security during data transfer to and fro.<br><br>knowhow/ skills and knowledge -  you need to have basic understand of the hardware/ software mentioned above and go about doing what you wan to do i.e to work with freedom like what you do in the company. its easy for a person like myself who do not work in his friend's company to write about it here but its another thing to perform what he wishes in real time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cost is just one thing besides a good reason to justify the action of the need for one or more or every employer in his company to have access to the company's network other than within the company premises and outside office hours.<br><br>If the setup requires a thrid party involvement in hardware installation/ modification or software upgrade/ add-ons, trust of the source is equally important.<br><br>Take a small company for example. I used to know one that have less than 50 employees. Basically they do not have an IT department. The admin/ HR/ Finance department handles all the liasion with an external networking provider. They watch over the overall network setup while the provider ensues maintenance to the system and trainings/ briefing on certain aspects of the system connetivity and usage. The details and scale of it are usually covered in the contract. Of course if mac or windows screw up the users can troubleshoot with their own knowledge but when it comes to connectivity problems or other major network issues the providers are called in.<br><br>Bigger companies like MNCs usually have their own IT dedpartment to handle this. The department will have experienced personel to handle problems and issues at networking level. system troubleshooting and computer/ hardware setups are usually done by the guys from within the department. Even if you have problem executing a function in windows or Mac, you can just call up the IT department externsion and they will help you out. However whatever modification or hardware not proposed/ authorized or owned by the company is prohibited for use within the premises as stated in part of the company's rules and regulation.<br><br>I am sure forumites her would like to know a little more about what your friend's company does and the scale of usuage intended for the remove access (like how many employees are afected by this change) before recommendations can be made/ suggested.</div>
