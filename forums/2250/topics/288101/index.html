            <div class='col-md body'>When bad tech stuff happens, fight back with one of these PC life-savers.<br><br>The bad news: PCs have been around for 30 years, and they still find new and unusual ways to break. The good news: I've discovered a kitbag full of tools that troubleshoot and fix perplexing tech problems.<br>The hassle: The last time I manually updated Windows (by clicking Start, All Programs, Windows Update), I got the dreaded 'Initialization Error 0x80040FF2' pop-up.<br>The fix: I could have read Microsoft's engrossing Windows Update Troubleshooter page (requires Internet Explorer). But instead of plowing through that blizzard of links, I whipped out DjLizard's Dial-a-fix, a multipurpose utility that repairs all sorts of PC problems. For instance, the program deals with Windows Update woes, corrects installer errors, restores missing Registry entries, and fixes Secure Sockets Layer glitches. If Windows' Defragger, System Restore, or even Internet Explorer stops running, Dial-a-fix can reinstall it. Behind the scenes, the utility massages the Registry to make it run more efficiently. Dial-a-fix is free, but the authors request a $5 donation if you find it useful--and you will.<br>_________________________________________________<br><br>More from MSN Tech &amp; Gadgets<br><br>Quick PC fixes<br>Junkbusters: Trash unwanted freeware<br>How to survive the worst PC disasters<br>Laptop Product Center<br>_________________________________________________<br><br>The hassle: USB devices usually play nicely. But every once in a while, when you try to install a new USB gadget, one of the others cries foul and stops working.<br>The fix: To find out why, run USBInfo, a utility that identifies and tests every USB port on your system and each device plugged into it. The $20 program works with Windows 98 and XP; try their 15-day trial version.<br>Extreme nerd alert: If your USB devices aren't recognized, or if a USB driver insists on reinstalling when you reboot, have I got some software for you! DevCon, which you launch from a command line, is Microsoft's free device-management tool for XP and Vista. Using Rob van der Woude's RenewUSB.bat file, DevCon will erase all of your USB device drivers, making your PC just like new. Then it will scan to relocate the devices and reinstall their drivers. The program is tough to use, so if you're going to try, you'd better know that "hash code" isn't something you eat with your breakfast eggs. I also insist that you back up your PC first. This trick can bring a sick system back to health, but it can also flatline it. Browse to DevCon for instructions on using the script file (including a disclaimer on potential damage to your OS).<br>Bad codecs bring down the curtain<br><br>The hassle: Figuring out why some videos won't play on my PC is my new least-favorite pastime.<br><br>The fix: I go straight to the heart of the matter by using CodecInstaller. It's a freebie (donations are accepted) that looks over my system and tells me which codecs--the programs needed to view videos--are missing. Then it supplies safe, reliable download sources. If CodecInstaller doesn't keep your videos rolling, try the shotgun approach: Download and install K-Lite Codec Pack, which has almost every codec known to humankind (13 gazillion at least); this freebie comes with a handy video viewer, too.<br>The hassle: I recently went 15 rounds with an erratic power button on my PC; every other day or so, it wouldn't work, stalling Windows in mid-shutdown and forcing me to remove the power cord to turn off the PC.<br>The fix: Replacing the power button didn't help, but a $10 power-supply tester from PC Power and Cooling revealed that the power supply was a goner. If you're handy (and cautious), try this shockingly easy power-supply testing trick from the company's troubleshooting page.<br>For people who like tracking down ornery problems on their own, What's Running offers a look at every active element of a PC: services, processes, drivers, and other modules. What sets What's Running apart from similar tools is its clever way of saving snapshots of settings; compare a shot taken when the system was working right with a shot from when it wasn't to hone your troubleshooting skills.<br>Tool of the Month: Disable Windows Update Reboot<br><br>Every week Windows automatically downloads and installs Microsoft's slew of updates onto your PC (unless you've changed the default update settings; see "Don't Let a Windows Update Bring You Down" for more). That's a good thing--usually. The bad thing is having Windows pester you every 20 minutes or so (depending on the type of update), asking whether you want to reboot now or wait until later. (Later, I said!) My old strategy was to wait until late in the day before getting the updates. Then I discovered Auto Reboot Remover, a tool that lets me safely disable--or change my mind and re-enable--Windows XP's Automatic Reboot annoyance.<br><br>source:  <a href="http://tech.msn.com/howto/articlepcw.aspx?cp-documentid=5617508&amp;GT1=10540" rel="nofollow">http://tech.msn.com/howto/articlepcw.aspx?cp-documentid=5617508&gt;1=10540</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rather than disable Windows Update, use Group Policy wisely. I've used that in Windows to keep certain updates out of reach from me and to prevent them from rebooting a PC, especially one that needs to restart the computer. It's very irritating when they restart without you knowing, especially after you've finished your lunch.</div>
