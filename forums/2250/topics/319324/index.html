              <p><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_nRUCxRA-T24/SC_QBFJlhsI/AAAAAAAAAmw/Lj7rT9QoDt8/s1600-h/Zen.jpg">http://bp2.blogger.com/_nRUCxRA-T24/SC_QBFJlhsI/AAAAAAAAAmw/Lj7rT9QoDt8/s1600-h/Zen.jpg</a></p>
              <p>A google search on 'Zen White Screen of Death' (<a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&amp;q=Zen+white+screen+of+death+&amp;meta">http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&amp;q=Zen+white+screen+of+death+&amp;meta</a>=) would reveal that this problem is a common one and that it is a bug with the software/hardware. I kena this problem only after using my Zen for 1 month and decided to call the Creative customer service hotline to request for a solution to the problem (though it has been proven online that there's actually no solution to the problem - it's just a disastrous manufacturing defect on the part of Creative). The customer service staff recommended me to reformat the Zen or update its firmware. Now, how am I supposed to reformat the player when I can't even enter the boot-up screen (there is only a empty white screen!)? Ok, so I attempted to update the firmware via the Creative MP3 Player Recovery Tool (though I have already updated it prior to the problem), but the problem remains. So, both solutions don't work. I searched for alternative solutions on the webby and tried those out too. For example, one required me to lock the Zen, and then press and hold the play button while unlocking the Zen again. It worked once, but that's about it.</p>
              <p>So far, Creative has refused to address the problem. Several people have reportedly sent in their defective units to Creative and got a replacement, but the replacements throw up the same problems. Based on the conversation with the customer service staff, it seems that Creative still refuses to address the problem and worse still, she gave me the impression that it's not their fault.</p>
              <p>Before getting the white screen of death problem, I have also encountered frequent 'freezing' of the Zen (that's what the reset button is for, man!). Also, the software kept on messing up with the formats of my music files (so instead of .mp3 and .wma files, I have files that are of unknown formats). Not only that, I have discovered that the Zen mysteriously and automatically deletes away some of my files. The white screen of death is my final straw and I am truly fed up with Creative's poor quality control of the Zen.</p>
              <p>For those of you have the Zen, I believe you should be familiar with the notorious white screen of death problem. YES, it's a disastrous manufacturing defect, and as a customer, I feel VERY cheated because Creative refuses to address this problem, so what I have with me now is essentially a piece of garbage - useless and crappy piece of gadget. I can't believe it's not doing anything and leaving buyers stranded.</p>
              <p>This incident has left me very dissatisfied with Creative and I intend to call Creative on the next working day to ask for a full refund (not a replacement because the replacement will give me the same problems again).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">All Creative Zen units that you see on the shelves now are not guaranteed to be in working condition. Most, if not all, have this problem, and if you buy the Creative Zen, you risk being a victim of this unsolvable white screen of death problem. Therefore, I would advise all who are planning to buy the Creative Zen to steer clear immediately of the product lest you want to be cheated and frustrated. </span></p>
              <p>Do not be tricked by Creative's 'Credit Card-sized wonder' ads for the Zen! If Creative refuses to grant me a full refund or grant me a reasonable explanation, I may consider bringing this matter to CASE.</p>
              <p>I will never buy another Creative product ever again.</p>

              <p>I would like to highlight that HP is just another Creative. Guys, <strong>pls do not buy HP computers. </strong>I had a VERY VERY bad experience with HP as well.</p>
              <p>I bought a HP desktop in 2005 and it came with a corrupted hard disk such that the desktop always hang when at the windows loading screen. I called the HP customer service staff several times and they always insist that it's my fault and requested that I reformat my desktop. But after reformatting for more than a dozen times, still same problem. Hang Hang Hang.</p>
              <p>FYI to everyone here, HP subscribes to the belief that the customer is always wrong, and the company is always right.</p>
              <p>So, after about 8 months, they finally decided to replace the corrupted hard disk that came with the desktop. I have to tahan Hang Hang Hang! for 8 months. Way to go, HP!</p>
              <p>P.S. Guys, unless you want to risk more white hairs, be advised that it's a wrong choice to buy HP PCs becuase HP has poor quality control.</p>
              <p>btw, my previous MP3 player was also Creative - The Creative Zen Neeon 512MB. It survived for 2 years before the scroll and volume buttons decided to break down.</p>

              <p>creative are always weak with their hard disk and LCD Screen players.These 2 also gives problems.</p>
              <p>i Had a zen mirco..it spoiled like 3 times within 1st yr..and i had to go down jurong just to get my player repaired.Damn irritating.And i bought a Zen Vison M.3months into the player..the LCD screen go hay wire...i can't see a shit on the menu..cos its too colorful messed up shit.Went to their customer service centre thinking that i could get a replacement cause its still under its 1 yr warranty,but i left the shop fuming and swearing.They told me the LCD is not covered in the warranty.Ya great".Fuck it all.I had to pa $167 to replace the f_u_c_king screen...i spent $500,cannot expect me to just use it for 3months and say byebye to it right?..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The person there told me that i mishandled the player thats y screen went haywire but i sweared that i used it with ultimate care,no pressure on screen,no drops or what so ever.It was so obvious that it was their fault-the manufacturing defect.i paid the replacement fee unwillingly swearing still.Sweared to myself that NEVER will i purchase anything from creative.TS ur thread re-ignited my fire and anger with creative..damn</p>

              <p>my Zen Micro also had the 'white screen of death' 2-3 yrs back, somemore not caused by me, my friend tried to play something then hang.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>overall i exchanged my Zen Micro 3 times within the warranty period, each time come back diff color, cos no stock.</p>

              <p>Yea, the Xbox 360 is the other that has quality control
              problem.</p>
              <p>I count myself as one really heng person because the Xbox 360
              that I bought in Oct 2006 has been free from all problems so
              far.</p>
              <p>But now that all Xbox 360s have 5 years warranty, it's not that
              bad.</p>
              <p>I would like to highlight that HP is just another Creative.
              Guys, <strong>pls do not buy HP computers.</strong> I had a VERY
              VERY bad experience with HP as well.</p>
              <p>I bought a HP desktop in 2005 and it came with a corrupted hard
              disk such that the desktop always hang when at the windows loading
              screen. I called the HP customer service staff several times and
              they always insist that it's my fault and requested that I reformat
              my desktop. But after reformatting for more than a dozen times,
              still same problem. Hang Hang Hang.</p>
              <p>FYI to everyone here, HP subscribes to the belief that the
              customer is always wrong, and the company is always right.</p>
              <p>So, after about 8 months, they finally decided to
              replace the corrupted hard disk that came with the desktop. I
              have to tahan Hang Hang Hang! for 8 months. Way to go, HP!</p>
              <p>P.S. Guys, unless you want to risk more white hairs, be advised
              that it's a wrong choice to buy HP PCs becuase HP has poor quality
              control.</p>
              <p>btw, my previous MP3 player was also Creative - The Creative Zen
              Neeon 512MB. It survived for 2 years before the scroll and volume
              buttons decided to break down.</p>
