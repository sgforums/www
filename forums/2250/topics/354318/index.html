              Hackers tap Wenâ€™s work report
              State Council official punished for computer security lapse; premier said to be furious
              
              Hackers broke into a senior State Council officialâ€™s computer containing drafts of Premier Wen Jiabaoâ€™s government work report for this year and were found copying it and other top-secret documents, according to mainland sources.
              
              â€œThe documents included comments from Politburo members who wanted to change this or that in the government report. These are regarded as top state secrets, even more sensitive than the government report itself,â€� one source said. â€œMr Wen was said to be furious when told about the case.â€�
              
              The hacking was carried out from Taiwan, this source, and another source, said.
              
              Regulations stipulate that senior officials have at least two computers â€“ one for the internet, and the other to process sensitive information. â€œThe fellow violated the regulation by using the sensitive computer to browse websites. As soon as he showed up, guys in Taiwan â€¦ broke into his system,â€� the first source said.
              
              Both sources said the official, a deputy head of a department too sensitive to be named, was severely punished after secret service agents monitoring internet data flow detected the hackers as they were downloading the files.
              
              The first source said the official had been placed under shuangkai, a party disciplinary measure under which he will be stripped of his government and party posts. The other source said he was demoted to entry-level rank.
              
              The government work report attracted widespread interest before its release during the National Peopleâ€™s Congress in March, following speculation it would contain details of a new economic stimulus plan. The speculation sent ripples through the worldâ€™s stock markets.
              
              As a result, the report was kept under even tighter secrecy than usual.
              
              In previous years, members of the NPC and the Chinese Peopleâ€™s Political Consultative Conference were given a preview of the report a day before Mr Wen delivered it. This year, the premier kept the contents to himself until he read the report to the NPC on March 5.
              
              The sources said the infiltration prompted the central government to tighten security measures in relation to internet access.
              
              â€œIt is not an accident, really. Overseas secret services have always been monitoring the governmentâ€™s IP [internet protocol] addresses. Government-backed infiltrators are particularly ferocious. As long as one stays online, you are naked in their eyes,â€� the first source said.
              
              Both sources spoke before researchers at the University of Torontoâ€™s Munk Centre for International Studies said on Sunday that mainland-based hackers had infiltrated at least 1,295 private and government computers in 103 countries.
              
              The central government has rejected their findings.
              
              An internet security expert said any computer could be hacked.
              
              â€œYou can try to defend your system with patches and firewalls and software, but the attacker always has the advantage because you only realise your weaknesses and loopholes after you are attacked.
              
              â€œTo ordinary people, the firewalls and software on the market provide sufficient armour,â€� the expert said. But trouble starts when someone has a particular interest in your computer.
              
              â€œIt is possible that for some business or political purposes some people or organisations would launch such attacks. The best thing to do, in this case, is to stay as far away from the internet as possible.â€�
