              <p>What makes 64-bit OSes faster than 32-bit OSes is the fact that 64-bit OSes can take advantage of additional hardware registers in the CPU. 32-bit OSes cannot take advantage of these additional registers, so they do not perform as fast as 64-bit versions.</p>
              <p>These registers are built into the die of the CPU, and even though they may not be used in 32-bit execution, they still do take up power. Additional power consumption is negligible. The TDP of a chip is for WORST CASE SCENARIO, when all components of the chip are at full and maximum stress. Even 64-bit, under normal usage, will not reach the max TDP typically.</p>

              <p>No links, just personal experience. Used to own a Watt meter to measure PC power consumption, no noticeable difference in terms of power used in 32-bit or 64-bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By no noticeable difference, like ~2-5W? Well within operating error.</p>

              <p>haven't google much on 64 vs32 yet. but what i know of is that hardware wise 32bit has limitation as pc hardware specs hits the pinnacle.64bits expands the possiblity and now we get higher specs for ram graphics and processing power.fast or slow i wuld rather say 64bit allows for more processing power, and more processing power means we can do lots more with a new pc. although 64 has been on for a while i still fear my older software and programs may not work. hardware wise 32 has to be scrapped totall if you go 64. but that's easy since they can be bought. software wise.. well we have to wait for them to be written. that's why for newbs who want a 64bit system i always recommend them to but a branded one of the shelf as they usually comes with everything a user need to get started. for me i have many older programs and application, with scraps of 32buit hardware so i am watching and waiting at the moment.</p>

              <p>As for my second post from above, i tried to phase it as best as
              i could already.</p>
              <p>I didn't change my attitude...if it were to be spoken instead,
              you probably wouldn't misunderstand.</p>
              <p>I can tell you that i'm purely curious that's why i asked for
              links...no other motives.</p>
