              <p>@ <span>SBS7484P</span>: Im giving some options,
              accessories are not a necessity, not for schoolwork at least. I
              also mentioned that the ipad is to prevent him from playing
              flash-based games and nothing more. Definitely every product has
              its benefits and flaws, just because it doesnt appeal to you,
              doesn’t mean it wont appeal to others. Come on, you say that it
              will be stolen, now put an ipad and any laptop side-by-side in the
              public and leave, dont tell me in an hour’s time your laptop is
              still there. It depends on your responsibility not what the device
              is.</p>
              <p>@Tanstan72: Its better to teach him to manage his stuff now then
              control him. When he grows up, you won’t be there day and night.
              Another idea would be to let him have your current laptop, but use
              a firewall to block all other websites except those which are
              required for his schoolwork</p>

              <p>Hi, I would like to buy netbook-atom processor...just for my son
              to do his e-learning and project...he is going to sec 4 next
              year.  Due to so much of e-learning...as an excuse to access
              computer and side track to play games/surf...I thought of giving
              him a netbook instead.  I am not good with computer stuff..can
              anyone tell me..with netbook-atom processor...it is difficult for
              him to side track to games...pls advise before I waste my money

              <p>Yes, supposed that you son plays a graphics intense and processor intense game, it would be inadequate. It's more than enough for browser based games - Runecsape, Shockwave Facebook games.... </p>
              <p>Unfortunately he might not even use the netbook at all. He would just chuck it aside after you have bought it and use the PCs or the laptop instead stating the reasons that teens normally do - very slow, screen too small ect.. I'm still a teen, so <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  yeah..  </p>
              <p>Bottomline is, if he wants to he can. </p>
              <p>May i suggest you to have a father and son talk telling him your utmost concerns and review his response to it. </p>

              <p>Like I have said, use what I have suggested as a<strong> last resort</strong> if you and him are not able to come to an understanding over this issue.</p>
              <p> You are your son's next of kin, you and your wife should have already known his character more than what we outsiders are able to comment on. We each have our own views on issues in relation to this issue. Ultimately the choice comes down on you. </p>
              <p>I'm in no position to say if you should use it or not to use it, nor I'm in any to comment about family matters, however what I suggest for you is to be liberal and hear out his views. Some teens have to be at the computers listening to music or watching videos for them to study effectively, just like the olden days where internet was non existant in singapore, the television was the medium for some people to study.</p>
              <p> It's common for teens nowadays to watch EPL/La Liga in the middle of the night, yes your concerns are not unfounded - lack of sleep = not being able to concentrate in class. If it's a few matches, like a match or two a week, why not? </p>
              <p>What I know is, this is an issue bothering you. There are many questions unanswered. Only you as a family will be able to resolve this. </p>

              Yes, he already 16, and can have freedom, but freedom is a privilege not a right. If he can't manage basic stuff properly, can he be trusted if he is given more freedom? If he gets his facts right, and can prioritize his time, I see no harm in giving him more freedom. Otherwise, it is doing more harm then good. You don't jump from elementary school to highschool.
              
              After the completion of his schoolwork, sure he is free to do as he pleases, but if the laptop is going to be distraction, then there's no point in getting him one. Furthermore, if it's for project work, you work in a group, so his peers should have a laptop, and if it is for e-learning, he school has the take to consideration of students who cannot afford a laptop. So a laptop is not a necessity.
              
              Classical music can help you study, but do you need the source of music to come from a computer, isn't a normal mp3 enough? What about the generation who did not have tvs, are you here to say that they could not study? Think again! I agree with that lack of sleep i cause you to lose concentration in class. Also, computers and tvs stimulate your mind so to have a deep, and sufficient sleep, it is best not to use them after midnight, or best, 10pm. However, if he were to complete is required work, and excels in his studies, i see no reason for him to do so. Work and no play makes Jack a dull boy

              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Freedom is a privilege? So... It's OK to be ruled by a dictatorship (read: N.Korea) because it's not a right? Interesting point here.

Definitely. <br>So having a netbook or iPad for 'studies' doesn't exactly let him do as he pleases after he completes his work.<br>Besides, it isn't cost effective, and the small screen is a source of annoyance to many.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">You can say this, but your previous statements don't seem to be echoing this line of thought from you.<br>I'd be dull as heck if all I had was a netbook. Granted, TV is not an option for me because my parents refuse to get SCV. All I have is Mediacrap, which in all seriousness, can go die in a fire because they suck so much.<br></span></p>

              <p>As for OP... Just let him do it.</p>
              <p>He'll realise the consequences in future if he doesn't study.</p>
              <p>Then again... Not to brag, but I got 11 O-Level points before CCA deduction.</p>
              <p>And I didn't study.<br>TF2-ed right up to the day of the exam. <br>How cool is that?<br><br>Not saying your son should be like this, but if he does pay attention in class, he should ace the exams easily.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
