              <p>Not fast enough to play games? lol playing games is what i am doing with my eee pc.</p>
              <p>(Same model eee pc in case you were guessing.)</p>
              <p>Preventing him from playing games is not a good idea, instead you might want to better equip him with time management...so that he doesn't spend too much time playing.</p>
              <p>Even the lousiest netbook in the market now should be play able to play game...so no point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No point buying a second hand netbook as netbook now as already quite cheap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And sorry to say, but i doubt the eee pc is even worth above 100 now.</p>

              <p>Asus Eee Desktop comes to mind.</p>

              <p>Athlon II X2 240 + M4A78L-M LE + 4GB DDR2 and a 500GB HDD in a CM 341 chassis and one of those 300W OEM PSUs from the likes of Delta, HIPRO and Lite-ON.</p>
              <p>All these parts can be found used online for a very low price.</p>
              <p>And don't worry, people aren't likely to abuse hardware...</p>
              <p>Except for one seller that I saw on VR-Zone.</p>
              <p>Audaciously putting up a dead Biostar motherboard on sale for $60.</p>
              <p>He himself states it's dead, and 'available for those who want to try and fix it for $60'.</p>
              <p>It's not even a very new board, and neither is it high end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, OP; do consider getting a nettop with a decent-sized screen like a 19" widescreen panel.</p>
              <p>LG1943SE's are pretty affordable, and they'll suffice.</p>
              <p>I'm afraid a small screen on a netbook is going to put a strain on your kid's eyes.</p>

              <p>Hey it's a pretty good idea. If he's able to bring it to school, he would probably enjoy school more due to increased popularity (yea, kids are like that). In fact, he would probably be frustrated with the lagginess of the netbook and decide that he doesn't want to play games with it instead.</p>
              <p>Still, if you want the best for him, sit down and talk to him regularly. Help him set up goals and make sure he attains them. No form of deterrence would beat a single word of encouragement. </p>

              Its pointless to get a netbook. It can barely meet the requirement of today. Furthermore, after he graduates and goes  for further study. There will be lot of project work that require computer usage, and definitely a netbook cannot handle such task. Generally, a netbook has a smaller keyboard and screen which is going to make typing and usage difficult and sooner or later, he will bug you for a better laptop. Might as well just get a proper laptop for about 1.2k.
              
              As for gaming, he should be old enough to manage his time. If worst comes to worst, confiscate it. Alternatively, you can sit down with him and advise him what is necessary from a parent point of view, if he does not heed it, you can forget about getting it for him and let him buy one for himself, afterall, at this age, he should be able to manage his finances. With your consent, he might even be able to get a Part time job which could generate himself an income.

              <p>Atom netbook cannot play sophisticated games but it can play the many games in facebooks.</p>
              <p>Atom netbook (N450 CPU processor) is sufficent for all learning needs ie the use of internet, Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, adobe reader, email.</p>
              <p>Many non-IT and engineering poly and uni students are very enthusiastic when they enter poly and uni BUT after a month or so, most of them no longer bring their laptops to poly and uni unless for presentations or project works.</p>
              <p>By the way, the poly and uni campus have wireless broadband internet for their students and students can upload their files or works into websites from home and retrieve them from the websites in the poly and uni campus to do their presentation or to show their project works. So, the laptop is not a necessity.</p>
              <p>Children like to perusade parents to buy them laptops for studies but actually they want the laptops to play games and do non-academic activities. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>Asus has a very good reputation in laptops, and right now some of their models are quite affordable.</p>
              <p>I implore you to consider the A42JR, with a Core i5-430M processor and the ATI Mobility Radeon 5470 graphics.</p>
              <p>If you think it's too much for him, a step lower will fetch you another A42/K42 model, with a lower-spec'd Core i3-330M processor, and the ATI Mobility Radeon 5145 graphics.</p>
              <p>The first configuration handles games quite well; as for the second you would need to lower game details a bit for it to be smooth.</p>
              <p>Both sets retail for less than $1500, and come pre-installed with a fully-functional Windows 7 Home Premium OS, 4GB of DDR3 RAM and a 500GB hard drive.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

              <p>Facebook games are fine. Some people feel more productive to click a button every 15 minutes while doing work. That's motivation for them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif?1212956094" alt=""></p>

              <p>...Why an iPad?</p>
              <p>You have to get accessories for it.<br>A student his age doesn't need an iPad. Those who have it are just flaunting it along with the fact that they're way too rich.</p>

              <p>Hi, thank you so much for the infor.  My main idea of getting the netbook is to deter him from playing games...while on the pretext that he is doing school work.  Ya..it is very difficult to control him...not to play games...and worse he is not the type who puts priority in his studies.  So left me with no choice....In fact we have 2 desktop and also a laptop... Getting the netbook..with my limited knowledge, i thought he cannot play games on it..</p>

              @ SBS7484P: Im giving some options, accessories are not a necessity, not for schoolwork at least. I also mentioned that the ipad is to prevent him from playing flash-based games and nothing more. Definitely every product has its benefits and flaws, just because it doesnt appeal to you, doesn't mean it wont appeal to others.  Come on, you say that it will be stolen, now put an ipad and any laptop side-by-side in the public and leave, dont tell me in an hour's time your laptop is still there. It depends on your responsibility not what the device is.  
              
              @Tanstan72: Its better to teach him to manage his stuff now then control him. When he grows up, you won't be there day and night. Another idea would be to let him have your current laptop, but use a firewall to block all other websites except those which are required for his schoolwork
