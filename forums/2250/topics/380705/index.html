              <p>this is what happen.</p>
              <p>for the past 1 month plus. my monitor spoil. so i never touch my cpu at all. on thurs last week, i went down to simlim to buy a new monitor. when i bring back home. it cannot go to desktop. it shows black screen befoer it reaches the desktop.</p>
              <p>on friday morning, i called the shop and they ask me to bring my cpu down. so i bring my 11 months cpu down to the shop in simlim. when i went down, everything was fine. it straight away goes to desktop. the person say nothing was wrong. i wasted $20 on my cabfare! when i brng back home, again i still cannot go to desktop.</p>
              <p>so on saturday i called the shop in the morning and he told me to bring both my cpu and monitor down to them. so i cab down again!  when i reach there, straight away he say my power supply spoil and he ask me to buy a new power supply. 65$ cooler master. (remember on friday he said nothing wrong) so i paid him and he ignore me. after my fren ask him to do on my cpu, he asked us to come back half an hour later. we went to eat and walk ard bugis and came back 1 hr later. the whole cooler master power supply was not even opened yet! so we told him to do ours first as my fren was quite unhappy abt their service alraedy. so he said he will do both cpu at one go, ( other customer's cpu and mine) after he finish fixing mine, the cpu goes straight to the desktop ( connected to the THEIR monitor) i told them to try it on mine and when they tried on it, it cannot on. he told me the power supply was short circuit as the mother board has some problem. he told me to leave my cpu and monitor there for 1 day and come and collect on sunday.</p>
              <p>so we went back and at night, he called me and told me that cooler master power supply cannot use on my mother board, so he chagne to another one that cost 69$ and he will charge me for 65$. i had no choice btu to say ok.</p>
              <p>on sunday, i went down and he told me that everything was ok. so i bring back home and yet, the problem was still there. on the first try, it load until the windows loading page and den black screen on the next page. i waiting for 5mins and i restart it. after i restarted it, it keep restart itself on the mother board page.</p>
              <p>on monday morning i called them, they told me they will get back to me later. i waited for 3-4 hrs and they did not call me back. so i call back to the shop and they did not pick up my call.</p>
              <p>so now i was thinking of asking a computer repair man to my house to repair for me. ):</p>

              <p>Like what raraken said, try it on another monitor first.</p>
              <p>Maybe the shop wants you to buy something from them, last time i also do the same thing so that people something from my shop.</p>
              <p>It is weird why that powersupply cant work with your motherboard, as nowadays the design of the power inputs are standardise already, and you saw that after fixing the powersupply the computer went straight to the desktop.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Do you have a graphics card installed? If yes, maybe the card itself is faulty.</p>
              <p>If not, a dying motherboard could be why your computer restarts at the motherboard splash screen, but that sign may not always means that your motherboard is faulty(if you get wad i mean)</p>
              <p>However i have a feeling that it is because some of your parts are not properly grounded. Meaning some components in your system might have receive some electric short from the casing. I remember once i was fixing a pc, when the motherboard is placed in the casing it couldnt start, but after taking it out and insulating it will start.</p>
              <p>Do more testing and keep us updated, i will  analyse your details and try to think of a way to solve</p>
