              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>I have a pretty old CPU which I intend to get rid of since it's spoilt (do not know which part of it is giving problem). However, I am thinking of whether the information in the hard disk can be retrieved and the ram can be used for my next computer. Anyone care to let me know how should I go about doing it?</p>
              <p>Also, will the rest of the parts like motherboard etc. be able to sell to computer or second hand shops or are they worthless and just be thrown away?</p>

              <p>whether U can reuse the parts depends on how good are the specs in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>U can take out the HDD and get rid of it separately...hammers are good...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>U can try selling to 2nd hand store as spare parts...but then again...dont expect to get back the amount U paid for it when U bought it.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Make sure it's the same type of RAM first of course. There's DDR1, 2 and 3. And if you are planning to get a new computer, chances are that the motherboard FSB is going to be rather fast, so you'll waste that speed with a slower RAM chip.</p>

              <p>RAM probably cannot be recycled if it's really old (for example, SDRAM).</p>
              <p>Hard disk likely can recycle.</p>
              <p>External graphics card maybe can recycle, maybe no, provided the new motherboard can support. Then again, if you play games, you can sell it.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>being an I.T. idiot, I really do not know how to differentiate the different models of the parts. Thus, I am going to provide some pictures for reference. Please let me know if they are sufficient. The priority is the hard disk actually. The rest of the parts I don't mind selling off or even dumping it. Thanks!</p>
              <p>Overall (motherboard + processor)</p>

              <p>And the HDD seems to be IDE , not SATA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So just make sure your new motherboard has an IDE slot. Best to just buy a new SATA ll HDD, it's cheap now. Just copy all your current data inside the new SATA HDD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One SATA HDD at around 500GB, 7200 RPM is about $90 or so? I just got back from Sim Lim today and I think the cheapest would be of course the 320GB ones, which are around $80 + I guess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S Your DDR1 RAM is almost obsolete , and won't work on the newer motherboards since most use DDR2/3 RAM now :/</p>

              <p>Sorry for the late reply. Unfortunately the RAM is 512MB. Would
                  you still be interested in it?</p>
              <p>How can I check if the new motherboard has a IDE slot? And I
                  will need to slot it into my new computer before I can transfer
                  everything to the new HDD right?</p>

              <p>Oh then it's okay :S Only interested in the 1GB ones..</p>
              <p> I don't think the your current computer is worth anything at the stores..</p>
              <p>Maybe you can give me a price budget, I can recommend a motherboard + CPU to you? Just purchased a new Core2Duo for my gf today. Good mobo + CPU + GFX card at only $999.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DIY coms are the best :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For an average computer, but fairly good for gaming:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would recommend a Gigabyte EP41 Mobo with the G41 chipset. With a Core2Duo E6300 2.8ghz. Both would cost around $280.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GFX card :</p>
              <p>Above average -9800GT 512MB. I believe playing games like L4D and BF2142 at high shouldn't be a problem. This will cost you around $180-$200.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you like, I could sell you my 8600GT 512mb DDR2. It's a tad slower than the 9800 but you still can run L4D on High with 2x AA.</p>
              <p>The etc like power supply, HDD should cost another $200 or so.</p>
              <p>Total would be around $700-800 for a fairly good spec'd gaming rig! If you have any details just PM me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S Long post because I just bought a new com today and the excitement stil lingers LOL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want, i'm actually selling my own gaming rig too ;o</p>

              <p>Hey, thanks for the offer! I'll get rid of this old one first before deciding to get another new rig, since I'm going NS and still have a laptop to use. I'll probably just buy those "standard" ones though, and it won't be for gaming.</p>
              <p>I'll let you know if I change my mind and decide to DIY! Thanks!</p>
