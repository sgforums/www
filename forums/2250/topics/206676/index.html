Apparently the former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, on its board.<br><br>Thompson told the Examiner that the chip was safe and that no one will be forced to accept an implant against his or her will.<br><br>Others, like veterans groups, are not so happy with the idea.<br><br><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33858" rel="nofollow">http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33858</a><br><span class="small"></span><span class="small"></span></div>

His big idea was that if he told the media about the walk, it would embarrass Apple as well as gain attention for his plight.<br><br>It looks like Apple saw a PR nightmare coming and decided to do something to head it off at the pass.<br><br>According to Macworld, Hayden received an apology, a replacement 2GHz iMac Intel Core Duo with 512MB and additional memory to match the broken iMac, which had 2GB installed.

We could even touch the wireless remote but the machine didnÂ’t work as Sony didnÂ’t want to plug it in.<br>The marketing chap had the lamest excuse of them all, he said that Sony doesnÂ’t want to show the live demo as there is a hidden secret feature that Sony doesnÂ’t want to show off yet.<br><br>I can guarantee you that it super does not work and that Sony is merely showing what the machine will look like. There was a live demo - but from the developers' machines - of some developers' demos but you can clearly forget about the real hardware.<br><br>I donÂ’t have any idea how it is going to produce enough Playstation 3 machines in time to meet the November timeline.<br><br><img src="http://www.theinquirer.net/images/articles/ps3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.theinquirer.net/images/articles/ps3l.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.theinquirer.net/images/articles/ps3a.jpg"></div>
