              <p>hi, need some help with upgrading my computer. novice here, but want to diy myself to save cost.</p>
              <p>where can i learn how to fix up the computer and know which parts go to which part .</p>
              <p>I am deciding to retain the following,</p>
              <p>-power supply, casing, dvd drive, monitor , and keyboard which does not use usb end.</p>
              <p>questions: how do i reused my old RAM in the current computer. Just plug it out from motherboard and plug it into new mother board.</p>
              <p>The things i would like to buy new ones are motherboard , and new CPU chip, probably RAM, and also a hard disk. I do not need my computer to be very powerful plus my cheapbudget would not allow it to be also.</p>
              <p>My initial research shows the following price at bizgram asia brohure</p>
              <p>Intel p4 dual core 5400 2.7 ghz + asus p5g41-m LX = 195</p>
              <p>I do not know what are the differences actually between all those different motherboard and CPU.</p>
              <p>Whatt about connecting cables? do i use the old ones or is it putdated already.</p>
              <p>RAM - Kingston pc6400 800mhx 2GB = 59, and another one is</p>
              <p>            Kingston ddr400 pc3200 1GB = 56.</p>
              <p>What is the difference actually, which is better and which is use for what type of purpose.</p>
              <p>Thanks for all the help!!! =)</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. where can i learn how to fix up the computer and know which
                                                              parts go to which part.</span></p>
              <p>There are DIY PC guides online, or maybe in community centers, but the best way to learn is to take apart your old PC and look at what cables are connected to what, which parts are to be installed where.</p>
              <p>Components in a basic PC is actually very easy to install as there is only ONE way you can connect them together, it is like the USB port in the front of your PC, you can only plug it in in a direction, unless you use brute force.</p>
              <p>Installing the motherboard on the casing is easy, as motherboard comes only in a few sizes, and the mounting holes are standard. That also means that the casing have holes predrilled to fit your motherboard. The only thing you need to do is to is installing the 'stand off' or copper things(suddenly forgot wad it is called) onto the holes on the casing which corresponds to the layout of the mounting holes on your motherboard</p>
              <p>The riskier part will be installing the CPU into the socket, a wrongly inserted CPU(as in direction) will spoil both the cpu and motherboard if you force it in. On a CPU, there will be a small notch or small 'triangle' marking, and that 'triangle' marking will have to match up on the motherboard's 'triangle' marking, and the notch fitting perfectly into the cpu socket's notch. It is like a jigsaw puzzle, there is only one way you can fit it in.</p>
              <p>DVD drive is 5.25 inch , and it can only fit in the 5.25 inch bay(which is the top) of the casing, alignment is foolproof as you want your drive tray to face outside casing so you can put ur disc in<br><br>HDD for desktops are normally 3.5inch, and the connection side will face the inside of the motherboard. Usually the HDD will  be installed at the bottom front of the casing</p>
              <p>Nowadays graphics card are using the PCI express x16 slot(It is the design of the slot). Meaning to say your old graphics card using another slot design will not fit into your new motherboard</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am deciding to retain the following,-power supply, casing, dvd drive, monitor , 
                                      and keyboard which
                                                              does not use usb end.</span></p>
              <p>Depending on how old your powersupply is, if it is just a few years old, you can still use it, but if it like 10 years old, the powersupply's motherboard's power connection cable may only be 20pin, while nowadays's motherboard uses 24pin and an additional 4pin or 8pin</p>
              <p>Casing are usually 90percent fine unless the casing you have now only supports smaller sized motherboards, and you want to get a motherboard of bigger size. If you are just getting a simple system, a new casing and a "450w" powersupply(which is only 250w or more in actual fact), will only cost $50</p>
              <p>DVD drive you can reuse, even if it is still using IDE connection(The long thick piece of cable which looks like a floppy disk connector), as most motherboard still has it. However if i am right, some highend motherboard already dont have floppy and IDE connections.</p>
              <p>Monitor you can reuse, if i were to assume your monitor uses VGA connection:<br><br>Before that, you need to decide whether you want to use a graphics card or not. If yes, <span style="color: #ff0000;">make sure the graphics card comes with a VGA out, or an adaptor</span>. If no, make sure your motherboard's onboard graphics also have <span style="color: #ff0000;">VGA out,  if not you need an adaptor</span>. Reason is because nowadays the video output are by DVI or HDMI</p>
              <p>If your original ram is DDR2, and the current motherboard  you are buying supports DDR2, then you can reuse, if not, you have to buy a new ram</p>
              <p>The CPU you chosen is a dualcore cpu. The motherboard you chosen is a P45 intel chipset, but manufactured by asus.</p>
              <p>Just like rams, motherboard is designed to go with the CPU. You cant install the Dualcore CPU you choosen on a P55 motherboard, because the P55 motherboard's cpu socket's design is different from the cpu you chosen. Simply put it, it is like putting a floppy diskette into a dvd drive, they dont work together. This is actually the more confusing part when building a new PC, as even though you know what CPU to use, the motherboard you choose is actually depending on your usage.</p>
              <p>The difference between the motherboard name is just the features.<br>Motherboard for INTEL processors are easier to differentiate than Motherboard for AMD processors because of the way they are named(at least to me)<br>Just fyi, you CANNOT install an AMD chip on a motherboard designed for intel</p>
              <p>And in Motherboard for intel processor alone, the way asus name their motherboard is also not that good for beginners(Just look at the naming format and you get what i mean).</p>
              <p>When customers ask me what is the difference, i can only give a rough guess(maybe because im inexperienced),. For example i will say maybe the product model end with the letter R, it may mean it supports Raid, and the one that doesnt have it doesnt supprot Raid. The best way is to look at the box and compare.</p>
              <p>Connecting cables, look at the part where i talk about the powersupply</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RAM - Kingston pc6400 800mhx 2GB = 59, and another one is</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">            
                                                          Kingston ddr400 pc3200 1GB = 56.</span></p>
              <p>Just from the name alone, i think the first one you chose is actually DDR2, because of the naming. 800mhz is the speed, and only DDR2 rams run at that speed. And if  you take 6400 divide by 8, you get 800mhz</p>
              <p>Kingston ddr400 is a ddr1 if im right, because only DDR1 run at that speed of 400mhz.  dividing 3200 by 8 gives you 400mhz.</p>
              <p>I dun really remember why i divide it by 8, there is a theory behind it, but i forgotten</p>
              <p>Just FYI, You cannot use DDR1 on a motherboard that supports DDR2, the ddr1 ram jsut wont fit into the slot. Even if your motherboard support both, you cant use them together, at least for now</p>

              <p>If they still have 250gb hdd, then ok, but i dont really remember the distro for hitachi bringing in 250gb, mostly are 320gb now. Maybe they have but i duno<br><br>It should be Intel Pentium Dualcore E5400 instead of P4 5400 i think. The motherboard is fine for a normal system</p>
              <p>Ram as long as it is DDR2 it will be fine, btw, how many price list have you got? <br>Can you double check the price of ddr2 2gb with other shops? <br>A week ago is about $66-70 for 2gb ddr2.</p>
              <p>If you want to use wireless, you need a wireless adaptor. The easiest way is to get the USB wireless adaptor. <br>If you want to get an internal one, most of them are PCI express wireless adaptor.(not to be confused with pci express x16 2.0 for graphics card). The PCI slot is mostly white in colour</p>
              <p>For DIY PC, if you are buying a new casing, they will include the screws and other things necessary.</p>
              <p>For screws(some may laugh at this but it is true)<br>Some casing follow a standard, look over here:<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_case_screws">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_case_screws</a></p>
              <p>The best way is to trial and error, if this screw to fit, try the other one. Normally as long as the screw fit in right without the need of excessive force, it is fine(im not sure if there are people out there who insist on correct screws<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">)<br><br>Warning: Do not use wood screws or screws of bigger size on the motherboard, you may damage the internal circuitry</p>
              <p>The toolbox u have in your house is fine, as long as it contains a philips screwdriver. I will recommand a screwdriver with a magnetic head, reason is because your screw drop inside the casing, it is easier to get it out with the magnetic head of the screwdriver instead of using your hand, especially if you have big hands.</p>
              <p>So is bizgram a reputable shop?<br><br>Yes they are a reputable shop, many people know about bizgram.<br><br>If you are going to ask how good bizgram is, i cannot really answer because different customers have different expectation of good. To some customers, if you are nice to them when they are purchasing(eg explaining, patience etc), but your aftersales service is bad, some will still say you are good. However some will say a good only if you are good at the counter and good at aftersales service.<br><br>Advice for you in simlim square, get a quotation first, then walk around comparing the price you got, and see who can give you a good price. Do not worry if they give u different configs, worst to the worst you can come back and post the configs here and ask for advice.</p>
              <p>Since you want to learn, you can try asking them if you really do not know how to assemble, can you bring it back and ask them to assemble for you, try to ask if they can do it free or at least a small fee? Ask this question at a time when the shop owners are not so busy or in a good mood(maybe after lunch or wad).</p>
