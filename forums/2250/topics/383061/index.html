              <p>i knew it! when it comes to product variety, Singapore is the worst country ever.</p>
              <p>went to sitex to buy flatbed scanner, but all i see are 3-in-1 printer/scanner/fax/photocopier. angry, i went to challenger, courts and cyberactive at Tampines mall and century square but nothing.</p>
              <p>is this me, or are flatbed scanners non-existent nowadays? i really can't believe this.</p>
              <p>if cannot find in challenger (singapore's biggest IT store??!?!), then wtf challenger exist for?! i suggest these stores upgrade themselves or become obsolete. same for sitex.</p>
              <p>it's suppose to be big IT event but all i see are PCs and laptops.</p>
              <p>it is trash like this that makes me want to go online to buy things.</p>

              <p>Ahem. SG is actually one of the BEST in product variety, considering our small size and population. Why do you think people in SEA come to SG to buy computer stuff, even though in their country, it may be cheaper?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have variety. We have the consumers who drive the sales. You have the demand, pump in the goods. You have more demand, get a greater market share by new, innovative products. Greater market share, more profit!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And yes, flatbed scanners are obsolete. Move on with the times. Flatbed scanners are usually big, bulky. The new designs are based on sleek, "slim" or even combining multiple products into one. Why waste desk space?</p>
              <p>And FYI, go SLS before you comment on our lack of variety. You can find all sorts of electronics at SLS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Challenger exists for the general public, where they know they have a reliable place to buy their stuff. Peace of mind, you know. Also, they have to keep up with the times. It's a business; outdated usually means out-of-business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So go ahead, buy online. </p>

              <p>Retailers, bring in products due to<strong> supply and demand.  There is literally no supply for </strong>such scanners anymore with the introduction of AIO(s).</p>
              <p>Futhermore, you can't be biased and blame it on the retailers.</p>
              <p>Manufacturers themselves<strong> have stopped</strong> or <strong>reduced production</strong> of such flat bed scanners<strong> due to the lack of demand. </strong></p>
              <p> Ts, please do not just come here and put fact-less accusations that Singapore has the least product variety. </p>
              <p>It's to say coming here and saying that Singapore retail stores do not sell<strong> VCR </strong>players anymore. </p>
              <p>There's always 2nd hand stores like Cash converters.</p>
              <p>Most consumers will not get a scanner alone either. It just does not justify the price.</p>
              <p>Let's take for example. The canon LiDE 25 Flatbed scanner - $109.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.canon.com.sg/p/EN/6-Flatbed-Film-Scanners/21-Flatbed/249-LiDE-25/">http://www.canon.com.sg/p/EN/6-Flatbed-Film-Scanners/21-Flatbed/249-LiDE-25/</a></p>
              <p>and the PIXMA - MP496 AIO.. which costs $199 and it has the same scanning resolution.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.canon.com.sg/p/EN/39-All-In-One/103-Inkjet/1177-PIXMA-MP496/">http://www.canon.com.sg/p/EN/39-All-In-One/103-Inkjet/1177-PIXMA-MP496/</a></p>
              <p>which would you choose? isit justifiable to pay $90 more for a scanner? </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>thanks all, i've decided to buy the Canon Lide 90 scanner.</p>
              <p>i already have a canon pixma printer at home and it's taking up a lot of space, and flatbeds are just better to use.</p>

Anyway, for sitex, they only sell the newest and hot selling products so no wonder they do not have flat beds.
