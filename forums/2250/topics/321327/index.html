              <p>Hi i got a original Vista CD complete with CD key which i brought from sim lim square, however my cd was damaged, and i didnt make any copies of it, The worst thing was that i was unable to get a replacement disk from MS, due to MS, due to my copy being OEM, MS SAID that it was my responsiblity to make my own backup copies.....</p>
              <p>As i have a orignal CD key and paided about 129  for my license and cd key, could anyone kindly pass me a copy or give me a back up copy? Its completely legal, as i OWN THE orignal license, i paid 129 for some really unfair EULA 'laws' from MS, really pissed off. I am willing to pay good money for a backup copy. Thanks</p>

              <p>I do not want anyone to flame the ts for asking this qn, flaming like:</p>
              <ol><blockquote>
              <li>am i hearing wrongly?</li>
              <li>Microsoft asked you to create a backup. aka Duplicate. </li>
              <li>It's illegal to burn, on the cd of vista xxx/ microsoft office xx , it said " do not make illegal copies of this disc"</li>
              </blockquote></ol>
              <p> I have called Microsoft (Singapore) and verified that this is legal, as no replacement would be given if you misplace the disc ect. However, it is on a basis that you do not distrubute it. Along with the Cd key.</p>

              <p>lol, i didnt even realised y_shun was flaming.... weird way to flame in such a way if he is indeed flaming, lol...... i didnt even get what hes trying to say, maybe he has a habit of climbing into his whatever cdkey...zzzzzz</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yeah, i called MS, they only provide any form of support for retail package buyers, they fark care if you buy the OEM version.... sad but true.... great deal for treating their customers this way, after they purchased 170plus dollars worth of software. As if i am their bill gates, money dun come easily ok? They recommended me to REPAY and buy a double license, Quite pointless for me to call them, right?</p>
              <p>Anyone got a backup cd image????? zzzz</p>
              <p>I can pay him good money, and self collection</p>
