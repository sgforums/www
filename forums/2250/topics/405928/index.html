            <div class='col-md body'><p>Nokia a Finnish mobile giant has unleashed a new touch screen Smartphone in the form of Nokia C6. It is the second member of the Nokia’s C series. The Nokia C6 looks like a trimmed version of N97. With inclusion of sliding QWERTY keyboard, it will be liked by heavy texters. It features 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, resistive touch screen, good battery, social networking, and 5 megapixel camera. Now, let’s look at the more detail of information about Nokia C6.<br><img src="http://nidesoft.com/forum/nokia/nokia-c6.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="291"><br>Design<br>To look at initially, the C6 resembles many recent Nokia devices that also boasted a touch screen, such as the 5800. The difference is that the C6 does not rely just on the touch display for data entry, with the inclusion of a slide out QWERTY keyboard. The keys on the keypad are of a good size, and text entry shouldn’t be an issue. Closed up the device measures in at a respectable 113 x 53 x 17mm, and weighs in at the top end of the acceptable scale at 150g. The touch display is a TFT screen, supporting up to 16 million colors, with a pixel resolution of 360 x 640 and measuring 3.2 inches across. The display has a built in auto rotate option, which kicks in when the QWERTY keyboard is opened, as well as within applications that support this feature on the device, such as the web browser. A proximity sensor disables the screen when in call, to stop you accidentally activating apps or undesired in call features.<br><br>Nokia C6’s features<br>The Nokia C6 is running on the Symbian OS v9.4, Series 60 rel. 5. It is pretty much same as other Nokia Symbian phones. The Symbian has lost its sheen with the market is ruled by Android and other smartphones OS. However, the Symbian OS has done a good job her. The Menu system, Icons and interface is very nice.<br>And its data is saved on a micro SD / SDHC flash memory card that can be inserted in the card slot that can be found on the side of the Nokia C6 handset. Officially, 16GB is named as the maximum storage capacity, but most likely the maximum storage capacity for micro SDHC, namely 32GB, will also be supported. The Nokia C6 phone also has wireless LAN built-in, and VPS and 3G support.<br>At in multimedia function, the C6 includes a 5.0 Megapixel camera, with autofocus and LED flash, with face and smile detection options available in the settings menu. Video recording is enabled, and there is a front facing camera for face to face video calls over 3G.<br>General media support on the phone is strongly represented, with a stereo FM radio with RDS included, plus a media player which supports multiple formats including MP3, WMA, AAC, eAAC+, WMV and MP4. The layout of the music player is very intuitive, and adding additional playlists to those automatically available is a simple process. . <br><br>The handset also has a built in GPS receiver, which allows you to add location information to captured images via geotagging, and also allows you to use the device as a portable SatNav device, with full a GPS support. Nokia OVI Maps is available, which gives you full access to voice turn by turn navigation, for free. The web browser on the handset is very capable, and presents most web pages well. Kinetic scrolling allows you to flick through long web pages, and support for Flash Lite 3.0 is also included.<br><br>Review<br>The C6 may not have high-end features or run the latest software, but its estimated price of 220 Euros before tax and subsidy will be a great draw for mass-market consumers. The Nokia C6 will be available in either Black or White, and should start shipping before the end of the current quarter. Although the features of the handset clash with other Nokia devices in the mid tier market, the aggressive pricing point should help to ensure that the device sells in good numbers, and will be a particularly attractive option on many free gift and half price line rental deals</p></div>
