            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br>I am not IT savy thus would seriously appreciate your kind assistance.<br><br>It seems my comp has slowed down slightly recently. When I click on IE Explorer icon, it takes slightly longer for the web page to appear and while browsing other sites, it takes slightly longer to load too.<br><br>When I opened other applications like Microsoft Word etc, it takes longer to load up too.<br><br>I scanned with SpySweeper, AVG anti spyware and Norton Antivirus all generate negative reports ie. no viruses/spyware. And also did online scan for Trend Micro which oso generates the same results.<br><br>Thus what can be the problem? It only occurs recently.<br><br>Does it gotta do with my RAM?<br><br>Mine is only 256MB. Windows task manager shows:<br><br>Total Physical Memory : 261424k<br>Available: 19064K<br><br>Total Commit  Charge: 273552k<br>pEAK: 632964K<br>Commit Charge: 273568K/632964K<br><br>Thinking of upgrading to 1GB RAM. Will it help at all? And how much does it roughly cost?<br><br>Your advise needed please.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br></div>

Because both type of RAM are of the same standard, which is SDRAM. The only difference is their speed, one at 100MHz, the other at 133MHz. If two different speeds are detected, the motherboard will automatically use the slowest available speed, in this case, at 100MHz.<br><br>In reality, however, it may not be the case. Different motherboard manufacturers have their own way of doing things, causing all kinds of weird things to happen.<br><br>Since your PC has no problem with handling PC100 and PC133 RAM, I think it's just another case of the RAM choosing the RAM slot or vice versa.</div>
