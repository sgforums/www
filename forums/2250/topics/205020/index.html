Sony manufactured the batteries that are being recalled, the representative said.<br><br>If they have one of the affected units, consumers are advised to eject the battery from the notebook after powering down and continue using the notebook with its AC power adapter, the CPSC said. Dell has so far received six reports of overheating units that caused property damage, but no injuries.<br><br>Dell has faced several issues this year related to exploding or flaming notebooks, and wants to ensure the safety of its customers, the representative said. The 4.1 million units is a subset of the 22 million units shipped during that time frame, he said. Dell said it doesn't expect the cost of the recall to materially affect its earnings. The company reports earnings for the previous quarter this Thursday.<br><br>At the moment, this looks like the largest battery recall in the history of the electronics industry, said Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates.

            <div class='col-md body'>Read the article...i think it brings out an awareness to mobile computer users out there.<br><br>Anyway i hope the cause/s of the defect can be rooted out soon and believe me it can be a long and tedious process. Many factors involved.<br><br>How users use it, storage and transportation (from SOny to Dell to distributors etc), design and part selection for the notebook model/s, QC (at Sony), QC (at Dell), and this ones important...how you assure your turnkey accessories are in compliance with the provider's quality declaration and your very own brand's QC policies.<br><br>If i can cash and carry any computing hardware, i will inspect them before buying them. I never like the idea of having a complicated electronic hardware delived to my doorstep if i can help it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>'Zippo' battery recall could cost Sony $430m and a truck</strong><br><br>By Ashlee Vance in Mountain View<br>16th August 2006 19:32 GMT<br><br>Dell has suffered from the bad press associated with its 4.1m fire-breathing laptop batteries that were recalled this week. <strong>But it's Sony - the maker of the lithium-ion batteries - that looks to front most of the financial burden for replacing systems.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Sony's line of recalled "Zippo" batteries could cost the company close to $430m, according to wild speculation from analysts.</strong></span><br><br>Analyst Roger Kay at Endpoint Technologies has Sony's costs pegged somewhere between $200m and $300m, while Macquarie analyst David Gibson says Sony will shell out up to $260m. Those ranges didn't stop Reuters from claiming the $430m figure and attributing it to no one.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>The scope of the recall costs will depend on whether or not other PC makers complain about gear supplied by Sony. The company's battery customers include the likes of HP, Apple and Lenovo. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has kicked off an investigation into the complete spectrum of products using Sony's batteries</strong>.</span><br><br>Dell doesn't see a "material" financial impact from the recall, although the company could be punished by slowed sales in the months to come. The hardware maker has been spending millions to repair its image and boost sales. Customers, however, have not embraced the idea of the laptop lighter add-on as a "feature."<br><br>The Washington Post reports,<br><br>In an incident last month, Thomas Forqueran, 62, of Arizona, was loading his truck and smelled smoke. Flames were shooting out of his Dell Inspiron laptop, which he had placed on the passenger side of the vehicle, and spread as the fire ignited ammunition that was also in the truck. The truck, a 1966 Ford F-250 passed down from his father, was destroyed by fire.<br><br>"I see Dell commercials half a dozen times a night, saying 'What can we build for you today?' " Forqueran said. "And I say, 'Grandpa's truck.' "<br><br>Dell has been forced to recall hundreds of thousands of batteries over the past few years, although this week's catastrophe marks the largest recall in US consumer electronics history.<br><br></div>

In order to keep things cheap, QC standards could be low.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
