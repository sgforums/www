What I<br>found in the user agreement for the software was pretty unbelievable,<br>obviously the people who recommended this software didn't read it. The<br>agreement itself is extremely long... but the attached excerpt from the<br>agreement almost knocked me out of my chair:<br><br>"10. UNSOLICITED MATERIALS<br>Any confidential, secret or proprietary information or other material<br>submitted or sent to IncrediMail, including without limitation via any<br>Message sent by You through the Service, Site, or IncrediMail's physical<br>mail and e-mail addresses, or in any other way, will be deemed to be not<br>confidential or secret. By submitting or sending information or other<br>material to IncrediMail or by posting information on any portion of the<br>Service you (a) Warrant that you have all rights of any kind to the material<br>and that to the best of your knowledge no other party has any rights to the<br>material; and (b) Grant IncrediMail an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable<br>license to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, transmit and distribute<br>the material, and you further agree that IncrediMail is free to use any<br>ideas, know-how, concepts or techniques you send us or post on the Service<br>for any purpose, without any compensation to you or any other person."<br><br>I'm not a reactionary person by nature but the implication of that<br>paragraph for the average user is staggering. I always tell my users to read<br>every agreement carefully but of course many don't, this agreement is<br>especially long and loaded with legalspeak to further guarantee that the<br>average person won't read it all. People are ultimately responsible for<br>their own actions but I believe that this particular company goes way too<br>far in misleading people about their ultimate goal and someone needs to<br>shine a light on them and make people aware of what's really going on, at<br>least then they can make an informed choice about using the service. I'm a<br>subscriber to several technical newsletters and I'm writing to all of them.<br>Thank you for your time, love your newsletter. --- Ed McPhail<br><br>Some of that language is similar to that used by other mail services and<br>ISPs to get around copyright issues that can innocently arise when<br>proprietary information is sent through a third party--- for example, it's<br>not uncommon for an ISP to want to ensure they're not violating a copyright<br>if they merely store a copy of your mail on their servers while it's being<br>processed.<br><br>But I can't think of any innocent reason for the phrasing that states "...<br>IncrediMail is free to use any ideas, know-how, concepts or techniques<br>you... post on the Service for any purpose, without any compensation to you<br>or any other person." Maybe there is a perfectly inoffensive reason for<br>including that, but it eludes me.<br><br>There's also another reason not to like IncrediMail, too: See next item.<br><br>Click to email this item to a friend<br>http://www.langa.com/sendit2.htm<br><br>return to top of page<br><br>7) IncrediMail Problems (Part Two)<br>There's another reason not to like IncrediMail, too: It's HTML-based, which<br>not only opens the door to all manner of web-borne security threats that are<br>absent from text-based email, but also adds tons of baggage to outbound<br>IncrediMail email. This extra baggage can clog the inboxes of recipients of<br>these mails, even if the recipients aren't IncrediMail users.<br><br>For example, the headers of email sent by Outlook Express might take this<br>simple form:<br><br>From: [user name and address]<br>To: {recipient's name and address}<br>Subject:<br>Date:<br>MIME-Version 1.0 Content-Type multipart/mixed;<br>boundary="----=_NextPart_000_0007_01C263C7.DB858E80"<br>X-Priority 3<br>X-MSMail-Priority Normal<br>X-Mailer Microsoft Outlook Express 6.00.2600.0000<br><br>But here's an actual IncrediMail header, snipped from a reader's note to me:<br><br>From: [user name and address]<br>To: {recipient's name and address}<br>Subject:<br>Date:<br>Content-Type Multipart/related;type="multipart/alternative";boundary=<br>"------------Boundary-00=_NVWB7TH0000000000000"<br>X-Mailer IncrediMail 2001 (1750710)<br>X-FID 9FF122EE-7F22-11D4-AE37-00010216CD0D<br>X-FVER 2.0<br>X-FIT Letter<br>X-FCOL Autumn<br>X-FCAT Nature<br>X-FDIS Vine Fall<br>X-Extensions SU1CTDEsNDEsgUmBScU4OIWRkSwsTZ04kZFNhYUoiU0k<br>LJWdTYGBgYWBkYWZNCiBKEksSU1CTDIsMCwsSU1CTDMsMCws<br>X-BG <br>X-BGT repeat<br>X-BGC #f5e0c3<br>X-BGPX 0px<br>X-BGPY 0px<br>X-ASN A5BE2A00-37CC-11D4-BA36-0050DAC68030<br>X-ASNF 0<br>X-ASH A5BE2A00-37CC-11D4-BA36-0050DAC68030<br>X-ASHF 1<br>X-AN 6486DDE0-3EFD-11D4-BA3D-0050DAC68030<br>X-ANF 0<br>X-AP 6486DDE0-3EFD-11D4-BA3D-0050DAC68030<br>X-APF 1<br>X-AD C3C52140-4147-11D4-BA3D-0050DAC68030<br>X-ADF 0<br>X-AUTO X-ASN,X-ASH,X-AN,X-AP,X-AD<br>X-CNT ;<br>X-Priority 3<br><br>Note that none of that is the actual email message--- it's just the typical<br>extra baggage IncrediMail adds to the email header before you even get to<br>the message itself: An extra 600 characters or so (call it roughly 5<br>kilobits) of code that must be sent by the mailer, processed by the ISPs of<br>both the mailer and the recipient, and then downloaded and processed by the<br>recipient for each and every IncrediMail message sent. Yikes! HTML email is<br>bloated anyway, but man, IncrediMail pushes it to new extremes.<br><br>Yes, IncrediMail provides amusing, all-singing, all dancing, animated,<br>colored, formatted, flashing, bleeping, blurping emails--- but with the<br>certainty of tons of excess baggage riding along with the email; with the<br>possibility of opening the door to malicious HTML-borne worms, viruses, and<br>such; and with serious questions about who owns the content of the messages<br>you send using their system.<br><br>No, thanks.</div>
