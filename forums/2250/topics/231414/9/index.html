              <p>I went to the show this afternoon. Each floor was so damn crowded (esp the third floor where there are chio girls dancing on stage) even though the entire IT show was held on four entire floors of Suntec Convention Centre.</p>
              <p>Even went to the Axioo booth trying to look for Giga, but there were dozens of assistant there and I couldn't be walking to each of them and say "Are you Giga?" like a madman in front of my friends. I saw one whose hair seem uncombed for years and was wondering, "Could that be Giga?". <img src="http://latecomerx.com/images/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15"> But anyway, fortunately and coincidentally, one of my secondary schoolmates was working there and I told him to look for Giga and send him my regards instead. Giga, if you're reading this, I may be going again this weekend. Tell me how can I recognize you there, and please share with me the contact numbers of those white gown-wearing chio bus around your booth. <img src="http://latecomerx.com/images/emoticons/icon_twi.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15"></p>
              <p>Got a Hitachi 500 GB HDD with 16 MB cache from Skylet's booth (was looking for the 32 MB one but they didn't have it) for $156. The girl assistant whom I inquired information about HDDs from seemed quite knowledgeable. She's short and quite cute-looking too, which somehow reminded me of Anty. <img src="http://latecomerx.com/images/emoticons/icon_red.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15"></p>
              <p>Then I got two sticks of Kingston DDR2-800 1GB RAM for $34 each from Best Bargain. Can you imagine it was like $100+ just 2 years ago? I think I will laugh at myself for getting them should they become $10 each or something next year.</p>
              <p>After that I just did some shopping at S&amp;K and The Wallet Shop in Suntec City and Marina Square before getting home and here I am posting this before having my birthday cake. <img src="http://latecomerx.com/images/emoticons/icon_mrg.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15"></p>

              <p>Both are external storage devices. However, the difference
              between Western Digital Elements Desktop and Passport Portable is
              the size.</p>
              <p>Elements Desktop is significant larger than Passport Portable.
              It also requires an AC adapter (meaning it needs another electrical
              power source).</p>
              <p>You could say that the Elements Desktop belongs to the 3.5"
              external HDD category and Passport Portable belongs to the 2.5"
              external HDD category, although their sizes aren't that.</p>
              <p>What's makes 3.5" different from 2.5" is the need for additional
              power source.</p>
              <p>Western Digital is well known, and their products are pretty
              good, so no worries. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>heh.. Thanks alot for the explanation Mayi <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  lol this 2 days i read bout the external hdd stuffs i learnt quite alot<br><br>I asked a girl at the WD booth bout the diff between Desktop and Portable category and she told me Desktop = 3.5" and Portable = 2.5" (which i assume myself earlier) so i thought all Portable = 2.5" hence i never even take a look at the Portable stuffs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  But the Passport Portable in metallic red color is really nice tho.</p>
              <p>I went yday aft and bought the WD Elements Desktop, 500GB $150.. good buy huh.... not from the WD booths i think their price for this is much higher (i think)</p>
