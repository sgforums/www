              <p>Gaming rig, eh? For Crysis, expect to run multiple cards. SLi is usually better for Crysis due to some partnership with NVidia for coding and stuff. So, 2 GTX280s or GTX 268 Core 216s should do. Processor wise, get a future-proof quad-core. If you can get a Core i7, do it. If not, Intel C2QX like the QX9775 (Did I get the code right?) at 3.2 GHz should be enough. Considering budget, Any quad-core should do(Q6600 entry-level has a 5.9 score already). RAM, get a 2GBDominator or something (I don't reccommend Value RAM unless you almost broke the budget or you see Elpida modules on it.) HDD, depending on space, unless you want fast access time, which means get a WD Raptor or VelociRaptor drive(s).</p>
              <p>Not sure what else......Oh and if you do somehow get an i7, for get about SLi. Just get 2 HD4850/70s for Crossfire.</p>

              <p>if u want to SLI, u would <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>compulsorily</strong></span> need motherboards with NVIDIA chipsets, as only NVIDIA chipsets are compatible with SLI up till now, whereas ATI Crossfire is compatible with more motherboards, such as those with Intel chipsets.

              <p>Processor wise, can just get a Core 2 Quad Q9650 (max for C2Q already). RAM, 4GB Kingston HyperX DDR2-1066.</p>

              <p>For SLi, nVidia relaxed and allowed SLi on <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">some</span> X58 boards. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Casing, unless you are overclocking, go for the Tempest. the HAF932 has 2 or 3 230mm fans. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, yea. Every time I design a gaming com, I get sorta carried away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would reccommend using the nVidia 780i chipset, though the 680i and 650i do a good job. I would reccommend nVidia Cards because they have GeForce PhysX inside. They do a better job at graphic intensive and physic intensive games. Take my 9500 for example. Crysis on High Settings is quite playable, with framerates of over 40fps.</p>

              <p>1. You need a quadcore<br>2. You need a powerful graphics card<br>3. Your ram needs to be fast<br>4. Because good graphics card needs power, u need a good powersupply<br>5. Because good graphics card needs power, they run hot, and u need a casing with good airflow<br>6. Games are big in size, maybe u need at least a 500gb if you install lots of games, and store many things</p>
              <p>Next, A powerful grapihcs card is enough if you are running at a resolution taht is quite high. If you are really crazy, and wants to crossfire, u need <strong>not just an Intel chipset, but a fast one</strong></p>
              <p>The Intel X48 will win the p45s, becos firstly it uses ddr3 rams, and than, when u crossfire, both the graphics card runs at x16 speed on the pci express 2.0 slot. Wheras the P45s or the normal one, they do support crossfire, but, when u crossfire, the first graphics card either:</p>
              <p>1. Run at x16 speed, and the 2nd run at x8</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>2. Both the cards runs at x8 speed</p>
              <p>That is the difference between the normal chipset and mainstream ones.</p>
              <p>I am more ATI based, so i can say the best card now is the 4870x2, for you to run it properly, u need at least a 750 watts powersupply, and a case with good air flow, such as the <strong>coolermaster HAF 932</strong></p>
              <p>Crysis is built for Nvidia cards, to  be specific the architexture of the card. Normally people play with nvidia cards. ATI cards are getting stronger nowadays, like the 4870x2. However, if you are just building ur comp for crysis only, u can get the nvidia cards, like the GTX280.</p>
              <p>Now, if you are into SLI- which basicaally also running 2 graphics card on 1 motherboard- you need a motherboard with nvidia chipset, like the 680i, 780i, 790i.</p>
              <p>The 780i is like the x38, while the 790i is like the x48. 790i runs ddr3 ram also</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are some motherboard that allows u to run ddr2 on x48 or both ddr2 and ddr3, one of them is the MSIX48C platinum, which i am using now, but the bios is messed up.</p>
              <p>If you are into overclocking, u need a cpu cooler, like the coolermaster hyper212 cpu cooler. Personally i am using the ASUS silent knight 2, not bad, my system is running at 3.33ghz, using Q9450</p>
              <p>One example of a good gaming rig:<br><br>Intel core 2 quad Q9550 with Gigabyte X48 series motherboard<br>Coolermaster Hyper 212 CPU cooler<br>Corsair XMS3 DHX ram<br>Antec Truepower Quattro 100watts [overkill]<br>Sapphire/HIS/ other brands 4870x2<br>Western Digital Raptor HDD 150gb for games and programs<br>Seagate Barracuda 1tb for storage<br>Any DVD drive if u not doing much burning</p>
