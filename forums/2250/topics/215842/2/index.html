Well if gaming is what the topic starter wants then the question still falls on what games he wants to play? If he is a serious gamer but is also budget concious hoping to squeeze every ounce of performance out of the card within his budget then a wise gamer like himself/ herself will know to sit back and read reviews. Lots of trusted sites and forums out there do reviewws with benchmark tests on specific PC games. If you have read or come across one or more of them you will realise that reviewers usually pick 2 cards from either chip technology vendor (i.e ATI/ nVidia) with almost the equal in price and printed specification for their tests. I wouldn't say those who supported nVidia are wrong but several reviews and benchmark/ performance tests recently show that nVidia is beating on ATI hard. However, wasn't it long before when nVidia got a bad bashing from ATI with the launch of their 9xxx series card? We must also note that although all the various cards are tested in a game but have all the CPU, hard disks, rams and motherboard manufacturers at that point of time been used for the tests as well? that will probably take years for one review on a single game to be completed. the truth is a new card from A chip maker's been released and at a retail price. Thus B chip maker will work to release their competing card at a 'competitive' price. and the cycle goes on. A card costing $1000 may drop to $600 or less in the space of a few months. so the decision to what to buy still falls on the buyers themselves. If they are comfortable with a $1000 nVidia card but finds that another ATI card released soon after at a lower price and performing better that does not mean that nVidia is a bad chip maker. Because now in stores that nVidia card he bought is selling at a lower price than that ATI card.<br><br>Unlike the processor or OS market, the good thing we have with the graphics card market is there are many license manufacturers to manufacture the cards based on the 2 graphics chips. So now the question is who to buy from and why? Well some card manufacturers were famous for packing in lots of goodies (games, software, cable accessories etc) with their card so that they can sell them good but some pull down their prices with the bare minimal so as not to burden budget buyers with the cost. SOme card makers spent lots more on advertising their products while some spend on their card designs. Also the power consumption, thermal management, color, circuit/ card layout etc determines which group of picky buyers they attracts. Apparently some flavours ATI while others nVidia.<br><br>As for the budget of $340-$370 (i am assuming it to be in Sing) no prob. I believe as a PC builder the topic starter can work it out on his own. Most lower ended PCI-e nVidia 7900 256MB series and ATI 1900 256 MB series (e.g PowerColor) fit the price range. These cards at 1048x768 resolution can play most games that are not too GPU intensive. Of course they need to be paired up with a decent mobo and other hardware too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>P4 2.4gHz is still more than enough to serve you as a multimedia PC for all your movies, TVs (plus recording) and music entertainment. A P4 is also enough for you to edit movies or manage your MP3s. So what do you do when you upgrade? sell off your old set up? why not keep it as a backup or distribute the work over 2 (or more) PCs? There are AGp versions of nVidia 7xxx series and ATI x700 series graphics card that works well with the delivery of multimedia contents. Even some builders with configurations cose to your setup are using the ATI 9600pro without the wish to sell off or scrap the system.<br><br>Like i said its not like you upgrade every month or every year. The very first build will always cost you since you have to buy the display panels and user interface etc. Susequence upgrades usually sees you spending more on the cards, boards and ram sticks/ hard disks.</div>
