              <p>Via: <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10129693-83.html">CNET</a>:</p>
              <p><em>BERLIN–A key piece of Internet technology that banks, e-commerce
              sites, and financial institutions rely on to keep transactions safe
              suffers from a serious security vulnerability, an international team of
              researchers announced on Tuesday.</em></p>
              <p><em>They demonstrated how to forge security certificates used by
              secure Web sites, a process that would allow a sufficiently
              sophisticated criminal to fool the built-in verification methods used
              by all modern Web browsers–without the user being alerted that anything
              was amiss.</em></p>
              <p><em>The problem is unlikely to affect most Internet users in the
              near future because taking advantage of the vulnerability requires
              discovering some techniques that are not expected to be made public as
              well as overcoming engineering hurdles: performing the initial digital
              forgery consumed approximately two weeks of computing time on a cluster
              of 200 PlayStation 3 consoles. In addition, a criminal needs to find a
              way to reroute traffic from a legitimate Web site to his own, perhaps
              through techniques that have become well-known in the last few years.</em></p>
              <p><em>Yet if one group can do it today, others eventually will. “We
              have a proof-of-concept that allows us to impersonate any supposedly
              secure Web site on the Internet,” said David Molnar, a doctoral student
              in computer science at the University of California at Berkeley.</em></p>
              <p><em>Molnar and six other researchers presented their findings during
              an afternoon session of the Chaos Computer Club’s annual conference
              here on Tuesday. Other team members include Jacob Appelbaum and
              Alexander Sotirov.</em></p>
              <p><em>Their work has focused on finding vulnerabilities in a
              technology known as Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, which was designed to
              provide Internet users with two guarantees: first, that the Web site
              they’re connecting to isn’t being spoofed, and second, that the
              connection is encrypted and is proof against eavesdropping. SSL is used
              whenever a user navigates to an address beginning with “https://”. SSL
              certificates essentially stand for the claim that, for instance,
              etrade.com actually belongs to E-Trade Inc., and is not being operated
              by a thief hoping to steal account passwords.</em></p>
              <p><em>Most browsers indicate that SSL is active by displaying a small
              padlock icon. An attack using a forged authentication certificate–which
              is what the researchers say they have done–is insidious because the
              browser can’t detect it and the padlock icon would still appear.</em></p>
              <p><em>Unlike most security issues, this problem cannot be fixed with a
              simple software update. “The bug is not in anyone’s software,” Sotirov
              said. “It’s not the browser that’s at fault. The browser does exactly
              what it’s supposed to do… The problem is that what it’s supposed to do
              is wrong.”</em></p>
              <p><em>The attack exploits a mathematical vulnerability in the MD5
              algorithm, one of the standard cryptographic functions used to check
              that SSL certificates (and thus the corresponding Web sites) are valid.
              This function has been publicly known to be weak since 2004, but until
              now no one had figured out how to turn this theoretical weakness into a
              practical attack.</em></p>
              <p><em>An SSL certificate is a small file that ties a real-world
              corporate identity to a Web site address and a corresponding public
              encryption key. This is presented to a private certificate authority
              firm, which is supposed to verify the link between identity and domain
              name and then cryptographically “sign” the certificate to vouch for it.</em></p>
              <p><em>The problem arises when someone else is able to forge the same signature.</em></p>
              <p><em>VeriSign, which operates the largest certificate authority in
              the world, learned of the vulnerability early on Tuesday and acted
              quickly to close the hole in its certificates, according to Tim Callan,
              vice president of product marketing at the company.</em></p>
              <p><em>“We went into our systems and removed the MD5 algorith and
              replaced it with SHA-1 (Secure Hashing Algorith),” he said. “You can
              not get an SSL certificate from VeriSign now that is subject to this
              attack.” More information from VeriSign is available on Callan’s SSL
              blog.</em></p>
              <p><em>VeriSign was in the process of phasing out MD5 before the issue
              came up and is now on track to have it entirely out of commission in
              January, Callan said. “On balance, public key infrastructure works
              extraordinarily well,” he said when asked if the vulnerability
              illustrated a need to change the trust model.</em></p>
              <p><em>Microsoft, while noting that the issue wasn’t a vulnerability
              with one of its products, tried to downplay the threat to users in a
              security advisory Monday.</em></p>
              <p><em>“This new disclosure does not increase risk to customers
              significantly, as the researchers have not published the cryptographic
              background to the attack, and the attack is not repeatable without this
              information,” the advisory said.</em></p>
              <p><em>A 1991-era protocol, but modern problems</em></p>
              <p><em>When MIT professor Ron Rivest developed MD5 in 1991, it was
              considered sufficiently secure. But starting in 1996, a series of
              increasingly serious flaws started calling the continued viability of
              MD5 into question.</em></p>
              <p><em>As CNET News reported in 2004, flaws discovered at that time
              “could eventually make it easier for intruders to insert undetectable
              back doors into computer code or to forge an electronic
              signature–unless a different, more secure algorithm is used.” Then, in
              2007, Arjen Lenstra of Bell Laboratories Switzerland, with Marc Stevens
              and Benne de Weger of TU Eindhoven, demonstrated a technique to
              construct two new certificates with different content but the same
              fingerprint.</em></p>
              <p><em>Although security researchers had been worrying, and
              recommending that other alternatives be considered, nobody had yet
              demonstrated how to exploit this theoretical flaw in a practical attack.</em></p>
              <p><em>Molnar, Appelbaum, and Sotirov joined forces with the European
              MD5 research team in mid-2008, along with Swiss cryptographer Dag Arne
              Osvik. They realized that the co-construction technique could be used
              to simultaneously generate one normal SSL certificate and one forged
              certificate, which could be used to sign and vouch for any other. They
              purchased a signature for the legitimate certificate from an
              established company that was still using MD5 for signing, and then
              applied the legitimate signature to the forged certificate. Because the
              legitimate and forged certificates had the same MD5 value, the
              legitimate signature also marked the forged one as acceptable.</em></p>
              <p><em>The process amounted to transferring a photograph from a real ID
              to a fake by carefully matching the holographic security markers.</em></p>
              <p><em>The rogue certificate can then be used to sign any other
              certificate of the attacker’s choosing–such as one which assures Web
              browsers that a malicious phishing site is actually the legitimate
              etrade.com or bankofamerica.com.</em></p>
              <p><em>After three unsuccessful attempts, each of which required
              approximately three days of compute time on a cluster of 200
              PlayStation 3s, the researchers obtained a forged certificate authority
              in early November, at which time they notified browser developers and
              certificate authorities, or CAs, about the security flaw. Molnar
              estimates that the same processing time could be purchased from Amazon
              for about $1,500.</em></p>
              <p><em>The team decided to disclose the vulnerability at the Berlin
              conference in hopes that the news will encourage everyone involved to
              fix the problem quickly. “The main message here is to stop issuing MD5
              certificates, now,” said Molnar. He believes that MD5 is so weak it no
              longer should be used for any applications: “More secure, freely
              available alternatives exist.” (In November 2005, the U.S. government
              announced plans to find successors to MD5 and SHA-1, an official
              federal standard with its own problems. The new federal standard will
              be called SHA-3.)</em></p>
              <p><em>By itself, the MD5-certificate-forging vulnerability wouldn’t be
              too worrisome. That’s because it relies on criminals being able to
              capture Web traffic to display a fraudulent Web site. But setting up a
              fake wireless access point to lure unsuspecting neighbors or business
              travelers is trivial, and a program released earlier this year to
              attack the domain name system (DNS) provides another way to direct
              Internet traffic for malicious purposes.</em></p>
              <p><em>While only a few CAs currently sign certificates with MD5,
              Appelbaum estimates that 30 percent to 35 percent of all SSL
              certificates currently in use have an MD5 signature somewhere in their
              authentication chain. “The CAs should contact every customer that
              currently uses an MD5-signed certificate and offer a free replacement.”</em></p>
              <p><em>In an interview on Tuesday morning, cryptography expert Bruce
              Schneier praised the research but downplayed the real-world
              consequences of the findings.</em></p>
              <p><em>“SSL protects data in transit but the problem isn’t
              eavesdropping on the transmission. Someone can steal the credit card on
              some server somewhere. The real risk is data in storage. SSL protects
              against the wrong problem,” he said.</em></p>
              <p><em>“This is good work, great cryptography. I love the research, but
              this doesn’t matter a whit,” Schneier added. “There are half a dozen
              ways to forge certificates and nobody checks them anyway.”</em></p>
              <p><em>Paul Kocher, president of Cryptography Research and an architect
              of the SSL 3.0 protocol, said the exploit highlights the need for a new
              universal hash function “that everyone is comfortable with.”</em></p>
              <p><em>“The paper is not a surprise, but at the same time it’s the
              crispest demonstration for why it’s necessary to remove this broken
              algorithm everywhere it is being used,” he said, before adding “there
              are bigger things to worry about, like browser bugs and operating
              security bugs.”</em></p>
              <p><em>The researchers have created a Web site signed with a forged
              certificate which can be viewed here. The forged certificate was
              backdated so that it could not be used maliciously even if stolen from
              researchers, so you have to reset your system clock to August 2004 to
              view it.</em></p>
              <p><em>Even though their work may be controversial, the researchers
              view their efforts as fundamental to creating a more secure Internet.
              “I don’t want to be hit by this type of attack either,” Sotirov said.
              “I use the Internet too.”</em></p>
