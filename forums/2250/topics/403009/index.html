              <p>Hi guys, ive got some questions and i dont know the answer. Hope you guys can help! (:</p>
              <p>I'm a currently a singnet user. i've signed up for a 8mbps home broadband but ALL THE TIMES when i download something from the net, it always varies around 270~340kbps on the download speed. then when i went to "www.speedtest.net", it shows that my download speed is 3.05mbps ( i tried this at 2.37AM one user, sometimes in the afternoon its like 2.87mbps two user, but its around the same :\ )</p>
              <p>my question is why doesnt it show 8mbps like my plan does? feel wasteful every month i pay $42 for slow speeds. My house is around 17 years old. does the slow speed links with the wire from the phone line to the modem? if yes, do i need to call singtel to change it for me? </p>
              <p>and..</p>
              <p>one of my starhub friend enjoy speed up to 12mbps but his plan is only 6mbps. ( i know starhub did a 2x speed boost ) but the difference is so obvious! he is paying about the same as me and enjoying speed 4x of mine!! he lives in a new house btw.</p>
              <p>so my question is how does starhub works? i heard it is a fat wire which supplies the whole building instead of individual phone lines of singnet. and it slows down when massive amount of people uses starhub. is it true? starhub better or singnet? i will switch if starhub is better.</p>
              <p>thats it. sorry if the post is very long. thank you! (: <br>if there is a link, i'll gladly read it and will save the trouble of you explaining ^_^</p>

              <p>PC (1) ---- Router (2)  ---- Modem (3) ---- Internet (4) ---- Modem  ---- Router ---- Server</p>
              <p>Possible causes:</p>
              <p>1. Your PC is infected with malware and is busy sending viagra-related spam to your friends, girls included. How to verify: Do a anti-virus scan.</p>
              <p>2. You're using a wireless router and some stranger is leeching your bandwidth. How to verify: Plug the modem directly to your PC and see if the connection improves.</p>
              <p>3. The cables between your PC, your modem and router, or even your router and modem themselves are damaged. (Rare) How to verify: Change them and see if the situation improves. You may want to get SingTel to install a new phone line as well, but they would charge $50 for it fyi.</p>
              <p>4. You're downloading from an overseas server which happened to have a slow uplink. How to verify: Test your speed by downloading a file from a locally-based server (go somewhere like www.maplesea.com and download their game client).</p>
              <p>Not sure what are the exact differences between SingTel and StarHub, but the issue about lagging during peak hours with StarHub seems to be common.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I get the speeds Singtel advertise (And slightly more :P). And my house is 12 years old.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fat-pipe/thin-pipe thing is kind of accurate. AFAIK, Starhub uses cable to transmit data, rather than ADSL. Advantage of cable is that you have higher speeds. Disadvantage: Everyone is using the same big, fat pipe. ADSL cannot transmit data that fast (25MBps max IIRC) but advantage is that you alone have access to that bandwidth. A single, narrow pipe just for you.</p>

              <p>i've tried the maple download. the speed is still the same. ranges 260-330kbps.</p>
              <p>sorry but my computer had no virus inside as scanned by avg 9.0 and im using wired ethernet, but it still is slow.. </p>
              <p>now i dont know should i switch to starhub or remain at singtel cos i dont really get the advertised speeds. ( usually you should get what you pay ) im using the 2wire white mio box. </p>
              <p>but starhub still seems more appealing, along with the phone line all those packages( even tho singtel offered an upgrade from my current 8 to 10mbps, i doubt there will be difference, still 300kbps++ )</p>
              <p>whats the difference between MBps and mbps. its damn scamming by the advertising of the telcos. megabyte and megabit? </p>
              <p>raraken, are you satisfied with singnet?</p>

              <p>I'm beginning to suspect that you're on a SingNet 3 mbps connection, which gives you a maximum theoretical speed of 375 kilobytes per second (kBps). Maybe you were downgraded after your last contract ended somehow. Check your latest monthly bill.</p>

              the maple download. the speed is still the same. ranges
              260-330kbps.</span>"</p>
              <p>You mean k<strong>B</strong>ps, not kbps, is that correct?</p>
              <p>B = byte, b = bit. 1 byte = 8 bits.</p>

              <p>I'm beginning to suspect that you're on a SingNet 3 mbps
              connection, which gives you a maximum theoretical speed of 375
              kilobytes per second (kBps). Maybe you were downgraded after your
              last contract ended somehow. Check your latest monthly bill.</p>

              <p>okay.. i've called singtel already, but the speed is still the same. the person tell me go "http://techsupport.singnet.com.sg/" to test my speed because it from local ( more accurate ) but the results is about the same as "www.speedtest.net". </p>
              <p>after he realise that my max speed was only 4.60++mbps, ( my plan was a 8mbps ) he told me to make the modem connect DIRECTLY to the wall socket and thus told me to remove the phone line from the ( i forgot what its called already, its a square box that splits the wall socket to phone line and DSL line ). with that, we got disconnected but he had my phone number, so he called me back again.</p>
              <p>with that, my speed is still the same at around 3mbps++ ( sometimes varies to 4++mbps ) but im still not at the speed i've paid for. then, he arranged a technician to come tml at 4-6pm to look into it.</p>
              <p>well, ill update you guys again if anything happens. :\ </p>
              <p>thanks for all the help you guys gave. very much (:</p>
