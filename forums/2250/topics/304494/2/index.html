I can't remember much, but I found those articles through a Google search like "P35 vs X38". You may want to try that as well.<br></div>

The issue is whether that uncle is shoving down components that are more than necessary for your needs. If you had told him you're not OC-ing before he recommended you that 1000W PSU, you can go back and flash him your middle finger before walking into another store.<br></div></blockquote>Firstly he also thought i am a overclocker.....cos i told him about 2.4 too slow, budden he say for my combination, 1000W is minimum, also maybe it is becos of the casing i wanna get, i say if put watercool plus lights<br></div>
