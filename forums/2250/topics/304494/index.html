            <div class='col-md body'>Since it's mainly for video editing and gaming, you will need at least 1GB of RAM. For now, I would recommend sticking to 32-bit OS, and not getting a 64-bit one.

            <div class='col-md body'>The choice of MB really doesn't matter much as long it has most of the features you need if you're not OC-ing. But if I have to pick, I would go with Gigabyte's GA-P35-DS3 going around at $205 (not our dear giga  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ).<br><br>Erm, for that 3x 8800 Ultra, I'm not serious about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Seriously, each 8800 Ultra costs more than $1,000. And the entire setup will easily cost more than $6,000. It's like a Mercedes-Benz - too fast, too expensive. You can read more about its review here.<br><br><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/article/Videocards/481/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/article/Videocards/481/</a><br><br>A 8800 GT (512 MB) or 8800 GTS (512 MB, not the 320 MB or 640 MB one) which cost around $450 and $550 respectively would be much more worth the $.<br><br>Processor-wise, get the Q6600 which is retailing at $440. Iirc, the next CPU in the Quad series is double that price.<br><br>For RAM modules, stay with DDR2 ones. The DDR3 sticks do not offer much performance advantage against DDR2 ones, but each one costs around 5 - 10 times more than its DDR2 counterparts atm. For a good balance between cost and performance, grab those DDR2-1066 low-latency modules like HyperX or BallistiX which is going for $80 - $110 each for the 1GB model. Otherwise, go with the DDR2-800 Value RAMs selling for around $40 per 1 GB stick.<br><br>To get the most value out of hard disk drives, go for the ones that are between 250 - 500 GB as they have the lowest $/GB ratio (approx $0.40/GB). I would pick one from Hitachi, and Anty would recommend you Seagate. Anyway, if you are looking for performance, go with Western Digital's Raptors ($2.30 - $4.20 / GB depending on model). They get pretty hot easily, so you may need good ventilation for your casing.<br><br>I'm not experienced with cooling systems, but I suppose you will need cooling for CPU, graphics card and casing individually or even water cooling only when you're OC-ing. These components should not sweat under normal use. Anyway, a good CPU fan typically cost around $100. Or you can just use the stock fan that comes with the CPU. Not too sure about the rest.<br><br>Other than all these components above, do remember to factor in the cost of the power supply unit (good ones go for $150 and above, infamous ones go for $50), the casing (walk around SLS to see-see, nice-looking ones cost between $80 - $180), the monitor ($250 - $450) and if the MB doesn't have a good on-board sound card, you may consider getting one. The cheapest would be around $50 (Creative Audigy) which can be said to be above most on-board sound cards.<br><br>And some general advice here. No need to use until up Lorry` de. You can consider upgrading every year and selling the parts off at 30% - 50% of the original price at forum marketplaces which can be used to supplement the cost of the upgrade itself. I personally find this way to be more worthwhile. It's like having a high startup cost on the first purchase but enjoying high-end tech stuff at 50% - 70% of the original price on every upgrade.<br></div>
