              <p>i think the HP xw9300 uses one of these.. not really sure if those two heatsink stacks have CPU's underneath them.. but.. then again, they dont have FANS on them.. except for a single fan on the chassis, one on the PSU and the small one on a nvidia quadro FX card.</p>

              <p>8gb is furture proof. But 8gb rams are not cheap. Further more, this money can be properly used to get a new graphics card or a better one.</p>
              <p>If you are continuing to use windows xp Mce, i do not think that there is a need to upgrade to a 8gb rams or totalled up 8gb of ram. You can only see 3gb(s) if you are using a 32bit system. </p>

              <p>hmm.. sure..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now, need some size expertise on you guys now.. firstly my PC's a m7390d, HP, as abovementioned. i'm afraid the mobo isn't a full ATX sized one, as its only got 3 pci slots and one pcie x16 slot. thats about all it accomodates. size wise my pc isnt toweringly tall, neither is it micro sized. its about the size of similar spec acers, dells, and whatnot you can find in the shops 2 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also, taking into consideration i need to control spending, so yeah, i will only overhaul this system june next year. therefore, id like recommendations for mobo's that are of this size, and can fit:</p>
              <p>1) 8GB RAM, @ at least 800MHZ, dual-channel preferred. (4X2GB)</p>
              <p>i wont be using all 8gig of it, but yeah, thats for futureproofing.</p>
              <p>2) socket LGA775 pentium D 930 CPU.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a PSU unit that has lots of "fan-out" cables :lol:</p>
              <p>im planning to install 6 (yes, SIX) fans on the side panel.. i wont mind my feet having some wind too :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also, a lil bit more help here, has anyone here had any experience with the SilverStone NT03 nitrogon CPU cooler? reading the reviews it had, i would like to get one of these.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>meanwhile, i'll be replacing all the RAM with 4X1GB 667 chips in a few weeks to come :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks for the help, if any :)</p>

              <p>let me add on a possibly redundant tip about air cooling if u are upgrading:</p>
              <p>if your hard disk is running at absurd temps like mine (up to 70 celsius), then you may be interested in those cheapo $10 hard disk coolers. cheap as they may be, with broken english on the cover and all, they actually work well. i have installed a dual fan hdd cooler unit on my WDC 250GB hard disk and a single fan unit on my secondary 80GB hitachi deskstar, and it help keep the temp. down by up to 6 deg C, can see this when the hdd is under load during gaming.</p>
              <p>not only does this apply to hdd, if your pc hapens to be like mine, in which there is no slot or vent in the front panel for an intake fan, but the side panel is perforated like meshes, try installing some fans on the side panel and adjust them so they suck air in. also postion them near the important components like HDD bay, optcal drives and GPU. cpu not really needed cus its got its own fan. the screw mouns u use might ruin the holes that u used to mount the fan with, as it isnt officially supposed to screw in a fan, but at this sacrifice u get a cooler PC.</p>

              <p>well i'd say get 2GB of ram. dual core CPU's fine so keep it there. PSU wise get sth around 500w. good enough to run the higher end but not so crazy GPU's. this is depending on ur gaming habit though. if its just things like dota and maple and stuff ur playing then there isnt a need to get the craziest grpahic card out there. make a good choice on your parts. if you really do vdeo/photo editing on a daily basis then i would suggest getting a HDD of at least 500GB space. add an extra 500GB to "mirror" the main HDD in case the main one fails and all your data is gone.</p>
