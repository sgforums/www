It would be made worse by an unsecured network.<br><br>Are you working or studying in the day? Is the computer in use in the day? If no, then someone probably found a way to your network due to those open ports and probably disconnect them remotely. Get a firewall to protect your network.</div>

Using those connecting to telephone one is it? This one don't have problems unless someone calls in, but they have a special telelphone filter to solve this problem.<br><br>If using router but have wires, not quite sure. Try resetting everything back to default.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to have this problem with my SMC router as well. I was using Azureus back then with my SMC router for BitTorrent. I think it had something to do with too many connections being made to your router and your router just sort of hangs. Then il have to restart the router and everything will be ok.<br><br>I solved my problem by switching to BitComet.<br><br>And then later on i got myself a DLink Router + Print Server.<br><br>Didnt have any disconnection problems.

Could be. But most of the time, it's the end users. Like one of the forumer had posted, it could you all uploading and downloading too many things at one time, and it hung. Starhub does a lot of maintainence, but I have never seen maintainence done at night. So it could be user problem.</div>
