              <p>How long was the duration between buying and exchanging?</p>
              <p>If i'm not wrong, only can exchange within one week and that the 3 yr warranty by the orignal manufacturer is not wrong.I would even probably not buy if the warranty was from the shop.</p>
              <p>When i bought my DIY pc, each part had a warranty by its own manufacturer and not by the shop itself. This is the case with most shops if i'm not wrong, anyway, in future, ask before buying to be safe.</p>

              <p>3 days on site warranty of Western Digital and not the shop. You cant blame anyone since you didn't ask.</p>
              <p>Tourist probably will know it. Since if buying from another country, they should like know beforehand if there's international warranty before buying, if not have to come back singapore to repair.</p>
              <p>Whining or not i dont know, but i can tell you that the shop is not at fault.</p>
