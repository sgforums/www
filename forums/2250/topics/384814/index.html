              <p>-sound isnt much of a problem(will be using ear piece most of the time) but i'll be using wireless (or maybe cable idk yet, most probably wireless), will be plaing for like 10hour+ per day and make try to reduce the frequency of lag to the minimum</p>
              <p>- i will be paying for the parts purchased and some fee for the "building" of the com :D</p>

              <p>Any cheapo dual core is fine (By cheapo, I mean AMD). 2GB RAM. Integrated graphics. Some cheapo casing. 160GB HDD. Windows 98 ( I saw OEM copy for ~$20 XD). Some cheapo PSU like that Powerk PP-ATX450W (I'm running out of weird cheapo PSU names :O) you saw going for $18 at your neighbourhood PC shop. A CD burner you stole from your grandma's PC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ummm, anything more?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously. Athlon II, 780G mobo. 2GB DDR2. That's pretty much all you need. Heck, you could play all those games on a netbook.</p>

              of it, I need to get my casing modded, so yeah, i can meet you at
              SLS sometime next week or something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Windows 7 is easier to use and about as fast, if not faster
              than, XP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you really just gonna play all that, (All prices based on
              Bell Pricing)</p>
              <p>Athlon II X2 240 + Biostar TA790GX3 AM3 DDR3 ATX mobo $241
              &lt;- Cheaper than MSI 785G -E53 O_O</p>
              <p>Kingston DDR3-1333 CL9 $72</p>
              <p>500GB HDD $75</p>

              <p>Yup, pretty basic. That said, your mobo will have space for
              multiple graphics cards should you feel the need........for

              <p>Then use Cooler Master casing, well ventilated. I'm using the
              Elite 334, perforated front panels with dust filters. then will
              undergo case modding to add additional fans at the side panel.</p>

              <p>I reco Bell leh, I go there lots of time, very friendly staff. I go there reco GFX cards, they got spend 15 mins telling me differences between the different brands (I already knew :P) and the different models. Got also open the box and let me see bundle, and the card. My rig I wanted to get from there, but they OOS, so go Cybermind for RAM, CPU + mobo. DVD, PSU and casing from Bell, and CPU cooler from Video-Pro. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That said, never rely on just 1 store. Go around, scout out the deals. I prefer Cybermind, Bell Systems, Best Price be side it, and Video Pro. mynextcom's unker very friendly, but if you on tight budget (under 16 FTW) = No choice, go somewhere else. Does Fuwell still exist? I don't remember seeing it at SLS. Not that I care though ^_^. Their service standard became crap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Case modding can go UVnium, 3rd floor. They sell all kinds of case stuff (fan, filters, mesh, CCFL). I'm going there to get 1 fan, and 2 filters for my side window. My Xigmatek touching already &gt;_&gt; If your mobo and CPU cooler got lights no need CCFL bah. I got "light show" cos my mobo got blue LED, Fan got white LED. Gonna get 2 red LED fan for the side casing and replace my front casing fan, and green (if have) to replace my rear fan. Then I will have DA POWAH. or just go red totally.</p>
              <p>(AMD Dragon FTW. Don't you which your platform was, cool like it? Don't you which it had mascot big like him?<em>*points to the Fusion Dragon* </em>Don'tcha?) </p>
              <p>AHAHAHAHAHA. Pre-holiday madness. So sian of packing, become siao lah XD</p>

              <p>Fuwell used to be good. That was about 3 years ago. never bothered going to check with them anymore.</p>
              <p>VideoPro also quite crowded at times, but pretty good deals inside. Normally Red Scorpion is about $70, I got mine for about $60 :D</p>
              <p>One of the guys at PCT offered me a job, but have to refuse :( Not 16 and over</p>
              <p>When I OC, my mobo kind of rocks. It has 5 blue LED in a row, for NB Voltage and CPU Phase power. When I OC, it will change phases quite often, then the LEDs will blink, switch on in a row, etc. Pretty cool stuff.</p>
