            <div class='col-md body'>Thus Speak Prodigal<br>-------------------<br>Part II : The Search for True Love<br>Disclaimer : Standard<br><br>Episode 10 : Heaven is a place on Earth<br><br>(a)At the Entrance of Heaven<br>----------------------------<br>There was a nothing but a door in front of the Prodigal, as he was in the midst of the white clouds under the blue sky. He was peering beyond the door. He knew that it was the entrance to a place where humans had desired to be : Heaven. However, the concept of heaven and hell are made by people but merely labels to worlds where heaven comprised of everything which one desires and hell was a place where one could not forgive oneself. In that context, if hell is just a place where souls seek redemption, by the same course, heaven is a place on Earth.<br><br>"Welcome to the entrance of Heaven, the Endless by the name of Prodigal," said a melodic voice, filled with a sense of rigour. A being with a pair of wide spread wings appeared before the Prodigal.<br><br>"Hello, St. Peter, the guardian of the entrance of Heaven," said the Prodigal.<br><br>"What is your business to Heaven, Endless?" asked the angel, who had guarded the entrance from trepassers for many eons. He was responsible to show the faithful souls who found their way to Heaven after their passing from death to the realm of absolute perfection, where they could finally meet their almighty God. It was strange to have an Endless to seek entrance into Heaven.<br><br>"I am here to see the Creator in an urgent manner," said the Prodigal.<br><br>"Well, state your matter, otherwise I cannot let you enter Heaven." said the guardian, as he lifted his hands, in preparation to defend  the gate against the Prodigal.<br><br>"St. Peter," said the Prodigal,"The matter concerns the fate of the cosmos, and I am afraid that I cannot divulge to you. I came on behalf of Lucifer Morningstar, who would be refused by the Creator."<br><br>"You mean you came on behalf of the traitor of our kind," St. Peter's face changed as he suddenly looked aggressive to the Endless. "Then I cannot let you enter. I fear that you are tricked by him into introducing chaos into Heaven."<br><br>"I have to, St. Peter," said the Prodigal,"It has something to do with Lucifer Morningstar, but he is also caught in the web of intrigue. We have unleashed a force which threatened the fate of our cosmos. He has made a deal with me to seal the anomaly which was caused by our duel, and I needed to see the Creator to warn him of a danger which he is facing."<br><br>"What danger?" said the angel in a haughty note. "Nothing could harm the omnipotent Creator, for he is the beginning and the end."<br><br>"Well, in the eyes of the Endless, he is only one of the Gods, and he is the one with the most followers from the realms of Earth. Of course, he created the Angels and Humans genetically thru his powers. To you all, he is God, but to me, he is just one of the powerful beings controlling one of the realms in the Universe. You think he is the beginning and the end, because the book which you read your origin is written by Him. Consider the source, St. Peter, and because it is written by Him, he is able to twist it in any manner he can, but to the Endless, it is just a book which he wrote to influence his followers."<br><br>"How dare you insult the Creator, maybe you are in cahoots with Lucifer Morningstar." the angel became agitated at Prodigal's words.<br><br>"Doesn't mean that I don't believe in your God means that I am aligned with the Devil?" said the Prodigal,"You sounded like one of those extreme Christians who condemned the other religions to Hell, because the people of the other religions do not believe in your God? You make no difference from the Devil. Good and Evil are merely labels." the Prodigal spoke in a clear manner, as he was able to handle against the angel.<br><br>"Let him in," a voice spoke in a deep and majestic manner.<br><br>"But Gabriel, how could you let someone who has dishonoured our Almighty?" the angel was not willing to let the Prodigal in.<br><br>Just at this moment, a flash of light came from nowhere and struck the angel in pain. The voice continued to speak,"I am the Archangel Gabriel, and I apologize for Peter's behaviour. Welcome, the Endless to Heaven and enter by the door."<br><br>"Thank you,St. Gabriel," the Prodigal said, as he was thinking in his mind that he would facing one of the most powerful archangels who was on the same level as the Devil. It would be a tough obstacle ahead, but he was sure that he could conquer all in his stride.<br><br>(b)A Deal of Evil<br>-----------------<br>Savana was a barren wasteland filled with the dust of chaos. The Endless, by the name of Devestation had ruled in his realm for many eons. Many had attempted to challenge his realm and was destroyed in the process. He was a Endless manifesting in the form of a human male, with a strong and brutal taste of sadism. However, despite all his responsibility was on destroying things, he was one who had a petty heart. His ambition was to destroy an Endless who had defeated him over his chase for the Goddess of Love. That Endless whom he hated for the former's egoism and arrogance was none other the person we know as the Prodigal. Devestation was not happy at the moment for he had a guest in the realm, a man in white suit who proclaimed himself as Luficer Morningstar, aka the Devil. The Devil had come to the realm to seek to borrow the Endless' flail to seal the anomaly.<br><br>"Lucifer Morningstar, you would not have my assistance, if you are helping that son of a bitch to seal the anomaly." the Endless said in a angry manner, when the Devil revealed his purpose.<br><br>"Devestation, obviously, you do not understand the meaning of Evil in my dictionary. I am not helping him at all, and I am merely leading to his own destruction, yes, using your flail to seal the anomaly is one but what is the price of using the flail? Think about it." the Devil said in a persuasive manner. He looked at the Endless with a evil smile.<br><br>The Endless seemed to catch hold of what he was driving at, and smiled as well,"So I would have your word that you would destroy the Prodigal."<br><br>"Of course, I vowed to destroy him because he humiliated me in my realm. I would not make life so easy for him, and I would make him suffer the pain of losing someone he loved : both his lover and his would be daughter." the Devil said as he burst into an evil laughter.<br><br>"Good, I would hand you my flail, and you would use it to exact revenge on him. It is a long time that someone is finally on my side to teach  that good-for-nothing Endless a lesson since Death and Fate had been siding with him all the time," said Devestation, as he laughed with the Devil. As plans were made in the realm of Savana, there were more imperative things to worry about.<br><br>[to be completed]<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 28 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(c)The Call to Arms<br>-------------------<br>Torrants, Cluon and Mayar were summoned in the court of the Palace of the Elves in Faerie Land. It was one of immediate importance. They were all sitting in the great hall of the elves where the statue of the great ancestors once stood. The God of Time was holding the hand of his wife Mayar, while Cluon was sitting there with a calm look on his face.<br><br>"Rise and kneel before her majesty, the Queen of Faerie Land," an elf spoke, and the three of them bowed before Queen Amanda who had entered into the hall with a grim and solemn look.<br><br>"Rise, my guests," said the Queen. "I have summoned you here for a cause. It is regarding the issue of the demoness, who had caused harm to my son, Kallen. Something had happened to him."<br><br>"What has happened to Kallen?" Mayar said as she was guilty that Kallen had blocked the blast to turn her to a troll by the demoness. She was responsible for the transformation of the crown prince of elves into a hideous troll.<br><br>"He had left yesterday, with a letter that he would seek out the demoness in Hell. He must be out of his mind. He would be so stupid to confront the demoness who was under the Devil's protection."<br><br>"So, you want us to go to Hell immediately," said the God of Time.<br><br>"Yes, and I would let Mayar follow you. Mayar, please bring my son back to me. He is my only successor to the throne of the Faerie Land." the Queen spoke in a begging tone.<br><br>"Yes, your majesty, rest assured that if I have to lose my life, I would make sure that Prince Kallen would be brought back safely." replied Mayar in a serious tone.<br><br>"We have to set off immediately," Cluon said. "But it is not easy to enter Hell, unless an Endless would accompany us."<br><br>"Yes, Prodigal has gone with Runoa to the Nexus," said Torrants. "Cluon, why don't you head to the Nexus and sought them out while both Mayar and I would head straight to hell. I could use my powers to summon Bish and Dakar to the entrance of Hell."<br><br>"Yes, I would," said Cluon, as he was longing to see his mistress again.<br><br>"Then go quickly, we would meet in hell." said Torrants.<br><br>(d)An Angel's Lamentation<br>-------------------------<br>In the midst of the surroundings, Prodigal had found himself the perfect surrounding which had given him a sense of tranquility, serenity and solace. It was the realm of perfection. He could see souls wandering across the pastures of the Heaven. It was the paradise where one could go if one chose the path to believe in Him, the Creator. He was pondering why Gabriel had allowed him to enter into the realm. Despite Heaven being an utopia, there was paradise's lost for some who had fallen from grace and the most appropriate example was Lucifer Morningstar. Innocence once lost, can never be regained again, were the words of Milton is his re-writing of the history of the bible.<br><br>"Welcome, the Endless," Prodigal heard a powerful voice behind him. He turned and see a man in pure white loin cloth which covered half his torso, and a pair of white breeches. He was holding the trumpet, and a beautiful ring encircles above his head. He was the most powerful of all angels, the angel who was once second to Lucifer Morningstar, and his name was Gabriel.<br><br>"I presume that you are Gabriel." said the Prodigal.<br><br>"I know that you bear the representation of Hope once in the Conclave of the Endless. Your feud with Devestation over a mortal woman by the name Celette, was well known, despite your destiny was with the Endless by the representation of Love, Runoa. Unfortunately, Heaven forbid the romance between her and you, and she was to be taken away from you so that your destiny was with Runoa."<br><br>"Someone finally know who I really am," The Prodigal spoke and he had no qualms in admitting that he was Hope, in the Conclave of the Endless, before Death and Fate, with Devestation equal in ranks with him. "Celette was taken away by your Creator, and she was a devoted Catholic and you had to made her suffer for her death."<br><br>"Yes, but she had her rewards to be in Heaven after death," Gabriel said. "You were wrong to be in the position of loving 2 women. You were disobeying Fate by entering into the fray with Devestation with a mortal woman."<br><br>"Who was to tell me that love is not something that is irrational?" said the Prodigal.<br><br>"But you were wrong to two-time both of them, Hope," Gabriel said in an assertive tone.<br><br>"Yes, you were right, I was wrong, and I had paid the price." the Prodigal said,"I have destroyed the lives of 2 women, and one had already died for me, and the other is now suffering because of my duel against Lucifer Morningstar."<br><br>"I know of your purpose of coming to Heaven, but I would not grant you the access to see the Creator. Like Lucifer, I have my spies too, and I know that you have entered into a pact with him to seal the anomaly, which was created. To fulfil your end of the bargain, you have to inform the Creator of my actions." Gabriel was direct, as Prodigal suddenly surveyed around and found 4 angels surrounding him, and they were in dark black suits.<br><br>"So, the Angels are revolting against God, just like Lucifer did," said the Prodigal, as he clenched his fists ready for a battle.<br><br>"Well, consider that he had only not cared for humanity and the angels. We served him for many millenia, and yet he was cold to us, and do not respond to our prayers. He only intervened in the affairs of humankind once, when he took a part of himself and created a Messiah."<br><br>"That I presume is Jesus Christ," the Prodigal said. "He was a good man, but exaggerated in the bible. The Bible is never written by God, it is written by Man to inspire the generations which were to come."<br><br>"You are wrong, Prodigal," Gabriel said as he held an epitome in his right hand. "The Bible is written by God, it is just the angels held the correct version."<br><br>"And you are re-writing the version by your revolt against him," the Prodigal spoke in a sighing manner. "But why do you want to revolt against him, just because he cared for humanity and not your, his most trusted servants."<br><br>"He has not spoken to us for a long long time. The Angels are nothing in his eyes. To the humans, we can be the nice guys, with our beautiful white wings and spread our powers across the land of the mortal world, giving them nice messages that God has planned to reward them with their goodness, yet in truth, and these poor stupid mortals who did not realize that we are also the hitman for God, as we punish the humans in many instances."<br><br>"Like the instance, where the first borns of Eygpt were killed to let the Jews to be free of their slavery in the book of Exodus." The Prodigal cited an example from the Bible which he had read.<br><br>"Yes, we have toiled for these creatures who are self-centred and selfish. Most of these so-called believers do not deserve to be in Heaven, because of their myopic nature. They had no respect for us. And they expect us to help them all the time, what a joke. We must change the world now, by the revolution and eradicate the inferior race."<br><br>"You sound no better than a fascist. Like Hitler, you want the entire human race to be exterminated like pigs. You are so cruel." Prodigal said with the tone of justice. "Is this what Heaven is all about? It is just nothing but a place on Earth."<br><br>"Yes, but a new world order is at hand." The angel said,"Mankind was doomed to die in the first place. They were thrown out of Eden because they believed in what the Devil said. They were destined to be sinners." Gabriel was very ready to beat the Prodigal in this battle of words.<br><br>"So, you want to covet the throne and start a new Heaven, but you do not realize that you are starting another Hell." said the Prodigal,"You leave me no choice."<br><br>"Then die, you shall be, Endless," said Gabriel, as he signalled the four angels in black to assault the Endless.<br><br>Prodigal stood calm in the midst of Heaven, he clasped his hands and separated them apart with 4 short strands of string like objects on his hand. He was surrounded by a fast moving horde of angels who were shifting postitions as quick as he could see them. He saw them spinning around him, and they would strike him at one blow. Without any hesitation, he threw the four strings into spacetime, and stood there. It was at this instant, four figures manifested with their palms concentrated on the head of the Endless. The Endless was to be ambushed in a fatal attack.<br><br>The next instant, Gabriel gasped as he saw the four angels  were frozen in space and time, as four strings appeared out of nowhere, to capture them on midair. The Prodigal stood there with a smile, and turned to face the Archangel.<br><br>"Gabriel, do not force me to use my powers."<br>said the Prodigal.<br><br>"You are just enlarging the anomaly by the use of the powers." Gabriel smiled as he knew that the Prodigal would not continue to use his powers if he were to create more damage to the Cosmos.<br><br>"Well, the anomaly is already there, whether it would get bigger, it is still there, but if I can stop you now, the cosmos would be much safer. Give up Gabriel, you should not walk the same path as Lucifer Morningstar." said the Prodigal.<br><br>Gabriel lunged at the Prodigal without any thought as he wanted to stop the Prodigal from foiling his plot. It was at this instant, an absolute flash of brilliance blinded his eyes, and the light was so powerful that the Prodigal had to use his hands to block them.<br><br>"No!!!!" Gabriel screamed in fear,"He's here, he's here!!!!!!!!"<br><br>"You mean God," Prodigal realized who could have such power.<br><br>"Yes, Hope, I am the Alpha and the Omega, I am God, the omnipotent being created from the seeds of the Universe." The silhouette of a being was seen from a distance away, and there was totally nothing but powerful light emitted from him, that flushed out everything around.<br><br>"You are finally here, the Endless," said God,"As it was meant to be this way. You are destined to come to Heaven and restore the order which your chaos had unleashed." The next instant, Gabriel and his angels were trapped into a cage. Prodigal looked ahead, since as an Endless, he is not afraid of the powers of God.<br><br>"And you too, you are aware of the rebellion and you let Lucifer Morningstar think that you are unaware of it. I am disgusted by the politics of your Utopia which is all nothing but a sham. You are just using your powers to shape the realm to be perfect," said the Prodigal,"It is time that we should settle our old score now." In the midst of Heaven, another battle was about to begin, as the Prodigal had to face the most difficult ordeal of his life which could change his future.<br><br>[to be continued]<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 02 March 2000).]</div>
