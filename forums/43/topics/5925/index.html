            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Revelations,<br><br>Well, it depends whether the happy song you will send me next is what I experienced currently in my life. The bizarre thing when I wrote love story is under the circumstances when everyone is telling me about their love stories from both the happy and sad ends of the spectrum, and the song you have sent me is just nice for me to gain enough inspiration for the poem written. So, I should credit you for sending the song. And thanks for supplying me so many good songs.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Dear Tet and Lex,<br><br>Hi there, I have been fine and well, except now struggling for my 1st year report and my viva exams.<br><br>Well, I am still waiting for my love story, and that is perhaps one of my reasons of writing this poem....<br><br>Good luck with whatever you are doing.  Do take care.<br><br>Hi, jliu,<br><br>Nice poem..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> We throw away a lot of things behind. Or in a better sense, we leave behind a lot of things. Then when we come into contact with those things which we leave behind, the feeling would be described by a chinese phrase "You1 Ru2 Ge2 Shi4" (Like a seperation of a lifetime). Your poem depicted how I felt when I recovered a box from a friend and found the only photo which I have with my ex-gf with me now in UK. But that is in the past already, what we should do is to look at now....Perhaps, to re-phrase Maya's famous expression in a more optimistic note :<br><br>"Nostalgia is like a grammar lesson, you find the past tense and the future perfect."<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.
