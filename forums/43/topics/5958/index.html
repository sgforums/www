            <div class='col-md body'>It is true that sometimes we do forget those around us......<br><br>This teenager lived alone with his father, and the two of them had a<br>very<br>special relationship. Even though the son was always on the bench,<br>his<br>father was always in the stands cheering. He never missed a game.<br>This<br>young man was still the smallest of the class when he entered high<br>school.<br>But his father continued to encourage him but also made it very clear<br>that<br>he did not have to play football if he didn't want to. But the young<br>man<br>loved football and decided to hang in there. He was determined to try<br>his<br>best at every practice, and perhaps he'd get to play when he became a<br>senior.<br><br>All through high school he never missed a practice nor a game, but<br>remained<br>a bench warmer all four years. His faithful father was always in the<br>stands, always with words of encouragement for him. When the young<br>man went<br>to college, he decided to try out for the football team as a<br>"walk-on."<br>Everyone was sure he could never make the cut, but he did. The coach<br>admitted that he kept him on the roster because he always puts his<br>heart<br>and soul to every practice, and at the same time, provided the other<br>members with the spirit<br>and hustle they badly needed. The news that he had survived the cut<br>thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone and called<br>his<br>father. His father shared his excitement and was sent season tickets<br>for<br>all the college games.<br><br>This persistent young athlete never missed practice during his four<br>years<br>at college, but he never got to play in the game. It was the end of<br>his<br>senior football season, and as he trotted onto the practice field<br>shortly<br>before the big play off game, the coach met him with a telegram.<br><br>The young man read the telegram and he became deathly silent.<br>Swallowing<br>hard, he mumbled to the, "My father died<br>this morning. Is it all right if I miss practice today?" The coach<br>put his<br>arm gently around his shoulder and said, "Take the rest of the week<br>off,<br>son.And don't even plan to come back to the game on Saturday."<br><br>Then Saturday arrived, and the game was not going well. In the<br>third<br>quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a silent young man<br>quietly<br>slipped into the empty locker room and put on his football gear. As<br>he ran<br>onto the sidelines, the coach and<br>his players were astounded to see their faithful teammate back so<br>soon.<br><br>"Coach, please let me play. I've just got to play today," said the<br>young<br>man. The coach pretended not to hear him. There was no way he wanted<br>his<br>worst player in this close playoff game. But the young man persisted,<br>and<br>finally feeling sorry for the kid,<br>the coach gave in. "All right," he said. "You can go in."<br><br>Before long, the coach, the players and everyone in the stands could<br>not<br>believe their eyes. This little unknown, who had never played before<br>was<br>doing everything right. The opposing team could not stop him. He ran,<br>he<br>passed, blocked and tackled like a star.<br><br>His team began to triumph. The score was soon tied. In the closing<br>seconds<br>the game, this kid intercepted a pass and ran all the way for the<br>winning<br>touchdown. The fans broke loose. His teammates hoisted him onto their<br>shoulders. Such cheering you've never heard!<br><br>Finally, after the stands had emptied and the team had showered and<br>left<br>the locker room, the coach noticed that the young man was sitting<br>quietly<br>in the corner all alone. The coach came to him and said, "Kid, I<br>can't<br>believe it. You were fantastic! Tell me what got into you? How did<br>you do<br>it?"<br><br>He looked at the coach, with tears in his eyes, and said, "Well, you<br>knew<br>my dad died, but did you know that my dad was blind?" The young man<br>swallowed hard and forced a smile, "Dad came to all my games, but<br>today was<br>the first time he could see me play, and I wanted to show him I could<br>do<br>it!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;SO, REMEMBER RIGHT NOW<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody is very proud of you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody is thinking of you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody is caring about you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody misses you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants to talk to you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants to be with you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody hopes you are not in trouble.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody is thankful for the support you have provided.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants to hold your hand.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody hopes everything turns out all right.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants you to be happy.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants you to find him/her.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants to give you a gift.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants to hug you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody thinks you ARE a gift.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody admires your strength.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants to protect you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody can't wait to see you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody loves you for who you are.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody treasures your spirit.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody is glad that you are their friend.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants to get to know you better.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants to be near you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants you to know they are there for you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody would do anything for you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody wants to share their dreams with you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody is alive because of you.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody needs your support.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody will cry when they read this.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody needs you to have faith in them.<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody trusts you.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Somebody hears a song that reminds them of you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All of us have a monkey in our heads, just that some of us have it suppressed, some of us have it acted out. My monkey have alot to say starting with this dialogue:<br><br>A male friend of mine notices his female colleague wearing tall heels on platforms.<br><br>Male: "Why do you wear high heels?"<br>Colleague: "To look taller"<br>Real Reason: "So that I can make a sound whenever I walk around and keep you awake while you work."<br>romantic reason: "to keep your erections for yourself and let your desire be a burden on my feet"<br><br>She told him in secret: "why should I see your erection when the very height of my heels gives me pain whenever I walk around?"<br><br>she told him some more: "every inch taller is every inch deadlier to the foot..I wear black to keep your mouth shut"<br><br>Q: Why do you wear a decorative ring?<br>A: To mesmerize you and keep you away from me..why do you insist on ignoring me?? I must wear these things as a reason for what you do to me..<br><br>Moral of the story: A woman's life is to carry a burden for the males around her.<br><br>Attractive a woman can look, but her capacity for pain can be great, that alone is a strong reason to carry on living.<br></div>
