            <div class='col-md body'>Lost Hope<br>original story by AngelDark<br><br>Once there was a couple living on a hill. That hill was a long distance away from the town, and the path towards town was filled with wild animals. These made it nearly impossible for the couple to get supplies, so the lived off what they planted, and  were often suffering in poverty.<br><br>**********************************************************<br><br>The king of that nearby town, Richard II, was aware of the poverty happening around the town. However, he was too obsessed in gambling at the arena, fooling around with women in the palace, and sleeping his time away to care about the citizens.<br><br>**********************************************************<br><br>Prince Victor had a dream, a dream of letting the citizens help to make the town prosperous, and having peace in the countries boundries. He was aware of the fact that the people were suffering, but he had no power to do anything.<br><br>***********************************************************<br><br>Then came one day, the couple, Mr and Mrs Jones, chanced upon a runaway stallion of the king's stables. It was badly injured from the attacks of the wild animals in the Forest of Illusions.<br><br>Mr Jones spoke to his spouse, "By the Gods, what have we here? A stallion from the King's Castle? And look, it is wounded by the wretchet beasts in the forest."<br>"Really, oh dear me! We must attend to it's wounds fast, I fear that the King will not be very happy to know that his steed has run away to our humble cottage and got into such a aweful condition."<br><br>And so, the stallion, by the name of Bruce, stayed at the Jones cottage for a while.<br><br>***********************************************************<br><br>"WHAT!? MY FAVOURITE STALLION RAN AWAY?! WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE GUARDS? WERE ALL OF YOU FOOLS ASLEEP DURING GUARD DUTY? FIND MY STEED AND I SHALL OFFER A HANDSOME REWARD TO WHOEVER FINDS IT."<br><br>The frightened soldiers spoke in a trembling voice, "Yes sire, right away sir."<br><br>*************************************************************<br><br>End of part 1<br><br>------------------<br>Darkness fills my heart with lead, letting me carry an eternal burden for the rest of my life.<br>Only you can lift the lead in my heart, break the spell of darkness and bring me out into the loving light that you shine on me...</div>
