            <div class='col-md body'>I was attached just before I came to the UK. She could make me smile just by being there. She could make me think, share and feel with such ease that I truly felt like putty in her hands. We'd both been in relationships before but no one touched us the way we did each other. I never believed in soul mates until she came along. She played a huge part in my initial lack of desire to come here, and I was content to go through the local system, i.e. from JC to NUS etc. But when the scholarship was offered it was too good an opportunity to miss. I knew that and so did she though we never brought it up in our late night talks at Holland V. ItÂ’s all going to work out, we concluded; a better future, life in the fast lane and good salary. Cut and dried we thought. She, being a flight stewardess, would see me regularly whenever she had London routes. The first year was a series of late night meetings and short holidays in Gloucester Hotel. Confidence grew and life was brighter than ever. And then the offer from an American university for her came. The unspoken hysteria grew. Instead of seeing each other 4 or 5 times a year working with SQ, we would now be completely apart for at least 4 years. I forget how many Â‘we can work through itÂ’ talks we had. Mad brainstorming for ways and means to cling on to each other grew more fruitless with each passing day. At the back of our minds we both knew neither of us had the stamina for it. Even soul mates need to hold each other ever so often. It was not a dreadful or dramatic breakup. It was slow and lingering. The emails dwindled and the love letters dried up. Like your favourite music fading away, we also faded into silence.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 03 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am seriously wondering if all this is just Terence's effort to get a date with me.<br><br>.......<br>One day she went home from playing (not a play) and found her uncle's Land Rover in front of the house.  Her mom and Mom's brother were loading clothes and knicks knacks from their home into the car.  "Mom," she said, "are we going to stay for a long time in Uncle's place?"  She was told it's going to be a one-week stay.  She was so excited with the unexpected trip that she spent her one week allowance on snacks from home to be enjoyed later in uncle's place.<br><br>Few weeks later they were still not home.  Sensing something was amiss she did not ask anyone why were they staying for so long there and why it looked like it's going to be a permanent stay.  Daddy started to visit them!  He came, played with the kids, talked with Mom and Uncle and Aunt and Grandpa but he always went home alone.  But she was still afraid to ask questions because nobody seemed inclined to enlighten her.<br><br>One day after school she walked to her old house.  She used the key she had taken from Mom's bag and got in.  There were new furnitures inside.  A neighbour later told her that her dad had rented the place to a family and he himself lived in his mother's place.  She believed that.<br><br>Time went by.  Uncle's family was feeling the effects of putting up relatives in their place.  Aunty went on weekly raids to make sure the room she, her little sis, her mom and her granpa shared was always tidy.  And Aunty loves throwing things away.  She grew to hate this intrusion on her private belongings, she grew to hate Aunty, but what could she do, it's not their house.  So she cried but tried to hide the tears because there were no excuse for crying, no one could make it better.<br><br>One day, after Dad's visit, she found a piece of bill bearing an unfamiliar address.  It was as if all the pieces came together and she realized that Dad must have remarried and *that* was why Mom left!  She thought seriously about visiting the address but Mom then started to drop hints about Dad's whereabouts.  She would told her, "Give your Dad some chocolate.  He said your little brother loves it."  "So I had a half brother." she thought.  She wanted to know more but she did not want to hurt Mom,  so she fished for information.  On the way home from house-hunting she asked Mom deliberately.  "Later, when we moved to a new house, can I hang a 'Home sweet Home' plate on the door?" and Mom snapped.  "Your dad has gotten himself another wife!"  The rest of the trip was quiet.<br><br>It turned out that the new wife had been a much frequent visitor of Dad when he was hospitalized after a working accident.  He married her maybe because she loved her more than Mom ever did.  Or maybe Dad married her because she was pregnant and how lucky he was, their firstborn is a <strong>son</strong>.  Suppose she were a boy instead, would Dad have stayed?  Suppose she felt the cracks in their home earlier could she have mended it?  Does he love her and her young sis, did he know they were going to be separated if he remarried?  Does he love them at all or he wanted a son more?<br><br>For Mom's sake she took the news gracefully like it was an ordinary occurence and she did not feel the hurt.  After a while Dad started to take his daughters to <span style="font-style: italic;">his</span> house to meet The Mrs.  He told them to call her <strong>Mama</strong>.  Her sis would not do that so she kept very quiet.  She herself tried to avoid the circumstances when she had to call The Mrs.  anything at all.<br>.......<br><br>Since I'm pretty sure I can get Terence to date me no matter what  :p, I don't feel the compulsion to win this competition.  I'm glad to say that the sis has not grown into a taciturn young lady, instead she became smarter than her peers because she has seen more.  The girl herself is all grown up, too.  She consoles herself with the thought that Mom and Dad never really match anyway.  And she knew why they got married, too, why Mom, a Chinese, married Dad wearing a muslim ceremonial clothes in Dad's home.  They got married eight months before her birthday.<br><br>Cheers, Terence, cheers, everyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then he saw her. To say that she was beautiful would have been<br>an understatement. She nearly took his breath away again.<br><br>"I'm sorry" he said. He hated sounding so lame.<br><br>"I am Lisa St Claire" she said, proffering him her hand in a manner in which he was not sure if he should shake it or kiss<br>it. "And you must be Jack Conrad, I have been really looking forward to meeting you".<br><br>Jack, still uncertain of what to do with the hand, just touched<br>her fingers lightly and bowed ever so slightly. Her touch sent a frisson of electricity down his spine. He was not sure how long<br>he would have just stood there feeling like a complete idiot, if she had not grasped him by the arm and said, "Shall we go in, Mr Conrad".<br><br>He had not been prepared for St Claire's wife to be so young,<br>beautiful or even so sexy. There was no doubt in his mind or body for that matter that she turned him on. 'Not now!' he told<br>himself, as he glanced nervously at the two dobermans. He tried<br>to pull his suit jacket down to cover himself up a bit more and<br>realised he should say something.<br><br>"Please", he said, "call me Jack."<br><br>"Of course", she said, "Jack it is, until I can think up a suitable nickname for you. You may call me Madam. Everyone here<br>does."<br><br>Jack was confused. What a strange nickname. He decided that the<br>rich just had strange habits, and that if he wanted to impress<br>his boss's wife and get that promotion, he would play along.<br><br>They entered the main hallway, where Lisa St Claire let go of his arm.<br><br>"Landers will show you to a room where you can freshen up a bit before dinner. Shall we say fifteen minutes. The dining room is<br>over there. Don't worry about your things I will have them taken care of."<br><br>Jack memorised the door she had pointed to. He did not want to<br>make any more of a fool of himself than he had already done. He<br>presumed they would show him his room later, because it was<br>already getting late for dinner. So he followed Landers along a<br>small passage way and disappeared from sight.<br><br>Lisa watched him go. 'This is going to be a weekend you will<br>never forget Jack Conrad' she smiled wickedly at her own<br>thoughts, and then headed for the dining room.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Headmistress Thorpe was on her way to her husband's office when she heard muffled sounds that appeared to come from a seldom used staircase. She quietly walked up and peared around the corner. There was nobody on the flight leading up. Trying to avoid making noise with her 5 inch heels, she inches closer to the flight leading down. She was frozen in her tracks when she saw Julie kneeling with her outstreched mouth around a huge penis, she also had both hand around the 8 or so inches she couldn't fit in her mouth. She was panicked because she coudln't recognize the mounstrous veiny organ. Besides, why was this duo hiding in the recesses of the school while there are comfortable designated areas for sponsors to be fellated. She leaned forward over the railing to see Mr. Ashbury, one of the older and wealthiest sponsors. The 65 year old man slowly placed both his hands on the back of the young girl's head and grabbed her blond hair. Julie, who until then had her eyes closed while she was lovingly sucking 4 inches of the man gigantic tool in and out of her mouth, looked up at him with a smile in her eyes. "You're such a good girl, Julie", he said as he tugged slightly at her head. He then held her head tighly and sighed. Julie closed her eyes and concentrated on rapidly swallowing the thick ejaculate that started flowing over her tongue.<br><br>All this time, Headmistress Thorpe was looking on in amazement. While the sight of a well endoyed man spewing cum into her docile student's mouthes always made her horny, she had just stumbled on a scandalous happening. She had to intervein. The young first year student was swallowing rapidly and opened her eyes to check on her generous<br>provider. Out of the corner of her eye she spotted Ms. Thorpe. The girl's eyes grew wide and she lost the concentration needed to swallow Mr. Ashbury's prodoginous seed. She wimpered and shook her head but could not dislodge the large spewing member from her mouth. Gobs of semen came out of her nose while she tried to get away from the<br>ejaculating man.<br><br>Headmistress Thorpe interviened on behalf of Julie and freed her from the old man who was in such extasy he didn't even know what was going on. Headmistress Thorpe grabbed the poor girl by the arm and pulled her to her feet. "So this is what you've been hiding for the past few months" She scolded at Asbury pointing to his still ejaculating penis. "Brent, I will immeditly report this to the board!" she said "It is completly innapropriate for you to pray on first year students. I've know you for 15 years Brent and I knwo this is not your usual form." She continued pointing to his still jetting and spewing cock.<br>"How long have you been taking Ejaccyn and more importantly where does it come from?"<br><br>Brent Ashbury was out of breath and didn't offer an answer, he just smiled because as a senior sponsor for over 35 years, he had enough clout to be forgiven most of his indiscretions.<br><br>Headmistress Thorpe turned to Julie who was trying to get back all the semen that  came out of her mouth before it hit any part of her uniform. "And you, young girl you are definatly in trouble!" She grabbed the girl by the hand and left for her husband's office, leaving  Brent Ashbury in the staircase with semen stains all over his expensive pants.</div>
