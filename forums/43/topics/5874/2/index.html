            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my entry for your competition:<br><br>The diary of a dying geek<br>-------------------------<br>I was having the worst of days in my life, living on this pathetic island where the people are simply doing stupid things. Unfortunately, I was made to do a stupid thing by my girlfriend. She threatened to break up with me and go with that long haired bloke with his Harley-Davidson motorbike  if I do not do her bidding. According to her, that guy is cooler than me, always ask intriguing questions like "What is sex, masterbation for male and females, womens mensuration period?" and so forth. I could not oppose her, otherwise she would sleep with him the next night. So, I have succumbed to her emotional hijacking and decided to do it. When I was doing it, it was really a pain in the ass. Apparently, we have to do it in the public, and because of my pathetic geek side body, I was pushed and pulled around like a punching bag. Worse, I was beaten up because I tried to learn Kung Fu in the internet. When I finally did the job, I finally walked to show my gf that I have gotten it for her, that i prove my undying geek love for her. She just said,"You are just a pathetic fool, and I have just slept with that man..." To my horror, it is the knife which stabbed into my heart.. She took the thing which I asked to get from her and said that she will never see me again. *sobsob* I stood in the rain at the same position for hours, until I suffer a terrible fever of 40 degrees celsius and a bad cough... Now, I am dying on my deathbed, writing my diary because of pneumonia. I hope that I will be remembered to be the most romantic geek ever for queueing up for a stupid Hello Kitty doll...<br><br>signed<br>A Hello Kitty collector's geek boyfriend<br><br>------The End -------<br><br>Well, now I can think of what to write for my next installment, after a warm up here...</div>

Originality<br>2. Pain-level (I'm an expert in pain so I can ascertain the levels experienced)<br>3. For Godsake - Grammatically sound writing!!!<br>4. Must leave a sense of wisful romantic echoing that lingers in the heart of the reader.<br>5. No f**king porn!<br>6. Sex scenes should not be graphic (any half-wit can be crude). They should be interpreted with a DH Lawrencian flavour - implicit of passion yet explicit on its profoundity on the human spirit.<br><br>(Maya: you can add more if you wish).<br><br>For the female prize winner, this awaits you...a specially written poem for you, dinner at Compass Rose, dancing, wine, scintilating conversation and a 'late night' bonus if things go well.....<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok for your sake, Maya, I just gotta make a fool of myself.<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><br>She is sitting there, looking at me as I came walking thru the door. I smiled, walk over and introduced myself.<br><br>"Hi, My name is Callan, I'm here to pick up the flims that are supposed to be ready today."<br><br>" Callan? errmmm, Pardon me but where are you from, I am not that sure as I'm new here."<br><br>She smiled that innocent smile, one so captivating, so unforgrtable.<br><br>"Oh! No wonder I have not seen you before. I'm from XX press. So when did you start working here?"<br><br>"Today's my first day." She smiled again. "Isn't XX press In Delta, and you came all the way here!?"<br><br>"Yup, no choice, the prices are lower here. So I think I will see you around often, yes?"<br><br>"Yup, and by the way my name is Kate." Smile again.<br><br>Kate, a name that lingers on my mind for days, a name I doubt it will ever be erase from my memory for this life. Sparks flew, romance came, and soon we were an item.<br><br>The night was humid, we laid in each other arms, one of the few things we like to do together most.<br><br>"Kate, do you think we would ever be together? I meant really togehter, you know live together, have kids, watch each other get older?"<br>I ran my fingers thru her hair, so silky, so smooth.<br><br>"You mean get married?!?" I was surprised by the bewildered look on her face. I am not sure if it was surprise or disgust that she is feeling.<br><br>"Well, yes if you put it that way." I tried to sound neutral and indifferent to it.<br><br>"I dun know, it was never on my mind before this. Anyway, you still have yet to build your career yet. You know what I like about you?" She said as she is sitting up.<br><br>I continued to look at her eyes, hoping to find the answer. To me, it's like the wisdom of the universe is in there.<br><br>"I like the way you think about your future, I like the way you plan your life for bigger things in life. You are an ambitious person, so keep it that way." She did not wait for my answer to come.<br><br>I nodded, just like a little boy. I always feel helpless before her. Maybe it's the fact that she is 2 years older than me. Maybe it's because I treasure her too much. Maybe it's just because I'm in love....<br><br>She is quiet today. Something on her mind. I know, but I dun know what.<br><br>"Kate, is anything wrong?" I asked.<br><br>"Nothing." A simple reply to a simple question.<br><br>"You want to go and have some dessert? Cheese Cake?"<br><br>She didn't seem to hear me.<br><br>"How about some Tiramitsu? We can go to Hilton."<br><br>"Callan, we need to talk." I anticipated that. She continued, "I dun think, we should carry on."<br><br>"You not feeling well? Did you go to a doctor? I can sent you...."<br><br>"Callan, I meant breakup...." Soft and meek might her voice be, it was like a bomb to me.<br><br>"WHAT?!?" I was stunned but quickly recompose myself. "Is anything wrong? Something at work? I understand how you feel, You want to share...."<br><br>"Callan....Stop." She is now looking at me so intensely. "There is nothing wrong at work, nor anything else, it's just me." She paused. I keep quiet.<br><br>"It's Jeff" She finally broke the silence. "Who is that?!?" I am confused. "Joseph, XX Adverts." I kind of recall the name. But it was foggy. I choose to remain silent.<br><br>"He proposed." That was it. I blew myself. "WAHT DO YOU MEAN HE PROPOSED?!? YOU WANT TO MARRY HIM?!? IF THIS IS A JOKE YOU ARE CARRYING IT TOO FAR!"<br><br>She started to sob. I knew I frightened her. I have not shouted at her before. She was too good to be treated like that. I tried to cool my head, Nothing but hot air came in.<br><br>"So?... I am waiting for an explanation. I think you at least owe me that." I mellowed.<br><br>"I met him, he didn't know about you. He was nice. It just started like that." She is not making sense, so unlike her, I must have really frighten her.<br><br>"Ok, so what? What started?" I am denying myself.<br><br>"We went out. He is really nice....... I MADE A MISTAKE, OK?! BUT SPARE ME, OF THIS TORTURE! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!" That's what my gal is like, so strong minded, never will she allow herself to break down infront of me. I think she is losing it. I turned and leave.<br><br>I could not sleep. I dun want to go back home. There's just all these flashback in my mind. I just sat there, alone in the night, alone in the park, nothing but my thoughts to accompany me. I feel so alone. I finally got tired of the loneiness, and decided to sleep in hope that I find something in my sleep.<br><br>I did not go to school, nor to work. I took leave, I switch of my beeper. I do not want to face anyone, with my failure. I closed the door of the chalet, and did not open it for 3 days.<br><br>Ring...Ring... "Hello....Hello?".......drooo...<br><br>I knew it was her. It is the 5th time this week. I have cool down alot since the "cold turkey" chalet. My logical nature did not allow me to dwell on my mistakes for too long. I decided to look for her.<br><br>She is sitting in front of me, looking down, playing with her own fingers. For once she looks like a little gal to me.<br><br>"How is the preparation going on?" I spoke first.<br><br>"It is fine." came the short reply<br><br>"You called me?" She nodds quietly.<br><br>"What for?" I prompted.<br><br>"I need a favour from you...." She paused to think. "Can you keep this down? Jeff still doesn't know about you and me. ANd I dun think it will be good for him to know."<br><br>"I will not tell, but I am not sure about the others..."  Trying to find an excuse.<br><br>"They do not know about it yet, and those who do promised not to tell." She stopped me. "It's you I worry about."<br><br>"What about the wedding?!?" I am confused.<br><br>"We will be migrating to Aus. The wedding will be there." She explained.<br><br>"When will that be?"<br><br>"A few more months, once the papers are ready.... Callan......I would like my things back."<br><br>"What things?!?" Again confused.<br><br>"My photographs...things I left at your place. Just to be safe..." She smiled that smile again.<br><br>She never fails to surprise me. I expected myself to be the one in control. But again she conquered me with her demure aura.<br><br>"I'll take it with me the next time we meet."<br><br>"Just leave it at my house, my mum will be there."<br><br>"Ok..." I am dissapointed.<br><br>That was the last time I spoke to her face to face. Last thing I heard, all went well, and she has since migrated to Australia. Never heard from her. And now thinking back, I should have kept a pic of her, to remember her by. She is becoming foggy to me and most probably I only remember her name and that smile of hers in a few years time.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Please note that the names in the story are mostly not real(except for mine) to protect their identity and no reference should be made to anyone in particular.</span><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 06 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True Heartwarming story....<br><br>In Bedok there lives an old ah por about 86 years old. She has been living in an old people's home for the past 10 years ever since her hubby died. Her only daughter is in America and does not come home much to visit her. Despite her age and athritas, she remembers the time during the war when under japanese occupation when times were hard. Her husband was part of the Singapore Volunteer Defence force that operated behind enemy lines. In short a proud old lady.<br>Most of her friends are dead and no one visits. Her only enjoyment coming from an old radio she had from the forties that still receives signals. This was a present from her hubby after the war. Well one day it broke and she started crying and felt lonely. In her next room lived another old lady who had a radio but would not share it with her. Day after day she would just sit around waiting for some form of entertainment.. nothing came until some kind hearted staff bought her a brand new radio... she was overjoyed. After some time though the other old lady became frail and in turn her radio broke also. Seeing that her "companion" had no radio, ah por went gently up to her taking her new radio. "Do you wish to share my radio?", she asks the old lady. The old lady with tears in her eyes looks at ah por with pitiful eyes and mutters "yes!... thank you" and begins to sob. Ah Por then whispers into her ear.... "why don't you fuck off"</div>
