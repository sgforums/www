Slick back hairand slightly oversized clothing.<br><br>Background:<br>Ounkeo was  anomral boy who grew up under normal circumstances until one day his village was attacked by the hordes of demi-godlike priest fighters.  Noone knew why they came or from where they came...but one thing that impressed upon young ounkeo was that they took no prisoners...and being the onli surviver from his village, voiwed to take revenge upion yonder demi-godlike hordes(sounds familiar?)<br><br>he later worked himself up the ranks of the powerful conglomerate Starhut(which dedicates itself to ridding the world of it;'s compettiton..namely from it's immediate ones...the Paiser priesthood), where he was eevntually taught the skills of combat and the ways of the Priest Fighters.  His job called him to investigate rumours of zealous paiser priests and the cult of kai, or bungCornHole(some of the many names that the group runs under)....He investigates and delivers reports and is not actually involved with activities against the cults.<br><br>But recenly Ounkeo has been getting restless after the incident where he was almost killed by 10 priests...he blacked out and rememebred seeing a mysterious woman walking away from him before he totally blacked out.<br><br>Since then he has dedicated his life to finding this woman who had helped him to repay her kindness while simultaneously taking a more active role in fighting the cults and priest hordes....<br><br>HE became a one man show...a lonewolf who increasingly became very anti social. He took upon him the name: FLYWIRE, and now runs freelance work for Starhut while he hunts down his sworn enemies.<br><br>But one thing is that Flywire considers himself a neutral party and fights only when necessary to change the balnce of powers even though he has sworn himslef to destrouy the cults of priests.<br><br>Flywire has few friends and many enemies.  Even the Gods themselves fight against this manling because iof his envious ability which was imbue upon him by, some say, the mystery Goddess Errie-chick, babe of the underworld.<br><br>PriestFighter Level:<br>Level 6, but has been shown to be able to temproarily increase levels to almost godlike proportions for short instances of time...this power seems to be involuntary and comes and goes when it pleases. but by in large he is a nomral man and gets his as skick 4 out of 6 times in battles...<br><br>special abilities:<br>after the near death experience, flywire now has the uncanny ability to slow down time to a crawl for a few seconds and has learned to fight and take advantage of this ability to defeat foes who would otherwise pulverise his bespectaclaed face.<br><br>He has also been imbued with the title of THE MAN WHO WALKS AMONG GODS because of his ability to manhandle Godlike beings like no normal human could.</div>

Spurned by society and tired of losing in all areas of life, these geeks finally found solace in a forum, where fellow losers come together in a mass orgy of ego-masturbation. All the female characters are beautiful and stunning with cup Ds, nevermind if they are pock-marked or scar-faced, flat as a runway or ugly as hell in real life. Here in sgforumsia, they are all beautiful pple. heh heh. one thing that's the same whether in real life or here though, is that all the characters are mongoloids.<br><br>People, this is a very sad bunch of losers indeed and they deserve our sympathies.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Callan,<br><br>Well, I can't do anything because everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Well, I am just writing for fun, and provide an interactive storyboard for people here. If it is interpreted as a ego trip, then there is nothing which I can do..<br><br>Well, Kallen has entered into the story, and I just finished the latest episode... As for villains, I have a big list of them... Just wonder how to use them.... Afterall, I don't think Prodigal is a good guy or anyone so far in the story are good guys...<br><br>Hi, MayaJade :<br>Mayar has finally made her appearance in the story, and together with Kallen, met Valentine, the daughter of Prodigal and Runoa... Well, the story had finally just begun...<br><br>Hi, Cluon :<br>Well, I have already thought of a story for Cluon. He would take a major role after this story. Well, I have to say that Prodigal was not actually a nice guy before he abandoned his responsibility and become a prodigal. You would see the wrong things he did. That is what I want to show, there is no such thing as a truly good guy. The world is not black or white, but filled with shades of grey....<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 10 February 2000).]</div>

Well, I would fit the 3ft troll part into the story and perhaps some of the characters in the story, which would provide a twist to the story. It would put the Torrants-Mayar r/s into a test. Well, everyone is looking forward to their love-making scene. I have to make it filled with obstacles, until it would look worthwhile to come to that part.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well  Cluon:<br><br>For the time being, at least for the Part II story, I am still able to cope, except for a love-making scene between Mayar and Torrants. Wel, I have designated a villainess to turn you into a troll, and it is none other than the Hallo Kathy. By all means, you get your sister to join in in the creative writing forum if it is ever formed soon.... I think I will need help when it comes to Part III, because I would be centering  my lead characters (well, for once, Prodigal, Runoa, Mayar and Torrants would not be taking centrestage)  in a city battle, a web of intrigue, and a war between the cults. In the process, I am thinking of a subplot for Kallen, and I was thinking of using Lexinnle for that romantic part...<br><br>Stay tuned...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
