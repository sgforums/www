            <div class='col-md body'>A note from the author :<br>------------------------<br>After writing 3 installments of the series, it has occurred to me that I have too many characters which I have to develop. This thread will be a supplement thread and it will be updated with the characters and the background setting of the story.<br><br>The original aim of the story was to write a parody to the current Universe of Sgforums. However, the author has subsequently discovered that he can add some philosophy, drama and what so ever field be it science and social science stuff into the story to enrich the audience. Of course, I would have to say that I was much inspired by Neil Gaiman, Roger Zelazny, JMS, and many authors which I have read. In the following posts to come in this thread, I will follow up with an explicit explanation of the background of the cyber-Universe, the virtual world of Sgforumsia, the island city Eropagins, and the characters in the world, which are the leading characters, supporting characters, and other entitites. May you enjoy this companion guide as to understand how the evolution of the characters would go in the story.... Readers can join in to contribute on some of the characters or make the story evolve as it goes along... Well, the first 2 threads are far back, but if anyone wants it, I will repost it in one full thread..... Anyone can add commentaries on why I actually name some places in some manner... There is a way which I did it.... *evil snigger*....<br><br>Happy Reading....<br><br>I am sure that everyone will be waiting for the next installment of the series...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Background of the Story :<br><br>The year is the beginning of 2000, after the end of the so-called millenium, when the devil has failed to find his wife, and the world did not end. The infinite cyberspace has just begun to continue to expand into the big universe by the use of world wide web (WWW).<br><br>It is the year of fire, the year of sorrow, the year where there is a great war in the world of Sgforumsia. Yet it is a new age. From the entities to the humans and to the little creatures, Sgforumsia was a small continent in the midst of the World Wide Web. Chef is the current emperor of the empire and have the mandate of the gods of cyberspace. His imperial troops are powerful enough to quell any rebellion.<br><br>Of course, near Sgforumsia, there is a small island city called Eropagins, where it hosts a 3 million population. However, the recent years, Sgforumsia were filtered by many factions of power, ranging from the self-proclaimed high brow intellectuals, to the cult leaders and to the other people who wander to give their peace of mind.<br><br>The first conflict dated from the war unleashed by the cult leader Karhole who antagonized the orthodox religions and the unorthodox religions. The various cult factions whom he declared as morons raised against him, namely the 2 androids Paiser I and II, Jane Wang (the grandmother or father if you consider sex change of 2 cyber punks by the name of bad beng marks and Kao Lin gal), Duck, and etc.... The arena was about to be infested with blood and mayhem. However, the rebellion was quelled by Chef in a decisive action to use the weapon bestowed by the gods of cyberspace, the thread killer!!!! With the Thread Killer, the imperial troops sent all the cult factions to Liaj with the exception of Karhole to New Yoke, and Jane Wang to Woodbridge hospital.<br><br>The war was witnessed by 5 of the characters of the story, namely prodigal (whose origin is unknown), Torrants, Bish the god of war, Ack and Dakar. At the end of the first war, Torrants was granted the manifestation of Time, where he sought to use his powers to rescue his lover who was cursed by an evil demoness from Hell... Bish was called to duty as there were unrest in the island city of Eropagins, where people are fighting over some dolls sold by some famous fast food restaurant called MacKaralds.. It was soon realized that it was the plot of a evil demoness called Hello Kathy, and she is hatching a plot to summon the God of War and the new God of Time, for reasons unknown. The prodigal was caught in the intrigue of the war. However, his role was yet to be determined. So, what is this big cosmic game which everyone is involved?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Characters of the Story : the Heroes<br><br>Prodigal<br>--------<br>The first protagonist of the story. A mysterious person in Sgforumsia where no one knows where he came from and who he was. Just know that he appears in a black trench coat, and wear a pair of sunshades, and exhibit powers that are beyond man. He is the most secretive of all. The only thing we know so far is that he has a soulmate called Ruona.<br><br>Torrants<br>--------<br>The other protagonist of the story, who is a handsome dude, whom all the gals would cat-call or yearn for in life. He was a powerful harpist, who could charm many with his soothing music, better than the popstars... However his heart is destined for a woman called Mayar, who was cursed by a demoness from Hell because of jealousy over a sad story competition he started years back. He was undoubtedly a good thinker and writer, with a few offensive insults to morons most of the time. His lover had disappeared before the day of the wedding. Ever since then, he searched high and low for her... He was awarded the manifestation of Time, and now he was going to be involved in a new conflict against the demoness plaguing the island city of Eropagins with the God of War.<br><br>Bish, the God of War<br>--------------------<br>Otherwise, the manifestation of war. Known to be a brute warrior in shining armour, but with his array of weapons ranging from simple halberds to machine guns. His duty is to preside over the wars, where his counterpart Peace would take over after the destruction caused by him. He was the god of conflicts, and a good friend of Torrants, and got him the job as the New Time... His powers are known to be destructive, just below the Continuum, the Creator (or God), Devil, and the Endless.... Nevertheless, he is the man with a good sense of humor and a taste for beers and wines...<br><br>Dakar<br>-----<br>The observer of the story. It is rumoured that he is the god of parties. He presides over drinks and food such that he is always seen everywhere, watching others' happiness and misery with his good popcorn and good beer... He is nevertheless a important character in time to come. However, he needs to get more involved.<br><br>Ack<br>---<br>The highpriest of Karhole cult, did not get involved in the first war. His motivations are unknown, but it would be reveal in time to come.....<br><br>Mayar<br>-----<br>The beloved bride to be for Torrants, but was cursed by the Evil demoness called Hello Kathy by an act of jealously, her whereabouts are unknown presently, and it is known that she is hiding somewhere so that her curse would cause famine and destruction to the people around her. Rumours that the Devil Lucifer S.A.Tan had interest in taking her as the bride....<br><br>Runoa<br>-----<br>The soulmate of Prodigal, but have not appeared in the story... However, it is known that she is the manifestation of Love....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course, if there are heroes, there are the villains as well :<br><br>Hallo Kathy<br>-----------<br>The ruthless demoness from hell, who seduced many of the people in the world of Sgforumsia. Her voodoo dolls had caused great violence and was presently leading Eropangis into self-destruction. Her plans were greater than that. Her consort is Dear Donald, but was henpecked poet... She had presently many minions, including the deprived kids named Pokkamon, Benggal and Cguy, and some other people.. Waterwire was a poor guy who fell for her charms, but was caught in the act...<br><br>Karhole<br>-------<br>Great Cult Leader who abused the knowledge of whatever he reads, starting from the bible to Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations", however, his attempts to control the Sgforumsia was destroyed by the many factions who opposed him followed by the emperor's quelling of the empire. However, his influence in the inner circle of Sgforumsia has granted him asylum in New York. A self-proclaimed sexy idol, who constantly flirts with young babes... He is nevertheless the most hidden villain of the day... But whether he would become the most popular villain in town is yet to be seen... He has a great band of followers who believed in his second coming....<br><br>Jane Wang<br>---------<br>An old pervert who turned into a woman after a sex change accident. He/She is nevertheless bitter over the popularity of Karhole and declared her wars against him... Presently locked up in Woodbridge and wrote low and sad porn stories which everyone spit and puke on... The Aunty of the Bad-Beng-Marks and Kao Lin gal, and her followers include Benggal, who loved posting perverted stuff on nothing but sex... She is a great sex exponent, together with her faction of minions....<br><br>more to come....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As the first part entitled "In the Beginning" which consist of the first 6 episodes of the story is coming to an end, it would be appropriate to talk about the next part of the story. The first part of the epic would end with the battle in Hell by dealing a little with the sexy cult leader Karhole in the first 2 episodes and the demoness Hallo Kathy in the last 4 episodes, where the Prodigal, Bish and Torrants battled against S.A. Tan and Hallo Kathy finally in hell. In the next story, we would have Runoa, Clone (who have already talked about his life story in the earlier story), Dakar, Ack and etc. Anyone who are interested in the 2nd part of the story, please follow up on this thread and give an introduction to your character description.... The theme of the first story centred on the freedom of speech, heaven and hell (in the last 2 episodes), tolerance of people's views and the 2nd story which I have already decided on, is the theme on love...<br><br>The search continues....<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 08 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Cluon :<br>Thanks for the latest addition to the story. You will be scheduled for a fighting sequence soon in the story. I am thinking in the line of the movie "The Matrix".<br><br>To Terence :<br><br>S.A. Tan is the broken up version of the Devil's name... I just thought that if I use Natasha, it will be infringing the copyrights of Piers Anthony. So I came up with my own version. Actually I have read the first 2-3 books of Immortality series on Death and Time....</div>
