            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bishamon, the God of War,<br><br>Well, in view of so many characters, I have to start planning for future stories. Hence in this episode, I would center on Prodigal, Runoa, Torrants, Mayar, Kallen, Clone, Hallo Kathy, and one or two more villains.<br><br>Dakar, you and Cluon would take centrestage for the next story with Flywire, Lexinnie and a couple of characters like Jane Wang, Ack and Karhole.. It would based on something like gang wars. I might need to find a co-author for this to see how this goes...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I have received the love scene from Mayar and Terence, and have started edited in the background. However, because I am against censorship board in Singapore, hence I would now post the original version and do some touchups when I link this portion to my story in the next few episodes to come. Meanwhile enjoy the Valentine's special by two of our great couples. Both Rinoa and I enjoyed the piece of work as we have read it....<br><br>[start of their story]<br><br>The meadow was filled with the fragrant smell of some strange flower.  It was midday, yet the distant sun of the Faerie Land merely cast a gentle light on the lands.  A lone woman sat on the grass with her nose buries in a posy of red blooms.  She was Mayar, the exiled purple-haired ex mermaid.<br><br>Suddenly a note pierced the tranquility of the meadow.  Mayar lifted her head and blinked in disbelief.  She strained her ears to catch that familiar and beloved sound again.  The meadow grew absolutely quiet.  It seemed that everything else was waiting for the note to sound again. Then it began, the most beautiful music the land had ever heard. [overhere fill in the sound a harp makes...i'm not sure =)]<br><br>Ripples of motion swept across the meadow. At first, when the notes were soft, the flowers swayed just slightly and the wind could hardly be felt. As the music increased in volume the land became more animated and fluffs of red and purple flowers whirl in the air.  At the centre of the ripples the fluffs gathered around an undistinct (issit the word?) shape.  It gradually morphed into a figure of a man.  Mayar hitched her skirt (to expose her lovely, silken, sexy, sexy legs?) and ran like a wild woman across the meadowwhile mouthing his name over and over again: "Torrents, Torrents".<br><br>When they touched the land descended into quiet again.  Torrents pulled Mayar into his arms and at that moment their lives felt complete.  Mayar hid her face in the crook of his neck and leaned on his lithe and powerful body. She could feel his strength emanated from his beautiful form and she absorbed it to salve her wounded heart.  He marvelled that she always smelt like seabreeze and he found himself helplessly enconsed in her yielding softness.<br><br>"Torrents, Torrents, I waited for you for so long, I didn't know if you would ever find me..." Torrents stopped her, "Be quiet, my love, I am here."<br><br>She pulled back and for the first time saw him in close range.  Even though Torrents had discarded his tattered clothes after his battle with the Demoness, his wounds had not healed yet.  Mayar inspected them carefully and asked him about his adventure.  Torrents told her about his trip to hell and Prodigal's super-heroic effort to get her whereabout from S.A.Tan.<br><br>The sun had retreated when Torrents finished his recount.  They were now inside a bower hidden in the edge of the woods by the meadow.  The bower used to house a family of royal fairies but now it was lent to Mayar by<br>Queen Amanda.  Some fairy dust left in the room by the faeries cast an unearthly yet lovely glow in various corners of the secluded bower. Torrents lied down with his head on Mayar's lap.  She told him about her own misadventure and when she was done, they fell into a comfortable silence. They didn't say anything to each other, yet their eyes spoke volumes.  Mayar gazed into Torrents [fill in colour here] eyes and saw inside warmth and infinite understanding.  Overcome with surges of thender feelings she pulled<br>a flower from a long vase and traced the contours of his face with its smooth petals.  Torrents reached up with his hand and it soon lost itself in the silken purple strands of Mayar's hair.  he gave her a pull she did not need.  Bending low, Mayar's lips gently fell upon Torrent's waiting ones. It was but a short kiss but it acted like an ignition spark.  Mayar gently moved Torrents from her lap to the soft grass of the bower.  he reclined on the grass and she descended upon him once again. the layers of clothes were hastily and hungrily peeled off each other. the desire was so tangible they trembled with animal anticipation. Torrants, bare-bodied, looking like a demi-god in the summer sun, firmly lat Mayar on the floating scent of sweet due and lowered his head to her warm moist lips. Mayar half-opened her opulent lips, cherry red with innocence, raised her<br>head to meet his with the experience of a woman who knew what she wanted.<br><br>Torrants ran his hand through her hair, down to her ears, the nape of her neck and finally resting on her firm breasts. as he allowed his weight to rest on her, she reached to the back of his head and pulled him closer to<br>her cheek and began breathing heavily with unwanton desire. his muscles clenched, his body knotted and his touch became firmer and lost the gentleness of before, replaced by the instincts of a semi-god who wanted to<br>erupt. *hahahah* (anyway, where was i?) her body responded to his touch and caress. her hands fluttered across his back and down to his heavenly buttocks, exploring its cleavage as he explored hers. in a swift movement they became one. there was no one else in this  universe, only the hearts and loins of two metaphysical entities colliding with  unparalleled passion and vigour. from a gentle rocking to a rythmic pulsating dance, they moved in unision, every thrust and cry in beat with the tune only they both knew.<br>time ceased to exist. the minutes turned into hours, the hours into years and the years back into minutes again. and in a rainbow-like explosion of joy and cosmic pleasure, they felt the sky fall to the earth and the seas  shoot into the space it left behind. it was over; yet the taste and smell of the experience made it feel as though it never ended.<br><br>--------End of their love scene--------</div>
