Yeah.<br><br>2) You don't masturbate enough, and you get twisted wet dreams.<br><br>I remember there was this time when I dreamt of this girl and her dream coordinated with mine....hmm..<br></div>

I heard sounds, sounds of ghosts? i dont know. The show hasnt began yet, Everyone wanted to go to toilet, I wanted to get out. I tell them all to get out of the cinema, they wont listen. I walked away from my seat, approached a curtain, nudged it apart and saw another cinema, with sounds coming from there.<br><br>2) I am on a holiday tour on another country, I enter this ornament shop and saw this woman who is topless, she probably was the shop attendant. I look at her breasts, I felt aroused and wanted to make love to her, she runs away, i went into this room with shelves of ornaments, and then the door behind me was closed, i kicked my way out, ran out of the shop and rows of shophouses, and climbed a hill and heard the sounds of wolves, i look up and saw flame of the forest trees, images blending with a rice field, there in the middle was a scarecrow, waving its arms, adorned with a straw hat..i heard the sound again, i ran down the hill, sliding against the dirt path with my back, then i heard a voice which overlaid the entire dream "We walk for a great distance expecting some great prize, in the end.." I then visualise the image of a female dog, lying on the ground, licking its teats, and masturbating against a huge dark rock, from there i woke up.<br><br>Any input?</div></blockquote>Ok...here are my interpretation for your dream. It is only an indication of what MAY happen, not wat WILL happen, ok?<br><br>Dream 1: Sorrow, much worry<br><br>Dream 2: The sign of a treacherous friend who will tell many lies in order to bring discredit upon you.Enemies are waiting to ruin you. Physical disorders. Future worries, bitter disappointment. Loss of money.<br><br>Erm...dunno whether I should have told you this but you may choose to ignore it.<br><br>------------------<br>Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them.<br>If you do, they might break your heart..but if you dun, u might break theirs..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have read abt your dreams. IF u are interested in dreams interpretation, perhaps you would like to know that there are some New-Age books on this topic. U can find it in bookshops like books kinokuniya in Takashimaya under the new age section. However i must warn you, New-Age is .. as it says.. is rather NEW. Its not totally proven to be correct. There are a lot of ppl who are skeptical abt it. though i choose to believe it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
