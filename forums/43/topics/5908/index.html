            <div class='col-md body'>Thus Speak Prodigal<br>-------------------<br>Disclaimer : Same<br>Part II : The Search for True Love<br><br>Episode 13 (Epilogue) :<br>Message in a Bottle<br>-------------------<br>Now, we come back to London finally, where we last seen Prodigal and Runoa both passed through the intersection between Oxford Street and Regent Street.<br><br>The Prodigal walked along the streets and could not have found any more solace. There was a reason why he was here. He remembered that when he once took the human form, he had a very beautiful love story with a mortal woman. However, it had to end because Heaven forbid the love between a mortal and an Endless. Ever since his journey from Heaven, he was forever changed by the experience. He could not understand why he had to see the things which he had tried to avoid.<br><br>As the journey continued, crossing between alleys and streets, he had finally reached the Charring Cross station, where it connected to a beautiful and old Westminster bridge. As the Prodigal walked across the pathway towards the other side of the bridge, where the large Millenium wheel stood. It was a metallic wheel which was filled with capsules that gave people the sight for the whole of London. It was already evening by then as the beautiful violet and orange colourings of the sky induced by the setting sun. London was ever so beautiful with the proud River Thames. As the Prodigal turned back, the famous Big Ben clock tower were illuminated by the bright yellow spotlights, accompanied by the British Parliament where the House of Commons and House of Lords stood. Finally, he stood by the riverside, before the majestic County Building which was the former Greater London Council. The County building took the form of old roman design, with the large Doric columns that gave it a grand entrance. All that was over this side of the river were overtaken by commercialization. The Prodigal stood by the balustrade, with his hands on the handle as he gazed into the river. His heart was filled with feelings, mixed with love and hate, despair and hope, order and chaos. There were only 20 years from now before the End of Time would freeze the entire Universe. He knew that it was his responsibility to seek the cure and hopefully rescue both Mayar and Torrants who had disappeared from the void. Cold and chilly gusts of wind, swept across the river, and the Prodigal's scarf was fluttering across with him stood calm in the midst of running river. Just at this instant, he conjured something in the form of a bottle with a letter placed inside, and threw into the running river. Upon the bottle touched the river and flowed along the river, the Prodigal stood and continued his walk.<br><br>As the bottle slowly flowed into the river, passing into the various bridges that allowed the passages from one side to the other across the Thames. It finally came to a point where a beautiful dome was sighted. Runoa was standing before the Millenium Dome, as she saw the passing of sunset at Greenwich area. However, the little bottle which was emitted by the energies of an Endless soon found its way to Runoa's attention.<br><br>Without any effort, she used her powers to lift the bottle from the river and opened the bottle and read the contents. She was sure that it was linked to her lover, the Prodigal. As she looked through the contents slowly, and it read,<br><br>"Dear Celette,<br><br>I have written this last letter to you, before I would to set off to seek a remedy to the crisis that has cost the disappearance of my two friends, Mayar and Torrants. I do not know why I am standing here. Perhaps, I came back here to find back the memories, those memories which once meant so much to me.<br><br>Losing you was one of the most terrible thing  in my life as an Endless. It was my mistake to fall in love with you and made you lost your life. For all these years, I have abandoned my responsibilities, and worse, I have abandoned someone who have loved me so dear. My affair with you had hurt her yet she could forgive me.<br><br>Remember where we first met here in Westminster Bridge, where you were about to kill yourself because your lover had just passed away because of Devestation's jealously. Ironically now, I am standing here in the same position as you were the first time we met. When I write this letter from my heart, I am struggling with the ghost of someone I loved and lost. Love lost can never be found again. In this time, I can  understand the difficulties you were going through, and I realize how painful it must have been for you to move on and love me. Sometimes the grief in my heart is overwhelming, and even though I realized that we are parted between 2 realms, and that we will never see each other again. Still there is a part of me which seeks to hold on to you forever. It would not be difficult for me to do that because loving someone else might diminish my memories of you. Yet this is the paradox after I met you in Heaven and our conversation have told me what I felt all these while. It was so brief and meaningful yet it meant so much for me. Despite I miss you greatly, it's because of you that I don't dread the future. Since you were able to fall in love with me then, you have given me hope and faith to move on finally. You have taught me that it's possible to move forward in life after death, no matter how terrible your grief was to lose me. And in your own way, you've made me believe that true love cannot and never be denied.<br><br>After these times, I realized that I have come to love Ruona more than the love I could give you when we are together and she is the destined woman of my life. I have to fulfil my destiny. The appearance of my daughter from the future, had brought us together, and in the search of true love, we have found true love. After the restoration of Time, I would return and continue where both of us had left off.<br><br>You would always be a part of me, that part of me, which was now changed and I have assumed the responsibility of Hope again. This is not a goodbye, my love. It is to thank you for that moment in Heaven. I thank you for loving me and receiving my love in return. Thank you for all the memories I will cherish forever. But most of all, thank you for guiding me on the path that there finally come a time now when I can eventually let you go.<br><br>Perhaps, if I would to pass with the Universe someday, we would meet once again and restart from where we have stopped.<br><br>Love Always,<br>The Prodigal"<br><br>Runoa was touched by the letter, and slowly let the wind sent the letter away with the bottle into the river again. As she finished the letter, it was totally dark in the sky, as she turned and walked towards the tube station.<br><br>In the station, she was waiting for the next train and see where the next train would take Prodigal and her. As the train arrived in the  station, she was ready to move on as well, just when the train door opened, a man in black trenchcoat stood in the midst of a cabin with no one inside. It was the person whom she was searching for in the big city.<br><br>It was a moment where both of them stood in the midst of a train, with an exchange of glances at each other. Where they would go or do next, we do not know. Hence the ending would be left here, when another story had just begun back in Sgforumsia.<br><br>[End of Part II of Thus Speak Prodigal]<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 11 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dedicated to the people (particularly the forumites) who have lost their faith in love, with the hope that they would find it again in their lives, and for those who are searching for true loves.<br><br>An Afterthought<br>---------------<br>Writing this 2nd part of Thus Speak Prodigal took me quite a lot of time. I concocted most of the episodes when I walked from place to place in the English town which I studied in. Finally, I could put all the pieces together and took more than the expected time to complete. Originally, I thought of finishing it by the end of Feburary, but it seems that I have to take a longer time as I was caught in the time of despair. Finally, it took a spur of fire to write this week and I decided to finish this before I head to Oxford again tomorrow for a trip again.<br><br>I have wondered how I would end the story, but in order to make the story go into a bigger and more interesting plot, I have chosen to set a scene where Time has ended in an effort to seal the anomaly. Of course, we now know that Mayar and Torrants disappeared. How are they going to come back? How is it going to be? What happened to the Devil and Devestation's flail? Well, so many questions left to be answered. Of course, I would try to get them answered as the story goes along. But Prodigal and Runoa would not be in the next story as well, as it's time to have the other characters taking a role in the story.<br><br>I would have to say, part of the ideas of this last episode of Part II, came from Nicholas Spark's "Message in a Bottle". I have read it a year ago through a recommendation of a friend who was helping me to go thru the turbulent times of my life, and the thought of the end of the story about the lead found hope even though she had lost her loved one was one of the themes which I liked to illustrate through the story. Of course, part of the story is mirrored with the author's way of life and perception what he thinks about the issues involved.<br><br>Lastly, I would be taking a short break to do my scientific research and another piece of writing (that I am presently writing in the hope to be properly published) which I wanted to finish before writing the next story "City on Fire", which is based back on the people we know in the forum who is taking up so much spotlight recently.<br><br>Of course, finally, I would like make a few acknowledgements (with no order of preferences) :<br><br>1)MayaJade and Terence for their contribution of the much awaited sex-scene, and it took me sometime to edit the entire thing and put it properly. For the uncensored and unedited version, please refer to the companion.<br><br>2)Rinoa Heartily for her contribution to the poetry involved in the story and her support as my friend during this period of time where I am trying to get bits and pieces of ideas into the writing of the story.<br><br>3)Lex for pointing out that bad mistake in one of the story. Dun worry, you would have a big part to play in the next one...<br><br>4)And to all the others, like Callan, who have contributed the drawings and many others who have one way or another make this story possible.<br><br>Have a good day.<br></div>
