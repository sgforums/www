And of coz i do save my .ist files but i started with the intention of using imagestyler to do my whole website...but still i am having trouble and i totally have no idea why.<br><br>Another qn that i wanna ask is that erm is it better for one to 'get-to-know' how to use Frontpage first before proceeding on to use Dreamweaver? Coz i still dont find the program easy to use...but well perhaps i am getting old hehe...anyway lame excuse..so what do u guys and gals have to say?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm..<br><br>For screen capturing software, try using Snag It! It's not too bad a software... real easy to use and friendly....<br><br>It's always good to not just start with Frontpage, but to have a solid foundation in what HTML is all about, and how to best manipulate and adjust the layout. Ie. using tables for the layout etc...<br><br>Of course, experience and experimenting is a vital part of the learning process.<br><br>Another recommendation would be to read up about things like.. how websites should be done.. the real theoretical stuff and fundamentals on site architecture.. Once you've built a solid foundation, any software shouldn't be too hard to use.. just a matter to experimenting and getting used to it.<br><br>If possible... do read and understand how HTML actually works.<br><br>Cheerio!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Selena:<br><br>PHP is a language that has outgrown its name. It was originally conceived as a set of macros to help coders maintain persoanl home pages, and thus it's former name from it's purpose, <strong>"Personal Home Pages"</strong> initially. Since then, PHP's capabilityhave been extended, taking beyond a set of utilities to a full featured programming language, capable of managing huge datbase-driven online enviroments.<br><br>As PHP's capabilities have grown, so too has it's popularity. PHP is presently running at more than 1.4million hosts online. It is also the most popular Apache server module available, beating even ModPerl.<br><br>PHP is now officially know as <strong>PHP:Hypertext Preprocessor</strong> It is a server-side scripting language usually written in an HTML context. Unlike an ordinary HTML page, a PHP script is not sent directly to a client by the server; instead, it is parsed by rhe PHP binary or module on the host server itslef, so no more downloading of plugins. HTML elemetns in the script are left alone, but PHP code is interpreted and executed. PHP cpde on a script can query databases, create images, read and write files, talk to remote servers - the possibilities are endless. The output from PHP cpde is combined with HTML in the script and the result sent to the user. Often, PHP would be coupled with an SQL program to harness it's pwoer with DBMs. The MySQL program is one of the most popular, and with Apache server, MySQL DBM and PHP, the 3 makes a powerful combination.<br><br>Hope my little piece of summary is useful for you.

            <div class='col-md body'>The best way to go about creating webpages is to hammer the basic layout with Dreamweaver/Frontpage etc etc and edit the HTML using a text editor which gives you more control and eleminates a lot of excess tags and junks that the program created,hehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.
