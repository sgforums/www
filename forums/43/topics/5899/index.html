            <div class='col-md body'>This is a poem which I have read through many many times after losing 2 women in my life, and share precisely the same sentiments. We can never actually get over our past loves. We are often injuried by the wounds which hurt ourselves by the backlashes of love. The wounds might eventually heal, but the scars remain. Not many people are lucky in this search. I will share this piece of writing with those who bears a deep sentimentality to love. I posted this poem like 4 am in the morning (in UK) here where I lived, woke up by a dream where I have seen my ex-gf again. Dreams can be so powerful yet painful at times, especially where you can remember them vividly, and ponder which is real or which is not...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Rinoa,<br><br>Well, I am still living each day in the most beautiful and hopeful manner I can, but in a different way than before. Strange and perhaps ironic, when I wrote the reply to a post "Commit Suicide" placed by someone, I realized that you don't have to kill yourself after something painful and traumatic happened in your life. In reality, if you look closely to yourself, you realize that a part of you has already died, that very part of you which makes you believe that you still have it to find what you want in your life. "Ghost" is perhaps what I thought about my life now.. Just send off the 2 birthday cards to my 2 only ex-gfs (where their birthdays are on the same week) and I could feel concerned for them, wondering how they are doing.. Perhaps, they have already forgotten me or let their hearts taken away by someone else such that there is no part of me in their hearts.<br><br>Even so, at the end of today, they are ghosts in my heart and soul, but I would still say the same to myself : "They are gone, I am still alive, and so live."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Have a nice day.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Rinoa,<br><br>Well, it is an irrelevant question to ask what happens when they come back to my life, because I am very sure to tell you that they would not want to come back to me anymore. I loved my 1st ex-gf for she represent the ideal woman in my search, but she is too cynical and pessimistic. My 2nd ex-gf touched my heart, but I was able to compromise to stay with her all the way, even when I was far away. At first I thought that I might do something wrong, but in the end, she did. In any case, I just used a line from a forumite in his signature :<br><br>"It takes a minute to have a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to fall in love with someone but it takes a lifetime to really forget someone whom you grown to love."<br><br>At least, I can say in both cases, I still loved them for the way they were in my heart. Sometimes, I wish that like you ever give me the hypothetical case that they would come back and what would I do. Then I realize that it is a waste of time to think about that, because it is impossible and irrelevant to ask. I can only be thankful to Fate for giving me the pain to experience two heartbreaks and each killing a part of me... I wonder whether there would be the third woman anymore and I wish to believe that there is... That is why I refuse to yield to cynicism, because cynics are people who can never achieve anything in their lives.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was just wondering...a person with just one heart but you can keep the love for 2 woman....It really takes alot for the third woman in your life to know she is the third in your place...<br>Whether U are going to have the third woman in your life...I still think the main question is if you are able to let them not haunting you...The very fact you think that U might not be able to find the third woman is because the love for 2 woman has left a great impact in your life...<br><br>You might not know what yuor future beholds...But for one thing dun say never...just be prepared of what you should do....if you are just tryng to find maybe a substitute for the third place in your heart to carry on the trend of your love life...it might be better for you to remain single for the rest of your life...<br><br>And have you asked yourself what is the main problem of the failure of these 2 relationship...Why is it not you that yuo have chosen????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Rinoa,<br><br>After having a hard and bad day, and plus reading your post, I have suddenly came to this relevation that maybe I should remain single for all my life, since I am not the kind of guy women wanted, so why should I try so hard in searching. I am tired of these questions like why all the past r/s went wrong, and why all that happened to my life. I should not even to try if that is what you want to tell me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal<br><br>Yes the scars remain, and you said earlier that you thank fate for giving you the experience of two heartbreaks.  Now it is really up to you what do you want to make of them.  You can lie down and bleed and languish about ghosts and we both know it's very exhausting...and killing.  If you're tired of thinking about where did you/who go wrong then stop thinking about it for a while.  It seems that you're doing what you've always wanted to do there in England so why don't instead of wonder wonder wonder you immerse yourself in do do do?<br><br>Yeah, I know it's not that easy to forget, the strangest things remind me of them and I have to suck my breath to quell the sudden onslaught of pain, but I don't stay there and let it assault me again, move on, dear prodigal, move on.</div>
