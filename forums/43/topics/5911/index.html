            <div class='col-md body'>The Raven<br>---------<br>by Edgar Allan Poe<br><br>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-<br>Only this, and nothing more."<br><br>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow<br>From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-<br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-<br>Nameless here for evermore.<br><br>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br>"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-<br>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-<br>This it is, and nothing more."<br><br>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>That I scarce was sure I heard you"- here I opened wide the door;-<br>Darkness there, and nothing more.<br><br>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<br>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"-<br>Merely this, and nothing more.<br><br>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice:<br>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-<br>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-<br>'Tis the wind and nothing more."<br><br>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-<br>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-<br>Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br><br>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.<br>"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br>Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore-<br>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br><br>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;<br>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-<br>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>With such name as "Nevermore."<br><br>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-<br>Till I scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown before-<br>On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br>Then the bird said, "Nevermore."<br><br>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-<br>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>Of 'Never- nevermore'."<br><br>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-<br>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br>Meant in croaking "Nevermore."<br><br>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,<br>She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br><br>Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he hath sent thee<br>Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!<br>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"<br>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br><br>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or devil!-<br>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-<br>On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-<br>Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!"<br>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br><br>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-<br>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-<br>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."<br>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br><br>"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting-<br>"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!<br>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br><br>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>Shall be lifted- nevermore!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liquid:  about Yeats, perhaps so.  But the important thing is whether one can get the message across well enough.  I think no one has a simple mind, it's just that they might not have the ability to pass off what they have in mind as proses, let alone poems.  I enjoy talking to eloquent persons because it's simply exciting to be able to "bathe" oneself in their stream of thoughts and feelings.<br><br>------------------<br>The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are<br>always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.<br>--Bertrand  Russell</div>

Having an intelligent mind does not mean that you can express yourself properly (hence IQ and EQ).<br><br>This is also why I like eloquent people as well, those people who are able to communicate their thoughts and feelings seemingly with complete disregard to the limits of the human physique.

            <div class='col-md body'>Liquid:  thank you, and you sound like a well read person, too.  Is this the result of being in Australia for a while?<br>I don't exactly hate the uncomfortable silence, sometimes I find that I cannot find the exact word to describe the way I feel/think.  But the one of the worst things that can happen to me is being stranded with someone I cannot talk to, someone whose reply is "erm, yes, i think so."  Do you think being talkative help in the gaining of eloquence (I am very talkative yadda yadda yadda) and I have to rely on good english to get my message across because I don't speak Chinese or any other local language (my malay is a goner <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>So, do you write stories, too?
