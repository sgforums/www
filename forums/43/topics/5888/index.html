            <div class='col-md body'>Thus Speak Prodigal III<br>-----------------------<br>Standard Disclaimer : any names of people who are written in story have nothing to do with people in real life. If there are resemblances, they are merely coincidences.<br><br>III The Rising Shadows<br>----------------------<br>Just when the great cult leader Karhole and his bitter enemies were to engage into a major scale flame war in the Sgforumsia arena, the imperial guards sent by the great all mighty Emperor of the Sgforumsia empire has surrounded the area and took all the cult leaders by force. The great Emperor Chef is nevertheless powerful in quelling such insolent behaviour from the people, as he possess the power which are granted from the gods of cyberspace. The cult leader Karhole was exiled to New Yoke, where he is rumoured to appear in Studio 54 with the prostitute called Mandy. Apparently, he bribed the inner circle of Sgforumsia, who are aides to the Emperor to be granted exile. His followers are now still meeting in secret, as they believed that their great leader would come back someday.<br><br>What happened to the other cult leaders? The androids Paiser I and II, Duck, and the rest of them were sentenced to the Liaj, where no prisoners are known to escape from there. Of course, they yelled their famous last words of T2,"I will be back" which is responded by the minions of Karhole with a "Yeah right, dream on...". Jane Wang was sentenced to the Woodbridge hospital by appeal of the court, because of her sexual change transplant which gave her strange moods and wierd psychological behaviour, like for example she or he could distinguish the sex of others properly after her/his operation. Nevertheless, the war  has ended.<br><br>The five friends has decided to part from the cafe. Torrants have been given the manifestation of Time and started on his new job, because of his undying love for a woman who had turned into a walking disaster whenever she go. He seek to rescue her from her fate with his new found powers. Dakar and Eck left to seek other parts of the land for new babes. While the god of war, Bish was called to attention for his duty, since a recent disaster has loomed everywhere for a manifestation of a demoness has appeared in Eropagins, the island city in Sgforumsia...<br><br>The prodigal, with his black trenchcoat, and his dark shades, took his haversack and started to walk around in the town to see what is going on. Strangely, before he was to reach to Eropagins to see who the demoness was. Perhaps, it would be a reunion with the God of War and some friends. Slowly, he took his walk slowly across the city centre into the outskirts of the city.<br><br>It was at this moment, he passed by a small village, where a few kids were tied up to the stake, and about to be burnt for their misdemeanours. The prodigal was curious, as there was a crowd around to boo at these innocent 12 year old kids. The prodigal, out of intellectual curiousity asked...<br><br>Prodigal : Kind Sir, Who are these boys? Why are they tied to the stakes to be burned?<br>Villager 1: Well, young man, these boys bear the saint names of Pokkamon, Cguy, Benggal, Waterwire and so forth.. They have comitted acts of disgrace to the village school.<br>Prodigal : What did they do?<br>Villager 1: They have asked the forbidden questions. Pokkamon, Benggal and Cguy have been polluting the innocent gals here with their brainless sexual fantasies, inspired by the evil demoness who has committed a lot of crimes in Eropagnis now, they started irritating the villagers with their questions like "What is sex?", "How do we have sexual intercourse with another woman?","Should we do it when a gal is having period?", "What kind of bra you wear?" and "can you have babies when you kiss the gal?".. The villagers were sick of their tirades, and are now decided by the mayor that they should all be burnt to the stake.. Waterwire has flooded the place with his nonsensical oneliners.<br>Prodigal : But they are kids, surely, we can pardon them...<br>Villager 1 : No, they are not pardoned. They break the school rules by trying to start their sexual revolution by being seduced by the demoness in the internet. They must die...<br>Prodigal : Surely, you can't be angry with a few kids who are still young and have no idea what these things are. Besides, they are charmed by the demoness. Their lack of knowledge is because we suppress so much information and we do not allow freedom of speech in this empire. Everything is controlled with an iron fist. Where else can these boys turn to if they do not know certain answers to certain questions which they do not know about? Of course, they use the internet and get their information from ill-informed newsgroups like sex discussion newsgroups.<br>Villager 1 : They ought to be burned, like the evil boy Bad-beng-marks and his sister Kaolin gal, who are running the syndicate of punks in the town. Of course, their grandfather is none other than the now turned Jane Wang...<br>Villager 2 : Burn them!!!!<br><br>Just when the village is about to set fire to kill these poor kids. Vrooming sounds were heard, and a bunch of masked motorcycles rushed into the execution place and took over the place by unleashing their hordes of machine guns.<br><br>The prodigal conjured a shield to block the firing bullets, and jumped onto the back of one of the motorcycles to stop the raiders from massacring the ignorant villagers. Like all John Woo's films, his style is slow and steady, as he grabbed the hand of the raider, and threw him to the floor, and grabbed the motorbike. The next move, was to use the machine gun on the motorbike to deal with the raiders. As usual, in all John Woo films, the bullets do not touch the prodigal but the bullets of the prodigal hit the raiders and killed all of them. However, the kids escaped with the remaining raiders, and the prodigal surveyed the dead bodies, as he took off his sunshades to see the sigil of these raiders to identify who they were. The winds flutter the prodigal's hair and his trenchcoat fluttered as well..<br><br>"So, the demoness is that sexy babe from hell named Hello Kathy banished from hell, and her invasion by her voodoo dolls was just the first step to conquer the Eropagins. Then Bish and Torrants could be lured into a trap. It could be a trap to trap both manifestations." the prodigal said, as he took the motorbike and rushed off straight to the island city, where the scarring fires which burned the city to ashes can been seen from afar.<br><br>[To be continued]<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal, probably a good story, but I am just so sick of the inane feline critter issues, and those morons "friends" of mine are still sending me cute horror pictures of that *%^&amp;^ posing.<br><br>Unobserved in the scene is an urchin with tattered clothes and purple eyes.  She observed the melee without interest  as she was more concerned with the price of flower nowadays than with a tea-serving cat.<br><br>Too deep in her thoughts, she accidentally took the same passage the Gawd of Time, Torrants, was taking.  Would she get to see the damsel this eager knight is bent on rescuing?  Would he need flowers?  Could she sell roses to him for $12 each?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>prodigal my man...<br>Everyday I want into this land looking for you but you are not around. I do not come as an immortal to see you but the mortal identity of the holey holey monk. I have some to see what can be done to save all from the attacks of the demoness and the rebellions.<br><br>It seems your Emperior is very pissed for that is why he send in his troops, declaring the rebellion is over. The rebels would busy making plans and raid on the power of our Sexy Cult Leader, forgetting the true monarch. He is angry and he decides to put an end to all this madness. The Cult Leader is still waiting to come back from his exile and many of his followers and friends and enemies are waiting.........<br><br>Prodigal my man...<br>The demoness is a powerful one. I fear for her attack here for she doesn't come starts a war, and when she don't I have not power over the situation. Only Time can tell use what to do for he can see the future. I have return the red mightly sword to Mars already and now I am only a mortal. I have step down from my Office for the time being, joining you to look at the situation......<br><br>Its a mircle that you survive their rescue mission. What a pity that they have escape and this spells trouble for this land. They are master of disguise and we do not know how they will come back again. Which whatever form but we can tell once we see them for everyone has experience their form of attack.<br><br>prodigal my man...<br>why don't we just walk around and make plans to prevent their rebellious act again.......<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To MayaJade :<br><br>So, after reading your description, I guess that you are not eager to be the character that Torrants is deeply in love with...

Well, if we win the hollywood oscar, I can start thanking my papa mama, mama papa, my relatives, my grandfather, grandmother, friends and etc for the Oscar like all those stars do in the ceremony...<br><br>To the God of War :<br>Hmm, as it seems that everyone is following into the storyline, your points would be added to the next installment.... Those young punks who were rescued would be seduced by the demoness to destroy the island city of Eropagnis... For the time being, we need a romantic love interest for Torrants, as originally I was thinking of the great MayaJade....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Proddy,<br><br>Good story. Keep it up! Just a few suggestions pal,<br>1. develop the characters a bit? Giving us a bit of their history would make them more real or endearing to the reader.<br>2. car-chase, or spaceship chase. You can't have a good story without a chase scene.<br>3. love scene. I don't know about Maya, but if that sexy dolphin-talking purple folicle nymph doesn't mind, I'll gladly sacrifice my modesty for a love scene with her to spice things up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers<br><br>GONG XI FA CHAI to all.</div>
