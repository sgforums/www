            <div class='col-md body'>Thus Speak Prodigal<br>-------------------<br>The Search for True Love<br>Episode 9 : Till Death Do we part<br><br>Disclaimer : As per normal<br><br>(a) The Prodigal's Heart<br>------------------------<br>The sun has just set in the Nexus.  Prodigal and Runoa had decided to leave for Savana in the following day, after taking a rest at Death's place. The goddess of Love was sleeping gracefully on the bed, with a beautiful duvat covering her. The prodigal was looking out to the window and see the night slowly covering the nexus with the beautiful stars.<br><br>The Prodigal could not sleep.  He was not sure where the path would lead him. It was a path filled with perils and obstacles. He could not find solace in his heart. After realizing that the damage he had caused with his battle against the Devil, he was filled with remorse that he had caused the life of his loved one in danger. He turned and looked at his loved one, so deeply in her sleep. He wished that she would be safe and sound and that nothing could harm her. Yet, he knew that he would hav e to leave her. He was afraid of where his destiny would lead him. He was avoiding his destiny all these while. He realized that he could not let a woman suffer with him. He walked out of the bedroom as he pulled his trenchcoat quietly. He had made up his mind that he could only seek Devestation alone.<br><br>He recalled that the god of destruction was his bitter enemy. They had never agreed on anything in any meeting of the Endless. Devestation simply hated him for taking away his love. It was the love of the mortal woman, and in the end, both of them lost the mortal woman to Death, because it was fated that the Endless could never love a mortal. If the love was consummated, cities would burn and the Earth as we know it, would suffer from hellfire.  He would knew that if he would beg the god of destruction for help to seal the anomaly, he would be utterly humiliated. But there is no choice. The fate of the cosmos is by far, much higher in magnitude than personal pride, whether the Prodigal could rationalize all these out.<br><br>He was in pain, only deeply in pain, as he stepped out of the door. He wished that he could kiss his love goodbye, but he did not want her to know that he would seek destruction on his own path. Such was his way of living.  He was walking down the corridor, towards the exit of Death's palace. As he was about to leave the Nexus, a feminine voice spoke,"Going somewhere, my dear brother."<br><br>"Yes," Prodigal said,"I have to go to Savana."<br><br>"You are leaving Runoa here," Death said,"don't you love her?"<br><br>"Yes, I do," Prodigal nodded his head as he could not face Death in the eye."You must understand that to love someone is not to let someone suffer with you."<br><br>"Yes," Death shared the Prodigal's sentiments,"But if I would love that someone, I would go with him in all my heart, even to die with him. Isn't that the mortal way, how it should be, my brother? Isn't that love? Are you not hurting her by leaving her here, and face the danger against Devestation alone?"<br><br>"But, I cannot let her to suffer, " the Prodigal said,"It is between Devestation and me."<br><br>"Yes, yes, you and him, both of you are always at loggerheads," Death sighed,"So, you are seeking him out on your own."<br><br>"Yes." the Prodigal said, "Death, I would like to go now, take care of Runoa for me, and I would be back soon." He turned his head and was about to leave.<br><br>"Please stop here, my love," a voice had suddenly stopped the Prodigal, as he was about to open the door and leave the place. It was the voice of his love.  "Even if you have to face the enemy, I would like to be with you, till death do we part." Those words touched the wanderer, but he was at a loss of words. The wanderer walked towards his love and hugged her, muttering words of apology as he embraced her with his arms.<br><br>Death was shaking her head, and realized that it was going to be a difficult situation for the two of them... "Why are they behaving like mortals?" Death said to herself as she shook her head. "Sometimes, I really wonder why these two Endless are turning so much mortal. We have a different purpose in our existence."<br><br>"Well, Prodigal," a handsome voice came and a figure materialized in front of the couple and Death. "You do not need to seek Devestation in Savana. I can gladly do the favour for you." It was a man in pure white suit, with a nice Leonardo-Dicappucino face.<br><br>"S.A. Tan," the Prodigal gasped, and he was in surprised why the Devil had come to the domain of Death. "Why are you here in the Nexus?"<br><br>"Of course, I am not here to pick another battle with you," said the Devil, as he shot a glance at Death, who was not duly impressed with his entrance into her realm. "I am here to negotiate a deal with you."<br><br>"A deal?" Prodigal could not believe his ears,"After all that humiliation I have made you, I am sure your heart is consumed with the fire to destroy me now."<br><br>"Well, always remember that the Devil may not be a forgiving person, but there are no forever enemies or friends in this world. I am here on the pretext as a businessman."<br><br>"Yes, so what is your deal?" the Prodigal said, as he clenched tightly to Runoa's hand.<br><br>"Before that, let me show you something," the Devil conjured a sphere and the image in the sphere was a little gal trapped inside a cage in hell. "This is your daughter, Valentine, the product of 2 Endless, you and Runoa who holds the profile of True Love in the future of our Universe, and she is in my hands now."<br><br>Prodigal and Runoa was shocked as they stared into the sphere, and found an uneasiness in them, that the gal was somehow related in blood with them. Especially the blue crystal eyes in the little gal's eyes, both Prodigal and Runoa could not help but to believe what the Devil had said.<br><br>"S.A. Tan, you are so despicable to use a little gal to trick my brother," Death attacked the Devil with her words.<br><br>"No, my sister, he is right, that is our daughter, both Runoa and I can feel it," the Prodigal said. "Let's cut the long story short, what is the deal?"<br><br>"Well, Prodigal, I am aware that our battle had caused an anomaly in our Universe, and this anomaly had not affected you, but me as well. I would get you the thing you need from Devestation in Savana. U need his flail so that you can effectively use your powers to seal the anomaly. If you could do something for me, I would return your daughter in the deal which I proposed as she is suffering from extermination of her own existence because Runoa has somehow passed away in her timeline."<br><br>"Don't trust him, Brother," Death said, as she was pondering how to help her brother out fo the situation.<br><br>"Well, the Devil came with a deal which has no choice," the Prodigal said, as he made a short glance from his love that they had to save that little gal. "S.A. Tan, tell me what you want from me, but if you do not return my daughter and Devestation's flail after I have done the thing for you, you would expect my fury in hell."<br><br>"U have my promise, Prodigal," said the Devil. "Here is the thing which I want you to do : you must go to the Seven heavens and see the Creator, and inform him of a plot by the Archangel Gabriel to revolt against him. I want this to end as fast as possible, as it was caused by the anomaly which our battle had somehow affected Heaven. I have news from my associates that Gabriel is going to revolt against the Creator, and lead the angels to a war against humanity. However, he is met by resistance in the community of Angels in Heaven. Hence to secure his power, he has plotted against the Creator. Your job is to warn the Creator i.e. that stupid old man who is trapped in his own shell after leaving the world to me and the angels to play with."<br><br>"That is strange, S.A. Tan, why would you want to help the resistance and the Creator to deal with Gabriel? Afterall, it does not benefit you at all. The Creator would just quell the rebellion by reversing the effect caused by the anomaly to Gabriel."<br><br>"Although I hate the old man for what he done to me, nevertheless, my purpose to eliminate Gabriel and assist the resistance rests on a fundamental assumption here : There can only be one Hell. If Gabriel successfully lead the revolution, heaven and earth would change, and revelation would seriously need a new editor. But never trust the bible, since it was written by Man and not by the old man."<br><br>"Well, to secure your throne in Hell, you have to stop Gabriel before a great war would lead to him holding a similar realm like you. Good thought," the Prodigal said,"Despite that I am not interested between your feud with the Creator, nevertheless, I would fulfil your part of the deal by going to Heaven."<br><br>"Then after you fulfil your part of the deal, we would meet to seal the anomaly, before it is going to cause more damage to our existence." S.A. Tan said, as he disappeared into thin air.<br><br>"Deal," the Prodigal said as he saw the road ahead filled with obstacles and difficulties.<br><br>"Are you sure you are going to do this?" Death said,"It is not easy to gain audience with the Creator, even if you are an Endless. Besides, you would have to deal against Gabriel."<br><br>"I have to, since S.A. Tan wants to seal the anomaly as well," said the Prodigal,"Well, my sister, please do me a favour, please let Runoa stay in the Nexus and protect her from harm."<br><br>"Prodigal," Runoa looked at him with the notion that she wished to follow him.<br><br>"No, my dear love, I would want to have your company very much with me," said the Prodigal,"But this is far too dangerous. I want nothing to harm you, and you must be protected at all costs, otherwise, our daughter would die."<br><br>"Alright, come back safely," Runoa said, as she kissed her knight deeply with her lips sealed to his. There was not a moment that both of them knew that it was an ordeal to them, and they had to support each other to carry through the test.<br><br>(b)Torrants and Mayar<br>---------------------<br>(This part is contributed by MayaJade and Ternece and has been edited to fit the story line. If you are curious, you can always look at the original version in the companion of Thus Speak Prodigal)<br><br>The meadow was filled with the fragrant smell of  roses and lilies. The most beautiful about living in the land of the Faeries, is that one could admire the changing seasons and also the wondrous beauty of nature. the green forest was packed with oak trees that lived longer than the elves themselves. The plains were laid strewn with brown leaves, and the climate was not too cold since it was turning Autumn in Faerie Land.  It was midday, yet the distant sun of the Faerie Land had cast a gentle light on the lands. A lone woman was sitting on the grass with her nose buries in a posy of red blooms.  She was the beautiful and gorgeous Mayar, the exiled purple-haired ex mermaid.<br><br>Suddenly a note blended into the tranquility of the meadow. Mayar lifted her head and  blinked. She was anticipating for him to come. For he had come to the Faerie Land for her, together with the servant of the Goddess of Love. She was awaiting for this nite, as she missed him for a long time. However, he would have to leave tomorrow, because Queen Amanda had made a bargain with the God of Time, that unless his son would be restored to his original form, she would not let Mayar leave. After all, the whole incident was caused by both Mayar and Torrants. Hence the God of Time felt that it was his responsibility to do something for the crown prince of the elves. He had agreed to the deal.  After their reunion, Torrents told her about his trip to hell and Prodigal's effort  to get her whereabout from S.A.Tan. They had agreed to meet and spent the night together before Torrants would leave with Cluon to search for the demoness Hallo Kathy for the antidote.<br><br>"Dearest, you have finally come," Mayar said as she kissed the lips of her beloved Torrants, who was struming the most beautiful music from the harp. The strings were weaved with passion and the music filled the meadows with serenity and tranquility. So much was the power of love.<br><br>"Yes, my dear Mayar," said Torrants,"I miss you dearly. And to leave you again, I can't."<br><br>Ripples of motion swept across the meadow. At first, when the notes began to get softer, the winds began to take over the music and whistled across the leaves across the plains. The flowers were swayed just slightly and the wind could be felt.Torrants dropped his harp, and let his emotions flowed into his loved one. When they touched,  the land descended into quiet again. Torrents pulled Mayar into his arms and at that moment, their lives felt complete. Mayar buried her head on  the crook of his neck and leaned on his lithe and powerful body. She could feel his strength emanated from his beautiful form and she absorbed it to salve her wounded heart. She touched him with her tender hands and felt his body boiled with passions. He marvelled that she always smelt like seabreeze and he found himself  helplessly enconsed in her yielding softness.<br><br>"Torrents, Torrents, I waited for you for so long, I didn't know if you would ever find me..." Torrents comforted her with his arms, "Be quiet, my love, I am here."<br><br>She pulled back and for the first time saw him in close range. Even though Torrents had discarded his tattered clothes after his battle with the Demoness, his wounds had not healed yet. Mayar inspected them carefully and asked him about his adventure.   They retreated into a  bower hidden in the edge of the woods which was used to house the guest of the royal family in Faerie Land. However, it was now the current residence of  Mayar  granted by Queen Amanda. Torrents lied down with his head on Mayar's lap. She told him about her own misadventure in Faerie Land and when she completed her story,  they fell into a comfortable silence. They didn't say anything to each other, yet their eyes spoke to each other. Mayar gazed into Torrents pair of eyes and saw inside warmth and infinite understanding. Overcome with surges of tender  feelings she pulled a flower from a long vase and traced the contours of his face with its smooth petals. Love and lust belongs to desire, and desire is always cruel. Torrents reached up with his hand and it soon lost itself in the silken purple strands of Mayar's hair. he gave her a pull she did not need. Bending low, Mayar's lips gently fell upon Torrent's waiting ones. It was but a short kiss but it acted like an ignition spark. Mayar gently moved Torrents from her lap to the soft grass of the  bower. he reclined on the grass and she descended upon him once again. the layers of clothes were hastily and hungrily peeled off each other. Their desires were so  tangible that  they trembled with animal anticipation. Torrants, bare-bodied, looking like a demi-god in the summer sun, firmly let Mayar on the floating scent of sweet due and  lowered his head to her warm moist lips. Mayar half-opened her opulent lips, cherry red with innocence, raised her head to meet his with the experience of a woman who knew what she wanted.<br><br>Torrants stroked Mayar's hair gently, down to her ears, the nape of her neck and  finally resting on her firm breasts. as he allowed his weight to rest onto her, she  reached to the back of his head and pulled him closer to her cheek and began breathing heavily with unwanton desire. his muscles clenched, his body knotted and his touch became firmer and lost the gentleness of before,  replaced by the instincts of a semi-god who wanted to erupt. Her body was responding to his touch and caress. her hands fluttered across his back and down to his heavenly buttocks,  exploring its cleavage as he explored hers. in a swift movement they became one. There was no one else in this universe, only the hearts and loins of two metaphysical entities colliding with unparalleled passion and vigour. from a gentle rocking to a rythmic pulsating dance, they moved in unision, every thrust and cry in beat with the tune only they both knew. Time had ceased to exist. the minutes turned into hours, the hours into years and the years back into minutes again. and in a rainbow-like explosion of joy and cosmic  pleasure, they felt the sky fall to the earth and the seas shoot into the space it left behind. it was over; yet the taste and smell of the experience made it feel as  though it never ended. They have finally consummated each other and lived by the bond that till death, do they part.<br><br>[to be continued]<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 26 February 2000).]</div>

Actually, I was just writing here to just give myself some templates which I can use for my own short stories as well as the novel which I am working on. I don't think that it would be good enough to be made into something publishable. Anyway, I would be still writing the big story which I have carefully concocted in this 2nd story.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After hitting that 300th post, and also realizing that I am not in the perfect psychological condition to engage in any discussion on women and anything else, I have decided that I would like to take a few days away from the forum. For those who are waiting for this episode to end, and for the future plot, I am afraid that you have my humble apologies. I apologize for my slowness in the recent week as well in writing the story.<br><br>They say that love's lost cannot be found again... Well, the prodigal wishes to take a few days of solace (on the birthday of his ex-loves) to recap his beautiful moments with those who meant so much to him in his life in his past life, and that his love for them does not end even though he do not see them anymore.<br><br>Have a good day...<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have someone to enter into my life to love me and take away all that pain, remorse and hurt from my heart.
