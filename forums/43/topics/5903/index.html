            <div class='col-md body'>Hi t|rEd,<br><br>My best friend, who is a budding writer, once criticised my poetry of being shallow and thinks that it is not that good... Hence I don't really think that I am that good in writing poetry. Maybe everyone is busy at the moment. I am sure, we would have new contributions if we keep the thread going...<br><br>Well, I was hoping for more feedback for the stories which I am writing actually... So that I can revamp my writing style or do some corrections....<br></div>
