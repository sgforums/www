            <div class='col-md body'>Thus Speak Prodigal<br>-------------------<br>The Standard drama line : Any characters are fictional in this account, and if there is any similarities to people associated in real life, are merely coincidences.<br><br>II The Hello Kathies<br>--------------------<br>While, the god of war Bish, Dokar, Ack, Torrents and the prodigal now gathered in the unscathed cafe in the city central of Sgforumsia, a storm is breeding as the cult leader Karhole has re-appeared with his cable modem and his minions are now preparing their ammunition for the second war against the other chaos factions led by Duck, Paizer I and II (the articial androids which managed to gain intelligence through the use of cosmic rays), Jane Wang and Stittpid, plue the rest of the other cult leaders...<br><br>Another storm was brewing across the streets, and it concerns the Hello Kathies. I have recently heard of a violent incident happening in Eropagnis, an island city near Sgforumsia. The evil capitalist who controlled the fast food chain called Macduckald, have came up with a set of collectible dolls called Hello Kathies. The Hello Kathies come in 6 beautiful wedding dresses, and be sold everyweek when you first pay the money for the value meal it purports. There are long queues in all the restaurants in Eropagnis, and because of the dolls, the people ended in violence, fighting over these useless dolls, as planned by the evil capitalist.<br><br>The prodigal sat down and ask himself, writing an electronic love email with his laptop in the cafe to his friend Ruona,"<br><br>Dear Ruona,<br><br>I am sure by the use of the BNN cablenet, you would have heard of this unfortunate incident in our homeland, Eropagnis about Hello Kathies. The people in Eropagnis have lived too much in comfort. The young beautiful gals here are so pampered and wanted their bfs to buy these little Hello Kathies dolls. To think these dolls can cause so much violence, that even that new computer game called Quarter Life is nothing compared to it. The Monarch of Eropagnis have issued a decree to ban the game which I am happily playing here as I wander across the oceans. Well, since they can ban the game, why not the diablur and the other games like Doom : Hunting Barney and Teletubbies and Star balls episode 1 : Shooting Jajabing should be banned as well.<br><br>I feel sad for the people of Africa plagued by wars of different tribes heavily in debt, because they are living everyday in poverty, with the poor kids suffering from starvation. All these people in Eropagnis can just throw their food they bought in order to acquire their hello kathies dolls. I have just realized that people of that country do not even know what starvation is in real life. Not to mention the beggars I seen in the streets of London, and other places I have been in Europe. They don't see the bad things which we see out there in the big world. As the great 007 once said,"the world is not enough to satisfy these Eropagnis and tomorrow never dies for their greed..."<br><br>I suppose that there is nothing wrong with the people wanting to buy a collectible. I am sure that the capitalist can justify that there is nothing wrong about making an investment by buying the hello kathies dolls at $4.50 and sell it at cut-throat prices. But I am sure that there is something wrong about people having the sheep mentality that if someone have these toys, I must have it too... I am sure that there is something wrong about people throwing food aside where the food could be used to feed those in starvation. I am sure that there is something wrong that people can get in a fight over a trivial dolls like football fans fighting over a match verdict in UK, while the poor people in Chechen are fighting for their lives, and the people in Aceh fighting for their freedom. When will the people in Eropagnis ever learn to look at the big picture of things and stop whining at one corner about their property, cars, stupid complaints about young gal doing theoretical physics and their bad life, where people are suffering out there.<br><br>Oh, so much that I want to spend the next hundred lines declaring my undying love for you. I have decided to censor this mushy part like the Eropagnis government over films which they think have bad influence over the children of their country.<br><br>your soulmate,<br>the Prodigal"<br><br>The prodigal stopped and sent his email with love and continue to drink his coffee with his other friends in the cafe, while watching the sky turning black in the arena, where the sky will rain blood as promised by the end of the Millenium (if you believe the millenium starts at 2001 or 2004 or whatever date you want to believe..)...<br><br>[To be continued]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Such was the beauty of Torrents.  However, the gods do not look kindly at lives which are happy, contented and smooth.  After breaking his stick during a particular ferocious fight with a pack of amorous Amazonians, Torrents had to walk through the Sleepy Jungle.  Contrary to its name, the jungle is infested with gay packs of hellhounds.  Sparing you the gory details, I'll just say that they did despicable things to our once handsome and wholesome hero. *Shed a few drops of pearly reptilian tears*<br><br>Now with scars on his face and his soul, he lurks the darkened alleys at night and pounce upon any unwary damsels who walk his way.  Some think that he has given up the axe, but they are gullible fools!<br><br>Enough about him, go on with the story, Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>upon the offer of Office of Time, Torrent sat in quiet contemplation. the world weighed heavily on his shoulders. the duties of the Office, one by one, were given due consideration - after all what could be more honourable than occupying the hallowed Office of Time?

You can find yourself looking over many things, whole beauty.<br><br>JAde:<br>The man has lost his beauty for the gods are not looking at him with mercy as you have spoken. He is now holding the Office of Time and hiding his looks from the mortals.
