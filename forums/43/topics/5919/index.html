We leave them trailing at the end of our speech, screaming <span style="font-style: italic;">inside</span> pleading the other party to hear, but often they end up as blank as before, a monumental reminder for us not to trust anyone else with our feelings again.<br><br>Examples of blankety blanks:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">note: P and T after a separation between them</span><br><br><strong>P</strong>:  Is it okay for me to call you like this? <span style="font-style: italic;"> or would you rather I never dial your phone number again?</span><br><strong>T</strong>:  My manager is not around, so I am alone here.  It's fine.<br><strong>P</strong>:  No, I mean me calling you for you, I wasn't asking about your manager. <span style="font-style: italic;">I don't care about your manager!</span><br><strong>T</strong>:  Oh, it's okay.  I'll tell you when I can't take it anymore. <span style="font-style: italic;">Please stop</span><br><br>What a charming life!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come to think of it, the situation would get even more uncomfortable if the opposite party actually responded to a blankety blank.<br><br>Really...the converstation would be much more enlightening perhaps, but more awkward and might ruin things. Hmm.<br><br>You know the example given sounds rather specific, P and T instead of the normal A and B. Hmm.<br><br>Or maybe you're just very imaginative...Heh.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're right about the enlightenment.  More than that, sometimes it's hard to believe that the other party doesn't hear the blankety blanks that are so loud to our own ears.  Then it may translate to a growing doubt about the other person's level of care for us.<br><br>Or maybe it's just insecure thoughts.  Are there anyone who go through life free of doubts?

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I think it creates more problems being more aware of it.<br><br>Then again, would you really feel the need to respond to someone else's blankety blank? Or would you even notice it? The reason you notice your own blankety blank, is simply because, it's your own. Hmm.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This section of the forum seems very quiet, hmm...people not feeling creative anymore?<br>And my need for validation on my efforts in my song thread is sadly unfulfilled, ahwell.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, it's pretty quiet here but sometimes the din in chit chat is just noises.<br>sensing other people's blankety blanks needs a strong sense of perception and it depends on how well one knows the other person.  i still disagree, though, that sensing them will create more trouble.  I's not that I don't want to say it outloud, I can't.  Ignorance may be bliss but I think deception (from false imprssion) creates a tangled web that causes so much heartache in the end.<br><br>------------------<br>Life can only be understood backwards   It must be lived<br>forwards. --Soren Kierkegaard</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, adding blankety blanks in our conversion, and choosing not to interprete them are just human nature.<br><br>wouldn't it be nicer if everything were as simple as ABC? i mean, y can't we just take the surface meaning of what is being said? in this way, we would probably be freed of those worries which may actually be no worries at all.<br><br>life is already complicated enough with out the worries, wat for make it worse with the addition of unnecessary worries?<br><br>just my 2 cents worth......</div>

Sometimes I wish my frens would too. It's pretty stressful when you have to second guess how the person feels. sometimes i think I'M oversensitive, trying to read into the words that other people say, giving myself extra stress. heehee, bad habit. also i must say i'm guily of blankety blanks. sometimes i want so much for the other person to do something, yet, i'm too.... shy? proud? to ask that person to do it. sigh, sometimes i wish i was more outspoken, more frank with people. i guess ifeel insecure of saying what i want for i fear of ridicule, or people looking at me as if i'm too much or something. sigh.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>off point? sorry.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the reason as to why we are so aware of our blankety blanks is probably because we consciously tell ourselves that this is where the blankety blank should be located in our sentence blah blah.. To me, i think it's sorta in our state of mind. Prolly it's because of our sensitivity or insecurities, as such, we try to form the right sentence in our mind and in order not to offend people or embarass ourselves, we add in the blankety blanks. So i guess that's why our friends may not see the blankety blanks when we use it.<br><br>I am also guilty of using blankety blanks, especially when i am icqing with my friends. I think the reason being that i can't really see their expression or know their moods for the day and when i get really curious about really personal things i'd start using blankety blanks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well, this is what i think about blankety blanks.</div>
