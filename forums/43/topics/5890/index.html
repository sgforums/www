            <div class='col-md body'>Thus Speak Prodigal<br>-------------------<br>Standard disclaimer applies... If it resembles anyone in real life, it is merely a coincidence...<br><br>IV : The Trap<br>-------------<br>The city Eropagins was on fire. The streets were littered with many wounded people and heads and bodies of the Hello Kathies dolls lying around.. It was a bloody sight. The buildings of the streets were heavily vandalized, with cracked windows and painted walls with bad graffiti spelt with words like "F*** U!!!" and "I want to go to hell". It was a sorry sight...<br><br>The prodigal had arrived at the scene a while, witnessing the destruction of the island city. He was surveying around the vicinity for his friends, Bish and Torrants fearing that they might in danger. He was on the bike. His eyes searched high and low for them, yet they were to be found....<br><br>"My friend, the Prodigal," a voice came behind the vagabond. It was the voice of a tardy man, in shining armour and a thick helm. The god of war, Bish was nevertheless his name and destruction was his game. "What brings you here?" He was accompanied by a handsome dude in white robes. That was none other than Torrants, the new God of Time.<br><br>"I came here to warn you and Torrants of danger. Somehow, the demoness Hello Kathy was  thinking of luring you here for some unknown reason...." the prodigal replied. "She has just got back her minions, a bunch of sexual perverts who she corrupted in cyberspace."<br><br>"But why did she want to hit us?" Bish asked.<br><br>"She has a feud with me, my dear friend, Bish," replied Torrants. "She was jealous of my r/s with Mayar and sought to destroy it. I was surprised that she is so powerful to use voodoo magic now."<br><br>"Perhaps, it is because she was in league with some powerful god...." the god of war suggested. "She is a beautiful babe, but her heart is one of the scorpion.."<br><br>"Well, you know, women, think of men, take away objectivity and accountability. Oh dear, I am being sexist here..." the prodigal commented... The other two men laughed... "Well, actually, sometimes, I don't think that women lack intellect at all," the prodigal continued on his earlier statement,"It is just that they have a different way of looking at things. One of the cynical lessons which I think men need to learn is that women are more particular to small things than to big things. Their proportion of desire towards something is even more important than anything intellectual at all.<br><br>"However, there is a more imperative question here," Prodigal said,"How are we going to deal with the kids who are seduced by the demoness into their unleash of sexual posts in the cyberspace thast is not repairable now?"<br><br>"They ought to be burnt for their blasphemous posts," Torrants said. "We should invoke our moral authority to send them to Hell."<br><br>"Hmmm, I think not," Prodigal said,"I agree that they have putting the degratory posts in the cyberspace, and causing a lot of trouble. However, the freedom of speech is something we should uphold. They may talk about things which are seemingly degradatory about life, and perhaps, they may be using not proper English, but we don't have to flame them. We can choose to ignore them. It is a choice. If we choose to read it and get offended by it, then it is also our choice."<br><br>"Then what should we do then?" The God of War said.<br><br>"Well, we can ignore their posts. These people can post what they want. The problem is not with us, is that there is a line between saying something sensible and saying something sensible. If these kids were to discuss sex with a more sensible note, perhaps, I don't think it would incur your wrath, Torrants. However, they chose to use the more direct and insulting way to do it. Propriety in making statements is something important. A person can make any form of statements he wants, but he should restrain whenever necessary. This has nothing to do with educational level and their command of English. Any person who resorts to an argument of condemning some other people's use of language being poor, is just a reflection how myopic or closemindedness he is. I recall an incident, where someone made a moral call against some orthodox issue, and resort to semantics to debase the mentality to those who spoke against him, and there are people who supported his twist of words. So why do we have to bother with people who can't even argue properly?"<br><br>"Both of you are getting into another debate again." Bish said. "We still have to dig out the demoness and sent her back to her realm, before her voodoo dolls caused an economic and social depression to the society."<br><br>"U are right, Bish," Torrants said, as he lifted his hourglass and searched for anomalies in the region.<br><br>"True," Prodigal folded his arms and surveyed around. He was anticipating, because the enemy was here to lure them.<br><br>A sinister laughter was heard, and a large gold horse carriage decorated with a pussy ace rushed towards the three beings. Bish had no fear in the face of danger, pulled out his minigun and fired towards it, but failed to stop it. Torrants levitated himself up to avoid the crashing blow. The prodigal lifted his hand, and suddenly the fabric of spacetime began to warp right in front of him. The carriage was forced to stop by his warp.<br><br>"How did you know how to do this?" Bish said in an astonished manner,"Unless you are one of the Endless."<br><br>"I am the prodigal," the prodigal replied with a smile. He waited for the person in the carriage to appear. He knew that the enemy was within.<br><br>The carriage unwrapped itself, and a pretty babe with a bare top and scantily dress (imagine what you want, because I am not going to bother) appeared, stroking a small pussy cat. Her face was endowed with the nice Loreal makeup, and you can smell her Estee Lauder perfume coming from afar. Her sexy appeal was so strong that even Bish and Prodigal have to whistle at her. Torrants was not at all impressed by the sexy dressed barbie doll.<br><br>"Hi, Ms Hello Kathy," Bish said in a polite manner.<br><br>"Sorry, my little god of war, it is Dr Hello Kathy, and I did not go through a few years of Hell college to be called Ms. You two gods of War and Time, you are going to be done for, forever burnt in hell."<br><br>"We will stop you from causing more harm to the cyberspace with your voodoo dolls," Torrants made his stand.<br><br>"Hahahahahhahhahahahah," the demoness laughed in a seductive manner, winking at the God of War, who was slowly moving his machine gun to be ready of any assault,"You are so flattering. My voodoo dolls are just collectibles which can allow capitalists to make money. How can you misunderstand my intentions?" She switched her facial expression from a sinster laughter to a destructive manner,"You two manifestations and that includes that third guy who is standing there, will die today..."<br><br>"I am so amused," the Prodigal mused to himself. "You know villains love to declare that their enemies would lose all the time. So much for a Hollywood punchline..." He stood between a cyber reality and did not bothered.<br><br>"Die," she unleashed her staff, and it emitted three beams of light. Bish was the first to response with his machine guns, and he fired straight to the beam directed to him. However, the beam destroyed his gun in the process, and the God of War lost his first weapon. Torrants evaded the beam gracefully, and lifted his harp to play a note to destroy the beam. The prodigal just made a simple gesture and waited. The beam was about to hit him. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a series of weaves appeared and cut the beam into nothingless.<br><br>Torrants fired another attack at the sexy demoness, who tried to lift her staff for the second attack. Bish took out his heavy axe, and ran straight for her. Prodigal stood aside, be prepared for any surprise.<br><br>The battle continued. Both Bish and Torrants attempt to capture the demoness. The demoness unleashed her minions against the two manifestations. The minion to enter was Pokkamon, who threw a big disc into the air. It exploded and a purple fat dinosaur appeared and started singing,"I love you, you love me, we are happy family!!!!" The cacophony of the songs by the purple dinosaur irritated the two manifestations, as they emitted an irritation to their ears.<br><br>"Damn it!" Bish lifted his muscular right arm, and an powerful sword engulfed with flames appeared,"Go to hell, your stupid Barney, the purple dinosaur!" The God of War slashed into the purple dinosaur and it faded into oblivion!<br><br>Torrants quickly used his harp to trap Pokkamon, and the strings from his arm coiled around the little kid. However, just when he was about to totally disable the kid, the evil demoness said,"If you kill my little boy, I will not spare your beloved Mayar."<br><br>The mention of a familiar name stopped Torrants immediately. It was the name of his ex-lover. He turned to the demoness and asked ,"Where is she?"<br><br>"Follow me then!" the demoness flew into the sky. Torrants followed her without hesitation. He conjured a flying pegasus and gave chase to the demoness like those action movie car chasing scenes. Bish immediately rushed after him with his powerful chariot with 2 fiery red mares, in the fear that his fellow friend was in terrible danger.<br><br>"Don't give chase, both of you," said the prodigal,"It's a trap!" He had no choice but to go after the two manifestations.<br><br>Torrants raced across the seven seas after the demoness, followed by Bish and Prodigal (who flew onto the chariot of Bish) and took the ride to chase after him. In his heart, nothing matters more than his beloved Mayar as he recalled his poem of undying love after her...<br><br>"Send word my dear<br>the silence has sunk<br>let your epistles ring clear<br>keep me visible in your hunt<br>A go-go shall only be done<br>if your fair word avoids me now<br>tell me how much I you want<br>And I'll be back with flurry and sound."<br><br>However, the demoness suddenly stopped and looked at him with a sinister laugh. The whole environment immediately turned red. Bish and Prodigal joined the God of Time, as they realized that they were lured into some realm of existence.<br><br>Suddenly, moans and cries were heard, and mountains were on fire. The plains were bloody red, littered with skeletons, and the sky were filled with the wandering souls.<br><br>"Tell me where are we now?" Torrants asked his two other friends. Bish suddenly realized where he was lured into. The prodigal kept quiet but it seemed to the rest that he already have the answer. In front of them, there were the demoness, and suddenly, a figure materialized. It was a very handsome man with the seemingly innocent boyish face and well combed blond hair and he resembled the star of a sunken ship movie, by the name of Leonard Dicappucino, with his famous line,"If you jump, I jump..". He was dressed in white suit, and with a nice clean black tie. He gave the demoness a deep French kiss and said in a melodious voice,"Well done, my dear! Now they are trapped here in my realm.".<br><br>"Who are you?" Torrants asked in an impulsive tone,"Where is my bride, Mayar?"<br><br>"You, my little boys, Bish and Torrants, and to that man behind you are so stupid to realize where you are brought to and who you are standing before."<br><br>"Well, my friends, we are in Hell." the prodigal said in a calm manner,"and the man in front of us is none other than the owner of Hell himself." The Leonardo Dicappucino look-alike stared at Prodigal and realized that he was not as simple as he seemed to be.<br><br>Bish and Torrants were shocked at Prodigal's words, and looked straight across, that the young handsome man in front of them was none other than Lucifer S.A. Tan. It would appear that a terrible battle was about to begin in hell...<br><br>[To be continued]<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 07 February 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 07 February 2000).]</div>
