A crack of lightning shreds the night sky<br>with its crooked, razor-sharp fingers. The hungry growl of a distant<br>thunderclap follows, vibrating the window panes, and little drops of<br>water seep round the edges, where I had neglected to shut them sound.<br>The rain thumps hard at the glass, like thousands of tiny fists,<br>trailing dejectedly earthward after impact, etching clear strips in<br>the accumulated filth of weeks.   Strange, not even people seem that<br>eager to be a part of my life.  My little candle dances in its<br>makshift holder, casting upon the little room shadows seemingly tuned<br>to an identical, soundless rhythm.  A cheery little pop, the flame<br>staggers, and the shadows dance once more.<br><br>I sit and stare, at the lonely little dancing candle, shrinking<br>under the weight of its bright yellow hat, at the grosteque patterns<br>carved out of the tropical dust on the window by the raindrops, and<br>at the pinpoints of light brought about by candlelight on the beads<br>of water stuck to the glass, a king's ransom in diamonds, hopelessly<br>trapped outside my confined world.<br><br>I shift a little, and my chair groans, as if resenting my<br>adjustment.  An unseen opening admits a drought, dancing the shadows<br>and rustling some papers on my desk, one of which curls lazily off<br>the table and into a darkened corner, just conveniently out of reach.<br>I do not care.<br><br>Another thunderclap, this time more distant.  The raindrops assail<br>my window with a fraction of their former fury, as if giving up hope.<br>Some manage to sneak through the tiny crack around the edges,<br>dripping with a constant rhythm to the floor, where they vanish like<br>magic into the gnarled floorboards.  The flame beckons, and the<br>assault begins again with whiplashing fury.  Vitality renewed, the<br>howling wind returns for an encore, hissing noisily through the<br>hidden opening, scattering the remaining papers, and squeezing the<br>life out of the candleflame, till it is no more than a blue speck,<br>clinging valiantly to the blackened wick, like a poor creature<br>struggling to stay alive.  I reach out to shield it with my hands, to<br>give it a chance at a new life, something that I know through a lack<br>of to be the most precious gift of all.  The flame, which once had<br>danced at the edge of death, now stood proud again within my cupped<br>palms.  I shared its joy, and I knew it shared mine too.<br><br>The runaway papers stirred a moth, which took flight hastily, and<br>now flitted in tight little circles around the flame, casting on the<br>bare walls an exciting shadowplay of wings and antennae.  It tries to<br>get closer, but the flame singes its antennae.  It does another lap<br>then tries again, but finds nothing has changed.  It settles finally<br>on the table, wings spread neatly by its side.<br><br>That's me... the flame when it was struggling to survive, the<br>raindrops which, try as they might, cannot breach what seems so<br>deceptively non-existent as a pane of glass.  That's me...  being<br>absorbed into the woodwork after a long fall;  Me, being blown around<br>all my life, to end up in the dankest of corners;  Me, finally<br>settling down to a long rest...<br><br>I look through teary eyes at the candle, now represented in my<br>awareness as a keleidoscopic spread of brilliant, flickering lights.<br>Something I loved, but  would never become.  Filled with a sudden<br>loathing, I killed the flame.<br><br>The shadows gave a final leap, and then became One.<br><br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br>Version: PGPfreeware 6.5.3 for non-commercial use &lt;http://www.pgp.com&gt;<br><br>iQA/AwUBOV+rfPU+GuzKFqPBEQJ+CACg2IP7A/nAif4aQm+QG+LBGZKJhOoAoLD9<br>QzYJ/VW+1kigDuq+u89JeQm/<br>=CB5C<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></div>
