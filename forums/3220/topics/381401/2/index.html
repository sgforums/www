              <p>Personally, I feel that the writer of that blog post has done nothing wrong. If giving tuition is his way of making ends meet, would he not be frustrated to have it compromised by an irresponsible parent?</p>
              <p>I can imagine how irksome delayed payment can be..tutors are human as well, what makes this stomper think that he is being "venomous"?! Too bad for the parent - some tutors who do not receive payment on time especially after a notable delay refuse to continue teaching, 3 weeks here is a damn long time to be owing someone money that he deserves through his work.</p>

              <p>Don't see anything wrong about whining in the person's own blog. Even if mention the name of the people involved, it's still fair game if it was the truth.</p>

              <p>Being a tutor who was cheated out of money, I can empathise with the fella....</p>
              <p>What I can say is this:</p>
              <p>If the tutor has rendered his services, you jolly well pay for it, and on time. If you can't pay on time, tell him upfront, and pay as soon as possible. If you don't like the tutor, then just pay him what he is owed and fire him. If you can't afford to pay him, then at least have the balls to tell the tutor the truth.</p>
              <p>I once got thrown out of my tutoring job even though I was owed a month's worth of fees. Simply put, the mother just said, 'We'll call you back for more tuition' and never called again. All my calls and SMSes to them were ignored. I wanted to go up to their house and confront them, but my own mom advised me to let it slide.</p>
              <p>If the tutor has done anything wrong, it would be to curse the student openly on his blog. By all means, rant about the cheapskate parents, but leave the student out of it.</p>

              <p>No offense, but you may be a little out of touch. For lots of students, especially uni students,  it isn't a summer job kind of thing.</p>
              <p>A lot of them depend on the income from tuition to pay for their purchases, food, notes, stationaery, etc. It's their allowance so to speak, as either the family cannot afford to give them or expect them to be independent.</p>
              <p>I also know a few who do tuition to pay their tuition fees for uni as well. The tuition fees and expenses for uni aren't cheap and many families can't quite afford it.</p>
              <p>And of course there are also those who have to give tuition to supplement their family income.</p>
              <p>It's really not a small deal for every one.</p>

              <p>I also know a few who do tuition to pay their tuition fees for
              uni as well. The tuition fees and expenses for uni aren't cheap and
              many families can't quite afford it.</p>
              <p>And of course there are also those who have to give tuition to
              supplement their family income.</p>
              <p>It's really not a small deal for every one.</p>
