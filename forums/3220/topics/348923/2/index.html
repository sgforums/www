              <p>Here a lot of people say the driver should have "do something" or "some action" ?

              <p>How about the bare minimum - moving the cat onto the pavement so that it doesn't get run over again?</p>
              <p>I'm not making excuses as I already have pets. How about listening to your own words - be practical and realistic, how many strays can one take in? You cannot create more time, space and money just by "caring more".</p>
              <p>Real animal lovers would never encourage other people to buy pets unless the latter have the means. Pet shop owners do not count. I'm sorry but you've betrayed your utter ineptitude once again.</p>
