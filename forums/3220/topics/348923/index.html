              <p><span>STOMPer <strong>Elson</strong> witnessed a cat being run over by a cabby, who drove off immediately without helping the injured animal. <br><br>The STOMPer was appalled by the driver’s inhumane attitude and behaviour. <br><br>Elson says: <br><br>“Just a few hours ago (21 Feb), I witnessed a hit and run at Tampines St 43, Blk 480 at 10:45 pm. <br><br>“A taxi driver ran over a cat. It may not have been the driver’s fault, but at least he could have just stopped to see what he could have done for the poor cat. <br><br>“As a passer-by, what I could do was just to bring the cat from the road to the pavement and call the National Environment Agency. <br><br>“I stood there helplessly watching the cat die. At least there was one driver who stopped and asked if I needed help. <br><br>“People should at least have the decency to stop and try to help. What is happening to the morality of Singaporeans? Do they just care about themselves or is it that they feel that animals don’t deserve to be treated in a better way? <br><br>“It has been already 8 hours since the accident happened. The poor cat is still on the pavement despite numerous calls we made to the NEA to request for somebody to come down to help dispose of its body.”</span></p>

              <p>dude, the TS took the cat from the road and put it at the pavement.</p>
              <p>the TS probably expected the cabby to do that instead of letting it die on the road and more cars just run over its body.</p>

              <p>This brings back memories...</p>
              <p>last time i witness something even worst than this.. it was a dog. I dont know how, but the dog was stranded on AYE, near the clementi/west coast side. I was walking on the overhead bridge with a fren, then we saw this dog, lying in the middle of one of the lanes. IT WAS ALIVE!!! but one of the leg seriously injured. it was trying to make its way to the shoulder, but couldnt due to its injuries.</p>
              <p>But what I saw next is horrifying. Cars were speeding on the AYE, you cant slow down right? then the cars were going over the dog, one by one, zooming over the dog. Sometimes the dog will give out a damn painful howl or scream. VEry sad, as the cars go by I can see more and more scratches on its body. Damn painful ordeal!! Then there was this car, that stop right in front of the dog, but did nothing and in the end, still decided to go over the dog instead of lane changing. The dog was also literally drag along by the cars. Yet no one called the police. I must admit i also never call the police. I do regret not calling the police.</p>
              <p>Anyway, after half an hour had passed, I went back to the overhead bridge, the dog is already dead, with many wounds on its body, and the dog has been dragged over a distance and died in another lane (from 4 to 1).</p>
              <p>Till this day, i still regret not calling the police...</p>

              <p>Frankly the taxi driver is not wrong. If a cat suddenly go onto the road, the taxi driver if try to avoid it he would more likely to get into accident.  He should control his car that the most important.  I do not see what he should stop the car, it is a cat , nothing he could have done, if he stop , he will cause traffic jam, or other accident.</p>
              <p>We have to draw a fine line of what you need to stop for.</p>
              <p>For animal lovers who feel strongly against this - too bad , you have no rights to say anything.</p>
              <p>Why is the cat a stray ? why is it on the road ? If you love cats, bring it back home and share your home with it. If you cannot do that, then you have no right to if the cat become a stray get get kill in an accident and blame the taxi driver for whatever.</p>
              <p>If you feel so loving or decent to cats or other stray ... then bring it home !!! If not you have no bloody rights or decency to say anything.</p>

              <p>We have to be practical and realistic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want the taxi driver to stop do what ?</p>
              <p>- you want him to stop, take a stone, and put the stray cat out of misery and he get post on the stomp, and get charge in court ?</p>
              <p>- or you want him to bring the cat to the side of the road, to say sorry, pray and wait for it to die ? or bring it to a hospital and pay hundreds of dollars for it. Then great he waste all the hours, not enough to pay taxi rental, the bills, his wife and childern go hungry, he get posted on stomp - as the stupid and unkind driver who let wife and children hungry for a stray ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As i have put it to the animal lovers - bring the stray home and give it a home, then no stray = no hit and run. Yet the answer was -no time and resources !! If the so call animal lover do not care enough then they have no right to condemn the taxi driver - for no time and resources !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The real blame is people who want to love animals and then give excuse of no time and resources !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One group of these people are the orginial pet owners - they happy want to love animals then buy one, but no time and resources or animals not what they expected, then did not bother to find another home. This is how stray cats &amp; dog started !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other group is the so call animal lovers ! they go around telling people to love animals, yeap encouraging tom, dick and harry to buy pets .... which become strays !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are the people who cause the problem and should be blame for the issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stray cats and dogs is harmful to the eco system, native species are threaten by them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shameful is to use the one's brain to give excuse of no time and resources, yet surprising have all the time and resources to surf and post here !!!</p>
