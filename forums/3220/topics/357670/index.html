              <p>Being asked to "go to hell" is probably the last thing one would expect from a technical helpdesk reply, but this was exactly what a STOMPer received.</p>
              <p>In an email to the citizen journalism website, the STOMPer, who did not give his name, said that he wrote an email to Singtel's internet customer service department to resolve a technical issue.</p>
              <p>From the attachment sent by the reader, the problem seemed to have been a latency issue, in which the network or Internet service seems to run slower than it should.</p>
              <p>
              
              The reply from the technical service staff was a one liner, "Hai sir, please go to hell!"</p>
              <p>Writing about his unpleasant experience, the STOMPer said, "I called them to verify that this email address (from the reply) belongs to the ISP (Internet Service Provider).</p>
              <p>"When I showed them the email, the supervisor apologized right away and said that he would make investigations."</p>
              <p>The citizen journalism website contacted the telco, which said that the staff in question had been fired.</p>
              <p>In an email reply to STOMP, a spokesman for the company wrote:</p>
              <p>"We are very sorry for the incident and have apologised to the customer.</p>
              <p>"SingTel takes a very serious view of this matter and after our investigation, the staff has been dismissed."</p>

              <p>I am not the least surprised about it.    I had many unpleasant encounters with the singnet cusotmer service staff.  Talked politely to them - excuse me, appreciate it, thank you and so on.   What I received on my end is nasty unprofessional treatment and they dare blame me for thing that I did not do.   I kena shouted at, the customer service staff use vulgarity on me.  When they cannot handle the case, I politely asked them to transfer call to their supervisor or manager they said they will not and passed my call from one to another for a long time.   </p>
              <p>I gave them chance till I take it no more and finally I "sacked" singnet.    I quit due to the bad service.</p>
              <p>I believe singnet does not have strict control over the customer service staff and does not provide proper training.</p>
              <p>Singnet sucks!</p>
