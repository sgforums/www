              <div>STOMPer <strong>Sam</strong>'s friends met with this irrational driver, whose passenger intimidated them by claiming he was a cop from the Secret Society Branch, but was unable to show any form of identity. <br><br>The contributor's friend, whose wife was pregnant was driving cautiously up the slope of Plaza Singapura's carpark, but was honked at by an impatient driver behind. <br><br>Not happy about the speed they were driving at, the passenger of the car behind got up, and remarked that he was a Secret Society cop.  When the couple asked for an ID to prove his status, the said 'cop' was unable to do so.<br><br>Says this STOMPer, who contributed on behalf of his friend's experience: <br><br>"I would like to share with you this story about how my friend's encounter with a policeman who claimed to be from the Police Headquarters, Cantonment, 16th Level, Secret Society Branch (SSB). <br><br>"This incident happened on June 2, at Plaza Singapura's multi-storey carpark. <br><br>"My friend was driving cautiously up the slope to the carpark, for the safety of his pregnant wife beside him and the design of the humps at the carpark, that were diagonal in shape, made it even harder to manoeuvre. <br><br>"Behind my friend's MPV was a white Hyundai Tuscani SJJ8989Z,  whose driver kept honking non-stop to get his attention. <br><br>"At first, my friend continued travelling slowly but the honking got more and more irritating. <br><br>"Therefore he stopped his car, got out and walk towards the Tuscani driver's side.</div>
              <div><br>"Instead the passenger of the said car walked out, a guy in his mid 20s to 30s, with an intimidating attitude. <br><br>"Ignoring the presence of the passenger, my friend asked the driver, what his problem was. <br><br>"The passenger then passed a remark saying that he was from the Police Headquarters, Cantoment 16th Level SSB.</div>
              <div><br>"Therefore my friend ask for his warrant card or any form of ID, however he was unable to show one. <br><br>"The only response from that passenger was that my friend was driving really slow. <br><br>"My friend responded, saying that he had to go slow as his wife is pregnant, at that time, his wife came walking back to the back to take a video of the entire conversation. <br><br>"During this process, the passenger who declared that he was from the SSB panicked and walked over trying to knock of the video from my friend's wife, who was using her mobile phone. <br><br>"The passenger asked, 'What is she doing/capturing?'. <br><br>"Before my friend could say anything, he notice that there was a long golf umbrella lying on the ground of the passenger's side door. <br><br>"At this time, my friend sensed that his wife may be in danger, and hurried to block the path of the intimidating guy. <br><br>"While doing so, a third party came out from another car, and told them that if there were no injuries please move the cars to one side as there were many cars waiting behind. <br><br>"My friend took this opportunity to end the situation and walked back to his car and drove off. <br><br>"After parking his car, my friend made a police report over the phone followed by a full statement recording. <br><br>"This case is under investigation, on the charges of 'mis-use of authority, and conduct towards a civilian at a public location without proper identification', that is if the passenger turns out to be a real policeman. <br><br>"Otherwise, it will be charged under 'impersonation charges' if this guy was not a real policeman."</div>

              <p>actually, so long as it has been reported, irrespective of whether or not it is publicised in avenues like the Press and STOMP, it will be investigated with utmost urgency. This is because the proverbial good colour of the office of the organization is at stake.</p>
              <p>If the person is indeed a Police Officer, then he will be dealt with accordingly for abusing his powers. If the person is not, then various impersonation charges will be applied.</p>

              <p>I do agreed that the poser is an idiot to pose as a police officer, however sometime I do feel that some drivers are really inconsiderate. From the article, I got a feeling that the so called "victims" are not some easy going people. Who on earth will start to use a camera to record an arguement. And I seriousily do not believed someone will be honking at the other driver continously, unless the front driver is driving at a ridiculer speed. If he really so worry that the wife is not able to take the ride, why don't he drop her off at the entrance.</p>
              <p>If drivers are more considerate in driving, then driving in Singapore will become more pleasant!!</p>
