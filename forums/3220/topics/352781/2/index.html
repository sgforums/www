              <p>I do not see any pleasure in these unsubstantiated postings.</p>
              <p>If there are no pictures, then at least it may count as a simple rant. And the subject of the rant may well be Mr Tan Ah Kow from Jurong or Mr Mat bin Salleh from Tampines. At least there's nothing to identify the person.</p>
              <p>By taking photos and posting it online, it may well be defamation.</p>
              <p>The man in the picture might be able to sue, and he might be able to win. No joke.</p>
              <p>With what I've seen in STOMP, the scenario I gave is entirely plausible.... and I don't believe you'd take pleasure in being the subject of the STOMP posting if that happens.</p>

              <p>Another story that I have to share but yet reflects on ugly Singaporean behaviour is opposite to this story.</p>
              <p>The bus was crowded and my friends and I boarded the bus early and some of us happened to be on the priority seats. Suddenly, I heard an old man raising his voice at my friend asking her very impolitely to get out of her seat and saying that this is a priority seat. I was damn pissed. I could tell very obviously that my friend just didn't see this old man, otherwise, she would have given up her seat anyway.</p>
              <p>So I told that old man that he could have asked politely and that old man argued with me and asked me not to bully him and he could speak english too. I was so pissed I would have argued with him all the way back.</p>
              <p>Upon transiting at the MRT station, that old man, went into the MRT, saw another person on the priority seat and started shouting at the person again.</p>
              <p>I mean, please give some reaction time even if one is expecting the person to give up his seat. Its a priviledge, not an entitlement, we pay the same fares.</p>

              <p>even if everything you posted here happened, i still think the "ben" posting this up is more of a dick than the father</p>
              <p>who appointed him judge and jury? so if the father don't want to give up his seat its the father's problem not ben's. why didn't he take pictures of the entire carriage and post it up to show all the rest who never gave up their seats? the guy said no, whats wrong with that reply? is there only one seat in the whole train? only one person ben can ask?</p>
              <p>so because ben thinks its correct to do so its suddenly ok to post someone elses picture to shame him online? who's the ugly singaporean here?</p>

              <p>even if everything you posted here happened, i still think the "ben" posting this up is more of a dick than the father</p>
              <p>who appointed him judge and jury? so if the father don't want to give up his seat its the father's problem not ben's. why didn't he take pictures of the entire carriage and post it up to show all the rest who never gave up their seats? the guy said no, whats wrong with that reply? is there only one seat in the whole train? only one person ben can ask?</p>
              <p>so because ben thinks its correct to do so its suddenly ok to post someone elses picture to shame him online? who's the ugly singaporean here?</p>

If u really are cultured, every seat is a priority seat. They should have painted those seats luminous yellow instead of dark blue anyway.</p></div>

              <p>Another story that I have to share but yet reflects on ugly Singaporean behaviour is opposite to this story.</p>
              <p>The bus was crowded and my friends and I boarded the bus early and some of us happened to be on the priority seats. Suddenly, I heard an old man raising his voice at my friend asking her very impolitely to get out of her seat and saying that this is a priority seat. I was damn pissed. I could tell very obviously that my friend just didn't see this old man, otherwise, she would have given up her seat anyway.</p>
              <p>So I told that old man that he could have asked politely and that old man argued with me and asked me not to bully him and he could speak english too. I was so pissed I would have argued with him all the way back.</p>
              <p>Upon transiting at the MRT station, that old man, went into the MRT, saw another person on the priority seat and started shouting at the person again.</p>
              <p>I mean, please give some reaction time even if one is expecting the person to give up his seat. Its a priviledge, not an entitlement, we pay the same fares.</p>
