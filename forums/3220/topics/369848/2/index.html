                                      priorities, which was exactly what happened during the medieval
                                      eras or war periods</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So you have personally experienced what happened during those time periods to truly make a comparison? I'm only making a comparison with &lt;10 years ago of true self personal experience.</p>
              <p>Like that you might as well start comparing that police wear shorts in the past.</p>

              <p>Teachers these days often take the job for the

                                      resulting in heavy problems because I have seen at least 80% of new
                                      trainees causing even top classes to have drops in results.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Ask yourself why there are so many new trainees. If it was such a good job, the job would be overflowing with teachers, and not 80% trainees!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Majority of students will have a certain amount of respect for
                                      the teacher. I don't think the mainstream will openly assault the
                                      teacher or anything right? However if a teacher does go overboard
                                      then a student has every right to voice out his/her opinion. That's
                                      pretty fair if you ask me. If you haven't realised people in the
                                      past have lived a far worse life than you or I have, which means
                                      that the laws and times are changing and if you can't accept it
                                      then it's best not to say anything.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No, I don't see respect from your words. Of course, you should voice your opinion if the teacher goes overboard. But to say teachers should expect kids behaviour from students? And tolerate it?</p>
              <p>By your words that "teachers these days often take the job for the
                                      sake of having a job, and not really because they want to teach", it has already shown your attitude. <strong>You view them as there for the money, and not for the passion. Any teachers that has passion will be swiftly swept down as for the money.</strong> Like wow!</p>

              <p>Its simply flawed or  must say "retarded"(I'm sorry about

                                      with the modern era, because I can easily compare it with the
                                      education system in fascist countries way before your time and see
                                      the difference. Simply put, the education system is getting
                                      different each generation and basing it on your time is a very
                                      biased attitude.</p>

              <p>I'm comparing during my time, which was late 90s.</p>
              <p>Yes the education system is getting different. And from my observations, it's getting worse. Not only the students, but the whole system itself is getting more flawed in my opinions.</p>

                                      against your beliefs I become a rowdy gangster with no life and
                                      wants to kill the teacher? Seriously? A teacher is there to teach

              <p>Some are there for the money, I won't disagree. But some, because there are many who quit because their passion for teaching were not recognized nor respected by students!</p>
              <p>Ask yourself if you have appreciated that your teacher spent sleepless night preparing your lessons, marking your worksheets and assignments, setting test papers that will help you understand concepts and score for your final O levels or A levels. OR do you merely think in your heart that they are paid to do so, so no point appreciating it?</p>
              <p>There are just so many minor things that teachers do, and sacrifice, just to get the job done for students. But have students like you put yourself into their shoes and think?</p>
              <p><strong>You really think their job is only stay in school to give lessons and nothing else?</strong></p>

              <p>Hmm so supposedly "students like me" become the cause of the

                                      and I don't really want to know. Stress is found in every
                                      profession, and from what I know many who go into the private
                                      sector have problems of mental health as well. Many factors cause
                                      this stress, from paperwork stress or personal problems. Its just
                                      stupid to place students as a major cause of it, do you realise
                                      that customer service officers have to face problems
                                      with   customers as well? The reason for the turnover
                                      rates could also be due to the capitalism built up and economy? The
                                      same is going for doctors as well isn't it? No offence but It seems
                                      to me that you are just making a general stereotype like all other

              <p>That's just an excuse for your obvious disrespect.</p>

              <p>And your final sentence in this quoted statement has totally no link. This is not about tradition, this is about respect and empathy, which students like you are clearly lacking.</p>
              <p>You think from what you see of the teacher at the frontal line of their jobs. But do you know the sacrifices they have to make for you at the backlines? You don't see it, so you don't feel it at all.</p>

              <p>I didn't even bother to put any insults. There's no need to when disrespect from students are all over the place.</p>
              <p>A teacher can teach well, and packets of students can go and complain the teacher is boring, and don't understand the lessons, etc. A teacher can do many things for the students to help them, yet packets of students can go and say that's because the teacher is like a dog.</p>
              <p>And a teacher can spend lots of time marking your papers and making sure you understand the concepts, and students like you would say it's because they are paid to do so.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Alright this is going to take a while…and my lack my knowledge to quote replies on this forum is making it worse. Anyway lets begin. The first point, the education system, as I have mentioned like a 100 times before, is changing. Whether its for the better or worse is not for you to decide, and comparing it with your time is very biased because during your time, people compared your education system with that of the era of Japan’s occupation. And you said it as well, like that also might as well compare that police used to wear shorts. And I really had to facepalm myself yet again…by 80% of trainees I meant that 80% of the teachers that weren’t officially hired yet. If you can’t even get that then…(Insert words here)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Next, did I ever say that they were there for the money? Most students as I mentioned will tolerate a teacher despite the unreasonable-ness. Have you heard of students assaulting or even shooting the teachers like in the United States on the news? Did I just hear a no? I’m sorry but it seems that you can’t get any of my messages at all. You keep assuming that I am a disrespectful student who goes against the teacher and all that, I don’t know if you’ll believe me but I do have a lot of respect for a lot of my teachers and I won’t be a douchebag by being openly rebellious to the teacher.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Oh and the gangster part was a gross exaggeration, a type of sarcasm message that I SUPPOSED that someone of your intelligence could get. It seems that you don’t. Anyway did I say that a teacher is there just to teach? I meant to say that that was the job requirements for the students.(I don’t know how to get it across, I’m just crumbling words together to form a sentence in this paragraph). Quite obviously a teacher does a lot more than that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And yes I do appreciate my teacher’s work a lot, and so does a lot of my classmates. But can you deny that the teachers who have passion are the minorities? We are in an Asian country, so you can imagine that students will listen to the teachers to a certain extent. Many a times I hear the school staff say retarded staff and no one seems to say anything…if it were elsewhere maybe things would be different. So just because a couple of gangsters decide to screw up a teachers life the entire generation becomes bad. I mentioned it before and I will say it again, whether the education system is getting better or worse is not up to you to decide.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And I don’t know if it’s a debating strategy but you keep saying “students like you..students like you..students like you”. Seriously, I will accept that you are older and have more experience than me, but form the way you present yourself here with sweeping statements just make me shake my head. And yeah the turnover rates do mean that teachers could bail out because of the economy, it matches in case you haven’t noticed it -.-</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Anyway by making a statement like that, you ignore the numbers who are there on scholarships, who have better job prospects or those who didn’t even have the passion to begin with. Students were also equally as bad during the 90s(Since you always compare it with your previous times) in many of the western and eastern countries with riots, revolts and even open insults to the teachers. Can you deny that? <span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">An excuse? It seems to me that you are only seeing me as “Ah your just a kid…we adults know better” which is true but flawed if you look at it from another point of view. This is a forum by the way…go to stomp and you’ll see a horde of other comments that people definitely won’t say in the real life. Conjuring up stories about me based on tiny little flaws in my comments is clearly a lack of balanced view.</span></p>

Did I forget to mention that<strong> he held a weapon to a 6-year old? </strong>The replies that came with it wasnt pleasing either. The teacher was forced to do that...was threatened by the students and had his head climbed over by students? Seriously? Look at the whole picture for God's sake.

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Alright this is going to take a while…and
                  my lack my knowledge to quote replies on this forum is making
                  it worse. Anyway lets begin. The first point, the education system,
                  as I have mentioned like a 100 times before, is changing. Whether
                  its for the better or worse is not for you to decide, and comparing
                  it with your time is very biased because during your time, people
                  compared your education system with that of the era of Japan’s
                  occupation. And you said it as well, like that also might as well
                  compare that police used to wear shorts. And I really had to
                  facepalm myself yet again…by 80% of trainees I meant that 80% of
                  the teachers that weren’t officially hired yet. If you can’t even
                  get that then…(Insert words here)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Next, did I ever say that they were there
                  for the money? Most students as I mentioned will tolerate a teacher
                  despite the unreasonable-ness. Have you heard of students
                  assaulting or even shooting the teachers like in the United States
                  on the news? Did I just hear a no? I’m sorry but it seems that you
                  can’t get any of my messages at all. You keep assuming that I am a
                  disrespectful student who goes against the teacher and all that, I
                  don’t know if you’ll believe me but I do have a lot of respect for
                  a lot of my teachers and I won’t be a douchebag by being openly
                  rebellious to the teacher.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Oh and the gangster part was a gross
                  exaggeration, a type of sarcasm message that I SUPPOSED that
                  someone of your intelligence could get. It seems that you don’t.
                  Anyway did I say that a teacher is there just to teach? I meant to
                  say that that was the job requirements for the students.(I don’t
                  know how to get it across, I’m just crumbling words together to
                  form a sentence in this paragraph). Quite obviously a teacher does
                  a lot more than that.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And yes I do appreciate my teacher’s work a
                  lot, and so does a lot of my classmates. But can you deny that the
                  teachers who have passion are the minorities? We are in an Asian
                  country, so you can imagine that students will listen to the
                  teachers to a certain extent. Many a times I hear the school staff
                  say retarded staff and no one seems to say anything…if it were
                  elsewhere maybe things would be different. So just because a couple
                  of gangsters decide to screw up a teachers life the entire
                  generation becomes bad. I mentioned it before and I will say it
                  again, whether the education system is getting better or worse is
                  not up to you to decide.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And I don’t know if it’s a debating
                  strategy but you keep saying “students like you..students like
                  you..students like you”. Seriously, I will accept that you are
                  older and have more experience than me, but form the way you
                  present yourself here with sweeping statements just make me shake
                  my head. And yeah the turnover rates do mean that teachers could
                  bail out because of the economy, it matches in case you haven’t
                  noticed it -.-</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Anyway by making a statement like that, you
                  ignore the numbers who are there on scholarships, who have better
                  job prospects or those who didn’t even have the passion to begin
                  with. Students were also equally as bad during the 90s(Since you
                  always compare it with your previous times) in many of the western
                  and eastern countries with riots, revolts and even open insults to
                  the teachers. Can you deny that? <span> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">An excuse? It seems to me that you are only
                  seeing me as “Ah your just a kid…we adults know better” which is
                  true but flawed if you look at it from another point of view. This
                  is a forum by the way…go to stomp and you’ll see a horde of other
                  comments that people definitely won’t say in the real life.
                  Conjuring up stories about me based on tiny little flaws in my
                  comments is clearly a lack of balanced view.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Like I said before, I don’t know if it’s a

              <p>2) If you do not know, trainees means NIE trainees. They are already officially hired by NIE, and being a trainee means they are in the 2nd semester of NIE course. Yes, facepalm yourself again.</p>
              <p>3) Yes, you mentioned money, albeit indirectly. If not why do you need to tell me they are there for the sake of a job?</p>
              <p>4) For your gross exaggeration, is that the way you are taught for debates or discussions? I would have thought you were more intelligent than that.</p>
              <p>5) It's good that you appreciate your teachers efforts. Keep it up.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Being a tutor, I can tell you that some students do complain to me about their teachers. But I always tell them about the behind scenes of a teacher...</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">What I guess about you now, that you are likely a good student (from a well-known school as well?) and do not know how some schools or students can behave. I'm not going to name the schools... All I know is, you are likely to be like most of my students, a good student...</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">It could be true that students in my time (O levels in 1999 for me) were already behaving as I have mentioned, I wouldn't know, I admit. And being in my secondary school, I was "sheltered" from the real behaviours of most students. We respect our teachers, although there were grouses here and there.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Work hard to score well. Your language is good; you have potential. Don't worry about those troubles or politics now. The best time of your life is being a student.</p>

There are good students and bad students, most of the students are just in between. I don’t know what kind of students you have seen but when you keep mentioning “students like you..students like you” it really really makes your entire text seem negative.</span></p>

No doubt there are other stuff, but that’s the main reason why schools exists. I really don’t see the need for corporal punishments and nazi-like obedience. Like if a student REALLY forgotten to do his/her project then so be it. Hand it in the next day. There is no need for things like insane scoldings or childish punishments like kneeling on marbles. I know that work is like that but some of the homework/projects that were given are redundant, and many teachers can’t seem to see reason. They just assume that the student is “lazy”.</span></p>

Another reason why students don’t respect adults that much other than those I have mentioned is that many don’t display themselves as mature enough. Just pop by stomp and you’ll see that 70% of the threads are gender bashing threads by..adults? And no I am not form any well-known school. In fact I’m from what may be considered as a “neighbourhood school” (A ridiculous term in my opinion).

              <p>1) The number of teachers leaving is also a lot. Good point there.</p>
              <p>And being a tutor, I actually find the stuff that students are learning easier and easier. Because MOE is going for syllabus reduction... Many topics are taken out... In fact, I don't see how it ramps up at all... Hmmm... You inspired me to maybe write an article titled "Then and Now" about the education syllabus before and now... Learning more with less, I don't buy it</p>
              <p>2) See, you are talking about money already.</p>
              <p>3) First part, disagree. 2nd part agreed. Nuff said</p>
              <p>6) Sure. I'm already convinced by your difference, as I have already said.</p>
              <p>7) 1st part you will understand when in JC or uni. 2nd part, I'm not even comparing with 20 years ago, but with something less than 10 years ago. Again, it could be that I was "sheltered" from these happenings as I have said.</p>
              <p>8) Corporal punishments and nazi-like obedience is a definite no-no, even 10 years ago. If a student forgot the work, it depends on the day-to-day attitude of the student. Of course, if you are usually a conscientious student, nothing will happen.</p>
              <p>9) :D</p>
              <p>10) Stomp is dumb. Forget it.</p>
              <p>Neighbourhood schools are still good schools. I have had students from so-called lousier schools scoring A1s for the subjects I taught. Or improving from fail to B3 in a matter of 1.5 months for E maths O levels.</p>
              <p>As long as students have the will and motivation, given the right strategy, confirm can score.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi I’m back. Sigh..you still don’t get it do you..Firstly many of my teachers have told me how the MOE have implemented in new topics that were once present in higher levels. In fact, take molecular genetics for example, it used to be in the tertiary levels. Anyway I really don’t know where you got your information from, because form what I’ve heard the syllabus is only getting more muggish as the year passes. Quoted from websites, teachers and reliable sources. And the “teach less learn more” policy is bullshit, no one practices it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Okay so I won’t even bother quoting your point forms anymore, firstly the main role of a teacher is to teach his/her students. If the students doesn’t listen, then they lose out, if the teacher is bad, expect criticism. Note that democracy emerged victorious so anyone can whatever they want. Secondly, I thought about your comment on students complaining to the higher-ups about teachers being boring and asked myself. Hey that’s not true because that’s something that is discussed privately, no idiot would openly tell the higher-ups. That works for the real world as well. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Nextly, the reason I brought other countries into this is because you kept commenting about how students were so obedient during the 90s and criticize the current generation. Well since you compare us with the 90s, whats the difference between comparing your time with that of the education system before your time?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And no offence but I don’t know why many people don’t seem to listen to advice from people younger than them in a true manner just because of a first impression. Maybe it’s a human thing I don’t know. But its like a senior in a company looks at a new employee with jaundiced eyes and a new employee looks at students with the same way. Ask yourself this, if we happen to know each other in real life and I happen to be an adult with a successful career, would the bases of your replies be the same? And a lot can happen in a span of 10 years, including the thinking, the trend, everything. Remember the USSR that was still present when you were schooling? Well now its gone and so has the previous thinking. Its not a matter of respect, it’s a matter of changing what is meant by it. Good day sir.</span></p>

              <p>Yes, those topics were once higher levels, but they had been simplified tremendously to bring down to O levels. It isn't any much harder. I'm not going to start on your teachers, but I would dare say that there will definitely be complains that they have to set new questions never set before, new notes, new powerpoints, etc.</p>
              <p>And where I got my information from? FYI, I did sec sch and jc from 1996-2001, then tutor students from 2002 to 2009. Of course I know the differences from then to now. And I can say, it's easier.</p>
              <p>You want examples? Simple. For sec sch: APGP was in O levels, but it's supposedly a killer in A levels now, and many students are dying from it, which I have no idea why.</p>
              <p>For A levels, curve sketching and stats was done without the use of graphic calculators. Students have the benefit of graphic calculators now.</p>
              <p>For O level physics? The whole nuclear physics is now out of syllabus. <br>For A level physics? You don't need to do Op-amps and Physics of Fluids, but replaced with the simpler Semiconductor physics.</p>
              <p>I won't go on with subjects I don't know about. Harder now? I seriously doubt it. Other than perhaps only for JC H2 maths as compared to C maths in the past.</p>

              <p>You have no idea of classroom management? If the student don't listen, but sleeps in class, so be it. But if the student disturbs other students or disturbs the class?</p>
              <p>Next, students nowadays demand much more multimedia, and I have no idea why. I happened to hear that many students complain boring when a teacher merely used the traditional transparencies + whiteboard. What has students become nowadays?</p>
              <p>3rd, if you think that's not true, think again. It could be direct, and it could be indirect. This happened to a school somewhere very west, but it's supposed to be one of the most notorious schools though. Not going to elaborate, but just telling you that such things do happen. And it's a serious sign of disrespect.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Still no link to bring in other countries.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">And I can tell you that for my time and the generation before me, teachers are still treated much more respectably than now. The main difference was that teachers in the previous generation was allowed to cane students.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">But still, there's no point comparing especially if you cannot see in the shoes of people your senior. Do it this way and you will fail terribly in initial job or scholarship interviews. Why? Because the interviewers will likely not be of your generation. It's not about comparing me and my previous generation; I'm past that stage but you are not. It's about you. Your prospects of promotion, doing well, etc, depends both on yourself, and the "adult" accessing you.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">There's also no point talking about a what-if as well, because you have indeed not been in the working world. Furthermore, if you are, as you said, someone (I wouldn't use the word adult) already with a successful career, and saying the same words as you have now yet not being a teacher, I would regard you as all talk no action only. I said the same thing to this full-time tutor who tells me how good the teaching profession is, etc etc, yet he tells me he do not want to be a teacher. Like huh?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Seriously, the world is about credibility. In business, at work, or anything, it's all about it. You asked why people don't listen to others younger than them? I can tell you that's BS (pardon for that word though :D ). Example, if you are a teacher, and you tell me it's indeed rewarding to be a one even though students are [fill in adjectives], I will give you respect. The credibility is there because you are a teacher. But then are you?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Or supposed you are a successful businessman at age 25, younger than me. You give tips on how to do businesses to people aged more than 30. Would they listen to you?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">It's all about credibility. You have zero outside world experience; how could you expect people to treat you seriously? Think about this. If you haven't even prove yourself in a certain area, why should people believe you in that area? Supposed a classmate of yours fail physics consistently, and come to tutor or teach you, an A student, and tell you that you are wrong when you are very sure you are correct. How much confidence would you have?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">There are reasons why the current generation of kids are termed as the "strawberry generation" which I'm not going to go into. But were my generation of students, or the one before, or the one even before, been termed as such? No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, this is a very recent case, happened only a day ago. A student got cut by his own penknife in this particular school because he was mischievous and playing with the penknife. Somehow, his father was led to believe that his son was involved in a fight. This father called the form teacher at 6.30pm, and who had no idea what happened because the teacher wasn't even at the scene, and gave a dressing down on why he wasn't informed.</p>
              <p>I don't need to go into details into the threats he gave about reporting to higher authorities, but this is a clear case of verbal assault on the teacher by the parent.</p>
              <p>And this is supposedly from one of the better schools in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This case was covered up from most students. So even if it happened in your school, you wouldn't know it too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similarly, the same goes for SAF. Many things are covered up unless they are blown to big proportions. But do you or would you know anything?</p>
              <p>Simply put, things are not as simple as you have put it. I can go on and on and on about examples.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, don't bother about all these now. Study hard for your Os ok? :D</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hello sir, I apologise for the late reply.<span>  </span>First of all, the simplification that was implemented in the topics cannot cover the fact that the basics of the new topics is still the same, it may seem easy to you but certainly not to many students who haven’t had the experience of going through the “O” Levels before. For your next point, I believe that this APGP subject was brought into the A Levels because many students could not take it back when it was in the “O” level syllabus. Our textbooks and combination start off more complicated than that of many other nations and I can accept it. However amendments need to be made to fit in with the changing world. The reason you can’t see why students are “dying” from this subject is perhaps because everyone’s mind is different. Maybe you could have understood it when you were schooling, but many of your peers then didn’t.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Here’s an example for the next point. Students in secondary schools get calculators as compared to their elementary school counterparts. So why exactly aren’t they getting the 90-100/100 like them. That’s because the questions are set in a different manner. And yes it is getting harder because of the rising level of competition, the setting of the syllabus to be more muggish rather than realistic and because we have many unimportant and unproductive activities which will affect our studies but are somehow implemented. I don’t want to mention further incase I’m being too politically incorrect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If a student disturbs the other students then a teacher has the right to send him/her out for punishments. If the student decides to be a prick then he/she’s<span>  </span>an idiot, but he/she has the right to say whatever the heck he/she wants. However in recent cases, teachers seem to get more and more childish and unreasonable. Many a times I see teachers trying really hard to outsmart <span> </span>to some troublemaking students with really flawed logics and reasoning. Whenever I hear that I’ll just shiver, but won’t say anything. How many times have you heard the statement “If you aren’t happy then just get out of my class”, or “I’ll have an easier time if I don’t mark your work” and silence erupts. Which dumbshit(Sorry about his) will stand up and walk out, or say “Okay then I’ll lessen your workload”. Those that do suddenly becomes rude rebellious and the teachers like yourself(yet again..sorry) will begin criticizing the new generation and such. Your next statement has no link…but I’ll comment about it anyways. Never have I seen anyone complain about the lack of multimedia. Maybe about the teaching..maybe about school but the multimedia. Find me a teenager’s blog who says that because that’s the <strong>weirdest </strong>thing I’ve heard. And alright so students complain about teachers being boring…but that’s their opinion. Did those students disrupt the class, vandalise the property and assault the teacher? So they found it boring and decide to express their opinion and oops, their now the isolated bunch of kids.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Oh there is a link alright. Our ancestors were either natives of Temasek, immigrants from the China or forcefully brought here by the British from India. So quite obviously when we talk about the education system, we should compare it with that of the world. It’s like saying “Hey we should all spit on the floor because it’s happening in Singapore. Who cares what’s going on in the world”. And did you know that students during the British occupation were allowed<span>  </span>to express their freedom of speech to their teachers and not get insulted by random people around the island? And in the case of scholarships and jobs, quite obviously I won’t tell them what I just told you. Example: An interviewer in a university asks an applicant “Why do you want to study medicine?”. So the applicant replies “Because I have a <strong>passion for medicine</strong>, because I love to <strong>help people,</strong> <span> </span>because I want to be part of a <strong>revolutionary advancement in the world</strong>, because I want <strong>to serve my country</strong>” But in their minds all they see are the paycheck and social standing in the world. Yes I have seen people like that who somehow got in. You can’t deny it. But in this case we are talking about the complains of adults about the new generation of students. I’m not going to bother to put up an act because there are such things as opinion. Like you mentioned before, “might as well compare that policemen in the past where shorts”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And you still don’t get my points about that phrase I made. Its not about what you think of me, but its about what the first impression is. Look at your first reply for example. I said that some of the replies here defending the teacher in the thread are crazy because hes obviously in the wrong and even you can see it. But then I get a reply from you stating how I don’t appreciate teachers <span> </span>and how I am like all other students who is pampered yada yada and done. I didn’t even start to mention about what adults thought of students and immediately I become a spoilt child who doesn’t care about my teachers. And then comes your comparison with the past. This reply is for your next paragraph as well. I didn’t say its rewarding to be a teacher, but rather since teachers know about the problems with kids nowadays, why still go into it? Every job has its problems and this is the problem for this job in this generation apparently.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">“There are reasons why the current generation of kids are termed as the "strawberry generation" which I'm not going to go into. But were my generation of students, or the one before, or the one even before, been termed as such? No.” Oh really? How about British veterans who criticize anyone borned after their age. How about the millions involved in the previous conflicts call those living in your era (90s I assume) a pampered group of birds? Yes they exist. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And see yet again another example of a first impression. So the father was an idiot for not getting things sorted out, but eventually it’s the students who covered it up? Not the parents? Not the school committee? Just a group of students who weren’t involved in this incident and couldn’t care less about the school’s reputation? Sigh. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The reason why I keep replying is because I don’t really like people who can’t accept changes and respect other’s behaviour. (No offence). If you can’t then so be it, but insulting others for not seeing the same way as you do is really..you know. There was a thread before about music(Not here) and how it has changed. The thread starter began insulting modern music and calling everyone who like modern music rubbish and stuff. Immediately the thread had a large group of replies who agreed with him and starting insulting modern music..making me just look down on these people a lot? So a teenager like rap, that’s his choice, he doesn’t like classics, that’s his choice. Accept it or just keep quiet. <span> </span>There was also another incident whereby people suggested shortening the term of conscription in Singapore. As usual I see ex-servicemen coming on the site and talking about how they endured hardships and stuff during their times and how scared cowardly and (profanity here) the new generation is. The thread started off with statistics and constructive comments, until they came in and<span>  </span>took the chance to tell people about their stories. It happens in the real world as well. Our forefathers suffered a far worse fate then us, and yet they aren’t boasting about their achievements. But a couple of second generation<span>  </span>SAF members who think they got the brawls trying to act tough? Yet again Sigh..</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Anyway don’t worry I’m not really thinking about this. Which explains why I only reply on the weekends. Thanks for the goodwishes as well.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hello sir, I apologise for the late
                                          reply.<span> </span> First of all, the simplification
                                          that was implemented in the topics cannot cover the fact that the
                                          basics of the new topics is still the same, it may seem easy to you
                                          but certainly not to many students who haven’t had the experience
                                          of going through the “O” Levels before.<strong> For your next point, I
                                          believe that this APGP subject was brought into the A Levels
                                          because many students could not take it back when it was in the “O”
                                          level syllabus.</strong> Our textbooks and combination start off more
                                          complicated than that of many other nations and I can accept it.
                                          However amendments need to be made to fit in with the changing
                                          world. The reason you can’t see why students are “dying” from this
                                          subject is perhaps because everyone’s mind is different. Maybe you
                                          could have understood it when you were schooling, but many of your
                                          peers then didn’t.</span></p>

              <p>Huh?</p>
              <p>First you ask me where I got my information from that it's harder nowadays. Then you tell me because it's harder, that's why it's moved to A levels.</p>
              <p>Make up your mind please.</p>
              <p>As a tutor, I know which topics most students have more problems in, and which are not. That's why I can say why it's easier or harder. It's easy to console oneself that one didn't do as well as one's senior because the syllabus is harder now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, don't apologize for replying at any time leh. This is a forum, there's nothing stopping you from deciding to reply 1 week from now or etc. You have all the rights to do so; there's nothing wrong at all. I'm busy enough not to check the forum every few minutes nowadays.</p>

                                          Students in secondary schools get calculators as compared to their
                                          elementary school counterparts. So why exactly aren’t they getting
                                          the 90-100/100 like them. That’s because the questions are set in a
                                          different manner. And yes it is getting harder because of the
                                          rising level of competition, the setting of the syllabus to be more
                                          muggish rather than realistic and because we have many unimportant

                                          other’s behaviour. (No offence). If you can’t then so be it, but
                                          insulting others for not seeing the same way as you do is
                                          really..you know. There was a thread before about music(Not here)
                                          and how it has changed. The thread starter began insulting modern
                                          music and calling everyone who like modern music rubbish and stuff.
                                          Immediately the thread had a large group of replies who agreed with
                                          him and starting insulting modern music..making me just look down
                                          on these people a lot? So a teenager like rap, that’s his choice,
                                          he doesn’t like classics, that’s his choice. Accept it or just keep
                                          quiet. <span> </span>There was also another incident
                                          whereby people suggested shortening the term of conscription in
                                          Singapore. As usual I see ex-servicemen coming on the site and
                                          talking about how they endured hardships and stuff during their

                                          generation is. The thread started off with statistics and
                                          constructive comments, until they came in and<span> </span> took the chance to tell people about their
                                          stories. It happens in the real world as well. Our forefathers
                                          suffered a far worse fate then us, and yet they aren’t boasting

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1)Yeah its my fault, I have no idea what APGP is. But the reason why they moved it into A levels is probably because the students taking it when it was in the o levels couldn’t take it. And that’s just a single example compared to others which made the syllabus harder. Refer back.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2)I’ll simplify it. Syllabus is “simplified” with calculators but questions are harder.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3)Oh it doesn’t matter if your not a teacher. You get my message. Just make a comment online that contradicts with the traditional beliefs and say you’re a student. See how many “The new generation is (Insert insults here)” and you get my point. And seriously if that “school in the west” apparently has students who vandalises property, assaults teachers and complain to higher-ups openly then I see where this is going. Because assuming what you say is correct, quite obviously those are the worse of the bunch, something that shouldn’t be the general assumption of students.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">4)Yes I have. Not the exact interview itself but yes. And you just contradicted yourself again sorry.<span>  </span>“doctors-to-be hear what I have to say then not happy”. This shows that you are clearly aware of the fact that most medical students go into the interview thinking that they will get a good job with a high social standing. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">5)As with you good sir. I said <strong>first impression, </strong>yes I am aware that you changed your statement later but I was referring to your first reply :)</span></p>

              <p>You know, I don't know if it's just me but users in this forum seems to find every single chance to bash at the current generation of youths and "preach" about their experience. Anyway back to the topic. It seems that the MOE has lowered its standards of employees to the economic crisis. Holding a sharp weapon and using it as a threat against a mere 7-year old is definitely not something that can be covered up, especially in a world like this. As described by the parent, the entire class was watching and could be influenced easily. Imagine if they used that form of violence to settle problems in the future...it would be disastrous.</p>
              <p>I can't believe some of the comments here as well. We aren't living in a medieval era sirs/ma'ams where people become pages at 5 years old, trying to cover up for such an action with I must say...random reasons is just flawed. Teachers undergo alot of training and receive a job that could last for a decade. I'm not saying that all teachers should be the perfect goody-two-shoes white ladies on those American movies, but at least have the basic patience not to vent your troubles on a kid. When they decided to become a teacher they should expect some kids to be like that.</p>
              <p>Many replies here state that teachers are being bullied...and the kids are being too pampered yada yada and alot of other stuff. But haven't anyone realised that you too were pampered as compared to your forefathers etc etc. I highly doubt so, most likely comments made from the mouth. The excuse that "good" teachers are bailing out on teaching because they can't take it or whatever is pretty pathetic if you ask me. Teachers during the war era had to handle a far worse predicament than the teachers nowdadays have to. I don't know if it's a trend here but many people here say that kids are too pampered and they were alot more mature but don't do any form of research or actually look at the change. I'm sorry for being direct but that's what I feel.</p>

              <p><br>About the part where you said this forum is finding "every single chance to bash at the current generation of youths and "preach" about their experience". I'm guessing you don't agree that the kids nowadays are getting more street smart?</p>
              <p>Teachers may sometimes use unappropriate methods to educate and punish kids, but one thing is for sure, these kids ain't innocent little angels either. (since the age of the internet, kids have long lost their angels wings)</p>
              <p>What i'm saying is that, when it comes to kids vs teachers sort of case, we as bystanders can't presume that it's the teacher from hell, or the poor little kids who got wrongly punished by the kids.</p>
