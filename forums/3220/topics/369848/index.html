              <div>An 'impatient, young' teacher threatened to cut off the ear of STOMPer <strong>Ong</strong>'s
              7-year-old son because of his poor handwriting. The teacher was
              allegedly holding a pair of scissors when she delivered the threat in
              front of the whole class.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In the STOMPer's email dated Jul 26:</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"My son who is 7 years old, is studying in Hong Wen school as a primary one student.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"He was threathened by his form teacher to cut off his ears
              because of his 'not so perfect' handwriting. The impatient young form
              teacher abused him verbally and made threats of physical harm.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"She held a pair of scissors at my boy, threathening to cut off
              his ears! My boy cried while moving backwards to avoid the scissor and
              the teacher.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"This incident traumatised him badly.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"The school principal has apologised but we do not feel the sincerity from the form teacher.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"We have written to MOE for investigation.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"I must also stress that the whole class of P1 students was
              watching the whole incident. They may have learnt to use threatening
              objects at one another from her.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"This is extremely unhealthy for the kids' emotional development.
              As a parent, it is within my rights to contact MOE and to let other
              parents that such teachers exist!"</div>

              <p>You know, I don't know if it's just me but users in this forum seems to find every single chance to bash at the current generation of youths and "preach" about their experience. Anyway back to the topic. It seems that the MOE has lowered its standards of employees to the economic crisis. Holding a sharp weapon and using it as a threat against a mere 7-year old is definitely not something that can be covered up, especially in a world like this. As described by the parent, the entire class was watching and could be influenced easily. Imagine if they used that form of violence to settle problems in the future...it would be disastrous.</p>
              <p>I can't believe some of the comments here as well. We aren't living in a medieval era sirs/ma'ams where people become pages at 5 years old, trying to cover up for such an action with I must say...random reasons is just flawed. Teachers undergo alot of training and receive a job that could last for a decade. I'm not saying that all teachers should be the perfect goody-two-shoes white ladies on those American movies, but at least have the basic patience not to vent your troubles on a kid. When they decided to become a teacher they should expect some kids to be like that.</p>
              <p>Many replies here state that teachers are being bullied...and the kids are being too pampered yada yada and alot of other stuff. But haven't anyone realised that you too were pampered as compared to your forefathers etc etc. I highly doubt so, most likely comments made from the mouth. The excuse that "good" teachers are bailing out on teaching because they can't take it or whatever is pretty pathetic if you ask me. Teachers during the war era had to handle a far worse predicament than the teachers nowdadays have to. I don't know if it's a trend here but many people here say that kids are too pampered and they were alot more mature but don't do any form of research or actually look at the change. I'm sorry for being direct but that's what I feel.</p>

              <p>Again, I see this type sentence that does total injustice to teachers:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>When they
                                      decided to become a teacher they should expect some kids to be
                                      like that.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yet another student that treats themselves as customers of the teachers, that they should be king because they are the "customers"</p>
              <p>Look Anthiadon, I will be much more direct that you. The Pri 1 teacher in question is wrong, no doubts about it. But your sentence that I quoted reeks of even more disrespect for teachers.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the past:</span><br>You are a student, you listen to the teacher, you give respect to the teacher. You tolerate the teacher, and not the teacher tolerate you. Students see teachers being there because they are learned and qualified.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now, you:</span><br>The teacher should expect you as a kid to behave like that, and should tolerate your behaviour. Students see teachers as people being paid to serve the students, and hence should tolerate the students.</p>
              <p>Go think and reflect about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now back to this sentence</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The excuse that "good" teachers
                                      are bailing out on teaching because they can't take it or whatever
                                      is pretty pathetic if you ask me.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>FYI, the teaching profession here has one of the highest turnover rates, and is one of the profession with the most number being admitted to IMH for stress and etc. And it's partly because of students like you.</p>
              <p>And how do I know? My gf is a school teacher who's already planning to run once her teaching bond ends. And why? Disillusioned of teaching partly because of the behaviour of students nowadays as compared to the past.</p>

              <p>I think the quality of teacher also drop badly nowadays. Many people take up teaching, not for passion but just to make a living. Cos it'a iron rice bowl job, recession proof.</p>
              <p>Many of these young teacher join teaching with the wrong mindset.</p>
              <p>During my NS times, I heard from one of my unit mates. That he went clubbing and manage to jio a young sexy dress gal who smokes more heavily than him. Drink better than him and more open than him in mindset(U know those kind of raba,raba dancing)</p>
              <p>When my unit mate asked her what was her occupation. She said she was a primary school teacher. And she became teacher becos of good pay and stable job He was so shocked.</p>
              <p>When I heard his story, first thing that came into my mind how good can this teacher be??</p>

              <p>Dear sir/ma'am eagle,</p>
              <p>First of all, good sir/ma'am, if you havent comprehended my point clearly I'll resummarise it. I meant to say that teachers often give the excuse that the students are overclimbing their priorities, which was exactly what happened during the medieval eras or war periods. Teachers these days often take the job for the sake of having a job, and not really because they want to teach, resulting in heavy problems because I have seen at least 80% of new trainees causing even top classes to have drops in results.</p>
              <p>Majority of students will have a certain amount of respect for the teacher. I don't think the mainstream will openly assault the teacher or anything right? However if a teacher does go overboard then a student has every right to voice out his/her opinion. That's pretty fair if you ask me. If you haven't realised people in the past have lived a far worse life than you or I have, which means that the laws and times are changing and if you can't accept it then it's best not to say anything.</p>
              <p>Its simply flawed or  must say "retarded"(I'm sorry about this) to compare what happened during the 80s in Singapore City with the modern era, because I can easily compare it with the education system in fascist countries way before your time and see the difference. Simply put, the education system is getting different each generation and basing it on your time is a very biased attitude.</p>
              <p>Oh and like every other one of your kind do, you begin your theory of stereotyping. So just because I made a comment that goes against your beliefs I become a rowdy gangster with no life and wants to kill the teacher? Seriously? A teacher is there to teach the stuff in the books and be done with it, expecting students in a supposedly democratic country to listen like nazi children with the influence of western media and globalisation is something only sub-humans will do.</p>
              <p>Hmm so supposedly "students like me" become the cause of the stress in teachers? I don't know where you get your statistics from and I don't really want to know. Stress is found in every profession, and from what I know many who go into the private sector have problems of mental health as well. Many factors cause this stress, from paperwork stress or personal problems. Its just stupid to place students as a major cause of it, do you realise that customer service officers have to face problems with   customers as well? The reason for the turnover rates could also be due to the capitalism built up and economy? The same is going for doctors as well isn't it? No offence but It seems to me that you are just making a general stereotype like all other "experienced" people do without actually doing your googling.</p>
              <p>I'm sorry that your girfriend lost her interest in teaching but blaming everything on students and comparing them with the past is just buncombe, because with the change in the world now, you can't expect everyone to behave like what you want them to. Why don't you dress up as CCP supporters and salute to Mao Zedong like your ancestors did then, after all its part of our tradition.</p>
              <p>Anyway trust me when I say this, I deleted at least half the insults here because it would seem very Bus-like to do that. With that I wish you a good day and hope you actually think about it as well.</p>
