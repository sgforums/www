              <p>The
              real story behind the mystery model at Singapore Import Nights 2009 who
              showed more than she was supposed to has finally surfaced.<br><br>The
              model, known as Sunshine Tracy, created a stir when photos of her
              posing sexily in a short dress at the car show were published on STOMP.<br><br>STOMP received the photos via email, but did not publish the photos that were more explicit.<br><br>Now, a friend of the model, known as Alex, said that she was not at the car show to model, but just to meet him. He said:<br><br>"That
              day, Tracy and I had arranged to meet at SIN2009. My main purpose there
              was to support my other friends, who were participating as SIN models,
              and also as contestants for this grand event.<br><br>"Being a property
              agent, I had to attend to my clients, even with last minute calls.
              There was a last minute arrangement by my clients that day, causing me
              to be late for nearly two hours in meeting Tracy..<br><br>"After
              rushing down to Expo, I called her twice on her phone, but she was
              unreachable. After entering the SIN2009 exhibition, I searched around,
              but was still unable to find her. All of a sudden, I saw a group of 40
              to 50 photographers surrounding one of the cars.<br><br>"Out of curiosity, I went to investigate and was totally amazed to see Tracy posing for the photographers.<br><br>"With
              her posing and getting up on a display car, I assumed she might have
              gotten herself employed. The photo session lasted only for a short
              period, and all of a sudden, Tracy was seen escorted to a safe place by
              SIN2009 organisers.<br><br>"I went to look for Tracy and managed to find out the real story.<br><br>"From the short chat with Tracy, I discovered that:<br><br>"She was not employed by SIN2009 to work as model for the event.<br><br>"She started posing for one photographer only but did not realise that her pose would attract so many unknown photographers.<br><br>"Knowing
              Tracy after 18 years of friendship, I know she's a freelance model who
              is willing to take normal outdoor/indoor photos and would NOT accept
              any lingerie photoshoot.<br><br>"After talking to Tracy, I realised
              that she wasn't prepared and was only expecting to just enjoy herself
              at this event browsing around and admiring nice cars with me.<br><br>"She
              was approached by one photographer for a single photoshoot, but was
              surprised to find herself swarmed by a group of unknown photographers.<br><br>"Those
              photographers were too overwhelming and totally surrounded her with no
              room for escape. Being a kind-at-heart girl, she showed her
              professionalism by posing for the cameras.<br><br>"Tracy did not realise the difference between photographers with integrity and those without.<br><br>"I
              would like to apologise for being late for the event. If it weren't for
              this, Tracy would not have wandered around aimlessly all alone.<br><br>"I
              personally feel that her dressing is not appropriate for the daring
              moves/pose done at SIN2009. Tracy has too told me that she admitted
              it's her mistake and deeply regretted her actions.<br><br>"Though I
              feel that part of this commotion originates with Tracy's dressing and
              inexperience in car show photo taking, I do believe that those
              shameless, low integrity photographers has indirectly caused a lot of
              inconvenience to other people's lives which has caused Tracy to have
              personal issues now."<br><br><img src="http://static.stomp.com.sg/site/servlet/linkableblob/stomp/262920/data/model5-data.jpg" alt=""></p>
