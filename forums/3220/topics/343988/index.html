              <p>Have you ever experienced this??</p>
              <p>-- WARNING: Long story Ahead---</p>
              <p>Date: 12 Jan 09</p>
              <p>Time: About 1:50pm</p>
              <p>Service: TownLink 291</p>
              <p>Bus Rego: SBS 8216 T</p>
              <p>Location: Bus Stop 75131, Bet Blks 701/702<span><br></span></p>
              <p>BC description: Looks like he's from China.</p>
              <p>Incident Description:</p>
              <p>The bus (Scania K230UB) was fully packed to the brim with students at the nearby school as it was going towards Tampines Int.</p>
              <p>Then, some1 pressed the bell.</p>
              <p>The bus then stopped at BS 75131. The BC opened the exit door so he/she can alight.</p>
              <p>Since there are a lot of kiasu/kiasi ppl  there at the bus stop, they wanted 2 board the bus. The students told the BC to dont open the door but to no avail. After a short scream by the students, the BC opened the door. About 3-4 people managed to squeeze into the bus.</p>
              <p>Then, a malay auntie (wearing a green thing over her hair) boarded the bus via the exit door and shouted at the students that if they dont move to the rear, she would complain to the school.</p>
              <p>Almost all the students in the bus was very angry about her. After scolding the students, she alighted the bus. But the students ignore her.</p>
              <p>Then, a Chinese uncle, around 60 yrs old, scolded the students again. They were already very angey, yet he continued to scold them.</p>
              <p>Then, a svc 69 came and the people at the bus stop rushed to the bus.</p>
              <p>The BC then closed the door and the bus continued with the journey. The uncle continued to mumble in the bus.</p>
              <p>Finally at the Int, when the man alighted, the students started scolding him behind his back.</p>
              <p>I advised the BC not to allo ppl to board when the bus is full.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note:</p>
              <p>This is not the 1st time that this thing happened.</p>
              <p>The attiude of the people living there is very...</p>

              <p>but...but...but... i have an injured arm that isn't casted
              because the doctor took it out. yet i cannot exert any/much force
              on my arm to hold the grip pole and i'll lose my balance and
              fall.</p>
              <p>am i not entitled to a seat then because i look extremely
              healthy? :(~</p>
              <p>btw, even when my arm was casted and i was losing balance, i
              barely had anyone giving up their seats to me. save for one auntie

              <p>Yes. Cause when ppl look at you, &amp; since u dont have any visable injury or got any casting, people wont bother you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you can do is to use<em> the other arm </em>to hold on the pole.</p>
