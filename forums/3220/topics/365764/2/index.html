              <p>The stomper is a bitch.</p>
              <p>The sales girl did provide her service. Even for less than $50 item</p>
              <p>Stomper already want to buy, and then refuse to buy not because of poor service, but because of credit card.</p>
              <p>Stomper did not appreciate the service given, did not say thank you, and probably acted in a manner that prompted the sales girl to make her comment.</p>
              <p>Stomper want to complain, and see the manager. What kind of person is she in first place? Later came back to take photographs.</p>
              <p>Stomper really has the gall to complain about rude sales person, when she herself is really abnoxious.</p>

                                                  a minimum of $50.00, I placed the items back at their original
                                                  places. <br> <br> “In response, Ms A asked me, ‘You are not buying anything?’. I
                                                  replied that I wanted to consider first as I did not want to buy
                                                  unnecessary items in order to reach the minimum $50.00 payment. I
                                                  then proceeded out of the shop. <br> <br> “As I was walking out, Ms A said, ‘You think carefully first then
                                                  come back, because I wasted a lot of time serving you. There are
                                                  other customers in the shop.’ I then told her that I did not ask
                                                  her to serve me, and that she had offered her services. <br> <br> “I asked to see the boss who was not around in the shop then. I
                                                  then asked Ms A for her name, and she replied me saying that she
                                                  did not have to tell me her name. <br> <br> “I then left for my appointment. After my appointment at around
                                                  8.18pm, I walked back to Enamour Beauty. <br> <br> “Ms A was walking out of the shop holding a handphone to her ear. I
                                                  used my handphone to snap a picture of her as I did not have her
                                                  name. <br> <br> “Ms A then went back inside the shop. I also snapped the shop
                                                  signboard and its unit number. In response, Ms A reappeared from
                                                  the shop with a handphone in her hand. <br> <br> “She came near me and said, ‘Look here bitch. I have also snapped a
                                                  photo of you taking a photo of me.’ <br> <br> “As I was leaving the place, I looked back and saw Ms A at the
                                                  front of the shop, with her handphone aiming at me. Surrounding Ms
                                                  A were other salesgirls of the same shop. <br> <br> “I wrote this email to let you know the miserable customer service
                                                  that Ms A gave me. Product knowledge is important, but attitude is
                                                  indispensible! <br> <br> “The fact that she called me bitch shows that she is not suitable
                                                  to be in the front line service. <br> <br> “I hope that no one else will experience this dreadful standard of
                                                  customer service.”<br>  <br> <img src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/photo/getArticlePhoto.do?id=13698" alt="" width="500" height="300"><br> <br> <img src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/photo/getArticlePhoto.do?id=13699" alt="" width="500" height="300"><br> <br> <img src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/photo/getArticlePhoto.do?id=13700" alt="" width="500" height="300"></span></div>

Nothing would have happened if the stomper did not return to the shop to take photographs. The lable bitch was not for the non-purchase,but for the stupidity of using the phone camera.

              <p>The sales girl did provide her service. Even for less than $50

              <p>Stomper already want to buy, and then refuse to buy not because
              of poor service, but because of credit card.</p>
              <p>Stomper did not appreciate the service given, did not say thank
              you, and probably acted in a manner that prompted the sales girl to
              make her comment.</p>
              <p>Stomper want to complain, and see the manager. What kind of
              person is she in first place? Later came back to take
              photographs.</p>
              <p>Stomper really has the gall to complain about rude sales person,
              when she herself is really abnoxious.</p>
