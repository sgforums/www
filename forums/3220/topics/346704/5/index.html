              <p>There are soooo many pregnant ladies around and even more who have been pregnant before.  I've heard my colleagues and friends complain of how tough it was to stand whilst taking public transport, but I've never detected such maliciousness and bitterness in any of them!  They all take it as something they just have to live with, and they all appreciate the times when they are given seats.  But none of them have ever been this bitter!  I guess basically, they are all happy to be blessed with child and they gladly take the suffering in their stride.  They do not have the entitlement mentality.</p>

              <p>Very good point.  I really dislike it when I offer my seat to the elderly and they reject my offer.  And then, like what you said, the passengers who alight later on will think that you are being inconsiderate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>End of day, all of us are just angry with the photo-taking right?</p>
              <p>with almost all phones now armed with a camera, how to ensure that we won't be stomped without us "committing" some crime.. well, you won't know until your picture appear on stomp or any other website..right?</p>
              <p>and, in this case, it is about SMRT seats.  so two issues right?</p>
              <p>rather than bitching/cursing, how about giving suggestions/solutions?</p>
              <p>1) why don't we remove all priority seats from all MRTs, and instead, just put two carriages in the middle as "specials", just for the elderly, handicapps, pregnants, and those with children/pramps?</p>
              <p>So the rest of us can happily go filled up the rest of trains, and we can drool, sleep, put our feet, put our bags, and revert to our normal lifes.</p>
              <p>2) All moderators will not allow immediate postings, for such posts with photos. But allow, a few days for investigations before allowing it "online". Most times, people after some considerations may reconcile their thoughts and deems such posts as trivals and remove them. So there is a "cooling" period.</p>

              <p>End of day, all of us are just angry with the photo-taking
              right?</p>
              <p>with almost all phones now armed with a camera, how to ensure
              that we won't be stomped without us "committing" some crime.. well,
              you won't know until your picture appear on stomp or any other
              website..right?</p>
              <p>and, in this case, it is about SMRT seats.  so two issues
              right?</p>
              <p>rather than bitching/cursing, how about giving
              suggestions/solutions?</p>
              <p>1) why don't we remove all priority seats from all MRTs, and
              instead, just put two carriages in the middle as "specials", just
              for the elderly, handicapps, pregnants, and those with
              children/pramps?</p>
              <p>So the rest of us can happily go filled up the rest of trains,
              and we can drool, sleep, put our feet, put our bags, and revert to
              our normal lifes.</p>
