              <p>why has the matter turned so ugly?</p>
              <p>Is it mandatory for passenger to give up seats to the needy? I think the answer is NO. Therefore it is only a moral <strong>obligation</strong> for passenger to give up the seat. If you can live to act like to are sleeping so as to avoid giving up the seat, so be it. To stomp on the passenger is neither a courteous nor a moral thing to do too.</p>

Sorry, kinda backfired, because to me, you seem to be getting more kicks in the butt than pats on the back.<br><br>and it's also an undisputed fact that the lady did offer you her seat the moment she was conscious that you were there. i know you're not exactly a packet of peanuts but hey, some people just aren't observant. but, she did still offer her seat.<br><br>did you say thank you? apparently not! Wow, and here i was, wondering why the younger generations are getting ruder, more uncouth, more un-adorable, and more elitist and arrogant. apparently we have our answer, it's parents like you, whom the kids learnt to follow. hey, monkey see, monkey do right? so is this how you're going to teach your kids? "Darling, if you see someone who doesn't appeal to you, it is ok to take their picture come home and stomp, just make sure you run really fast ok? because if you get caught.. well, try not to get caught, sweetie."<br><br>it is, in reality, a lose-lose situation for you. you can't exactly tell me "no! of course that's not the way i'm going to raise him up, i'm going to teach him good manners myself!" yeah right. Good manners like saying "thank you"? sorry, if you can tell me that, you're just going to be one big flabby hypocrite. You can fix the big flabby part with the christy chung formula, but you'll still be a tight sexy hypocrite, good looking on the outside, ugly in the inside.<br><br>i'm sure everyone will appreciate the aesthetic relief, but don't expect getting any "mum of the year" or "best mum ever" award anytime soon, ya?<br><br>and i read in a post that you were actually offered seats by other generous and gracious commuters, and you refused them. seriously, what's up with that??</span></p>

              <div><strong>Priority Seat - Rude and
              Inconsiderate woman. Please help to pass the
              message.</strong></div>
              <hr style="color: #e7d3e2;">
              <div>Dear all,<br> <br> I hope we can stand together in this.<br> <br> I'm not sure how many of you are in the same position as I
              am.<br> I try my best to get a seat in trains ever since I found that I'm
              pregnant. I'm not afraid of myself falling, but, I'm afraid of
              people falling on me when the train brakes suddenly. <br> <br> My latest trip to Japan made me realise how fortunate pregnant
              Japanese women are. Train operators give out a tag for them to tag
              to their bags so that other passengers know that they are expecting
              even though the tummy is not showing yet. I brought one back, but,
              that hardly work here.<br> <br> Over the last two weeks, I'm really frustrated as I'm already into
              Week 26 and my tummy is already very obvious for my small build. I
              decided to start a photo album of inconsiderate people who did not
              offer their priority seats. <br> <br> Today, I met one and took a picture of her. She did not offer me
              the seat even after finishing her sms and after one stop. However,
              she realised that I was taking a picture of her and ask me very
              rudely if I want the seat. I answered yes and she stood up and
              started hurling vulgarities at me and calling me a bitch. I scolded
              her back as I think she should be embarassed of herself! She walked
              away after about 20secs of cursing.<br> <br> However, before she alighted at Novena station, she stopped by my
              seat and started cursing at me and my unborn baby! I'm speechless
              as I'm wondering if she is even ashamed of herself!<br> <br> My husband just told me that I do have the rights to sue her for
              abusing me with language.<br> <br> I'm posting her picture here and I intend to put this message up in
              Stomp and also to send this to SMRT. <br> <br> If there are any lawyers reading this message, please kindly
              advise.<br> <br> I seriously cannot tolerate actions like this and from someone who
              is obviously educated.</div>

              <p>My dua sen:</p>
              <p>Photographs don't always tell the whole story.</p>
              <p>What if it turns out that the woman in the seat was actually ill? And she didn't give up her seat because she was too ill to stand properly? And the supposed swear words are actually incoherent rabble brought upon by a semi-conscious state of mind induced by flu medication? We don't know that, and the pregnant woman herself might not even know that.</p>
              <p>Besides, let's just say that the story is completely true, in which case the woman in the seat is in the wrong for not giving up her seat. Then in that case I say that the pregnant woman is just as much in the wrong for taking that woman's photograph, posting it online, and starting what is essentially a smear campaign against a complete stranger.</p>

              <div>A pregnant woman earlier alleged that  this woman not only failed to offer her a Priority Seat in the train, she even cursed her and her unborn child.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The woman pictured in the story has since informed STOMP of her side of the story in an email dated Feb 1.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Here's what she had to say:<br><br>"The truth of this incident is I boarded the train before the pregnant lady did. I was tired and trying to sleep as you can see in the photo.<br><br>"I had no idea when she boarded or that she was maliciously taking a photo of me sleeping. She never once asked for the seat, nor did anybody around alert me of her presence.<br><br>"Nonetheless, I looked up after a while, and when I noticed her, I immediately asked, 'Do you want to sit?'<br><br>"To my shock and horror, she said 'Yes' really rudely, glaring at me, and rushed to the seat without a word of thanks!<br><br>"I then asked her, 'Hey I offered you the seat, why are you being so hostile?'<br><br>"She said, 'Of course! Couldn't you see the sign?'<br><br>"Certainly I knew I was sitting on the Priority Seat. But am I expected to be constantly on the lookout for pregnant women? I was asleep for Christ's sake, and the minute I noticed her, I offered it to her!<br><br>"There was NO '20 seconds of cursing', 'she stood up and started hurling vulgarities at me', nor did I curse her and her unborn baby.<br><br>"'A pregnant STOMPer says this woman not only did not offer her the Priority Seat in the train, she even cursed her and her unborn child' - this vicious statement is totally untrue.<br><br>"If there were SMRT cameras, I would most certainly like the public to see how ungrateful this pregnant lady really was, and worse, trying to malign me on STOMP!<br><br>"I do not deny that I called her a b***h. She certainly is the epitome of the word 'b***h'.<br><br>"The truth is, she called me one too! After I graciously offered her the seat, she called me a b***h because I said there was no need for hostility simply because I had not noticed her earlier.<br><br>"As for 'cursing her and her unborn baby'? All i said before I alighted was that it would be terribly sad if she brought up another person just like herself.<br><br>"I am not ashamed to say this because this is the true story, and I am sure everyone would agree with me that it is a great shame that a lady of her age cannot even conduct herself graciously, and is thinking of bringing up a child."</div>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I wish people would stop trying to make judgement just like that. Not having been at the actual scene and without first hand information, how would you know what the actual situation was like?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Unless you've been pregnant yourself and have experienced the exact same thing the stomper had, what rights do you have to call her a selfish person? how can she be selfish if she's trying to protect another (yes, I do agree though that the baby does belong to her.) if you've endured a whole crappy week, and would just like to have a little rest while getting back from work, it would only be human for one to be irritable and snappy, especially as the seat has already been specified that it was for "needy" people. Just by the label, it would instil, the notion, somewhere in her mind, that the seat was more or less rightly "hers". Hence the drama.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">it to, however would be equally wrong if we just deemed the other lady on the seat to be a selfish, rude, person with no moral ethics. Cause by doing so, we would have neglected other factors which would have led to her behaviour. If she was asleep, which most people generally are, if would be impossible to demand her to sense random needy passengers in her sleep to suddenly awake and give up her seat to her. Also, she too might be just as in need of the seat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The main point is that everyone should just try to show a little more consideration for each other. And to not be so petty. If neither on of them perused the matter after the lady gave up her seat, there would have been absolutely no need for this whole big issue. Ya? All this fuss about nothing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">and on the picture taking thing, its absolutely vile. it's the same “</span><span style="color: black; font-family: SimSun;   " lang="ZH-CN">æŠ•æ‹�</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">”aint it? you’d be totally invading the privacy of another. to post it on the net whilst spreading stories about the other person it just abominable. </span></p>

              <p>I find the pregnant woman abit retarded, just because someone doesn't give up seat to you, you take her pictures. What if the lady sitting on the seat was not feeling well that day?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are so many seats on the MRT. Why aren't the other commuters giving up their seats? Is it because there are no priority seats signs?</p>
