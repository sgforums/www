              <p>I find the pregnant woman abit retarded, just because someone
              doesn't give up seat to you, you take her pictures. What if the
              lady sitting on the seat was not feeling well that day?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are so many seats on the MRT. Why aren't the other
              commuters giving up their seats? Is it because there are no
              priority seats signs?</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I wish people
              would stop trying to make judgement just like that. Not
              having been at the actual scene and without first hand information,
              how would you know what the actual situation was like?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Unless you've
              been pregnant yourself and have experienced the exact same thing
              the stomper had, what rights do you have to call her a selfish
              person? how can she be selfish if she's trying to protect another
              (yes, I do agree though that the baby does belong to her.) if
              you've endured a whole crappy week, and would just like to have a
              little rest while getting back from work, it would only be human
              for one to be irritable and snappy, especially as the seat has
              already been specified that it was for "needy" people. Just by the
              label, it would instil, the notion, somewhere in her mind,
              that the seat was more or less rightly "hers". Hence the
              drama.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">it to, however
              would be equally wrong if we just deemed the other lady on the seat
              to be a selfish, rude, person with no moral ethics. Cause by doing
              so, we would have neglected other factors which would have led to
              her behaviour. If she was asleep, which most people generally are,
              if would be impossible to demand her to sense random needy
              passengers in her sleep to suddenly awake and give up her seat to
              her. Also, she too might be just as in need of the seat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The main point
              is that everyone should just try to show a little more
              consideration for each other. And to not be so petty. If neither on
              of them perused the matter after the lady gave up her seat, there
              would have been absolutely no need for this whole big issue. Ya?
              All this fuss about nothing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">and on the
              picture taking thing, its absolutely vile. it's the same
              “</span><span style="color: black; font-family: SimSun;">æŠ•æ‹�</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">”aint it? you’d be totally
              invading the privacy of another. to post it on the net whilst
              spreading stories about the other person it just
              abominable.</span></p>

              <p>In the first place, it isnt even compulsory for people to give up their seats to others even if that they are sitting on the priority seat. The giving up of seats to those who are more needy is simply a kind gesture. All of people boarding the train are paying their fares and have their rights to sit down too. She have no right to demand for the seat and to even STOMP about the incident. She's just being a nuisance by doing all these.</p>

              <p>Yeah! </p>
              <p>After reading that pregnant lady's ranting, she comes across as self-centered, extremely vindictive and vicious. </p>
              <p>I'm glad that the Stompee wrote a reply.  And I'm also glad that there are witnesses to the incident who've come forward to defend the Stompee. </p>
              <p>In all honesty, it is one's own choice to get pregnant, so if you're pregnant and have to take public transport, don't get all bitter over it and go around getting all worked up when there are no seats for you.  I think the Stompee was gracious enough to wake up, realise the situation, and give up her seat.  There was no need for the Stomper to act all righteous over the situation since the Stompee took the initiative of giving up her seat. </p>
              <p>I'm sure more witnesses will come forward.  It will be interesting to find out if the Stompee really did curse the woman and her unborn child as claimed.</p>

              <p>Precisely!  It IS harrassment and slander!  And using the Stomp site as a channel means that the slander is on a really huge scale!  I'm no lawyer, but I think if this ever becomes a legal issue, the Stompee is the one with real damages to claim.</p>
