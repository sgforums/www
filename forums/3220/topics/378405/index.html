              <div class="c_comment">I feel you stomper JC. Since you witnessed them placing their items there, I understand your feelings. If I were you I will first ask politely to move away the stuffs. If they did not listened, I'll throw out my voice. I'm a girl too but I don't care because I don't like these type of people. Let me tell my story. I got into an arguement with a tall gangster-looking guy a year ago in a very crowded bus when he rest his back on a pole which I wanted to hold for balance. He refused to move even after I said politely. I scolded him and he scolded me back so rudely which made me slapped him. He was about to retaliate and his friend stop him. He kick the bus door demand to open the door and went out angrily cursing. I still remember that incident. &gt;_&gt; I wished I had taken his photo to post here but I decided not to. It was intense but I felt I did the right thing. People like them are so rude and think they are kings. Those type of people need to learn a lesson of humiliation sometimes.</div>

              <div class="c_comment">hi all, the above was one of the comment i saw when i was browsing at stomp. after reading this comment i felt that some of the girls nowadays are getting more violent towards guys, as the take for granted the law that has been inplace to protect them.</div>
              <div class="c_comment">This is what will come to my mind if i am in a dispute with a female, i must nvr get violent with her, cos she is physically weaker and the law punishes heavily on guys who hit a girl. But recently i got this feeling that when<strong> some</strong> girls get pissed by a guy, they would must likely get violent with the guy. Maybe they think that if the guy dare to hit me back i would go to the police, even if i started it the law will be on my side.</div>

              Yes, the guy seems to have been rude. However he doesn't owe this wintercherry anything, and is certainly not obliged to move on her say so. It seems that she escalated the situation to the level of physical abuse, and it would have been reasonable for the guy to slap her right back. The guy should have taken her photo and posted it.
              
              I would have returned her slap with interest.

              <p><br>the problem is that guy just quarrel with her, thats all...... she sounded like it was something to be proud of.</p>
              <p> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I scolded him</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he scolded me</span> back so rudely which made me <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slapped him</span>. He was about to retaliate and his friend stop him. He kick the bus door demand to open the door and went out angrily cursing. I still remember that incident. &gt;_&gt; I wished I had taken his photo to post here but I decided not to.

              <p>if every girl behave like her guys better dun start a dispute with them. he scold her then she gave him one tight slap. What the world is becoming. even the guys is at fault, but by slapping him the girl is at greater fault.... if this happen in other countries i bet the girl wouldn't be so daring.</p>
              <p>i do agree that girls need to be protected by the law, but i just feels that the younger generation of girls are taking advantage of the biased law in singapore. take the recent kicking groin case for instance, lucky that guy nvr retaliate if not he will be in big trouble.</p>
              <p>i do believe that we guys has to behave like gentlemen to a well mannered ladies, even without the law. but not to those who take this for granted.</p>
