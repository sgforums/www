              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">On 25<sup>th</sup> May and 1<sup>st</sup> June, I no longer received the quality of customer service from the front line staffs. Prefer to be served by my friendly and caring staff called Jessica. She is the one who give advice and promotes the company products to me before I sign up for each accounts. I would always remember her welcome me when I enter and wish me well before I leave.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Her attitude towards customers are her friends, hence I never felt every dollar I had are too small to deposit. She promotes the products after listens to what customers needs. She reminds the customers the important of saving for raining days. Jessica possesses a good PR skill and goes extra mile to help every customer. I used to spend as much as I earned. However with her advice, I managed to grow my ‘pots of gold’. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now she no longer up on the frontline, neither the other staffs had the set of PR skills and communication between customers. How to give feedback to the company and rate their service? Personally, I feel they lacked of smile, friendly and lower their tone when approach their customers. I felt threaten if served by the fat lady in the centre and the end of the table who had loud voice and fierce looks on their face. They don’t talk more to customer about open new accounts. Their style is ‘take your money and make your way to the exit fast’, don’t sit too long and ask questions. Not a word to say thank you for using NTUC Thrift or ‘please come again to open new accounts’. No one will tell a customer how to grow their money with NTUC Thrift. Hence it like they are being paid and not happy to do their job.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Only Jessica managed to remind and advise customers to invest with NTUC Thrift. Her positive comments give customers good impression. She had a lot of experience and understanding of every customer’s ability to save money into NTUC Thrift. I’m surprised she could extend her help to show her concern why withdraw or close an account with NTUC Thrift. She really showed concern and she had the customer best interest as well as the NTUC Thrift. She doesn’t want to lose her customers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Since Jessica no longer in the frontline and just to thank her and appreciate her all these years of serving me, I would always remember to give a small token of gifts before I leave NTUC Thrift. She would not waste paper of printing and let me know how much I had in each account. Her service is very much the same as OCBC, UOB and financial advisers as they would show your figures on their computer screen. As far as I know, it my money what so private that I can’t see. I def will trust and open new accounts with Jessica. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Sad to say, I am truly unhappy with the service anymore. Therefore I’m thinking of closing my account with NTUC Thrift, if their service hasn’t improved. </span></p>
