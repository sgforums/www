            <div class='col-md body'>Women Say Screeners Groped Them<br><br>Fri Feb 8, 6:41 AM ET<br><br>By ANANDA SHOREY, Associated Press Writer<br><br>PHOENIX (AP) - Dozens of female travelers have filed complaints with<br>the Federal Aviation Administration and state officials, claiming that<br>male airport security screeners groped them under the guise of random<br>body searches.<br><br>The complaints include 18 filed with the FAA by women who claimed they<br>were singled out for pat-down searches when they were traveling alone,<br>then groped or fondled by male agents, according to spokesman Jerry<br>Snyder.<br><br>At least 35 women have contacted Arizona Attorney General Janet<br>Napolitano about being improperly touched during pat-down searches,<br>spokeswoman Pati Urias said, although none has filed a criminal<br>complaint.<br><br>The complaints were made from Oct. 11 to Jan. 31. Security measures at<br>airports have been tightened, and the use of random body searches<br>increased since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.<br><br>Current policy allows female passengers to request female screeners,<br>but no federal law requires airlines to provide an employee of the<br>same sex to conduct searches.<br><br>The complaints are being forwarded to the airlines, which are<br>responsible for disciplinary decisions, Snyder said. He did not<br>identify the airlines involved in the complaints, nor give further<br>detail on the alleged incidents.<br><br>But Sharon Schmidt, of Placerville, Calif., says an America West<br>security worker whisked her to a closed-off area as part of an airport<br>screening, then smirked as he put his hands inside her sweater and<br>slid them up her torso.<br><br>"I am appalled, infuriated and disgusted that the FAA has given<br>airlines their approval to randomly violate my civil liberties," she<br>said.<br><br>The airline said it interviewed three male gate staff agents who may<br>have witnessed the Jan. 21 search.<br><br>"No one could recall this particular passenger, but all denied ever<br>singling out women for search; continuing to search any male or female<br>passenger who refused a search; or touching women inappropriately<br>during the search process," America West general counsel Linda<br>Mitchell wrote in a letter Thursday.<br><br>The three men were nevertheless "counseled on the use of tact and<br>professionalism," and the same message was reiterated to all gate<br>agents, Mitchell wrote.<br><br>Nobody has been disciplined as a result of Schmidt's complaint, she<br>wrote.<br><br>Passengers of Alaska and United Airlines also contacted the attorney<br>general's office about being groped during searches, Napolitano said.<br>An Alaska Airlines official would not comment on any complaints, and<br>United did not return calls Thursday.</div>
