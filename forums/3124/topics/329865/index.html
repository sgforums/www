              <div>THE YEAR OF 2009 WILL SEE ANOTHER BIG WIND AND TREND OF THE WORLD ESPECIALLY THE WHOLE OF ASIA BLOWING TOWARDS THE KOREAN FASHION WITH SO MANY POP STARS &amp; IDOLS FROM KOREA BEING WELL FANCY BY THE ASIAN FANS; MORE POP SONGS AND SERIES SHOW HAS BEEN QUEING UP ALONG THE PIPELINE TO BE TELECAST IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, AS A FASHION REPORTER I CAN REALLY FEEL THE STRONG WAVE OF THE KOREAN FASHION PUSHING UP WITH NO COMPROMISE.</div>
              <div>AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, MY PERSONAL APPRECIATIONS OF KOREAN CULTURE AND ITS FASHION WHICH IS HUMBLE AND CONSERVATIVE, UNLIKE THE WILD WILD WEST WHICH AT TIMES OVER EXPOSED THEIR WILDNESS AND FASHION WHICH IS A DIRECT REFLECTIONS ON THEIR CULTURE HAD TOO LITTLE TO BE CLOTHED, FASHIONS WITH LITTLE PIECES OF CLOTHES TO BE WEARED AND OVER-EXPOSED BODY ARE COMMON SIGHTS.</div>
              <div>WHAT TO EXPECT FOR <strong>YEAR 2009</strong>, BESIDE THE BALLROOM DRESSES FROM GUCCI, CHANEL, LV, BURBERRY, VERSACE ETC.. BIG NAMES, WE SHOULD BE SEEING SOME NEW TRENDS FROM THE JEANS WEARING CLUB OF SLIM FIT &amp; TIGHT BOTTOM, WITH BIG HUGE T-SHIRTS, OR VERY VERY BIG T-SHIRTS OF VAROUS DESIGNS &amp; COLOURS. JEANS OF DARKER COLOURED HAS BEEN MY TARGET, NO MORE PATCHES AND FADING STONE WASH DESIGNS (THIS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR FEW YEARS), MULTI COLURED JEANS MAYBE A COMMON SIGHT ON THE STREET, COLOURED OF ORIGINAL DARK BLUE JEANS WITH YELLOW, PINK, LIGHT GREEN, SHADINGS CROSSING THE LEGS PORTIONS. WELL, THESE ARE SOME OF MY PERSONAL DESIGNS THAT IS NOT ON THE STREET YET; AND I AM EXPECTING ALOT OF COPY CATS TO FOLLOWED MY DESIGNS SOON......LOL. AFTER BEEN IN THE FASHION DESIGNING INDUSTRY FOR 8 YEARS, I HAVE CONCLUDED MY PERSONAL FEELINGS WHICH IS "GOOD TO HAVE PEOPLE COPYING WHAT I HAVE DESIGNED AND SEEING SO MANY PEOPLE WEARING MY DESIGNS IRREGARDLESS WHETHER THEY BUY MY ORIGINAL PRODUCTS OR JUST ANOTHER PIRATED COPIES....HAHAHAHAA...!!!". WELL, SOMETIMES BIG NAMES ALSO HAVE TO COPY FROM "small man" LIKE US; BEING AROUND FOR TOO LONG DOES MAKES THEM RUN OUT OF IDEAS AT TIMES.</div>
