            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has received backing from an unlikely source, with Bayern Munich general manager Uli Hoeness singing his praises at the weekend.<br><br>It was Hoeness who bitterly fought with the German Football Association (DFB) to get Oliver Kahn picked as Germany's number one for the last World Cup - a battle he eventually lost as Lehmann got the nod from Jurgen Klinsmann.<br><br>However, now Kahn is off the scene, Hoeness seems to be throwing his weight behind Lehmann in the race for the number one jersey at next year's European Championships.<br><br>'Lehmann has got to play at Euro 2008, even if he does not play one more game for Arsenal until then,' Hoeness told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.<br><br>'It is unfair and inappropriate to doubt Lehmann - he is an excellent goalkeeper.'<br><br>Hoeness' backing is surprising since he has a player in his Bayern Munich squad who he is pushing to become the new Germany number one.<br><br>Michael Rensing, 23, has already been designated the successor of Kahn at club level and is currently playing while the elder statesman recovers from an elbow injury.<br><br>While Rensing is getting regular match practice, Lehmann was not even on the Arsenal bench for Saturday's 2-0 win over Bolton.<br><br>But the 37-year-old insisted: 'It is only up from here and I will force my way through.'<br><br></div>

That's something one has to take in, " Lehmann said.<br><br>"But I'm an Arsenal player and I won't just fade away quietly."<br><br>Wenger was asked about Lehmann's outburst following his side's demolition of Slavia.<br><br>"I don't want to humiliate anybody," said the Gunners boss. "We have three world-class goalkeepers and we can only play one."<br><br>But Lehmann is bemused by Wenger's assertion that he has three "world-class" goalkeepers to pick from.<br><br>"One of them must be me," he suggested. "The other two have proved their class by winning titles? If I think about that, I can't recall any. I guess today you're nevertheless world-class."<br><br>Lehmann won the Uefa Cup in 1997 with Schalke 04, the Bundesliga title in 2002 with Borussia Dortmund and the Premier League with Arsenal in 2004.<br><br>And he made it clear he feels he should still be the number one at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>"I'm convinced that I'll be playing again. Almunia has not yet showed that he can win matches for us," Lehmann added.<br><br>"I've experienced this situation before and know what the others are expecting from the goalkeeper. I can't imagine he'll be able to handle that."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lehmann got too much things to whine liao lah...</span></div>
