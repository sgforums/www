I've missed United, Fulham and the England games. It was a thigh strain that turned into a tear but I'm clear of it now and can't wait to get going again.<br><br>"I managed to score against Derby and that meant a lot but all of a sudden I was out injured. As I said, it wasn't ideal but I'm fighting fit now and raring to go.<br><br>"I've a lot of family who are either Tottenham or Arsenal fans and I know how much it means to them. When you watch the game on television you can see how much everyone is pumped up for it. I just hope to get some part of the game. I can't wait for it."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually I think given our current form we have a very high chance of beating them even though they r supermotivated...our midfielders are contributing to the scoresheet and this has really helped us win matches we cudnt win last season bcos of lack of goals</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bent: Arsenal Sold Henry Cheaply</strong><br><br>Darren Bent hopes to be involved in his first North London derby on Saturday when Tottenham Hotspur host neighbours and arch-enemies Arsenal. In the build-up to the game he has spoken of the similarity in the transfer fees that took him to White Hart Lane this summer in the same week that Thierry Henry left the Emirates...<br><br>Eyebrows were raised when Arsenal's talismanic captain and all-time leading goalscorer Thierry Henry was sold to Barcelona this summer for Â£16 million in the same week that Charlton's Darren Bent was bought by Tottenham Hotspur for Â£16.5million.<br><br>Was Bent, an occasional England international, ove-priced, or was the world-class Henry drastically under-valued?  The pricing, of course, took account to the relative ages of the two strikers. Bent was 23; Henry was a few weeks away from his 30th birthday.<br><br>Nevetheless, Bent feels Arsenal let Henry go too cheaply.<br><br>He said: Â“If it was me selling him, Thierry would be going for a lot more than that. Barca did well to get him for that price.<br><br>Â“I went to Spurs a couple of days after he went so comparisons between the two transfers were bound to happen. But IÂ’m not worried by it Â— itÂ’s just the market.<br><br>Â“Barcelona managed to get Thierry for Â£16million and Tottenham came and got me for Â£16.5million Â— it doesnÂ’t mean weÂ’re the same.<br><br>Â“Its simply what Tottenham were willing to pay and what Barca were willing to pay.Â”<br><br>Wandsworth-born Bent has been rumoured in the past to be an Arsenal fan, the  former Ipswich striker has revealed he actually supports Chelsea.<br><br>But he is itching to be involved in the derby at White Hart Lane on Sturday, and to sample the unique atmosphere.<br><br>He resumed training this week after recovering from a thigh injury, and said:<br><br>"IÂ’m a London boy so, for me, this fixture is one of the big ones.<br><br>Â“You can see how much it means to people.<br><br>Â“I remember watching a Spurs v Arsenal derby on TV a couple of years back and it was just ferocious Â— tackles flying in, stuff like that.Â”<br><br>Bent will be aiming to help Spurs achieve a victory over Arsenal at the Lane for he first time since November 1999. Tottenham haven't beaten their rivals anywhere in the last 18 meetings in all competitions.<br><br>And that 2-1 reverse on 7th November 1999 was the only time in 25 meetings since he became Arsenal manager that Arsene Wenger has experienced defeat in the North London derby.</div>
