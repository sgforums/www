              <p>Ironically Eboue was our best player ytd. The title race is far from over but the passion isnt there. The first goal,our defenders were caught offguard. Im frustrated with some of our players. They werent as fantastic as they were during the first half of the season.</p>
              <p>Arsène Wenger: 'A draw is not good enough'</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">On the result...<br></span></strong></span>"It's a very disappointing result today for us because we dropped eight points in the last four games. When you're in the race for the championship, especially when you have the opponents we have, that's a big disappointment but we have to keep belief, spirit and focus for the next game."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">On Mido's red card...<br></span></strong></span>"Funnily enough I don't think there was any intention there from Mido, I maybe didn't see him, but he hit him on top of his head because he just headed the ball at the moment he wanted to play the ball. I don't think that... personally I didn't see any bad intention from Mido. I believe the referee gave the red card when he saw the injury, because he was bleeding on the top of his head, but it was very difficult to assess that he wanted to hit him on his head, I don't think so."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">On Clichy's injury...<br></span></strong></span>"He's bleeding, they will see after - he's in the shower now and we'll see after if he needs stitches or not."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">On suggestions that the Boro goal was offside...<br></span></strong></span>"They say that the offside situation is judged every time the ball is played, but of course the ball wasn't played to him, spirit-wise he was offside."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">On Adebayor's goal being given offside...<br></span></strong></span>"Yes, the referee explained to me that the intention of our player was to play the ball to one of our players, who was offside, so the deflection of the ball doesn't count anymore. I didn't know that but, at least I learned something today."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">On the damage done to Arsenal's title hopes...<br></span></strong></span>"I don't know, we'll see that at the end of the season, but of course today we were after three points, but we'll see at the end of the season. A draw when you chase the championship is not good enough."</p>

              <p>Cesc Fabregas has reopened the row over Martin Taylor's foul on stricken Arsenal striker Eduardo, insisting the Birmingham defender should take the blame for the incident.</p>
              <p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="300" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>

              </tbody>
              </table>
              Eduardo suffered a sickening leg break after Taylor's two-footed tackle but while the Blues camp has rallied around Taylor, who was sent off for the challenge, Fabregas believes the defender is culpable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              Gunners boss Arsene Wenger initially suggested Taylor should face a life ban for the foul but swiftly retracted his comments.
              <p> </p>
              'Of course I blame him,' said Fabregas.
              <p> </p>
              'He did it and he knows why he did it. Of course he is not going to say he did it on purpose, he will never say that.
              <p> </p>
              'But a very good player is injured for a year and the player who committed the tackle is suspended for three little games. It is very, very unfair.'
              <p> </p>
              <br></td>
              </tr>
