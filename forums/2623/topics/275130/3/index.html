            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Cesc ends Schmeichel fairytale*<br><br>A goal 10 minutes from time from Cesc Fabregas was enough to give Arsenal a 1-0 victory over Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium.</strong><br><br>Fabregas scored with an angled drive to end City's winning start under Sven Goran Eriksson and become the first player this season to beat rookie goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.<br><br>The 20-year-old Dane had kept his side in the game moments earlier when he saved a penalty from Robin Van Persie after Micah Richards had fouled Alexander Hleb.<br><br>And Schmeichel was almost an unlikely hero at the other end, connecting with Martin Petrov's injury time corner and forcing a save from Manuel Almunia in the Arsenal goal.<br><br>However, Schmeichel's sensational start to his Premier League career came to an end, with Arsenal shading the match after making a slow start.<br><br>It was particularly harsh on the imposing centre-back duo of Richard Dunne and Richards, whose only mistake was the foul which led to Arsenal's 68th minute penalty.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Penalty claim</span></strong><br><br>And at the other end, Eriksson and his bench were up on their feet in the second half claiming a penalty when Kolo Toure flattened Michael Johnson, but Chris Foy waved play on, allowing Arsenal to take advantage.<br><br>The game developed into a matter of Arsenal enjoying possession, with City looking to counter-attack and exploit Arsenal's makeshift defence.<br><br>Most of the time they were faced with the solid partnership of Richards and Dunne, so Van Persie tried his luck from long range and cleared the crossbar.<br><br>City chances in the first half were more convincing. Johnson burst through the Arsenal defence to set up Martin Petrov for an effort that went wide.<br><br>Emile Mpenza, in for the injured Valeri Bojinov, had an even better chance after Stephen Ireland sent him through but the striker made poor contact on his effort.<br><br>Elano had the best of the first-half chances for City but he barely tested Almunia with a shot from the edge of the area when he had team-mates waiting for a pass.<br><br>The pressure from the home side built after the half-hour mark and they almost took the lead in the 36th minute, but Van Persie was inches away from Fabregas' cross.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frustrated</span></strong><br><br>Arsenal were frustrated further after the break, with Adebayor and Tomas Rosicky denied, before City began to come back into the game.<br><br>First Petrov flashed a shot wide of the far post after cutting in from the left, but Toure collided with Johnson in the penalty area but got the benefit of the doubt from referee Foy.<br><br>Then after 62 minutes Mpenza raced through onto Ireland's clever flick but Almunia spread himself to deny the striker.<br><br>They were almost made to rue their misses when Richards brought down Hleb in the area and the assistant referee instructed Foy to point to the spot.<br><br>However, Schmeichel saved with his legs as Van Persie blasted down the middle, and he denied the striker again two minutes later from a long-range effort.<br><br>The City keeper then tipped Fabregas' powerful effort over the bar.<br><br>But the Spaniard was not to be denied with 10 minutes remaining.<br><br>The ball was fed to Hleb on the right before he slipped a pass Fabregas who smashed into the roof of the net at the near post.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wenger Pleased With Character Of Arsenal</strong><br><br><img src="http://dynimg.rte.ie/000070fa10dr.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger has once again praised his sideÂ’s determination after Arsenal fought doggedly for a 1-0 victory over early pace-setters Manchester City.<br><br>The game was glorious to watch as Arsenal lit up the pitch with some wonderfully fluid attacking football. As was the case throughout last season though, for all their prowess, the home side failed to finish their chances.<br><br>City came to the Emirates high on confidence after a 100% start to their campaign and for 80 minutes, they looked like keeping another clean sheet.<br><br>Cesc Fabregas struck with ten minutes to go to secure the points for Arsenal and Wenger was happy that his side never gave up against an impressive City side.<br><br>Â“I thought we would score a goal because I saw that the team was keeping their way and going with a lot of determination and we do have enough quality to score one,Â” he told Sky Sports.<br><br>Â“But I must say that we came up against a good Man City team who defended very well and we needed a lot of determined attitude.Â”<br><br>Robin van Persie had an opportunity to score from the penalty spot on the hour after Micah Richards brought down Aliaksandre Hleb, but the Dutchman saw his effort saved by Kasper Schmeichel.<br><br>But Wenger was impressed by the teamÂ’s spirit as they came back from that disappointment to win the match.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s what I like the most. We were 1-0 down against Fulham and in the end we won 2-1 today we were unfortunate with the penalty but the team kept going and won in the need and that always takes something special in the side.<br><br>We feel that the spirit is right, the quality is there and the desire in the side is fantastic. We have all the ingredients we must now focus on consistency,Â” said the Frenchman.<br><br>It was down to midfielder Cesc Fabregas to secure the win and Wenger hopes from more goals from his young playmaker.<br><br>"I think Cesc will contribute more goals. Gerrard got 20 but I think Cesc will as well. But he contributes more with the assists as well which balances out the fact he doesn't score. But he did not actually have a chance today in the penalty area," he told ArsenalÂ’s official website.<br><br>With the transfer market due to close in less than a week, Wenger took the opportunity to state that he believed he had enough quality in the team already<br><br>"I am not in the market for any new players," he concluded.</div>
