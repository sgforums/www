              <p>Arsenal had fine chances throughout the first thirty minutes. Walcott
                      laid a perfectly weighted ball on the half-way line onto the
                      grateful Adebayor. Leaving defenders in the wake, the Togolese
                      international virtually had a one-on-one opportunity with new
                      Netherlands number one, Maarten Stekelenburg. <br> <br> As soon as Ade ran into the box though he made the wrong decision.
                      Instead of feinting his shoulder to the side, and taking the ball round
                      the glovesman to stroll the ball into the Dutch net, he tried to dink
                      the ball over the keeper but ended up hitting it directly at the
                      stopper.<br> <br> Fabregas too had a chance to break the deadlock, striking the ball
                      perfectly with his right foot from about 25 yards out, showing great
                      technique in getting the ball up-and-down and curling it into the near
                      corner. Stekelenburg however denied the European Championship winner
                      by theatrically palming the ball into touch.<br> <br> Robin Van Persie and Emmanuel Adebayor were linking up well for half an
                      hour, and providing the former Feyenoord man stays fit all season, then
                      Premier League defenders will be on red alert.<br> <br> Just after the half hour mark, Suarez unleashed an unstoppable
                      half-volley past Manuel Almunia, to notch not just the first goal of
                      the game, but also the first goal of the tournament, after the earlier
                      game between Internazionale and Sevilla ended goalless. <br> <br> Huntelaar struck a second immediately after the restart with trademark
                      opportunism; seemingly taking a deflection off the
                      backing-out Toure, but replays showed that the Ajax forward had just
                      pegged the ball with enough swerve to take it round the Spanish
                      stopper, Almunia. Kolo Toure may feel slightly responsible due to his
                      inability to clear the ball properly prior to the goal.<br> <br> Five minutes before time, Huntelaar - the natural predator that he is,
                      again rolled the ball past Arsenal's custodian, but the move was
                      rightly ruled offside, as the Dutchman was three yards off the last
                      defender.<br> <br> After taking their time getting involved with the game, the final
                      quarter of the first half certainly belonged to Ajax. Arsenal went into
                      the break two goals down, and Wenger, who had been irate most of the
                      half due to his team's carelessness in giving the ball away, will
                      surely have vented his fury in the dressing room. <br> <br> The half time statistics say everything about this match so far.  The
                      Amsterdam outfit had 4 shots in total, 2 on target, and had a brace of
                      goals to show for their efforts. Arsenal on the other hand had 7 shots
                      in total, 5 on target, and still drew a blank.<br> <br> Steve McClaren was in the stadium and will be encouraged by the
                      performance he had seen so far considering his FC Twente side will play
                      host to an Arsenal side that will surely consist of the same
                      components. The former England manager should have gone home at half
                      time comforted, for if he stayed for the second, he would have left
                      worried.<br> <br> Ajax emerged from the break looking confident and more organised at the back compared to their North London visitors. <br> <br> Arsene Wenger will be hoping for a better performance from his
                      Brazilian midfielder. Denilson had been largely anonymous all game, and
                      if he is to stake a regular claim for the spot to the side of Fabregas,
                      then he would have been ordered to get his act together.<br> <br> Stekelenburg had been nothing short of commanding all first half, and
                      again he bossed his area early in the second by claiming crosses and
                      distributing early, releasing his team-mates on the counter, but
                      nothing coming to fruition.<br> <br> William Gallas and ex-Barca defender Gabri were both booked for
                      separate incidents after ten minutes of the restart. Two minutes later
                      and Fabregas is also cautioned for showing his studs to Silva.<br> <br> Adebayor and Van Persie linked up well again on the 62nd minute after
                      Manu was threaded through and sprinted away, his ball to Robin though
                      was too heavy and by the time the he had controlled it, he had already
                      been shut down.<br> <br> Four minutes later Eboue, for the first time in the match, found
                      Adebayor's head with a perfect in-swinging cross that the tall
                      centre-forward powerfully plumbed into the opponents net. <br> <br> Not long after, Arsenal were searching for an equaliser, and from the
                      same side Eboue put Sagna through who had been marching on the overlap,
                      Bacary then swooped the ball in to substitute Bendtner (on for Walcott)
                      who headed straight into Maarten's mitts.<br> <br> Bendtner carried on his fine goal-scoring form as Adebayor leaves
                      Ajax's subsitute goalkeeper in no mans land, keeps his composure on the
                      touchline as the keeper flaps, passes back, and Nicklas thumps a neat
                      but powerful finish into the opposition net.<br> <br> Most of the play was then in Arsenal's final third, the passing was
                      more confident, and Ajax seemed to content to back off play while they
                      recouperated and reflected on Arsenal's ability to creep back into the
                      game.<br> <br> For the third, Ajax were carved apart. A perfect team goal as
                      touch-and-move football is given a visual education to all those who
                      wanted
                      schooling. Denilson set up Adebayor and all he can do is find the net
                      for his second - much to the delight of the visiting fans. Ajax may
                      feel aggrieved as even though Van Persie was not involved in the build
                      up, he certainly impeded the keeper's vision, blocking his view of the
                      shot.<br> <br> More substitutes, and the young gun of the moment, Jack Wilshere, comes
                      on for Fabregas with five minutes remaining. Denilson had been
                      complaining for some time about feeling uncomfortable on the pitch and
                      he is brought off - Welsh teen Aaron Ramsey takes his place.<br> <br> The game finished and Arsenal top the table with six points in the annual Amsterdam event.<br> <br> Wenger will feel pleased with his team's second half performance in
                      overturning a 2-0 deficit. Ajax coach Van Basten however will be
                      particularly perturbed by his side's inability to hold onto a lead. <br><br>At the end of the game Cesc Fabregas told<em> Sky Sports</em> : "That is what it is all about, we want to be there in the Champions
                      League and opponents like this are ones we shall face. The boss said we
                      were second best in the first half, but we created chances and in the
                      second half were more aggressive, I think we deserved it."<br><br>Fabregas added: "I love playing for this team and for these fans... I will always give 100 per cent."<br><br>Arsene Wenger told <em>Sky Sports</em>:
                      It was the game we wanted, high-paced, Ajax fought for every ball...
                      they died after an hour though. We lapsed concentration for their two
                      goals within two minutes, but they were good strikes. Overall we came
                      back well. Adebayor did very well. We looked dangerous going forward,
                      defensively our positioning was not right."<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Line Ups:</span><br> <br> <strong>Ajax</strong> - Stekenlenberg, Silva, Olegeur, Anita, Schilder, Gabri, Lindgren, Aissati, Suarez, Huntelaar, Sulejmani.<br> <br> <strong>Arsenal</strong> - Almunia, Clichy, Toure, Gallas, Sagna, Walcott, Denilson, Fabregas, Eboue, Van Persie, Adebayor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>An exciting match featuring Arsenal's first 11 with the scoreline  2-3 at the end in Arsenal's favour. Ajax's 2 goals kan nice. Next up is Inter Milan and Sevilla live on Supersport.<br></em></p>

              <p>The Gunners fought
              back from a two-goal defecit to claim victory against the Dutch giants,
              Emmanuel Adebayor and Nicklas Bendtner netting three times between them
              to save the blushes of defensive duo Kolo Toure and William Gallas.</p>
              <p>The win sees the Londoners top the Amsterdam Tournament standings as
              they continue their pre-season preparations ahead of their European
              qualifier against Twente, the first leg of which takes place on
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>And while there is clearly room for improvement, Wenger believes the
              Ajax clash gave a perfect insight into what his men can expect when
              they face the Tukkers.</p>
              <p>"We had an idea tonight of what we can get at Twente," he told <em>Sky Sports 2</em>. "I think the pace will be the same."</p>
              <p>Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas agrees, and added: "In a week's
              time we play a big part of the season, which is the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"We want to be there so we know we have to be ready, and opponents like this (Ajax) are the sort of opponents we will face."</p>
              <p>Arsenal will face Sevilla today in their final hit-out before the Twente clash.</p>
