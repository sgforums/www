            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>his thoughts on the game...</strong><br><br>"I thought first half we looked a bit... it was a sunny evening, itÂ’s an end of season game, you know? And to be honest I think they could have gone in front. We didnÂ’t move the ball around quickly enough and it was a bit disappointing first half. But in the second half after weÂ’d had a chat to them at half time theyÂ’ve come out and played as they have in the last three or four games. ItÂ’s not got them the results theyÂ’ve deserved in recent weeks but tonight to be fair to them theyÂ’ve come away and got a win."<br><br><strong>on the second-half performance...</strong><br><br>"To be fair there could have been a lot more goals from both sides. Second half we were a lot tighter and got about the job. I told them itÂ’s not the end of the season and that theyÂ’re still playing and will continue to play until the end of the season. And I think theyÂ’ve pulled their socks up in the second half and really impressed me. We played right until the end and we created the chances. Maybe we got a bit bogged down with how Fulham played early on but we pointed a few things out to the players at the break and I think they took it all on board."<br><br><strong>on the influence of Johan Djourou, Justin Hoyte and Mart Poom...</strong><br><br>"Of course it makes a difference. TheyÂ’ve all had first-team experience and when these lads see the way Mart Poom, Justin [Hoyte] and Johan [Djourou] apply themselves itÂ’s great for them. ItÂ’s good for them, gives the side a bit of strength and they can work off of that. At times we needed them once or twice tonight and itÂ’s nice for them to come along and play - but only when the manger says. IÂ’m pleased with the way these boys have played all year and I think we will see the benefit in coming seasons."<br><br><strong>on the impressive return of Joe OÂ’Cearuill...</strong><br><br>"It just shows the benefit of a loan period. HeÂ’s gone out to Brighton, heÂ’s had league experience and you can see the difference. Who knows for Joe whatÂ’s in store for him? But heÂ’s come back in and had a good return for us tonight."<br><br><strong>on his expectations for the remainder of the season...</strong><br><br>"IÂ’ve put a bit of a demand on them as to what I expect over the next three or four games and hopefully theyÂ’ll come out and prove to me they can do it. Hopefully, we can continue the way weÂ’ve played recently and also win a few more games too. Quite a few of these lads have put in performances that hopefully, if they can continue to produce, will force ArsÃ¨ne [Wenger] to play them in the Carling Cup next season. And thatÂ’s another progression in their development for the Club."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Gooner coach on the recent reserve game against Fulham..</span></span></div>
