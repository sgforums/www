            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Honours even at Fratton Park</strong><br><br>It finished all square at Fratton Park on Sunday as Portsmouth just missed out on a place in Europe on the final day of the season.<br><br>Despite a lack of goals both Pompey and Arsenal created plenty of chances and as goalless draws go this one was as fast-paced and eventful as they come.<br><br>Portsmouth had a good chance to go in front inside the first five minutes when Niko KranjcarÂ’s free-kick found the feet of Sean Davis who hit the ball just wide of the left post.<br><br>Minutes later Arsenal were attacking, Julio Baptista picked up on a ball in by Cesc Fabregas but his shot on target was cleared on the line by Djimi Traore.<br><br>With most of the possession in midfield leading up to the half hour mark the pace seemed to steady until Baptista again came close to putting the Gunners in front Â— a long ball in from Fabregas found the head of the Brazilian but the ball went just wide of the left post.<br><br>And almost immediately after Nwankwo Kanu at the other end sent the ball rocketing towards the net from 25 yards out but his effort was pushed over the bar by Mark Poom.<br><br>Five minutes from half-time Arsenal were awarded a penalty after Linvoy Primus made a reckless challenge on Emmanuel Eboue in the area. Baptista, who had been a constant threat for most of the game, stepped up for the spot kick but James pulled off a tremendous save to leave it goalless at half-time.<br><br>Arsenal started the second half well with an early chance to take the lead when Alexander Hleb's running down the left came one-on-one with the keeper but hit the ball just wide of the left-hand post.<br><br>Probably the best chance of the game though came for Portsmouth and Tresor Lomana Lua Lua who was clear on goal but was left looking to the sky in disbelief after he hit the ball wide on 50 minutes before being flagged offside.<br><br>Controversy then reared its head as Portsmouth finally found the back of the net just before the 70-minute marker but the goal was disallowed. Poom made a double save clearing shots from Lua Lua and Richard Hughes before Kranjcar finally netted only for the linesman to make a late call for offside.<br><br>Shots on goal were few and far between for the final 20 minutes with the closest in ArsenalÂ’s favour as Fabregas took an adventurous long range shot but hit it wide of the post to leave it goalless at full-time. </span></div>
