            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Arsenal ended a turbulent week on a positive note by hanging on for a 2-1 victory over Reading at Emirates Stadium.<br><br>Gilberto Silva's penalty early in the second half, after Andre Bikey brought down Gael Clichy, set The Gunners on their way before Julio Baptista poked home a second on 62 minutes.<br><br>Cesc Fabregas diverted a corner into his own net three minutes from time as Reading mounted a plucky response after falling 2-0 behind.<br><br>With three players suspended as a result of last week's defeat to Chelsea, The Gunners overcame that hindrance to snap a run of three defeats in a row.<br><br>Arsenal dominated possession for long periods, but their passing lacked the crispness and fluency which illuminated the Carling Cup final the week before.<br><br>Baptista, looking a tad uncomfortable leading the line, shot wide from Alexander Hleb's pass, as The Gunners seemed happier when breaking on the odd occasions when Reading attacked.<br><br>One such moment arrived on 12 minutes as, from a Reading free-kick near the Arsenal box, Hleb set off downfield before passing to Freddie Ljungberg, who played a one-two with William Gallas only to be denied by Marcus Hahnemann.<br><br>A lull in the action saw the linesman require a change of flag, while Reading chairman John Madejski was flanked by Chris Tarrant and Cilla Black in the stands.<br><br>Former Arsenal midfielder Steve Sidwell shot straight at Jens Lehmann before a lapse from another ex-Gunner - James Harper - should have resulted in the home side taking the lead.<br><br>Harper failed to cut out a loose ball in the box, Baptista unselfishly drew Hahnemann out of his goal before squaring to Fabregas, who swung and mis-kicked with an open net inviting a simple finish.<br><br>Hahnemann made another good save from Ljungberg at the end of the first half, but the Swede was adjudged offside in any event.<br><br>Arsenal showed a bit more thrust in the early stages of the second period and Hahnemann needed a flying save to turn away Fabregas' thumping drive.<br><br>On 51 minutes, the break Arsenal wanted arrived as Bikey brought down Clichy in the box and Gilberto steered his penalty into the corner of the net.<br><br>Their tails up, The Gunners should have had a second goal on 59 minutes as Fabregas' sumptuous pass released Theo Walcott in behind the defence, but Hahnemann was out quickly to block the youngster's shot.<br><br>From the resulting corner, the Reading keeper was less assured, flapping at Fabregas' set-piece and needing Glen Little to head clear at the far post.<br><br>Arsenal amply demonstrated their ability on the counter attack on 62 minutes as Reading fell 2-0 behind after forcing a corner at the opposite end.<br><br>The ball was eventually shuffled to Denilson in the centre circle, who passed it on to Baptista and the Brazilian somehow jinked past Graeme Murty before poking his shot beyond Hahnemann.<br><br>Reading could have salvaged an immediate lifeline, but Sidwell missed the chance to score against his old club when heading over a corner from six yards out.<br><br>Sidwell then had another opportunity to punish loose defending, but fired his shot wide of the upright after Arsenal had failed to clear inside their own box.<br><br>The Gunners wanted a second penalty moments later, but Hahnemann appeared to just get a touch on the ball as Baptista tried to take it round the American keeper.<br><br>Reading set up a nervy finish by pulling a goal back three minutes from time. Philippe Senderos, having just come on for Hleb, glanced on a corner and, in sticking out a leg, Fabregas could only turn the ball into his own net.<br><br>With Arsenal's defending becoming increasingly desperate, Sidwell was presented with another chance to score, but his sweetly-struck volley drew a fine save from Lehmann at the near post as the hosts saw out four minutes of injury-time without further alarm.</span></div>
