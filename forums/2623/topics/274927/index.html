            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/24/images/2006122407991901.jpg"><br><br>BLACKBURN ROVERS take on Arsenal at Edwood Park today with manager Mark Hughes having warned his players that Robin van Persie can succeed Thierry Henry as the Arsene Wenger's Top Gun.<br><br>Hughes is relieved that Henry is no longer in the Arsenal line-up but dismisses suggestion that the Gunners are likely to drop out of the top four.<br><br>The Blackburn manager said: "Thierry Henry was an outstanding player for them for many, many years and you always feared an Arsenal side with him in the line-up. But they have got other young players that can come to the fore.<br><br>"Take van Persie, who has been a thorn in our side in recent years. He is an outstanding talent and maybe it's time for him to step up to the mark and be the main man. When one great player leaves a great club, invariably another player steps in to his place."<br><br>Blackburn have their own new talisman this season in Roque Santa Cruz, who has shown immense promise following his move from Bayern Munich. He could partner Benni McCarthy up front for the first time today if the South African is judged to have recovered from concussion after his head injury last weekend.<br><br>The pair have already struck up a friendship off the field and Hughes believes they will also click on the pitch. "Benni likes to come off and get involved in the build-up and Roque goes long and gives us an aerial threat. They can become a good partnership. Roque has scored two goals in two games. I believe he is going to have an outstanding season."<br><br>The Gunners travel to Ewood Park with memories of last season's bitter FA Cup defeat at the hands of Rovers still fresh in their minds.<br><br>After a 0-0 draw at the Emirates Stadium, Cesc Fabregas made insulting remarks to Hughes, while Wenger was also uncomplimentary about Blackburn following their 1-0 win in the replay. Hughes claims, however, that those events are in the past.<br><br>"People seem to forget a few weeks before that we had been beaten by six goals at the Emirates. We went back there with a gameplan, got the job done, Benni was available for the replay and he made the difference."<br><br>Asked about the responses of Fabregas and Wenger, the Rovers boss added: "In fairness to the young man he apologised afterwards in the dressing room and that was the end of it as far as I am concerned.<br><br>"And when managers get beat they tend to look at the game from their point of view and I'm guilty of that as well. After you have had a painful defeat it can be difficult to give credit to the opposing team and you have to recognise that."<br><br>Summer signing Eduardo da Silva could make his debut for the Gunners if the Croatian frontman shakes off his ankle problem.</div>
