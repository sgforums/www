              <p><br>dude arsenal only got lucky that they face ac milan, a team with a lot of oldbies who cant run as fast as youngsters in arsenal. They were just lucky to face a team that is more technical but slow. And arsenal only scored their goals in the 80+mins. If they had not scored, the match will go into extra time at san siro!</p>
              <p>I dont think the UCL against AC milan is even that good at all. arsenal are just lucky to score first in a match that could have gone either way. (i admit arsenal attack more in the match though). Arsenal are also just lucky to get AC milan instead of inter. Look at how inter dominate ac milan in serie a league match you know liao.</p>

              <p><br> dude arsenal only got lucky that they face ac milan, a team with a
              lot of oldbies who cant run as fast as youngsters in arsenal. They
              were just lucky to face a team that is more technical but slow. And
              arsenal only scored their goals in the 80+mins. If they had not
              scored, the match will go into extra time at san siro!</p>
              <p>I dont think the UCL against AC milan is even that good at all.
              arsenal are just lucky to score first in a match that could have
              gone either way. (i admit arsenal attack more in the match though).
              Arsenal are also just lucky to get AC milan instead of inter. Look
              at how inter dominate ac milan in serie a league match you know
              liao.</p>

              <p>But man utd faced exactly the similar milan the last time. Its just that different feeling and passion when you face giants like AC.</p>

              <p>and for what? when he leaves arsenal, all the money he saved will be used up by the next manager and nobody will thank him for it.</p>
              <p>instead they will remember it as the miser who cost arsenal titles due to his pride or sth.</p>
              <p>its ok to depend on his youth, but when money is running around now in the epl and every club spending millions, its quite different from the 92 man utd team that was mostly youths too.</p>

              <p><br>The thing i guess is... unlike their previous CEO Dein. The Arsenal board of directors are only interested on their yearly big payday... They are not interested on spending big money on players... And i sincerely doubt they are even interested in football or seriously keen on winning the titles... These are businessmen who are only interested in the money and winning comes in second. </p>
              <p>From how i look at it, over the years... They have approved and sold their best players if the money was right... This isn't a club thats going for titles... Making profits are their main objective... By next year, their turnover could be as high or higher than Real Madrid after the Tv rights deal come into effect...</p>
              <p>The directors are waiting eagerly to milk their club's profits that they actually made a pack not to sell now cos the returns could be more in 2 to 3 yrs time... And of course, better not to spend on players now when they may sell in a year or 2 time or their profits could be lesser... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p><br>You are right. 5 points isn't alot... That match at Stamford Bridge is the most important and could be the title decided... Apart from it, Everton away will be the only difficult game they have... So everything is still very open... I won't even count Arsenal out yet... cos anything can happen in football.</p>
