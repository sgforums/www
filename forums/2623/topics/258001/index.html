            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Thierry Henry has cast doubt on his future at Arsenal by leaving open the possibility of a transfer this summer. Two months after saying that he intended to finish his career at the club, the striker went no further yesterday than saying: "For now I'm an Arsenal player."<br><br>Henry was responding to a question, during a promotional tour in Beijing, about suggestions he may leave for Barcelona, who hope to buy him. He noted separately that there has been "a lot of stuff happening at the club recently", which includes the departure of David Dein, the former vice-chairman, and made clear his disillusionment with Arsenal's Premiership placings over the past two years.<br><br>"This year it was pretty difficult to see once again that we finished so far behind the top teams," he said, adding: "I'm actually getting annoyed that we're finishing at the end of the top four."<br><br>He believes the squad lacks experience: "Sometimes having a lot of youngsters in your squad you cannot have the same spirit or the same result that you had the year we stayed unbeaten [in the league]. We had guys who had been in the game for 15 or 10 years and who had won a lot."<br><br>Portsmouth have signed Ghana's Sulley Muntari from Udinese for a club record fee, thought to be about Â£7m.<br><br>Liverpool are considering offering Sami Hyypia a new two-year contract to stave off interest from Wigan Athletic. Rafael BenÃ­tez, who is increasingly confident his demands for significant transfer funds will be met by the club's American owners, also hopes to buy the the Real Zaragoza centre-half Gabriel Milito.<br><br>Oldham are set to sign Lee Hughes when he is released from prison this summer. Hughes, 31, was sentenced to six years' imprisonment in August 2004 for causing death by dangerous driving.<br><br>Ronaldinho has received a one-game ban for last Saturday's red card, clearing him to play in Barcelona's final Spanish League game against Gimnastic. Celtic are to sign the striker Chris Killen from Hibernian on a free.</span></div>

So that will never, ever stop.<br><br>"But, as I said, for now I'm an Arsenal player. So there is nothing to add to it.<br><br>"For now I am an Arsenal player, so that's all I can tell you."<br><br>Barca are reportedly willing to allow Samuel Eto'o to join the Gunners as part of the package to snare Henry.<br><br>Henry, 29, has been with Arsenal since the summer of 1999, scoring a club record 226 goals in 359 appearances.</div>
