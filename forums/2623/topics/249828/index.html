It's frustrating, I couldn't Tottenham creating many chances today, they scored two goals," added Wenger.<br><br>"It's been the story of the season. We had fantastic spirit and a great quality to our game but we have to learn to make the maximum of what we create.<br><br>"Of course to come out of the game with the chances Tottenham created and to concede two goals is too many.<br><br>"We hit the post three times and had two or three crosses plus the shots, I think we should have scored at least five today.<br><br>"It is a bit confidence, maturity as well, but the basic ingredients are fantastic and we have to keep working and believe in what we do because we produced some outstanding football today." </span></div>
