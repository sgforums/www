            <div class='col-md body'>One of the most romantic tales in HighburyÂ’s folkore has been given a new twist by a recent discovery by workmen currently redeveloping ArsenalÂ’s old stadium.<br><br>Until the early 1990s, it was strongly rumoured that a horse was buried under HighburyÂ’s North Bank Stand, with stories suggesting that a horse, together with the cart it was pulling had accidentally tumbled to its death while the foundations of the original North Bank construction were being laid in 1913.<br><br>However, no equine remains were discovered when the North Bank was redeveloped in 1992, seemingly scuppering this part of Highbury heritage. That is until now!<br><br>Further to ArsenalÂ’s move to Emirates Stadium last summer, the development of the ClubÂ’s old stadium into Highbury Square has meant further digging has been necessary. And, deep below the surface, workmen from main contractor Sir Robert McAlpine, discovered two horseshoes alongside the remains of some timber, believed to be the cart.<br><br>Pat Brennan, the workman who discovered the artefacts said: "We were digging at the north end of the site, where we are excavating for the foundations of the Highbury Square apartments and discovered what looked like two rusty old horseshoes. I took them to the site offices and one of the lads, who is an Arsenal fan, mentioned the story about the horse. ItÂ’s great to think that I may have found some items which have a place in ArsenalÂ’s history."<br><br>Ninety per cent of apartments are now sold at the development of 711 high-spec one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments and penthouses, all of which will all be completed by summer 2009.<br><br>Demolition at Highbury started in August last year, with two of the four stands being completely demolished by the end of January this year. The Art Deco faÃ§ades of the existing Grade II-Listed East Stand, with its famous Marble Hall, and the locally-listed West Stand remain as construction currently continues around them.<br><br>Over half a million man hours have now been completed on site since work began, and just over 800 workers will be on the development at the peak of construction. A concrete batching plant has been constructed at the centre of the former pitch, 145,000 m3 of material has been excavated and approximately 14,000m3 of concrete has been poured.<br></div>
