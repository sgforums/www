But today I am very happy to be at Arsenal. And I want to say that I have nothing against Chelsea.<br><br>Â“I experienced bad but also good moments there and they are at least the club that made me a France international and made me discover England. I owe them a lot and it will remain a good step in my life.Â”<br><br>The young and versatile player, who impressed at right back with Les Bleus in the goalless draw with Italy recently, has revealed his former employers offered him the chance to sign a new contract.<br><br>Â“Chelsea did everything to make me stay until the last moment. They wanted to extend me a number of times but I did not want for reason they know,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“For me is better today to play for such a club as Arsenal with a coach like Arsene Wenger, who knows me. It was the best for me to leave Chelsea.Â”<br><br>The 22-year-old has explained he was not part of Jose MourinhoÂ’s plans for the beginning of the season and the fact that he would not have appeared regularly at Stamford Bridge made him leave.<br><br>Â“LetÂ’s say that the coach (Jose Mourinho) decided that I would not play until September 1. If I hadnÂ’t left, I would have been part of the group like everybody and I would had to fight like the previous years.<br><br>Â“I play some matches last year on my second season. The coach knows me and letÂ’s say that I proved a little more than two years ago. So if I had stayed, I would have played a little less but not enough to my view, that is the reason why I left."<br><br>Diarra previously revealed Claude Makelele was his guide at Chelsea, but the midfielder thinks he is ready to fly on his own now.<br><br>Â“Everybody needs somebody!Â” he said.<br><br>Â“At Arsenal, there is William Gallas, but I think I am stronger than two years ago so I can do things on my own.<br><br>Â“I joined Arsenal because it was my decision. The coach knows what I can do. For my part, I know what he wants me to do.Â”</div>
