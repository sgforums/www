              <h1>Cesc, Adebayor and Walcott back for Man City</h1>
              <p><a title="Cesc Fabregas (4) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/cesc-fabregas">Cesc Fabregas</a> is set to be named in the Arsenal squad on Saturday for the first time since before Christmas.</p>
              <p>The captain was last seen hobbling off just before half time against
              Liverpool on December 21 after picking up an injury to his knee
              ligaments.</p>
              <p>The return of Fabregas is one of the major names involved in
              Arsenal's injury merry-go-round before the game against Manchester City
              on Saturday. <a title="Emmanuel Adebayor (25) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/emmanuel-adebayor">Emmanuel Adebayor</a> (hamstring) is back after two months out while <a title="Theo Walcott (14) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/theo-walcott">Theo Walcott</a> (knee) is available following a fortnight on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>But <a title="Robin Van Persie (11) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/robin-van-persie">Robin van Persie</a> (groin), <a title="Eduardo (9) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/eduardo">Eduardo</a> (groin) and <a title="Abou Diaby (2) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/abou-diaby">Abou Diaby</a> (thigh) will be absent after all three picked up injuries on international duty. <a title="Samir Nasri (8) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/samir-nasri">Samir Nasri</a> (flu) and <a title="Carlos Vela (12) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/carlos-vela">Carlos Vela</a> (fatigue) may also miss out. But <a title="Nicklas Bendtner (26) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/nicklas-bendtner">Nicklas Bendtner</a> should be available despite picking up a knee problem for Denmark on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"We have lost <a title="Robin Van Persie (11) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/robin-van-persie">Robin van Persie</a> for a groin problem," manager Arsène Wenger said.</p>
              <p>"We have also lost <a title="Eduardo (9) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/eduardo">Eduardo</a> through a groin problem, he picked it up after 80 minutes in the Croatian game. We lose aswell <a title="Abou Diaby (2) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/abou-diaby">Abou Diaby</a> with a thigh problem that he picked up in France in training. We might
              lose Nasri too because he came back with flu and could not practice
              today.</p>
              <p>"So three players are out and there is a question mark over Nasri.
              But Fabregas, Adebayor and Walcott are all back and available in the
              squad.</p>
              <p>"Nicklas texted us last night and said everything was alright with him. But <a title="Carlos Vela (12) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/carlos-vela">Carlos Vela</a>, I count out because he lands on Friday morning at 10.30am. However if needed he can be in the squad."</p>

              <p>well derserved win for the gunner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal pair
              Emmanuel Adebayor and Cesc Fabregas returned from injury to help
              inspire a 2-0 triumph over Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on
              Saturday. </strong></p>
              <p>Togo international Adebayor had not featured for the
              Gunners since February while Gunners captain Fabregas has been
              recovering from a serious knee injury he sustained last December.</p>
              <p>And
              the duo made their comebacks in style as Fabregas' eighth minute
              free-kick allowed the unmarked Adeabyor to open the scoring against
              their affluent opponents, who have struggled on the road this season.</p>
              <p>After
              a shaky start, Mark Hughes' men did find their feet and substitute
              Gelson Fernandes went mighty close to restoring parity before half-time
              when his strike clipped off the outside of the post.</p>
              <p>Arsenal,
              though, started the second period in excellent tempo, and they put the
              game beyond City's reach when Fabregas' dinked through-ball found the
              feet of Adebayor, who coolly tapped home to ensure the club tightened
              their grip on fourth place.</p>
              <h4>Bundled</h4>
              <p>The Gunners came into
              the game on an unbeaten league run of 16 matches which had taken them
              back into the top four while City had secured just one away win this
              season, but they were the last team to beat Wenger's men back in late
              November.</p>
              <p>Nigel de Jong tested Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia with a low drive from 20 yards.</p>
              <p>Arsenal,
              though, went ahead on eight minutes after they were awarded a free-kick
              on the right when Robinho bundled over Bacary Sagna.</p>
              <p>Fabregas'
              delivery to the penalty spot was inch-perfect for Adebayor, who powered
              a header back into the bottom corner for his 13th goal of the season.</p>
              <p>Arsenal
              - without leading scorer Robin van Persie because of a groin injury
              suffered during the international break - continued to press.</p>
              <p>Fabregas ran to the near post and his cross was cut out by City captain Richard Dunne.</p>
              <p>The
              visitors were forced into a change on 17 minutes when full-back Wayne
              Bridge - just back from a hamstring injury - limped off, to be replaced
              by Gelson.</p>
              <p>Arsenal continued to dominate and force City back into their own half.</p>
              <p>Defender Kolo Toure charged into the right side of the area, and forced a save from Shay Given at his near post.</p>
              <p>City broke away in the 27th minute through Shaun Wright-Phillips.</p>
              <p>His
              run and pass played in Micah Richards, who had charged up field before
              driving in a low, angled shot which was kept out by the legs of Almunia.</p>
              <p>It should then have been 1-1 when Wright-Phillips slipped in Fernandes, who was unmarked on the penalty spot.</p>
              <p>However, his shot on the turn struck the outside of the post when it really should have nestled in the back of the net.</p>
              <p>Almunia was out quickly to grab the ball at the feet of Bellamy as the Wales striker dashed into the Arsenal penalty area.</p>
              <h5>Silky</h5>
              <p>In
              stoppage-time, Andrey Arshavin played a lovely one-two with Adebayor on
              the edge of the City box, and his curling shot was pushed away by Given.</p>
              <p>Adebayor
              made it 2-0 at the start of the second half. Again Fabregas was the
              provider, this time sending a superbly weighted, angled chip over Dunne
              into City's penalty area on 49 minutes.</p>
              <p>The 6ft 3ins striker gratefully received the ball once more, drawing Given before rolling it into the net.</p>
              <p>Song headed over from a corner before Denilson drilled a 25-yard shot wide as Arsenal threatened to run riot.</p>
              <p>City,
              though, refused to lay down. Pablo Zabaleta checked Almunia was still
              awake with a 20-yard drive, which the Spanish goalkeeper palmed down.</p>
              <p>Arsenal
              were soon back on the offensive, as William Gallas blasted a shot
              across goal after being picked out by a deep ball into the City area.</p>
              <p>Dunne cleared off the line after Theo Walcott had nipped in down the right and drew the goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>Perhaps
              with one eye on next week's UEFA Champions League quarter-final first
              leg away to Villarreal in mind, Wenger made a change on 70 minutes as
              Nicklas Bendtner replaced Adebayor and Emmanuel Eboue came on for
              Walcott.</p>
              <p>Fabregas was given a well-deserved rest when he was replaced by Aaron Ramsey - leaving the field to a standing ovation.</p>
