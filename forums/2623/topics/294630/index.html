            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill has defended Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's policy of signing young foreign talent.</strong><br><br>England's failure to reach Euro 2008 has led to some sections pointing the finger at the number of foreign players currently plying their trade in the Premier League.<br><br>Suggestions have been made that players from abroad restrict the development of young home-grown talent.<br><br>Gunners boss Wenger is renowned for his ability to identify potential, and he has often recruited from abroad in a bid to build on his squad.<br><br>His actions have received criticism from some, however O'Neill has defended Wenger's policy, expressing his belief that English players can only benefit from playing alongside and against gifted footballers.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responsibility</span></strong><br><br>"It is not his job to make the England side better," he said.<br><br>"People say having few English players at Arsenal does not help England - but that is not Arsene Wenger's job.<br><br>"His job is not to make the England national side better. His job is to win football games for Arsenal. He has done that consistently and brilliantly for 10 years.<br><br>"My own view is that if you are good enough, you will come through. It might take a bit longer but you will come through.<br><br>"The point I make is if you have some English players playing in those great sides, as Arsenal did with the whole back four at one stage, then, with playing alongside great foreign players, they can only improve.<br><br><strong>Fruitful</strong><br><br>"We have gone down a certain route at the moment with having quite a few English players. Whether it is fruitful in the long term, who knows? It is a route I am kind of following now.<br><br>"But our next couple of signings might be really decent foreign players. My job is also to try to win enough football games for Villa for me to try to keep this process going.<br><br>"I am delighted with some of the young English players we (Aston Villa) have. (Gabriel) Agbonlahor and (Ashley) Young are thriving at the moment which is great and (Gareth) Barry has earned his place in the England team.<br><br>"But if you are a club manager, and if you job is to win games for your club, then it shouldn't matter who you sign and Arsene has built some really great teams."</div>
