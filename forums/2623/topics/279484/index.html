            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.tah.de/afp/deutsch/sport/images/188994.jpg"><br><br>The Frenchman agreed a three-year contract last week to commit himself to Arsenal until 2011 and, after being hailed by Bob Wilson as the club's greatest manager at the launch of the new Arsenal Opus book, he said that he wanted to finish his career at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>"I am at a stage in my career now where I don't want to be associated with anyone else," he said. "I met this club at the right moment of my life. I was mature enough to give what I had learnt. I had difficult times at the start, but the club was always behind me."<br><br>Arsenal face Tottenham at White Hart Lane tomorrow and the comparison between Wenger and Martin Jol, whose own relationship with his club's directors has been the subject of intense conjecture, is difficult to ignore.<br><br>"It is like a marriage," said Wenger. "You need clear rules at the start - you have the freedom to accept them or not. I had the freedom to work with my ideas. I had the support of the club and the fans. That is the biggest luxury in the job."<br><br>Wenger also admitted that Jens Lehmann is no longer his automatic first-choice goalkeeper. Lehmann played for Germany in their Euro 2008 qualifier against Wales on Saturday, but missed Wednesday's friendly against Romania.<br><br>Wenger says that the German has an elbow injury and he will again start with Manuel Almunia against Tottenham. "We'll see [who is first choice] - it's down to them," said the Arsenal manager.<br><br>Jol's selection of Pascal Chimbonda, meanwhile, for tomorrow's derby will be unaffected by the full-back's arrest on Monday by police as part of their investigation into corruption in football.<br><br>"Pascal has trained, so there is no issue. For me there's no problem," said Jol.<br><br>Spurs will also have Michael Dawson, Darren Bent and Aaron Lennon all available for selection tomorrow. "Aaron always gives us a lot of width and speed," said Jol.</div>
