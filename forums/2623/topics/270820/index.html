The major trophies are the championship and the Champions League.<br><br>"I work very hard to develop this team.<br><br>"We knew we were facing major competition in England with clubs who invest a lot of money. We knew we wanted to go a different way and be a little bit patient.<br><br>"But, while we have a young team, we have experience. [Cesc] Fabregas has 100 games in the Premiership. I believe we have the quality and we must show it."<br><br>Wenger has been impressed by what he has seen from his players in pre-season and he believes his squad is hungry for success.<br><br>"I must say the desire for success, the hunger for success, the togetherness I've seen during pre-season has been greater than ever," added Wenger.<br><br>"I'm very excited for the new season because what I feel and saw during the camp for pre-season made me impatient to start.<br><br>"I'm personally very optimistic because of what I've seen inside my squad."<br><br>Wenger also rejected claims from Freddie Ljungberg that the club broke promises they made to him after he sealed his move to West Ham earlier this week.<br><br>"I did not make any promises to anybody," continued Wenger.<br><br>"The company works well when everybody does what he's responsible for.<br><br>"The player is responsible for his performance in the team, not the policy of the club.<br><br>"I'm responsible for the technical performance of the club, not the financial running of the club.<br><br>"No matter how big a player is, he's never responsible for the technical policy of the club.<br><br>"Freddie left as well because he decided it was the right moment.<br><br>"He was a great fighter for the club and did extremely well. The club did very well for Freddie as well.<br><br>"Nobody is here forever - but football is a team's sport. That's something magical.<br><br>"The talents we have makes us very optimistic. We can replace these players and the spirit of the team can compensate the quality of the world-class players we've lost."</div>
