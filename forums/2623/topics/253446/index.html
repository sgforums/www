What I know is this transfer is definitely going through.<br><br>"It's a great chance for him. A lot of polish players dream about playing in the Premier League.<br><br>"He had some other options with big clubs in Germany but the offer which Arsene Wenger gave him probably was the best and not the financial side of the offer but the prospect of playing for a big club, maybe not yet but in a season or so."<br><br>Fabianski, a member of Poland's 2006 World Cup squad, was expected to feature for Legia Warsaw on Wednesday evening.<br><br>However, he was only on the bench, further fuelling talk that a move to Emirates Stadium is edging nearer.<br><br>"Last night Legia Warsaw played a game against Gornik Leczna and Lukasz was only on the bench because the club wanted to check his substitute Jan Mucha will be able to fill his place," Kubicki explained.<br><br>Jens Lehmann and Manuel Almunia are likely to begin next season ahead of Fabianski in the pecking order, but Kubicki does not expect the young shot-stopper to take too long breaking into the first-team.<br><br>"When he came to Legia Warsaw he was the second keeper behind Artur Boruc and it didn't take him long (to become number one)," he said.<br><br>"He's prepared to wait for his chance and when he gets it I'm sure he will take it with both hands."<br><br>Kubicki is also expecting Fabianski to become his country's number one in the not too distant future.<br><br>He added: "He's probably on a similar level (to Tomasz Kuszczak and Boruc) but he's five or four years younger than them and that's an advantage."</span></div>
