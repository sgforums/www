            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/walcott.jpg"><br><br>Theo Walcott admits he learnt a lot from Thierry Henry, but insists Arsenal have "forgotten" about him after starting the season so well.<br><br>Walcott is eager to forge his own reputation as a Gunners legend after his stellar display against Slavia Prague invited caparisons with the Frenchman.<br><br>Arsenal have thrived since Henry's summer departure to Barcelona with last Tuesday's 7-0 Champions League thrashing of the Czechs bringing their 12th successive victory.<br><br>Arsene Wenger felt offloading Henry would force the club's youngsters to shoulder more responsibility - and the likes of Walcott, Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie have responded in mesmerising style.<br><br>"In a way everyone was disappointed when Thierry left," said Walcott.<br><br>"But at the same time we have sort of forgotten about him at the moment with us doing so well.<br><br>"However, he is doing brilliantly at Barcelona and I wish him all the best."<br><br>Walcott's second goal against Slavia was trademark Henry, dashing past defenders into the area and steering the ball with the outside of his foot into the far corner.<br><br>Wenger admitted the goal - the second of two clinical finishes by the England striker - had a "touch of Henry about it".<br><br>But while Walcott is flattered by comparisons with the former Gunners idol, he is determined tread his own path at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>"People are going to compare the second goal to Thierry but it was my own goal," said the 18-year-old.<br><br>"I trained with Thierry for a year and a half. It was brilliant to train with him every day and take bits out of his game, but I'm my own player.<br><br>"I just want to be my own player and get a few more goals. People are always going to compare me to Thierry - the way I run and everything - but as I keep saying I will be my own player."<br><br>Wenger is beginning to see a major return on his initial Â£5million investment in Walcott, who arrived at Ashburton Grove in January 2006.<br><br>A remarkable twist awaited four months later with Sven-Goran Eriksson selecting him in England's World Cup squad - even though he had not played a competitive game for the Gunners.<br><br>Eriksson then declined to use him and Walcott's frustration was heightened by his subsequent peripheral role in Arsenal's first-team squad.<br><br>But his exploits against Slavia have filled him with a renewed sense of optimism as he seeks to nail down a regular place in the side.<br><br>"It was an eventful summer going to the World Cup. No-one expected me to be in the World Cup squad, including me," he said.<br><br>"I was only 17 and hadn't played in the Premiership. It wasn't my decision that I got picked, only Sven knows about that.<br><br>"It was good experience to train with world-class players and see how they performed on match days and coming up to the games. It was really good to be there.<br><br>"I've been with Arsenal for nearly two years now and have been working really hard.<br><br>"It was good to get those goals last night. It's been up and down for me in the past but that's gone now. It's in the past and it's all uphill now."<br><br>Walcott's pace repeatedly left the traumatised Slavia defence for dead and there was no indication he was playing only his second game for Arsenal at striker.<br><br>Previously deployed as a winger, he could now benefit from Van Persie's knee injury to secure an extended run at forward.<br><br>"The two goals are a weight off my shoulders in a way," he said.<br><br>"I played against Reading as a striker. The boss signed me as a striker so I think I'll be a striker. But I can play anywhere, which helps as well."</div>
