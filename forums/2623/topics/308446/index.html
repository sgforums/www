              <h2>Arsenal midfielder Alexander Hleb says it is essential that the Gunners agree a new long-term contract with Mathieu Flamini.</h2>
              <p>Speaking to Setanta Sports after Arsenal's 0-0 draw with AC Milan in
              the Champions League - a game in which Mathieu Flamini again impressed,
              his team-mate Alexander Hleb stressed the importance to the Gunners of
              the dynamic France international midfielder.<br><br>Flamini helped to
              subdue World Player of the Year Kaka and Italian playmaker  Andrea
              Pirlo as Arsenal fell just short of beating the European champions in
              their last 16 clash at the Emirates.<br><br>The game confirmed that
              this season Flamini has emerged as one of the leading holding
              midfielders in Europe, though players like Cesc Fabregas, Emmanuel
              Adebayor and Hleb himself tend to receive more media attention.<br><br>Remarkably
              Flamini, who joined Arsenal rom Marseille, nearly left the club for 
              Birmingham last summer. But his long-term future is still unresolved,
              with his contract expiring at the end of this season and Juventus said
              to be monitoring his situatuon closely.<br><br>Flamini though would
              like to stay in North London, and Hleb wants Arsenal to do whatever it
              takes to keep the services of the 23-year-old.<br><br>"For me it is very important, I think for Arsenal too," Hleb told Setanta Sports. "He is my friend and he is very important.<br><br>"Mathieu was fantastic, really. He ran everywhere where the ball was.<br><br>"I think he had a fantastic performance and he killed [Gennaro] Gattuso. I like his game and he is very important to us."<br><br>Although
              the Gunners dominated the second half against Milan, they had to settle
              for a goalless draw. The return leg in Milan will be tough and the tie
              has swung in favour of the Rossoneri, defending champions.<br><br>For
              Arsene Wenger, who has yet to win the Champions League, his team's
              participation beyond this round of the current campaign looks to be
              delicately poised.<br><br>An away goal at the San Siro would change the
              balance dramatically, and Hleb is confident that this team can repeat
              the club's earlier European heroics - at the San Siro against Inter in
              2003 (when Arsenal won 5-1) and at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid in
              2006 (a 1-0 win) - and qualify for the quarter finals.<br><br>"It was
              difficult [at home to Milan] but I have belief in myself and Arsenal
              and I believe we can get through to the next round," said Hleb.<br><br>"I think we can win in Milan but of course we need concentration and to give 100 percent to get through at the San Siro."<br><br>Arsenal
              came agonisingly close to taking a lead to Milan with them, Adebayor's
              late header cannoning off the crossbar to give Carlo Ancelotti's side a
              reprieve.<br><br>Asked what he thought when he saw the ball strike the
              woodwork rather than the back of the net, Hleb replied: "I don't know,
              ask him, it is better!  I think he needed to score but he was unlucky
              and that is football."</p>

              <p>You may be right . Or perhaps he is waiting for other big clubs to make their move to sign him so he can blackmail Arsenal to offer him a much better deal (pay increment) . I don't know . But I still believe he will stay given his first team opportunities .</p>
