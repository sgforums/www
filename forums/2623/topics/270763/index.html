I don't see why they can't," he said. "Everybody always talks about Arsenal being a young team but a year ago they reached the Champions League Final and, without trying to find excuses, they had so many people injured last season."<br><br>Quizzed about the uncertain future of the club, he said he didn't want to "get into the politics" but he could not agree with Freddie Ljungberg who, having joined West Ham, suggested that the Gunners lacked ambition.<br><br>"I'm sure this season with everybody back, Arsenal can compete for the league. Sometimes it doesn't matter about the size of your squad, it's about the atmosphere in the dressing room and everybody loves each other at Arsenal," he said.<br><br>"Hopefully they will have no injuries and I don't know why they can't win the league with Robin van Persie back along with [Emmanuel] Adebayor and Eduardo [da Silva].<br><br>"Everybody has to get behind the boss and I know they will. I can only wish them all the very best and I will always support them whenever they play.<br><br>"Whenever I have the chance to go and see a game, I've kept my box so now I can finally say I will be an Arsenal fan.<br><br>"It may sound weird, something amazing to say, but I'll even miss the boos at Tottenham even though I never lost to them when I was in an Arsenal shirt.<br><br>"I'll miss the Manchester United games and Chelsea games too."<br><br>Speaking about his first goal for his new club, a last-minute netted rebound after his penalty had been saved, the 29-year-old said: "It was a double great feeling, playing again after five months.<br><br>"Scoring a goal on my debut was great and I hope it will be the first of many. But as long as the team wins that's the most important thing."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> If arsenal can still win title,why leave at the first place? haishh</span></div>
