              <h3>Premier League: Arsenal 1-1 Aston Villa - Match Report</h3>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/dotcomhome.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="230"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nicklas Bendtner preserved Arsenal's lead in the Premier League with
              a vital injury-time equaliser against Aston Villa on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Last week, a late, late leveller had cost Arsène Wenger's side two
              points on a nightmare afternoon at Birmingham City. This afternoon, the
              Second City's other side arrived at Emirates Stadium armed with
              determination and a game-plan -they so nearly pulled off a fine win.</p>
              <p>Arsenal were bright enough in the opening stages but they fell
              behind in the 27th minute when Gabriel Agbonlahor's cross was turned in
              by Philippe Senderos. Shaun Maloney rattled the woodwork just before
              the break and, though Arsenal improved in the second half, Villa were
              in an indomitable mood. Scott Carson did make a couple of decent saves
              but Manuel Almunia was forced into more eye-catching action this
              afternoon.</p>
              <p>It seemed to be an afternoon in which insult would be added to
              Eduardo's injury.  However, in the last move of the match, Gael Clichy
              crossed deep to the far post, Emmanuel Adebayor nodded down and
              Bendtner stabbed in a crucial goal from close-range.</p>
              <p>With Manchester United thrashing Fulham, Arsenal's lead is now cut
              to a point but, after this game, perhaps they must be grateful for
              small mercies.</p>
              <p>Eight days ago, a last-gasp goal made for a draw that felt like a
              defeat. This one did not really feel like a victory, Arsenal had not
              played well enough for that.</p>
              <p>And in the cold light of day, this performance may be given as
              further evidence that Wenger's men are wobbling. However, a glance at
              the table will tell you Arsenal are still in pole position. Albeit only
              by the slenderest of margins now.</p>
              <p>Despite its bitter finale, there had been much to like about
              Arsenal's second-half display at St Andrews last Saturday and so Wenger
              stuck with that side. Obviously Eduardo was absent and the manager
              started to fill the void by pushing Theo Walcott, scorer of both goals
              at Birmingham, into the attack alongside Emmanuel Adebayor. The
              fit-again Abou Diaby returned on the left and Alex Hleb switched to the
              right.</p>
              <p>Villa arrived armed with three dangerous and different attacking
              threats - John Carew, Ashley Young and Gabriel Agbonlahor - plus a
              burgeoning reputation in the Premier League. Wenger said he side need a
              mind-focussing challenge after last week's events, some of us would
              have preferred a 'gimme'</p>
              <p>The opening minutes were all Arsenal. Whatever the rights and wrongs
              of last week, Wenger's men had suffered after it. Their opening attacks
              this afternoon made you think they were going to make two wrongs
              (Eduardo's injury and Birmingham's penalty) into a right.</p>
              <p>In the seventh minute, Adebayor's flick fell to Walcott who stole a
              yard on his marker and fired a low shot across the face of goal. Scott
              Carson threw himself to his right to palm the ball aside.</p>
              <p>Arsenal continued to pressure but, in the 12th minute, Villa showed
              their renowned pace on the break. Agbonlahor went clear and raced
              almost half the length of the pitch until he could see the whites of
              Manuel Almunia's eyes. However in doing that he had not spotted William
              Gallas. <br>The Arsenal captain timed his sliding challenge to perfection.</p>
              <p>Walcott was starting to make his pace count. On a couple of
              occasions he burst into the area only to be crowded out by a clutch of
              white shirts.<br>However Villa were still having their moments. In the
              20th minute, Agbonlahor muscled off Senderos and, had his pass reached
              Shaun Maloney more quickly, then the Irishman would have surely given
              the visitors the lead - as he had when the two sides met in Birmingham
              exactly five months earlier.</p>
              <p>Still, the flow of the game was still generally with Arsenal. Midway
              through the half, a Fabregas corner was deflected out to Senderos
              however the Swiss defender hacked the ball over the bar.</p>
              <p>And worse would follow for the 23-year-old in the 27th minute.
              Agbonlahor, who was becoming a growing threat, teased his marker on the
              left of the six-yard area and his low shot was deflected home at the
              near post by Senderos.</p>
              <p>Another cruel blow in a week filled with ill-fortune for Arsenal</p>
              <p>Suddenly Emirates Stadium was shrouded by anxiety - and it never really lifted before the break.<br>Villa
              would have to make two changes before the whistle. Nigel Reo-Coker made
              way for Zat Knight and then Curtis Davies was stretchered off and
              Isaiah Osbourne came on.</p>
              <p>However the changes barely seemed to affect Villa. They looked
              comfortable and two minutes before the break, Maloney let fly from just
              outside the area. His rising drive may have crept in had Almunia not
              fingertipped it onto the post.</p>
              <p>In injury time, Senderos redeemed himself by clearing Wilfred
              Bouma's dangerous low cross. The ball flew up the other end via Walcott
              and <br>Adebayor's touch gave Fabregas an opening eight yards out.</p>
              <p>Like Arsenal's performance in the first half, his chip was nervous
              and hesitant. Wenger's men went into the break looking anything but
              title contenders.</p>
              <p>An early response was essential. Walcott did his best by stinging
              Carson's hands with a rasping near-post drive after only 25 seconds.<br>However
              the revival did not last. Villa turned the screw once more and in the
              54th minute Arsenal were indebted to Almunia once more when he expertly
              turned aside a low shot from Young.</p>
              <p>Arsenal now had to force the issue and, with that in mind, Wenger
              brought on Nicklas Bendtner. Almost immediately the Dane nodded a
              Fabregas free-kick over the bar.</p>
              <p>At least the game was now opening up but there were chances at both
              ends. Clichy and Hleb had long-range efforts saved by Carson. In
              between Agbonlahor again bulldozered through only to shoot straight at
              Almunia.</p>
              <p>O'Neill brought on Marlon Harwood and the former West Ham striker
              gave the Villa attack more of the same. He forced a decent save out of
              Almunia with 15 minutes left.</p>
              <p>Adebayor nodded over then Hleb set up Flamini to sidefoot an effort over the bar however the visitors still looked resilient.</p>
              <p>Wenger threw on his two Brazilians - Gilberto filled in at centre
              back while Denilson was in his usual midfield role. And, as the game
              entered the final 10 minutes, Villa were now penned back while Arsenal
              were prowling their half in search of an opening.</p>
              <p>They banged on the door and, though energetic, they looked spent of
              ideas until the final nano-seconds of injury time when Bendtner struck.</p>
