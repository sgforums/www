              <p class="first"><strong>Arsenal have applied for a work permit for their Mexican striker Carlos Vela, who has been on loan with Osasuna.</strong></p>
              <p>Vela, 19, signed for Arsenal from Guadalajara in November 2005 but was not eligible to play in this country.</p>
              <p>He was farmed out to Celta Viga and Salamanca in Spain before joining Osasuna for the whole of last season.</p>
              <p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger told his club's website: "We have applied
              for a permit for him and he will be involved with the first team next
              season."
              </p>
              <p>Vela was snapped up by Arsenal after winning the golden boot as top scorer at the 2005 Fifa Under-17 championships.</p>
              <p>He signed a five-year deal for a fee that could eventually rise to over
              £2m and Wenger is keen to bring him into his squad and bolster his
              attacking options.</p>
              <p>"Carlos has played the whole season at Osasuna on the left-wing and he had to work hard there," Wenger added.</p>
              <p>"But for me it is not his position. He is a central striker, an Eduardo type."</p>

              <p>come to think of it, arsenal have more than 5 strikers already - Adebayor, RVP, Bendtner, Dudu, Walcott, Vela. signing another one will force us selling off someone.</p>

              <p><br>dat's why i'm looking forward wat vela can offer to the squad next season.</p>
              <p>i think dudu can come back stronger but he may have to sit on the bench cos we have too much strikers.</p>
              <p>adebayor has achieved like wat henry did in his second season by scoring more than 20 goals, who know he might transform to world class next season?</p>
              <p>walcott's rate of scoring is the worse but he can pass well, so most likely wenger will deploy him as right winger or replace him on hleb's position.</p>
              <p>bendtner still need some experience n i afraid he need to go on loan to gain more experience as we really have too much players as strikers.</p>
              <p>rvp.... too injuries-prone liao, worse than last season but he can provide good pass. so maybe wenger should use him as winger.</p>

              <p>we do have superstar like RVP but does he deliver at all? when he was injured, we had done pretty well without him.</p>
              <p>having superstar can also affect the team's morale if he behaving like big shot (late for training, condemning his team-mate).</p>
              <p>remember there were time when players who live under the shadow of henry? it's only henry left which made the players stronger than ever.</p>
              <p>bear in mind that we r not richer club like spurs who spent big. we definitely do not wish to land up like leeds united one day when in hugh debt.</p>

              <p>The Mexican forward
              was signed in 2005 by Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, but has been unable
              to commence his Premier League career due to FIFA regulations regarding
              work permits.<br><br>As a result, the 19-year-old has been sent on loan
              spells with Spanish clubs Salamanca, Celta Vigo and Osasuna, for whom
              he has impressed.<br><br>And with Wenger keen to strengthen his
              attacking options, Vela has finally received clearance to play in
              England and only awaits the arrival of his passport before setting off
              to join the Arsenal squad in July.<br><br>"Despite the critics that we have received for making Carlos play at Celta Vigo, Salamanca and Osasuna, these
              spells have been very important for preparing for life in the Premier
              League," said Vela's agent Eduardo Hernandez.<br><br>"His time in Spain has now come to a close and he is just waiting for his passport. <br><br>"He has worked the amount of time required by the Premier League and everything is going fine. <br><br>"He has been granted permission to play and will be joining Arsenal in July for the beginning of pre-season training. <br><br>"Many
              people have criticised us for the way this process has been handled but
              the laws of Fifa and the rules of competition in some countries have
              meant that we have experienced some problems. <br><br>"But they are over now and a new chapter in his career can begin.</p>

              <p>The Mexican forward
              signed for the Gunners in 2005, but was blocked from playing in England
              due to FIFA’s strict rules regarding work permits.<br><br>Consequently,
              the 19-year-old has spent the last three seasons on loan in Spain,
              enduring stints with Salamanca, Celta Vigo and most recently Osasuna.<br><br>And
              after impressing in La Liga, the ex-Guadalajara youngster has been
              belatedly granted permission to join the Arsenal squad, which he will
              do this July for pre-season training.<br><br>Vela is thrilled to
              finally get his opportunity to crack the Premier League, and believes
              his time in Spain has provided the required grounding to help him
              succeed in the world’s most popular league.</p>
              <p><strong>Dream</strong><br><br>“I’ve been waiting two years for a work permit,” Vela said. “Now my dream has come true. <br><br>“I have to take advantage of this opportunity to stay in England. I hope I’m lucky enough to be at Arsenal for a long time. <br><br>“I’ve achieved a lot in Spain. It has been a useful experience to play for several different teams and move around. <br><br>“At
              Osasuna I had a difficult experience because of the relegation battle
              but I always had a place in the team. I played well all season. But I
              expect to have a much better season next year. <br><br>“I’m sure all
              my efforts will pay off. I’ll be playing in one of the best teams in
              the world that plays competitions like the Champions League - I want
              those games as soon as possible. <br><br>“I have changed a lot, I’m more mature as a person and player. I feel ready for Arsenal.”</p>
