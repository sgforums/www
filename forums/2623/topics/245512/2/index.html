Adebayor's header from Baptista's cross looked destined for the net before the Spaniard palmed the shot onto the post.<br><br>The visitors did eventually find the back of the net on 73 minutes when Gallas was well-placed at the far post to tap home after Kolo Toure helped on Cesc Fabregas' corner.<br><br>Liverpool then weathered a few nervy moments before Crouch capped a fine individual display by completing his hat-trick on 81 minutes.<br><br>The England international turned smartly in the area before smashing home with his left-foot leaving Lehmann no chance of a save.<br><br>Liverpool nearly added a fifth with only an outstretched hand from Lehmann keeping out Aurelio's drilled effort that looked destined to nestle in the far post.</div>

Arsenal might have good and young talents but you'll still someone with lots of experiences for them to looked upon and currently i don't see anyone able to hold that role</div>
