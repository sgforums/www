            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/Images/h/henry_0506birmingham.jpg"><br><br>Arsenal and Togo forward Emmanuel Adebayor thinks that his teammate and fellow striker Theo Walcott will one day reach the playing standards of former Arsenal superstar Thierry Henry.<br><br>19-year-old Walcott moved from Southampton to Arsenal in January 2006 for Â£5million but, despite the huge expectation from both media and fans alike - especially after his surprise call-up for the England squad for the World Cup Finals in 2006, has so far failed to nail down a regular first-team place, having only started seven Premier League matches so far, (14 times from the substitutes bench), with seven League Cup appearances (with one goal) and two FA Cup starts.<br><br>He had only started only one Champions League match for Arsenal before TuesdayÂ’s Champions League tie against Slavia Prague, where he performed excellently, scoring two goals in the GunnersÂ’ emphatic 7-0 win.<br><br>Since Thierry HenryÂ’s departure to Barcelona and WalcottÂ’s recovery from a niggling shoulder injury, the teenager is now finding a regular place in the team and after his performance on Tuesday will be looking forward to becoming a first-choice starter.<br><br>His performances of late have now elicited praise from his teammate and Togo international striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who believes that Walcott could well become one of the Arsenal greats.<br><br>"He is still learning but I can promise you in a few years, Theo will be up with Thierry,Â” said Adebayor, who moved to Arsenal at the same time as Theo Walcott, but who played frequently with Thierry Henry.<br><br>"He may be more than Thierry because he's learning very fast, he's progressing and in a few years Theo will be where he needs to be.<br><br>"It's the first time I've played with him as a forward but he's a very good player. He's got the speed, he's very fast, makes runs behind and he's got some skills as well so it's very easy to adapt with players like that.<br><br>"He took his chance well. The keeper gave him the ball and he was in the best position at the best time. For the second goal he just ran and showed how quick he is. He showed that he can be a good finisher as well and is very good for the team.<br><br>"I am here to adapt with everyone. Last year I played with Thierry, Robin van Persie, Julio Baptista. This year I'm playing with Robin, Theo, Eduardo. I'm ready to play with anyone that they put up front with me," finished Adebayor.</div>
