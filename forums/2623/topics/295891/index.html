At the moment we have a few injuries, but we have other players who can do a great job.<br><br>"The manager needs to change the team in some positions but we keep the same spirit and the same way of playing."<br><br>Arsenal may now have a seven point cushion on fifth-placed Manchester City, but Wenger is taking nothing for granted despite the so-called 'Big Four' looking set to battle it out for the Premier League crown.<br><br>"It is not guaranteed for everybody," the Frenchman declared.<br><br>"Teams like Villa and Man City who are doing well, Everton and Portsmouth can fight to be in the top four too.<br><br>"It is becoming more and more interesting for the teams moving up."<br></div>
