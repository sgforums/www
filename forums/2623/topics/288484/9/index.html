Captain Ryan Giggs should have done better when arriving at the far post to meet the eventual low cross, but could only stab the ball wide from a yard out.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson was out of his dug-out when a decision went against Patrice Evra, for kicking into the back of Emmanuel Eboue, and was quick to give fourth official Alan Wiley a piece of his mind as well as the referee.<br><br>In the 23rd minute Giggs tried his luck from just outside the area, but the ball was always rising over the bar.<br><br>Despite Arsenal having seen plenty of possession, with 30 minutes almost on the clock, the home side had not yet tested Edwin van der Sar - until Alexander Hleb's run down the right on the counter attack was checked by Anderson, six yards from the edge of the area.<br><br>Fabregas whipped the resulting free-kick into the six-yard box, where Gallas met it with a bullet header, only to be denied by the legs of the United keeper.<br><br>However, United snatched the lead in first-half stoppage time.<br><br>Wes Brown looked to have bundled Hleb off the ball before he slipped in Ronaldo down the right. The low cross was met by Rooney at the near post and his scuffed shot deflected up off the diving Gallas and past Almunia into the net.<br><br>Arsenal's response was immediate, as they drew level just three minutes into the second half.<br><br>Eboue floated the ball over from the right into the penalty area, where Adebayor had timed his run perfectly.<br><br>Van der Sar was out quickly to block the Togo striker's volleyed effort. However, the loose ball broke to Bacary Sagna, who squared it back to Fabregas and the young Spaniard set himself before drilling in his 11th goal of the season from 12 yards.<br><br>United were clearly shocked by the equaliser and the Gunners were soon back on the offensive again with a sustained period of pressure.<br><br>After 57 minutes Anderson and Owen Hargreaves bundled over Hleb just outside the United penalty area.<br><br>Fabregas cleverly sent a low shot under the jumping wall, but van der Sar was across to make a comfortable save.<br><br>Slowly.though, the champions began to find their own rhythm again. A fine interchange between Rooney and Giggs set up the England forward with a free header 12 yards out, but for once he was well off target.<br><br>Following a quick counter-attack, Eboue weaved his way into the United penalty area and fed Hleb, who made space before ballooning an effort horribly wide.<br><br>United went back in front when substitute Louis Saha fed Evra, who skipped into the right side of the box, drew Almunia and cut the ball back for Ronaldo - who could not miss.<br><br>Arsenal pressed for an equaliser, which almost came when Evra spooned the ball onto his own bar.<br><br>Just when it looked United were set to take the spoils and record a ninth straight league win, Arsenal forced in a dramatic stoppage goal when Gallas struck at the far post - the ball having been palmed away by van der Sar from behind the line.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>We were prepared to 'die' to win - Gallas</strong><br><br>Arsenal goal hero William Gallas claimed his team-mates were prepared to 'die' on the field to secure a result against Manchester United.<br><br>Gallas, who had earlier scored an own goal, grabbed an injury-time equaliser as the leaders denied United top spot in the Barclays Premier League at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo looked to have put United on course for victory after Cesc Fabregas had scored the Gunners' first equaliser.<br><br>Gallas hailed his side's teamwork and told Sky Sports: 'We had to fight. We said if we had to die we would die together on that field.<br><br>'In the first half we tried to play football but it was not really easy.<br><br>'We played very tight. It was difficult for us to find good space.<br><br>'We conceded a goal - maybe I was a little too late but that is football.<br><br>'In the second half when we came back on the pitch we said we had to play better.'<br><br>Arsenal, with a game in hand, remain unbeaten and top of the table from United only on goals scored.<br><br>Gallas added: 'I think we had to stay top of the table, we have to put pressure on other teams - other teams can go back like Chelsea or another team.<br><br>'We have to stay at the top to put pressure on Manchester United and maybe they can make the mistake.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some of u have no idea how good gilberto can be...<br><br>Anyway, good results. Arsenal already beaten manutd twice last season in the league so i dont really think they can get a win again. A draw would have been a good result.<br><br>Nevertheless, It was more of manutd losing 2 points rather than arsenal gaining a point. 90min+ goals are sweet and vital for title race.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe i had too many glasses of tiger beer, but that does not deny the fact that We Don't Like It When ManUre Scores, And Before The Game Give Us Some Arrogant Comments. Fcuk those critics, we have proven them wrong again. Especially to Starhub for not showing the Slavia Prague and Arsenal game this coming week again!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. i didnt break any just by posting at that forum.<br><br>As a fan, i dun like the way the critics, ManUre players and the fans treated us. We deserve at least some respect from them, sweet talking us first then threw some sh!t at us. It's time to return that back to them.<br><br>turbo_drift, u wan to edit my post or whatever sh!t i dun care. its all about taking criticism back for the ManUre fans. Alot of pple do it to insult them, sure u will do it too if some prick from the sh!t club comes up to u and celebrate in front of ur face. If ur frens do it to u, i might understand that. But a total stranger with his other sh!t fans do it, thats way wrong and something must be done.<br><br>Try going to "CRAPSHACK" and do it in front of their face wearing an Arsenal Jersey or declaring that u are an Arsenal Fan. i'm sure u will get it back from them too. And dun say its stupid to wear an Arsenal Jersey or declaring that u are a fan of Arsenal, bcoz many pple did it openly. u treat someone with respect, they treat u back likewise. But prior to this game, i receive no such things from them. All they do is talk sh!t!<br><br>u didnt see me replying to the Liverpool thread did u? bcoz Liverpool treated us with respect and i will treat them back the same way too. Except calling them names(thats common), their fans were also well behaved when they crash at the pub last week.<br><br>Its all about respect dude...<br><br>i dun wan to argue anymore, i said my piece and its up to u to accept it. I'm just glad that we can take some positive things out of this game.</div>
