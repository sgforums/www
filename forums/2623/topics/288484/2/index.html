            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Ade aiming high*<br><br>Emmanuel Adebayor will be living out a boyhood dream when Arsenal host Manchester United on Saturday - but insists he will keep dreaming of Premier League title glory, no matter what happens.</strong><br><br>Arsenal and United are level on points and have the same goal difference going into Saturday lunchtime's clash, live on Sky Sports, and the Togo international striker reckons the chance to see England's top two teams going head-to-head is an exciting one.<br><br>Speaking exclusively to skysports.com, the 6ft 3ins targetman admits the prospect of playing in such a game inspired him to become a footballer, but while he is full of respect for Alex Ferguson's side, the only thing on his mind is three points.<br><br>"As a child I dreamed about playing in games like this," he said with a big smile on his face.<br><br>"Arsenal are first, Manchester United are second and we are playing each other. This is a big, big game, we will see who is going to win. I really hope it will be Arsenal.<br><br>"We are very focused and at the moment we are full of confidence. They will be confident as well because they are winning and scoring lots of goals. Guys like Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney are playing well, so it's looking good for them.<br><br>"But the most important thing for us is that when any team comes to the Emirates Stadium, no matter who they are, we want to take the three points and go home. It's as simple as that."<br><br>Adebayor scored the winner when Arsenal triumphed at Old Trafford last season as the Gunners recorded a league double over their rivals, only to finish 21 points behind the eventual champions in the final standings.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Realistic</span></strong><br><br>And while Adebayor feels his side have a much more realistic chance of sustaining a challenge this time around, he laughed off suggestions that Saturday's result would determine the course of the title race.<br><br>"Of course, Arsenal and United are the best two teams in the Premier League at the moment," he added.<br><br>"But in England, whenever the top team plays the second team, people say we are going to see who will win the title.<br><br>"However, the title will not be handed out on Saturday. The title will be handed out in May."<br><br>Adebayor already has six goals to his name this campaign and is now setting his sights as high as possible as he prepares to lead the Arsenal forward line in his biggest game of the season so far.<br><br>"My ambitions are very big now I am at Arsenal," he concluded. "I want to win the title, I want to win the Champions League, I want to win the Carling Cup.<br><br>"As soon as I wake up in the morning I remember I want to win these things and that helps to make me a better player. Every player has to have ambitions like that and in the end God will decide what I can win."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ferguson sees Arsenal as main title rivals</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson believes the Premier League title race looks to be between his Manchester United side and rivals Arsenal.<br><br>In an interview on the League Managers Association website ahead of the clash between the two teams on Saturday, Ferguson said: 'At the moment I think it's looking between Arsenal and ourselves at the top but you know football changes.<br><br>'When you come to January and it really does start, then you expect to see Liverpool and Chelsea.'<br><br>The United boss said he has built a squad capable of retaining the Premier League title.<br><br>'We have had some incredible injury situations, but over the last few years we've been like that at early season with a lot of injuries,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'I hope and pray that by the time we come to December - because the second half of the season is where it really begins - we have got a good strong squad together.<br><br>'I feel that once we get that strong squad together we are capable of going and winning the league again.'<br><br>Ferguson said the start of the season can put teams like Tottenham in a 'false position' because of the disruption caused by international call-ups.<br><br>'Once the internationals get out of the road, then I think you'll find that the Premier League will settle down, we'll get a true perspective of who is going to be really challenging and you will get some consistent results,' he said.<br><br>'At the moment there have been some surprise results.'<br><br>Ferguson also paid tribute to Carlos Tevez, who despite struggling to learn English is letting 'the football language talk'.<br><br>Tevez is being given private tuition at home to improve his English and Ferguson said he is working hard.<br><br>But the United boss could not hide his delight at securing the services of the man who he believes single-handedly kept West Ham in the Premier League last season.<br><br>'What I have noticed about the boy here, since he has come to us, is that when he loses the ball he wants it back which is a great attribute to have as a striker really, not every striker thinks that way. So he's got a lot of great things about him and most importantly that great enthusiasm to play.'<br><br>The Manchester United boss also revealed has been in touch with Jose Mourinho 'a couple of times' since he left Chelsea and believes he will end up working on the continent.<br><br>'I don't know if he will come back into the English game, I'm not sure of that,' Ferguson told the League Managers Association website.<br><br>'I think Jose will end up at a top team in Spain or Italy, I'm almost certain of that.<br><br>'There certainly is no-one on the radar at the moment obviously, he's taking a break and I think he's aiming to come back fresh.<br><br>'I don't think there's any problem about him coming back into management, I think it's where he comes back in and I don't think anyone has any clues to that at this moment in time.'<br><br>Ferguson warned that managers cannot be out of the game too long because they will become forgotten - although he conceded that will not happen to Mourinho.<br><br>'I was reading an article the other day where a club was talking to Brian Little and Brian has done great work in his management career at Darlington, Aston Villa, Leicester etc,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'He's been around quite a few clubs, Brian, but he's been out of the game for about three years now and you get forgotten about.<br><br>'It is ridiculous, but being out of the game that long is a handicap because with his qualities and his CV, Brian Little could quite easily manage 80% of the clubs in England<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Arsenal run surprises Van der Sar*<br><br>Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar says he did not expect Arsenal to cope so well following the exit of former striker Thierry Henry.</strong><br><br>"It would have been obvious to think they would have a poor season without Henry," he told BBC's Football Focus ahead of Saturday's game.<br><br>"But boss Arsene Wenger has an eye for talent. He motivates and educates them.<br><br>"They have done remarkably well and not many would have expected that. Arsenal are playing well and winning."<br><br>Henry, who was the club's all-time league goalscorer, left for Barcelona in the summer after eight years with the Gunners.<br><br>But Arsenal showed signs they could cope without their talisman when they reached last season's Carling Cup final, by largely using their second string.<br><br>And this campaign, they remain unbeaten and head the Premier League table going into the fixture level with Sir Alex Ferguson's team on 26 points.<br><br>Manchester United are in good form themselves, having won their last eight games after picking up just two points from their first three league matches.<br><br>However, Dutchman Van der Sar remains cautious about his team's prospects despite going well in the league, Champions League and Carling Cup.<br><br>"It all depends on injuries - we had lots of problems with that towards the end of last season," he said.<br><br>"This season we have a bigger and stronger squad. The ingredients for having a great season are there, yet success is still so far away.<br><br>"If we are still doing well in all competitions during March or April then I'm sure it will be fair to ask me about our prospects then - but that is many months from now."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wenger resists old grudges</strong><br><br>For a long time, a meeting between Arsenal and United was seen as the encounter of the Premier League season as the championship rivals locked horns, often in fiery affairs.<br><br>However, since the emergence of Chelsea as the challengers to United's crown, their importance has waned, along with Arsenal's title aspirations.<br><br>This year, though, it is set to be different - with the Gunners defending an unbeaten record of 24 matches in all competitions which stretches back to April last season and now seen as genuine contenders once again.<br><br>There is, of course, little love lost between the two camps, given the infamous 'Battle of the Buffet' in 2004 when Wenger's Invincibles were finally defeated at Old Trafford and notably the Red Devils' 4-2 win at Highbury later that season when Roy Keane squared up to Patrick Vieira in the tunnel.<br><br>Wenger accepts their relations had sometimes been "hotter" than in the current climate.<br><br>He reflected: "You could always handle things differently, and just sit back and do nothing.<br><br>"I feel the papers also have a responsibility to heat it up as much as possible before the game, but I feel as well that the managers have a responsibility to make first a football game.<br><br>"What is important is that this is a good football game and that we win. All the rest is less important."<br><br>Wenger quipped there could be "no guarantees" of tempers not being lost once again, but maintains professional respect for the United manager.<br><br>"Enemies is a big word," said the Frenchman.<br><br>"I don't know Ferguson well enough to say that I am friends with him. I respect him for what he has done, and for what he is doing in the job. That's it."<br><br>Ferguson believes the game will be "tense". Wenger believes this Arsenal squad will be more than ready for the challenge which awaits their emerging title credentials.<br><br>"The reason it fires us all up is you know that the games will be intensely competitive and that is the most important - not what happens in the corridor before or after the match," said Wenger.<br><br>"This is a game that will be watched by millions of people and they don't see what happened in the corridor, they only watch what happens on the pitch."<br><br>Wenger added: "I feel the two teams are playing well at the moment, and that with their characteristics, maybe the two teams are more technical than a few years ago, a little bit less physical.<br><br>"But of course the commitment in these kind of games is always very high, but the characteristics of the players are a little bit different now."<br><br>The Gunners boss may have been in reflective mood ahead of the big match, but the French coach diplomatically refused to be drawn on just who had thrown the first slice of pizza in that infamous incident in Manchester three seasons ago.<br><br>Wenger stressed: "I never have come out on what happened inside on that day and I will not today.<br><br>"I feel that some things we have to respect and if it went overboard on the day then we have a duty to stay quiet."<br><br>Whatever the outcome tomorrow, you sense there will always remain a professional appreciation between the two rival coaches.<br><br>Wenger said: "Ferguson has most of the qualities you need to be a great manager.<br><br>"He is passionate, makes the right decisions, personality and consistency in his motivation.<br><br>"You must sacrifice your life to be such a long time in a job like his.<br><br>"You get up in the morning and drive to the training ground and you're at work, but this job never leaves your head wherever you are.<br><br>"You need to be consistently determined in your attitude and we are the same as far as the sacrifice is concerned."</div>
