              <p>we should have won against birmingham ( oh clichy!),aston villa,boro and wigan. we could have collected in total 12 points. But arsenal screwed it up. I think nw its the time for adebayor to warm the bench up. But we dont have another reliable striker besides rvp who's still rusty.</p>

              <p>hope wenger will wake up his idea after throwing the title away... season after season he has been so miser with transfers and trust the team too much... like wats was said before here he is very good to the players but all this is at the expense of major honours n disappoints the fans tis few season...</p>
              <p>adebayor reali should b dropped... his control is rubbish and he is definitely no henry... i would rather play bendtner-rvp partnership... again eboue and diaby shows their "skill"... reali hope wenger bring in another winger(right or left dun matter, jz bring in a decent one) during the summer else sure 100% chop gunners will be in for another disappointment next season...</p>
              <p>cheers to chelsea for the win cos they deserve it... hope they can make gd of this win and win epl at end of the day...</p>

              <p>Personally, I feel Wenger honestly belief his present squad is good enough for the epl title. And In some ways, he isn't wrong... But the thing is... the present Arsenal squad has too many youngsters... And with youngsters, they are great and advantageous but when the pressure starts to build... They crack up and can't perform consistently... They perform great in the CL cup match but coming back to the epl... these youngsters suddenly find it hard to perform again... I think there is some truth in what previous Pool captain Alan Hansen said "You don't win anything with youngsters"...</p>
              <p>If we look back, the last time Arsenal team was able to take this kind of pressure was when they had many senior players on the team... Players like Sol Campbell, Lehmann, Pires, Ljungberg, Henry, Cole, Kanu, Gilberto, Vieira, Edu... These were experience players that know how to handle the weekly match build-up pressure that happens from March till May... Seems like the present youngsters are finding it harder than they thought...</p>
              <p>Wenger seriously need to spend some money on "older" players and not always go for the sweet young things that he seem to like... They are the ones that can help the youngsters to cope with the pressures... Anyway, the league title isn't over by any means yet... and apart the from the United and Pool games now that they have got the chelsea one out of the way, their run-in isn't that tough...</p>

              <p>personal view.....I dont think the problems is lie on too many youngsters. infact, most of them are already wif arsenal 3 or 4 seasons liao ( beside Segna, 1st season, but is doing extramly well ).</p>
              <p>from the past few games, even the last nite game. I would said, they are doing pretty well in the mid field &amp; attacking build up!! but always no good quality finishing.....reason very obvious! we do nt have a quality striker....to produce a good run wif good positioning....</p>

              <p>sad to admit this, we r just not good enough. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>the season is over for us. we have to learn our lesson n move on! our defenders sux! drogba seems to be someone who always scoring against us. n our midfielders n attackers seem to lack of confidence in shooting. wat's the point having top 4 passers in bpl when NONE can score? our team is so predictable n opponents seem to know how to handle us.</p>
              <p>rite now, we should focus on 3rd/4th spot.</p>

              <p><br>frankly speaking, i dun think gallas n toure r dat good comparing to other big 3 defenders.</p>
              <p>n almunia seems to be leaking goals even since he is recovery. somehow i wonder should we play lehmann?</p>

              <p><br>i hope he honour his words. why? he is playing sucky!</p>
              <p>wenger should have subbed him off instead of rvp. hope next match wenger should punish him by warming the bench by starting bendtner n rvp.</p>

              <p>honestly, from day one, I never think that he will become a great world class striker one day ( his positioning, his ball control, his speed, his sence of goal. all are suck ).</p>

              <p><br>tall strikers cannot make it one la. Tall strikers are best at being a support striker. If you compare peter crouch and adebayor after this season, i would say adebayor is a much better striker. I think wenger bought adebayor because at that time, arsenal needs a tall striker. It was never wenger's intention to make him the first choice striker. He probably wanted RVP, walcott, eduardo to be the first choice striker. Unfortunately, all these three failed.</p>
