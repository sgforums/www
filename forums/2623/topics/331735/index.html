              <p>My personal view, Arsenal should not be carried away with the confident win frm sheffield united. Hull City will not step aside and let arsenal walk by even at the Emirates. Expect a strong and creative midfield line-up from wenger and we shall await the class/confidence/free flow football that Arsenal never fails to provide. As usual, we remain strong in our belief that our strikers have the composure, technique and ability to hit the ball in the back of the next.</p>

              <h1>Clichy fit for Hull, Silvestre also available</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/images/sep_08/gun__1221654177_GC_bburn.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="250"></p>
              <p>By Richard Clarke   </p>
              <p><a title="Gael Clichy (22) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/gael-clichy">Gael Clichy</a> should be fit to return to the Arsenal side for the visit of Hull City on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The French full back went to hospital last weekend during the second
              half of the 3-1 win at Bolton. It followed a heavy challenge by Kevin
              Davies just before the break.</p>
              <p>Fortunately tests revealed only bruising to his shin. He has missed
              training all week but returned on Thursday. Straight afterwards, Arsène
              Wenger spoke to Arsenal TV Online.</p>
              <p>“I am really pleased that Gael is available,” said the manager. “He
              had a training session today for the first time and he should develop
              well in the next 48 hours.”</p>
              <p>Another French defender, <a title="Mikael Silvestre (18) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/mikael-silvestre">Mikael Silvestre</a>, will also be available for the first time following his move from Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Despite the success of his 'Carling Cup kids’, Wenger will return to
              his established squad on Saturday. Alex Song is the only doubt.</p>
              <p>“Alex has a fitness test tomorrow,” said the manager. “He had a kick on his hip [in midweek] and it is very tender.</p>
              <p>“However <a title="Mikael Silvestre (18) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/mikael-silvestre">Mikael Silvestre</a> is available and we did not have any injuries from last week [against Bolton]. The likes of <a title="Robin Van Persie (11) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/robin-van-persie">Robin van Persie</a> and <a title="Theo Walcott (14) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/theo-walcott">Theo Walcott</a> have recovered fully so everyone is available.”</p>
              <p>Arsenal TV Online subscribers can see the full interview on Friday morning. In it, he talks about: the Carling Cup performance, <a title="Jack Wilshere (19) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/jack-wilshere">Jack Wilshere</a>’s display, what he can learn from <a title="Theo Walcott (14) player profile" href="http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/theo-walcott">Theo Walcott</a>,
              Vela becoming Arsenal’s fifth international striker, the background of
              the youth set-up, the psychology of being top in the Premier League,
              the start Hull have made and the foundations they have put down.</p>

              <h1>Hull Stunner Shocks Arsenal</h1>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsenal 1-2 Hull City</span> <br><br></span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hull City stunned Arsenal by coming from a goal behind to secure a famous win and become only the second side to win at the Emirates. A scruffy Fabregas goal opened the scoring for the Gunners but a Geovani screamer and a Cousin header sealed a shock win for the Tigers.</span></p>
              <p>Yet despite having restored his first team, Arsene Wenger’s side struggled against their newly promoted opponents and endured a frustrating first half which ended goalless despite the home side’s best efforts.</p>
              <p>Instead, a profligate Gunners reverted to their old ways, overplaying the ball when often well-placed whilst the visitors defended stubbornly and with a confidence borne of their strong start to the season.</p>
              <p>Keeping with the general theme of the week, it was one of Arsenal’s youngest players who had the best chances of the first half.</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott had several opportunities to open the scoring for the Gunners but a combination of excellent defending and wanting too much time on the ball denied the young Englishman.</p>
              <p>Whilst the Gunners dominated possession and carved out some excellent opportunities they rarely threatened Myhill in the Tigers goal and a frustrated Arsene Wenger could only watch on in dismay.</p>
              <p>However, whilst the first half was largely disappointing fare, the second period sparked into life within minutes of the restart with Hull almost taking the lead. The Gunners failed to clear a corner and a speculative shot from Boateng was saved almost on the line by Fabregas’ outstretched leg.</p>
              <p>The chance spurred Arsenal into life and less then five minutes they were ahead, albeit through the scrappiest of goals.</p>
              <p>Van Persie played Walcott in on the break and he bamboozled several Hull defenders before a low cross was deflected off Adebayor into the path of a combination of Fabregas and McShane who bundled it into the net.</p>
              <p>Minutes later and it should have been two. Van Persie set up Eboue but his attempted back heel was deflected into the path of Adebayor, who, with the goal at his mercy, took too much time, and his shot was well defended and deflected high and wide by the Hull defence.</p>
              <p>With a lead established Arsenal threatened to overwhelm Hull who were left rocking by the home side’s change in tempo yet they held firm and to the dismay of the home crowd hit back in stunning style.</p>
              <p>Geovani put them level on the hour mark, leaving Arsenal to rue their missed chances. A stunning strike from the Brazilian from out on the left, swerved and dipped into the top corner leaving Almunia absolutely no chance and putting the sides back on level terms</p>
              <p>Only minutes later and Hull were in dreamland. A corner in from the right found Cousin outjumping Gallas and his header flew over Fabregas on the post and into the back of the net.</p>
              <p>A shocked Wenger responded quickly, throwing on Bendtner and Vela as Arsenal pressed forwards searching for an equaliser.</p>
              <p>Van Persie came close after being put through by Fabregas but Gallas came even closer, his header coming off the bar and hitting Vela but falling wide. Myhill then tipped over a fine strike from Fabregas in stoppage time as Hull held on for a famous victory to continue their fantastic start to life in the top flight. </p>
              <p>Arsenal, meanwhile, fabulous in midweek, trudged off at the final whistle thoroughly dejected leaving Arsene Wenger, who having just his watched his dislodged from the top of the table and conceding again from a set piece, with much to ponder.</p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Almunia, Clichy, Toure, Gallas, Sagna, Walcott (Vela, 76), Fabregas, Denilson, Eboue (Bendtner, 68), Adebayor, van Persie</p>
              <p><strong>Hull City:</strong> Myhill, Turner, Dawson, McShane, Ashbee, Zayatte, Boateng (Garcia, 76), Marney, King, Geovani (Hughes,72), Cousin (Mendy, 79)</p>

              <p>The first goal from Hull clearly exemplifies our complacency, no man even close to geovanni when he shoots... Second goal shows our weakness in defending from set pieces again... Eboue and rvp really off form too... Eboue really cmi in left midfield, he always fail to spot the overlapping runs of clichy and prefers to cut in with his right... RvP is really terrible too, all his shots fail to hit the target</p>
