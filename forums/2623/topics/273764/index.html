            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/Images/dotcomhome.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger was delighted with Arsenal's 2-1 win over Fulham - and predicted the result was the start of a good season for the Gunners.<br><br>The hosts looked to be heading for a shock Premier League defeat at the Emirates Stadium, where new boy David Healy had fired the visitors into the lead after just 52 seconds following a Jens Lehmann mistake.<br><br>However, after being thwarted by a superb performance from stand-in Fulham goalkeeper Tony Warner - who started after Antti Niemi injured himself during the warm-up - a late penalty from Robin van Persie levelled matters, before Alexander Hleb won it for Arsenal in the final minute.<br><br>Wenger knows the importance of a good start for his young squad, now without inspirational Thierry Henry who was sold to Barcelona over the summer.<br><br>With the first leg of a crucial Champions League qualifier coming up next week, Wenger feels this afternoon's recovery can only have positive repercussions.<br><br>The Frenchman said: "We had a horrible start and were playing against a good Fulham side, a good goalkeeper.<br><br>"Apart from that, we were resilient, didn't give up for 90 minutes, were physically and mentally strong.<br><br>"This is the kind of result that can change a season for a team. It's a positive start."<br><br>Wenger continued: "You can get momentum from these things, and especially belief.<br><br>"Nobody could ever measure it in terms of psychology, but it is important.<br><br>"To have lost the game today would have been a big blow for the team because everyone would have said it was after Thierry Henry had left."<br><br>Wenger revealed Lehmann was "the happiest boy in the dressing room", following Arsenal's recovery.<br><br>The veteran had earlier made a complete hash of an attempted return pass to the defence, striking the ball against his left leg and gifting possession to Healy, who slotted into an empty net for a first top flight goal.<br><br>Wenger said: "First of all, I was surprised he had made the mistake.<br><br>"He's an experienced keeper and you want to deal with your first ball.<br><br>"Jens changed his mind, but wasn't quick enough to respond to his brain. He lost his co-ordination."<br><br>Wenger added: "Every goalkeeper can make a mistake. He made one. If you are an outfield player you are not punished, but you are in goal."<br><br>The Arsenal boss - who rates summer signing Eduardo da Silva as '50-50' for the midweek trip to Prague - was in good spirits following the victory.<br><br>He added: "I read I'm cracking up under the pressure.<br><br>"I think it's linked that I have to make an ECG for my life insurance, and I came out of a hospital somewhere.<br><br>"If I'm sick, I'm ignoring it, so it's all good.<br><br>"I wasn't stressed today because the players were giving everything to win. As long as you have that in a team, you have hope."<br><br>Meanwhile Fulham boss Lawrie Sanchez was less than impressed by what he saw as "blatant simulation" from some of the Arsenal players.<br><br>He said: "I was at the same meeting with Arsene Wenger and (referee's chief) Keith Hackett, and they did say simulation was going to be a big 'no no' this year.<br><br>"I haven't seen the penalty incident, but there were three simulations that went unopposed.<br><br>"That gives people the impression they can get away with it.<br><br>"If (referee) Phil (Dowd) had booked someone with it, people wouldn't have been as ready to go down in the box.<br><br>"There were at least three claims in the first half for penalties. If they weren't penalties, then they were simulation. It's either one or the other."<br><br>Fulham, though, looked a much-improved outfit from last season, when they only narrowly escaped relegation.<br><br>Sanchez said: "I am disappointed for the amount of effort we put in not to get something.<br><br>"Tony Warner did fantastically well, pulling off some saves, and we're very disappointed.<br><br>"It was always going to be tough, but we shouldn't be leaving here losing 2-1."<br><br>He added: "We defended well and, when we attacked, we had five or six good opportunities to score.<br><br>"But you've got to take your chances. It's about the quality of finishing.<br><br>"This was a game which we were always expected to lose. I told the players we could gain everything from here.<br><br>"We had a go. It's just unfortunate that we've come away with nothing."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> Will Le boss blame lemon if arsenal were to lose? haha. And Mr sanchez,nxt time dun just assume that arsenal is shit when the season hasnt even start yet. Judge it after the match nxt time. But on the other hand,arsenal still needs improvement </span></div>
