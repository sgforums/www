It will have to happen to Arsenal.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s not about buying into a dream, itÂ’s about believing the opposition will crack. ItÂ’s about mental toughness.<br><br>Â“You donÂ’t play your main rivals every game but, in a way, you do as you have to beat the immediate opposition to stay in the race.Â”<br><br>The Gunners rubber-stamped another season in the Champions League by finishing fourth Â— even though key players such as Thierry Henry, William Gallas and Robin van Persie missed a large chunk of the season through injury.<br><br>Any dip into the transfer market by Arsenal will prove crucial as they continue to juggle the move to the Emirates Stadium with success on the field. Wenger needs to strengthen his squad, something United have already done.<br><br>Keown added: Â“Manchester United have addressed their own problems defensively, they didnÂ’t have a dominant header of the ball at the back but they now have Nemanja Vidic.<br><br>Â“He has come in, a no-nonsense defender heading for fun. With Rio Ferdinand, they have been the dominant pair in tough away games such as Bolton and Manchester City.<br><br>Â“United also have that blend and movement from Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo with Paul Scholes joining the pack.<br><br>Â“Michael Carrick makes raking passes. They have a good balance attacking and defending.Â”<br><br>Keown was talking as he helped launch a Â£600,000 spending programme funded by Barclays Bank to regenerate sports facilities at Rosemary Gardens, north London. He said: Â“Last season was difficult for Arsenal but I hope they can do a Man U next season.<br><br>Â“The nucleus is there and I hope Wenger signs a long-term deal.<br><br>Â“But you do need key people to play a bigger part. With so many youngsters in the Arsenal squad, you need key men such as Henry.<br><br>Â“Cesc Fabregas must come to the fore next season Â— he has experience under his belt now.<br><br>Â“You have to keep improving to stay ahead of the pack. YouÂ’re up against Chelsea and Manchester United, who are wealthy clubs.<br><br>Â“Liverpool are the same now while Tottenham are re-emerging and what a great opportunity there is at Newcastle now to shake that up.Â”<br><br><strong>What he says here is absolutely agreeable. We can and will do better nxt season. I think keown is also hinting AW to bring in some quality players.</strong></div>
