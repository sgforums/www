            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.football.co.uk/shared/images/news/player_profile_115151.jpg"><br><br>New Birmingham manager Alex McLeish is attempting to keep on-loan Arsenal central defender Johan Djourou for the remainder of the season.<br><br>Djourou initially joined Blues in the summer with a view to him returning to the Gunners in January.<br><br>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wanted to keep his options open with Djourou as Kolo Toure will be on African Nations Cup duty.<br><br>McLeish will try to retain the player and, if that fails, attempt to bring in another centre-back.<br><br>He said: "Will I try and keep Djourou for the season? I would think that would be a target we would try and achieve.<br><br>"I know Arsene is mindful of the fact Toure is needed for the African Nations Cup. It is an obstacle we will have to try and overcome.<br><br>"But if we can't do that, we will have to try and look for someone else because we are a little bit light in that department of the team."<br><br>McLeish will look to strengthen when the transfer window opens and the former Scotland manager hinted he may look north of the border.<br><br>He said: "I would like to bring in trusted players. There is no doubt about that. It just depends if the target is available or if we can afford the target.<br><br>"There is no doubt I would like to bring in players I have worked with or players I have seen that I would like to work with. We definitely have things down on paper.<br><br>"I would hope to get value for money, I know it can be done and we have to spread the net as far as possible.<br><br>"Agents have already been getting in touch with players and already I have a couple in mind I think might be useful."<br><br>McLeish admitted: "Having money to spend will certainly be new to me. There's no doubt about it.<br><br>"I'm not sure there will be huge funds in January but, if we can make a fist of it in the Premier League, then next summer will be very interesting.<br><br>"But, whatever I get in January, I will make the most of it."<br><br>Birmingham skipper Damien Johnson is stepping up his bid for a first team recall after completing a second 90 minutes for the reserves - against Aston Villa - since recovering from a hamstring injury.<br><br>The Northern Ireland international has started only one game this season, the Carling Cup clash at Blackburn in late September.</div>
