              <p>Marcello Lippi, the only manager to have won the World Cup and
              European Cup, yesterday said that he would be cheering for Arsenal as
              the latter competition unfolded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Premier League leaders are among four English sides, along with
              Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea, awaiting their fate in
              today's quarter-final draw, a quartet, said Lippi, everyone would be
              trying to avoid.</p>
              <p>"Any of the four could win the Champions League,
              but at this moment the way Arsenal play is the one I like best. It
              would be good for football if Arsenal could win. They play on the
              ground, they manoeuvre the ball, very, very well. It's very fast and
              very technical."</p>
              <p>Lippi's verdict may come as a surprise to Sir
              Alex Ferguson, a long-time friend of the former Italian manager. Lippi
              did add: "Manchester United play great, great football and Alex
              Ferguson is the type of manager able to renew his team, and, every four
              to five years, to bring it back to an excellent level of top-class
              football."</p>
              <p>Ferguson, incidentally, is a lone dissenting voice
              among the English clubs in enthusing at the prospect of an all-Premier
              League tie. With no seeding or country protection in the midday draw,
              to be made in Nyon, Switzerland, an all-English tie looks probable. The
              Arsenal manager, Ars√®ne Wenger, and the Liverpool and Chelsea players
              Steven Gerrard and John Terry all said they wished to draw foreign
              opponents, but Ferguson said: "We will relish the chance to face
              another English team in the quarter-finals."</p>
              <p>Manchester United
              are unique among the Premier League clubs in not having faced domestic
              opponents in the Champions League before. Chelsea and Arsenal met in
              the quarter-finals in 2004, with Chelsea winning. Chelsea and Liverpool
              have met three times, twice in the knockout stages, with Liverpool
              winning both times. The other qualifiers are Barcelona, Roma, Schalke
              and Fenerbahce.</p>
              <p>Lippi, who reached four European finals with
              Juventus, winning in 1996, added: "When I won it, it was the last year
              of the European Cup [when only domestic champions entered]. Then it
              became the Champions League and now it's possible that even a team that
              has finished fourth can win it. It was more beautiful, more significant
              when it was the European Cup."</p>
              <p>* The France striker Karim
              Benzema, who had been linked with a move to Old Trafford, has extended
              his Lyons contract until 2013. "It is out of the question to leave now.
              I want to continue to improve here," he said.</p>
