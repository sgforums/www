            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Robin van Persie admits life away from football the last few months has been tough, but is raring to go for next season.</strong><br><br>The Arsenal striker has been sidelined since January when he fractured a metatarsal while scoring against Manchester United.<br><br>Van Persie has recently stepped up his rehabilitation after being able to reflect on his game over the past three months.<br><br>"For the first two weeks all I could do was sit at home. That moment was very hard for me," the Dutchman said.<br><br>"I was watching lots of football, but there I was, not even able to go to my own kitchen to get a drink. Everything had to be done for me.<br><br>"I had a lot of time to think about things such as how I see Arsenal, how Arsenal sees me, how I can improve.<br><br>"Those things you can really think about, but when you live day to day there is no time to stop and think about it.<br><br>"You are too tired and also in football it is always 'the next game, the next game, this game has gone, look at the next one' - and suddenly I did not have that for three or four months."<br><br>Van Persie is optimistic ahead of next season, believing The Gunners will mount a greater challenge both domestically and in Europe.<br><br>"We have been very unlucky this season, personally I do not think it was down to our quality," he added in Arsenal's match day programme.<br><br>"I am sure that if we keep on playing the way that the boss thinks, the way Arsenal thinks, the way most of the players think, we will be successful.<br><br>"Maybe next year, and certainly within two years, as long as we all stay together." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>unfortunate of him to get injured &amp; unfortunate of Arsenal as well.  Otherwise, I believe arsenal will be challenging the likes ot Chelsea &amp; Man U.<br><br>but Arsene Wenger has a young squad at his disposal and its for the future but the sad thing is that, Arsenal is the poorest amongst the top 4 clubs and nxt season i dun think they will have much to spend.  they need a goalie to cover Lehman, a midfielder bcos none of them has impressed this season and also  a striker - they miss Henry terribly and Adebayor is not scoring consistently.<br><br>since Man U wanted Adebayor, they could sell him and use the cash to get someone else.</div>
