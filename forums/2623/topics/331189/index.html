              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is 'optimistic' playmaker Tomas Rosicky could return from injury before Christmas. </strong></p>
              <p>Rosicky has not featured for the Gunners since
              January, after undergoing hamstring surgery in May, but had been
              expected to make his comeback this month.</p>
              <p>However, the Czech
              Republic international suffered a setback in his recovery leading some
              reports to even suggest his career could be under threat.</p>
              <p>Rosicky's
              agent, Pavel Paska, moved to dispel those rumours on Thursday, and now
              Wenger has explained the reasons behind the delay.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman told the club's <em>official website</em>: "He is not close to playing again and he has not had any real setback, but the evolution (of his injury) is very slow.</p>
              <h4>Patience</h4>
              <p>"The recovery process is slower than we expected at the start. It doesn't look worrying but the delay is longer than expected.</p>
              <p>"He
              had a re-attached tendon that was loose in his hamstring, and that
              demands a lot of time to re-coordinate the movements of the hamstring.
              That makes it very difficult to predict exactly one week more or less
              how much time it will take.</p>
              <p>"But I am optimistic that before Christmas you will see him in a good shape."</p>
              <p>Of the injury, Rosicky told <em>Denik Sport</em>:
              "Everything went well, according to the schedule. When I was running
              long distances, it [the hamstring] gave me no problems at all.</p>
              <p>"But
              when I started on the ball and tried to change directions of running
              and changed pace, the knee reacted badly. So far it does not allow me
              to go on in the recovery so it has stopped my training for some time. I
              am not resting completely, though.</p>
              <p>"I can lift weights and do
              other exercises. The knee simply must get down. It does not mean at all
              though that I have to end my career.</p>
              <p>"I don't understand how it
              could have been published as no-one has spoken with me on this issue.
              This news have come out probably because I was expected to return in
              September, which failed.</p>
              <h5>Eduardo</h5>
              <p>"This injury is
              unusual and odd. Doctors tell me that the pain can fade away quickly
              and I can be back in three weeks, but it can also take more time.</p>
              <p>"That
              is why I have to be patient. Every such treatment can bring unexpected
              problems with it. That is what has happened now so my return will be
              delayed."</p>
              <p>Wenger also gave an update on long-term injury victim Eduardo, who suffered a broken leg against Birmingham in February.</p>
              <p>"He is still very much on course and he could be a very good surprise because he is a little ahead of schedule," Wenger added.</p>
