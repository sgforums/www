Alas, it was not a dream debut for the Brazilian as his side went down 1-0 Â– all thanks to his compatriot Peres who converted a penalty in the first half.<br><br>Speaking to a group of reporters after the match - with Peres acting as interpreter - Leandro shared his experiences in Singapore so far.<br><br>The clean-shaven midfielder said, Â“I am satisfied with my performance (against Tampines) but I feel that thereÂ’s still room for improvement.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s only my first competitive game in Singapore, so I still need time to adapt to my new team, the food and my new surroundings."<br><br>Leandro was quick to point out the difference between Brazilian and Singaporean football.<br><br>Â“There is definitely a big difference in the way football is played in Singapore and in Brazil," he said.<br><br>Â“In Brazil, the players tend to retain possession and pass the ball around. In Singapore, the players tend to use long ball tactics. So with time, I will adapt to the way football is played here.Â”<br><br>During the game, Leandro displayed his silky skills and masterful techniques on the ball. He was the CubsÂ’ designated dead-ball specialist Â– the way he delivered the freekicks and cornerkicks truly confirmed that Leandro was indeed Brazilian.<br><br>Team manager Eugene Loo was quick to praise him. Â“You can see that heÂ’s (Leandro) got good technique and skill. ItÂ’s been one month since he trained with us.<br><br>"Now we just have to see whether he can adapt well to the Singaporean climate and surroundings.Â”<br><br>Not everyone was fully impressed by Leandro though.<br><br>StagsÂ’ coach Vorawan Chitavanich commented, Â“Yes, thereÂ’s no doubt that he is a very good player. However, he needs to learn to release the ball faster because once players mark him down, he will lose possession easily.Â”<br><br>ItÂ’s not easy for someone like Leandro to learn from a coach who does not speak his language. However, he revealed that both he and the coaching staff work hard at communicating with each other through various hand and body signals, plus a sputtering of English words.<br><br>Â“I talk a lot with my coach (V Sundram Moorthy) about where is my best position to help the team. There is a lot of communication going on between me and him," said Leandro.<br><br>"I told him that my preferred position is playmaker, playing just behind the strikers.Â”<br><br>Even though language is a barrier for the talented Brazilian, he finds his new team mates endearing.<br><br>Â“I find that my team mates are very good and they are easy to play with. But most importantly, I like them because they welcome me,Â” he enthused.<br><br>Leandro may not have enjoyed the best start to his S.League career but thereÂ’s no doubt that he will be a force to be reckoned with in the future.<br><br>Who knows, maybe in a few yearsÂ’ time, he will be the one who does the recommending of players to the S-League.</div>
