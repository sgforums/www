            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Emmanuel Adebayor says ArsenalÂ’s players have learned how to overcome Â‘difficult momentsÂ’ following SundayÂ’s 3-1 win over Fulham.<br><br>The visitors equalised 12 minutes from time at Emirates Stadium but the Gunners answered the questions asked of them, thanks largely to a fantastic measured strike from the Togolese forward.<br><br>Stand-in captain Gilberto added emphasis to the scoreline with a spot-kick three minutes from time. According to Adebayor, the turning of one point into three is something Arsenal would have struggled to accomplish earlier in the campaign.<br><br>Â“I think weÂ’ve learned how to deal with the difficult moments,Â” said the 23-year-old. Â“When they equalised it was a difficult moment for us on the pitch but we never know how to give in. I think at the beginning of the season these are the games that would have finished 1-1. We know we all have to give our best from the beginning to the end of the game and if we do we know at the end we are very happy.<br><br>Â“As a footballer you always want to finish first or second [in the league] but we lost at the beginning of the season so this season was very difficult for us. Now I think we understand how football is and that you have to have the same approach whoever you play against. I think we have in our heads what we are going to do now and how we are going to prepare for next season.Â”<br><br>The former Monaco striker puts ArsenalÂ’s progress down to the experience the younger players are now putting into practice. ItÂ’s something he believes bodes well for the next campaign.<br><br>Â“A lot of players have a lot more maturity,Â” said Adebayor. Â“Out there today you could see that. Even when they equalised we just wanted to play our football, we kept our shape and in the end we won.<br><br>Â“We all just tried to do our best. We wanted to win this game and we are very proud of ourselves. But now, in the other two games, we want to finish as well as possible.<br><br>Â“I think we can show that we can finish well and we can start well next season. ItÂ’s very important for us and thatÂ’s what we are working and fighting for."</span></div>
