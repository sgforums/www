At least the big clubs will play as well.<br><br>"Last year, we lost against PSV Eindhoven, who refused to play in the first and the second game, just waiting for one counter attack. Yet we struggled more than we had done in the season before against Real Madrid.<br><br>"Maybe you play against Real Madrid or Barcelona, and you say 'what a Hell of a task' - but then a different problem you face because they will come out and play."<br><br>Wenger firmly believes his current side have the burning ambition to succeed.<br><br>However, the Arsenal manager is cautious to predict whether the latest crop can emulate the 'Invincibles' of 2003-04 and go a whole domestic league season without defeat.<br><br>"We have different qualities now," Wenger said.<br><br>"Maybe we are not a strong as we were impact-wise, but we are more mobile and technically different, more creative - that is now what we want to show."<br><br>The Arsenal boss added: "We will try to go as far as we can, but we have only played 15 [Premier League] games.<br><br>"If we had played 25 or 28, then I would have said yes, but it is too early.<br><br>"I see the hunger and togetherness, the desire to do well - but for unbeaten? We are [still] too far [away]."</div>

ArsÃ¨ne WengerÂ’s side could now face one of EuropeÂ’s major names in the draw for the last 16.<br><br>A point in their last two European games had left the London outfit playing catch-up on leaders Sevilla. The equation this evening was to win themselves and hope the Spaniards slipped up at Slavia Prague.<br><br>It looked good for over an hour. Goals from Abou Diaby and Nicklas Bendtner allowed Arsenal to move into cruise control. Meanwhile Robin van Persie looked excellent in his first start for two months.<br><br>However just after Dorel Zaharia had headed Steaua back into the game after 69 minutes at Emirates, Luis Fabiano gave Sevilla the advantage in the Czech capital. Freddie Kanoute added another two minutes later and Daniel completed the victory just before time. Though Arsenal held on to their win amid Steaua pressure, they were forced to settle for second place.<br><br>It was a disappointment but not a big one. The main job of Group H was achieved two games ago when Arsenal secured their place in the Knockout Stages. Their opponents will be decided on December 21.<br><br>But while Arsenal may face a major European force in the draw, anyone taking on WengerÂ’s side will know they have precisely the same problem.<br><br>The manager had made it apparent that there would be changes in his starting XI for Matchday Six. However the extent was a little surprising. We knew Jens Lehmann would play his first Arsenal game since August 19. The immediate return of Van Persie and Diaby was a little more surprising. Alex Song and Denilson were paired in central midfield, Philippe Senderos came in behind with Armand Traore at left back.<br><br>To illustrate the switch around, all seven substitutes were full internationals.<br>WengerÂ’s thinking was clear. Pack the side with enough quality to win the game but keep an insurance policy on the bench.<br><br>Emirates Stadium provided an almost eerie backdrop at kick-off this evening. Travel disruption meant the ground was under-populated when the teams walked out and a touch of winter mist only added to the atmosphere.<br><br>However Arsenal were far from unsettled. WengerÂ’s side were in control from the first whistle and never looked ruffled from the moment they took an early lead.<br><br>After two minutes, Van Persie sent an exquisite through-ball into the right-hand channel. Walcott raced on to it but pulled his shot inches past the post. A couple of minutes later the 18-year-old collected the ball 10 yards outside the area, weaved past a pair of half-hearted challenges before thudding a shot over the bar.<br><br>The England winger was also involved in the opener after eight minutes. He spread the ball wide to Sagna on the right. The FrenchmanÂ’s low, curling cross into the area was controlled with one touch of DiabyÂ’s long right leg. His second planted a shot across Robinson Zapata and into the far corner of the net.<br><br>It was starting to become one-way traffic. In the 12th minute Diaby nearly grabbed his second. His deflected drive from just inside the area looked destined for the top corner again before Zapata threw himself to his left to spectacularly turn the ball aside.<br><br>Steaua were trying to pressurise but it seemed that picking up one point from their first five Group H has dented their confidence. Their best chance of the half came on the quarter-hour when Nicolae Dica fed Adrian Neaga on the right but Traore timed his sliding tackle to perfection.<br><br>Van Persie saw a long-range drive deflected over as Arsenal kicked-on once more but it was Walcott who was really catching the eye. Before the half-hour the winger had escaped a couple of times in the right-hand channel. His crosses floated dangerously across goal however, on both occasions, no-one was on-hand to convert.<br><br>But Arsenal were relentless. Van Persie curled an effort wide then TraoreÂ’s marauding run down the left ended with a neat ball towards Bendtner at the near post. Only desperate Steaua defending prevented a goal.<br><br>The Dane did not have long to wait. Three minutes before half time Song found Van Persie on the edge of the area. The DutchmanÂ’s tantalising twist and perceptive pass gave Bendtner a little space in the area. He hurdled one challenge and then planted a low shot into the far corner. A cool finish on a chilly night.<br><br>Arsenal began the second half with a certain strut. There was a sense of confidence and control in everything they did. Van PersieÂ’s fizzed a free-kick through a crowded area and narrowly wide of the far post. Then, just before the hour, Zapata roared out of his goal to deny Bendtner as he raced clear.<br><br>Van Persie made way for Eduardo with 25 minutes left. Almost immediately, Steaua grabbed a goal. Substitute Romeo Surdu whipped a hopeful cross in the area and Zaharia steered a header beyond Lehmann and into the far corner. It was a shock and against the run of play but it ignited the visiting team and their fans.<br><br>Lassana Diarra and Emmanuel Eboue came on. The IvorianÂ’s first act was to hurry back as Steaua broke forward and clear SurduÂ’s driven cross over this own bar.<br><br>Bendtner nearly forced a third when Zapata spilled his shot from distance. But, at the other end, Ovidiu Petre sent a swerving long-range effort inches past LehmannÂ’s left-hand post with a few minutes left.<br><br>Walcott and Eduardo went clear in the final minutes but Zapata stood firm. Arsenal deserved to hold on to their win tonight and, in most groups, 13 points would enough for top spot.<br><br>Just not this time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Wenger - Game isn't a 'present' for Lehmann*</strong><br><br>Jens Lehmann is not being handed a Â‘gift of a gameÂ’ against Steaua Bucharest tonight.<br><br>The German keeper is set to make his first Arsenal appearance since August 19 when the Romanian side visit Emirates Stadium on Matchday Six. The 38-year-old, who made a couple of high-profile errors at the start of the campaign, was absent initially due to injury then ArsÃ¨ne Wenger decided to stick with Manuel Almunia.<br><br>In his pre-match press conference, the manager revealed his reasons for re-instating the former-Schalke stopper now.<br><br>Â“It is good for every goalkeeper to practice but at some stage you need to play at a competitive level,Â” he said. Â“I decided when we qualified with two games to go that the game in Spain would be played by Almunia and the game in England by Lehmann.<br><br>"It is not a present. It was decided three weeks ago. It is to keep him fit and competitive because Almunia will play in the Carling Cup and we need the three 'keepers to be competitive. If Almunia gets injured tomorrow then you need Lehmann to have played.Â”<br><br>Wenger baulked at suggestions it would present him with a selection issue if Lehmann displayed the form that made him one of the stars of the 2006 World Cup.<br><br>"Why should it be a problem if a player plays well?Â” replied the manager. Â“It is a problem if he doesn't play well. In football you have one problem after another one. It is good to anticipate but you do not need to solve a problem you don't have. For all of us the only target is to do well for the Club - and we can only do that if we perform well.Â”<br><br>LehmannÂ’s omission from the side has sparked newspapers suggestions of a move in the January transfer window. It is fair to say WengerÂ’s comments on Tuesday neither opened nor shut the door.<br><br>Â“His Â‘long-term futureÂ’ depends on, at 38, what you call a Â‘long-term futureÂ’,Â” the Frenchman said. Â“We haven't spoken about that.<br><br>"Jens has a one-year contract so that is not long. At the moment I expect him to play well in this game. I can't guarantee he will be here for the second half of the season but I can't make that guarantee about anyone. And we have not been in touch with anybody.Â”</div>
