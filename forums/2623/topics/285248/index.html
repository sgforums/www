            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Extracted from soccernet forum:</span><br><br>I am worried about Henry these days and I would give you my reason.<br><br>He is a Barcelona player now in body but his spirit is still at Arsenal which is totally understandable but he might distract the players.<br><br>When he was injured last season, I found his presence on the sideline to be distracting especially to Adebayor. The players already say they feel like a burden has been lifted not having Henry around and it would be better if he gives them the opportunity to shine. Henry coming in december (which is a very busy part of the season) would be an unwanted distraction. This team needs a 100% focus and concentration to achieve sucess this season.<br><br>There is another article where Henry tipped Arsenal to do the double this season.<br><a href="http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,2483_2793726,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,2483_2793726,00.html</a><br><br>Those comments in my opinion are out of place and would put unnecessary pressure on the boys. Arsenal has only played 10 games this season and the boys have never won anything in their careers. It is just to early to start making sweeping predictions. A lot of fans (me included) believe that this team can go on and do things, the coach believes in the team and the players have self belief but nobody is talking of titles yet. Wenger has been very carefully not to talk about winning the title and the players have also been very humble and have also avoided that type of talk, its just too early.<br><br>I said I was not going to talk about Henry again but I noticed this worrying trend with Henry. I think he is honest in wanting to come back in december for a proper farewell and I also think his assessment of the teams potential is spot on but it is wrong. He can talk about the team at the end of the season and come to the emirates any time from next season but now is not the time. He should know how fragile the team is being with all this players for a while and I definitely expect him to know better than to distract this team with his pressence or comments.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>i kinda agree wif the comment. henry's return can only distracted our young players. if he want to do so, it's better to do it at the end of the season.<br></div>
