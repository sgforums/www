              <h1>Nasri return to squad but Song misses out</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/images/aug_08/gun__1219048981_wba16082008_nasri2.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="250"></p>
              <p>By Chris Harris</p>
              <p>Samir Nasri is back in the Arsenal squad for Tuesday's Champions League clash with Porto after shrugging off a knee problem.</p>
              <p>The French international has not played since suffering the injury
              while on duty with Les Bleus at the beginning of the month. That halted
              Nasri in his tracks after a flying start to the campaign but the
              Arsenal.com Player of the Month for August is finally set for his first
              game in September.</p>
              <p>Arsène Wenger confirmed Nasri's return at his pre-match press
              conference but revealed that Alex Song (hip) would not be available
              against Porto despite appearing on the bench for the weekend defeat to
              Hull City.</p>
              <p>"Song has still not recovered," said Wenger. "I had him on the bench
              on Saturday but he did not feel comfortable and he had a little
              setback. That shows you that we lost a player through the Carling Cup -
              once again.</p>
              <p>"Nasri is fit and is in the squad. But Abou Diaby, Eduardo and Tomas Rosicky are not back yet."</p>

              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal were in
              impressive attacking vigour on Tuesday evening to secure a 4-0 triumph
              over Porto in their UEFA Champions League encounter at Emirates
              Stadium. </strong></p>
              <p>Robin van Persie and Emmanuel Adebayor both struck
              braces as Arsene Wenger's side responded from their weekend setback
              against Hull City to move top of Group G.</p>
              <p>Holland international
              Van Persie opened the scoring with a finish from close range before
              Adebayor doubled the home team's advantage with a towering header.</p>
              <p>Any
              chance of a Porto comeback was ended just three minutes into the second
              period when Van Persie stabbed home, and then Adebayor stepped up from
              the penalty spot to seal the triumph after Nicklas Bendtner was felled
              in the box.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><h4>Nasri</h4>
              <p>The Gunners were heavily
              criticised after their Premier League loss to Hull, not least by
              manager Wenger himself, but the Frenchman resisted the temptation to
              axe some of his under-performing stars.</p>
              <p>French winger Samir Nasri
              was the only new face, ending a month-long spell in the treatment room
              to replace Emmanuel Eboue - who was relegated to the bench.</p>
              <p>Early
              on Arsenal threatened, breaking fluidly from their own half, short
              passing from Van Persie, Cesc Fabregas and Adebayor saw the ball worked
              across the area to Theo Walcott.</p>
              <p>He was stationed on the right
              and had time to pick his shot, but a smart save from Da Silva Helton
              saw the effort palmed to safety.</p>
              <p>The reactions of Helton saved
              Porto once again shortly afterwards when Van Persie attempted a
              long-range shot, but then it was Arsenal's turn to mop their brows.</p>
              <p>Tomas
              Costa sped down the right wing and delivered a perfect cross to
              Cristian Rodriguez, whose diving header hit the ground before
              deflecting off the bar.</p>
              <p>But the effort offered only temporary respite for Porto - who saw Van Persie, Walcott and Adebayor miss half-chances.</p>
              <p>For
              all Arsenal's dominance of territory and possession, Porto's speed on
              the counter meant they could not afford any lapses in concentration.</p>
              <p>Lisandro
              Lopez underlined the point by blasting a beautifully-struck curling
              shot at the top corner, but a diving Manuel Almunia reacted just in
              time.</p>
              <h5>Opener</h5>
              <p>Arsenal remained on top, however, and their perseverance was rewarded with a 30th-minute goal by Van Persie.</p>
              <p>Adebayor and Van Persie combined expertly down the right of the area, creating space for the Togo marksman.</p>
              <p>He looked up and delayed his pass to the Dutchman, who prodded the ball home.</p>
              <p>The
              Gunners surged further ahead with five minutes of the half remaining
              when Adebayor leapt above Jorge Rolando to head Van Persie's corner
              towards the ground.</p>
              <p>The ball bounced awkwardly for Helton and
              defender Nelson Benitez, who was stationed on the line - the duo could
              only watch on as it sailed over their heads.</p>
              <p>The second half was just three minutes old when Arsenal added to the scoreline with a surprisingly easy third.</p>
              <p>Walcott
              did the initial damage before the ball found its way to Van Persie, who
              showed strength to fend off Bruno Alves and stab home.</p>
              <p>Porto's defence was crumbling, and Walcott should have made it four but missed a sitter from four yards out.</p>
              <p>The England forward's pace was proving a constant threat as he marauded down the right wing at will.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's fourth arrived when Bendtner, on for Van Persie, was brought down by a clumsy tackle from Freddy Guarin.</p>
              <p>Adebayor stepped up and slotted the penalty home to complete an easy night for the Gunners.</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal boss Arsene
              Wenger was pleased his side responded to their weekend setback with a
              convincing triumph over Porto in the UEFA Champions League. </strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners suffered their second Premier League loss
              of the season last Saturday as Hull City claimed a shock win at
              Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>Wenger had intimated that he would make several
              changes to his side for the game against Porto, but his only alteration
              came via the inclusion of Samir Nasri in the starting XI.</p>
              <p>The
              Frenchman's team were impressive versus the Portuguese Liga champions
              as they claimed a 4-0 success, and Wenger was glad his charges repaid
              his trust.</p>
              <p>He told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "I believe sometimes you have to give a chance to the players that were not completely up for it.</p>
              <h4>Overconfident</h4>
              <p>"If
              you do change one or two, then why not four, five or six. The response
              was very important. If that had not come then it would have been
              different.</p>
              <p>"It was a convincing 4-0 win. We were shocked after Saturday's defeat and we responded to that with a 4-0 home win over Porto.</p>
              <p>"I believe we were focused, disciplined and did not take all our chances. Overall, we would have taken 4-0 before the game.</p>
              <p>"But it is only half of the week. The next important half is against Sunderland on Saturday.</p>
              <h5>Fight</h5>
              <p>"We
              have plenty of character. We are maturing and in progress. We are
              ambitious and confident and sometimes maybe overconfident."</p>
              <p>Arsenal
              captain William Gallas added: "We had a point to prove. Nobody likes to
              lose and it was very important for us to win tonight.</p>
              <p>"Like the boss said, we have to play together and fight together. We did a good job tonight."</p>

              <p><br>to a certain extent i agree. but why these ppl choose to post in sgsexforum instead of bar? last time bar used to have all this threads. the reason is cos sgsexforum has taken on a new direction. we have new objectives. besides providing quality sex education, we also encourage ppl to speak up about their sexual experiences fantasy or otherwise and queries about sex. in addition, in order to create a fine balance, we do not lock those threads looking for sex in sgsexforum. not cos we want to drive ratings up but cos we encourage ppl to post without boundaries. and sex box was approved to take on a light hearted direction without inhibitions. so you see, its a delicate balance in sgsexforum. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
