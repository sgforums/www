              <p>on Tuesday, 25 March 2008</p>
              <p><strong>If Arsenal are to climb back into the title race then
              manager Arsene Wenger needs to make tough calls starting with the
              dropping of Kolo Toure from their defence.</strong></p>
              <p>Only last month The Gunners were five points clear at the top of the
              Premier League table, but a run of poor performances now sees them sit
              in third place behind Chelsea and Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Last weekend's defeat to Chelsea was a crushing blow for the North
              Londoners, not only because their city rivals overtook them in the
              league but that when the pressure came on in a high pressure game they
              simply couldn't cope.</p>
              <p>Many people have wrongly pointed to the double substitution by Blues
              boss Avram Grant as the turning point in the game, but it was just
              coincidence that the Arsenal dam cracked when Nicolas Anelka and
              Juliano Belletti trotted onto the pitch.</p>
              <p>Chelsea did not change their tactics with those switches, despite
              what many reports would have you believe, instead they just kept
              launching long balls into Didier Drogba and pushing a nervy Gunners
              defence right back into their own penalty area.</p>
              <p>Drogba took advantage of poor positioning by William Gallas and Kolo
              Toure for both goals that he scored. There was no midfielder dropping
              back to help them out, yet they should still be held accountable for
              their poor decision-making in those two incidents. Toure, in
              particular, was embarrassing in how he tried to defend the second goal
              with his wild swing at the ball making Gunners fans blush every time it
              is replayed.</p>
              <p>Those two goals highlighted the fragile partnership that Gallas and
              Toure share in the centre of defence. Both should be suited to play
              alongside each other as they are strong, quick, good tacklers, and
              committed to clearing their lines at all costs. But it doesn't work.</p>
              <p>Sometimes they are too close together, which invites pressure from
              the opposition and sees them challenging for the same ball. Then at
              other times they are too far apart and fail to communicate properly as
              they are pulled out of position - which was the case when Tuncay Sanli
              found Jermaine Aliadiere to score in the 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough.</p>
              <p>Despite not being the complete defender himself, Philippe Senderos
              is actually a far more solid partner for Gallas to link up with. The
              Swiss centre-back reads the game well, encourages those around him,
              marks his man very closely, and is often on hand to help a fellow
              defender when they are being doubled up on. It was obvious that Wenger
              would drop him once Toure was back to full fitness, but it was the
              wrong decision to make.</p>
              <p>The difference between Toure and Senderos cannot be judged on
              statistics as the Ivory Coast international has clearly played more
              games than Senderos. However, it is curious to discover that when
              Senderos has started in the league Arsenal have won seven times and
              only conceded six goals, while Toure has been involved in fourteen wins
              and seen nineteen goals be conceded.</p>
              <p>Those stats don't mean much though as the level of opposition needs
              to be taken into account, what happened in the particular games (i.e.
              if someone was sent off), and neither have an advantage of helping the
              team win more as both defenders have scored two league goals each.</p>
              <p>Yet for anyone who watches Arsenal on a regular basis, it will be
              blindly obvious that Toure and Gallas does not work as well as Senderos
              and Gallas does. Gallas is the mainstay in this equation because he is
              the club captain. Toure might be a better individual player, but
              Senderos is a far better team player. So Wenger should go with what
              works for the team and not just rely on the individual ability of each
              player.</p>
              <p>Senderos is a player that constantly gets mocked in the media for
              being a huge liability, which is born from two poor performances when
              he was marking Drogba. However, any defender that comes up against the
              Chelsea powerhouse seems to struggle, as Toure and Gallas both did last
              week.</p>
              <p>Toure left for the African Cup Of Nations, where he was terrible for
              Ivory Coast even though they reached the semi-finals, earlier this year
              and has not performed well for Arsenal since returning from that
              tournament. If a player is not playing well then they shouldn't be
              playing - Arsenal learnt that last year with Thierry Henry, but could
              be making the same mistake all over again.</p>
              <p>With Bacary Sagna limping off in the defeat to Chelsea, Toure may be
              asked to fill in at right-back which would see Senderos restored to the
              heart of the defence for the next match against Bolton Wanderers.
              Unless the volatile and undependable Emmanuel Eboue is chosen as cover
              for Sagna, but let's hope that that isn't the case.</p>

              <p>Precisely, the first report that i've read to take away credit from Grant. His "attacking football" did not win the game for Chelsea, the 2 goals we scored was basically a reminiscent of the old Mourinho times, which is launching of long balls.</p>
              <p>But funnily though, our local papers seems to say that Gallas was the main culprit.</p>
