              <p>At just 17 years of
              age, the Cardiff City star finds himself in a situation that pretty
              much every British teenager – and many more besides from abroad – will
              have dreamed of at some point.<br><br>The Bluebirds prospect has the
              opportunity to choose between three of England’s biggest and most
              successful clubs, with Arsenal, Everton and Manchester United all
              desperate to land the Caerphilly-born midfielder.<br><br>And while
              David Moyes and Sir Alex Ferguson will no doubt make a final push to
              sign the Wales under-21 international, The Guardian reports that Arsene Wenger’s Gunners are on the verge of adding Ramsey to their already vast labyrinth of outstanding young talent.<br><br><strong>Developments</strong><br><br>They
              say a week is a long time in football, and such developments prove the
              saying true given United revealed via their official website last
              Tuesday that the club was "delighted to announce it has agreed terms
              with Cardiff City for the transfer of Aaron Ramsey subject to terms
              being agreed and the player passing a medical".<br><br>But Cardiff were
              quick to point out they had fielded offers from three separate clubs,
              two of whom have since been granted permission to speak to Ramsey. It
              is believed Liverpool were one of the initial suitors, but Reds boss
              Rafa Benitez pulled out to focus on first-team options once the bidding
              rose to the â‚¤5million mark.<br><br>Just to add a little more pressure
              to their already swamped youngster, Cardiff have intimated they are
              keen for Ramsey to head to Old Trafford, as United boss Ferguson has
              promised to send the player back to Ninian Park immediately on a
              year-long loan.<br><br>But Ramsey, who has been praised for his mature
              and patient handling of the situation, is keen to consider all options,
              and has visited Everton with his parents and advisers to hold
              discussions with Toffees boss Moyes.<br><br><strong>Face To Face</strong><br><br>Ferguson
              may rue the fact he was on holiday when the Ramseys visited United’s
              Carrington Park training complex, as the player’s parents are
              supposedly to keen to talk face-to-face with their son’s prospective
              bosses to ensure their will be no off-field issues at his new place of
              employment.<br><br>Wenger was also out of the country, but opted
              instead to bring the Ramseys to him by flying them over to Switzerland
              – at Arsenal’s expense – on a private jet on Saturday morning to
              discuss the matter over lunch.<br><br>The Frenchman has never before
              had issues luring Europe’s most promising youngsters to North London,
              having convinced the likes of Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott that their
              futures lay at the Emirates. It is understood Wenger has assured Ramsey
              that he will not be sent out on loan, and would be given every
              opportunity to fight for a first-team place with the Gunners.<br><br>With
              personal terms essentially agreed with all three clubs, the decision of
              which Premier League giants he chooses is all down to Ramsey. No
              pressure, right?</p>

              <p>With Aaron Ramsey poised to join Arsenal from FA Cup finalists Cardiff
              City in a £5million cash deal, despite bids from Manchester United and
              Everton, the Bluebirds' chairman has explained his club's position on
              the proposed transfer.<br> <br> Peter Ridsdale said Arsenal's bid for their academy graduate was the
              best cash offer they received, and told BBC Sport: "It is a very
              straight-forward, no-strings-attached £5million cash offer - simple.<br> <br> "We felt that Manchester United equalled it because it [United's offer] included a loan back option."<br> <br> Ramsey, who has made just 22 first-team appearances for the
              Championship side that reached the FA Cup final, is expected to have a
              medical at Arsenal's Hertfordshire training ground within the next 24
              hours.<br> <br> Ridsdale admitted: "We would have much preferred him to remain as a
              Cardiff City player or returned here on loan next season had he gone
              somewhere else.<br> <br> "The only deal with a loan-back option was with Manchester United but
              ultimately it is up to the player to decide where he wants to go.<br> <br> "In an ideal world I would have wished him to go to Manchester United
              were he to leave us, but we have to be careful as we have relationships
              with Arsenal and want to do business with them in the future."<br> <br> Ramsey first caught the attention of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (who
              flew the player and his parents out to Switzerland at the club's
              expense at the weekend for a face-to-face meeting) when he scored and
              impressed in Cardiff's FA Youth Cup quarter-final defeat by the Gunners
              in February 2007.<br> <br> He beat John Toshack's record by becoming Cardiff's youngest ever
              player at just 16 years and 124 days when when replacing Paul Parry in
              a 1-0 home defeat by Hull City in April 2007.<br> <br> Ramsey was included in Toshack's Wales squad for the first time this
              summer for their two friendlies against Iceland and the Netherlands,
              but didn't play.<br> <br> Regarding his proposed transfer from the Bluebirds, a club statement
              read: "Cardiff City were informed on Friday morning that Aaron Ramsey's
              preferred destination this summer is the Emirates Stadium with Arsenal.
              We will now continue the dialogue with the Gunners with a view to
              Aaron's move being completed.<br> <br> "The move, unlike other options, does not include a loan back period at Ninian Park for the 2008/09 season.<br> <br> "We would like to wish Aaron every success in the top-flight."</p>

              <p>Signing the top rated
              17-year-old would be extra sweet for the Gunners, as it would leave
              Manchester United with no small amount of egg on their face after they
              announced last Tuesday that they were delighted to have agreed terms
              with Cardiff City for the transfer of Aaron Ramsey.<br> <br>Evidently
              the powers that be at Old Trafford took for granted that the youngster
              would jump at the chance to join them, but that has proven not to be
              the case.  <br><br>"Cardiff City were informed on Friday morning that Aaron Ramsey's preferred destination this summer is at the Emirates Stadium with

              United, then from Arsenal and Everton.<br><br>From then on, there was a
              battle to agree personal terms between the three clubs that many
              assumed double winners Manchester United were going to emerge
              victorious from. The outside bet was that Everton, a smaller club,
              would offer him more playing time and that he would choose them for
              that reason.</p>
              <p>However, he went inbetween, to Arsene Wenger's Arsenal, explaining that
              he believes the offer is best for his future, which may have been
              swayed by Arsene Wenger's decision to meet with him personally, whereas
              it was alleged that when Ramsey and his family wanted to meet with
              United's directors they were not afforded the opportunity.<br><br>"It is an honour to be wanted by massive clubs like Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton," Ramsey said in the <em>Western Mail</em>. <br><br>"In the end I had to make the decision I felt was right for my future." <br><br>"Cardiff
              City gave me my start in professional football and I won't forget that.
              It doesn't seem that long ago when I first joined as a schoolboy.<br><br>"I have come a fair way since then, but there is still a lot of hard work ahead." <br><br>Meanwhile,
              Cardiff chairman Peter Ridsdale has explained the club's stance on the
              negotiations: "I believe we handled the situation as well as it could
              be handled. <br><br>"I spoke to David Gill, Manchester United's chief
              executive, yesterday and they are disappointed, but there is no problem
              with Cardiff City whatsoever. <br><br>"We had a detailed chat and there is no bad vibe, none whatsoever. I kept Manchester United informed at every moment. <br><br>"They
              were the first to make a £5million offer, but I told them at the time
              that if any other clubs came in at an identical level, they would also
              be given permission for talks with Aaron. <br><br>"Arsenal have sent me an email thanking Cardiff City for the way the transfer negotiations were handled."</p>

              <h1>Ramsey completes Arsenal switch</h1>
              <p class="first"><strong>Cardiff City teenager Aaron Ramsey has completed his £5m move to Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>Champions League winners Manchester United and Premier League giants
              Everton were also in the hunt for the 17-year-old Welsh prodigy.</p>
              <p>But Ramsey has signed a long-term deal at Arsenal after they flew him
              to Switzerland for face-to-face talks with boss Arsene Wenger at Euro
              2008.</p>
              <p>"He was a big factor in my decision to join Arsenal," said Ramsey. "I'm so happy to have signed for Arsenal."
              </p>
              <p>Known as "Rambo", Ramsey progressed through the youth ranks at Cardiff City.</p>
              <p>In April 2007, he became the youngest player to represent the Bluebirds
              aged 16 years and 124 days when he replaced Paul Parry in a 1-0 home
              defeat to Hull City.</p>
              <p>Since then, Ramsey went on to make a total of 22 appearances
              for the Welsh side, including a substitute appearance in last season's
              FA Cup Final against Portsmouth at Wembley Stadium.</p>
              <p>He also became the youngest player to represent his country at Under-21 level in August 2007.</p>
              <p>Ramsey spoke to Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson on the
              telephone as initially Premier League champions United looked favourite
              to sign him.</p>
              <p>Cardiff made no secret of the fact they wanted him to join United to take advantage of the loan-back agreement.</p>
              <p>He also met Everton manager David Moyes before being flown out on a private jet to Basel last Saturday to meet with Wenger.</p>
              <p>"Arsene talked to me for a long time about the club and the plans for the future, which really excites me," said Ramsey.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal is a club which always gives young players an opportunity at
              the highest level of the game and I am going to work my hardest to be
              part of future successes here.</p>
              <p>"It was a really difficult decision to leave Cardiff City, they are my
              local club with great supporters and I would just like thank everyone
              at Cardiff City for their support and help in my early career.</p>
              <p>"I will still look out for their results and there will always be a place in my heart for the Bluebirds."</p>
              <p>Ramsey caught Arsenal's eye when the young midfielder shone in a
              goal-scoring display during Cardiff's FA Youth Cup quarter-final defeat
              to the Gunners in February 2007.</p>
              <p>"We're delighted to have signed Aaron Ramsey," said Wenger.</p>
              <p>"He is a young player who has shown huge potential with his
              performances for both Cardiff City and Wales at Under-17 and Under-21
              levels.</p>
              <p>"He is still only 17, but has already shown that he is a very intelligent and mature player with great quality.</p>
              <p>"Although he mainly plays in midfield, Aaron is a versatile player and can also play across the defence.</p>
              <p>"We are all looking forward to welcoming Aaron to the Club for our
              pre-season preparations." Ramsey - hailed as "sensational" by Wales
              youth guru Brian Flynn - is one of a crop of promising Welsh youngsters
              tipped for the big-time.</p>
              <p>Cardiff boss Dave Jones has hailed Ramsey's versatility as the teenager
              has played in his favoured central midfield role, on each flank, at
              full-back and also in a free role behind the striker this season.</p>
              <p>Ramsey, his former Cardiff colleague Joe Ledley, Tottenham's Gareth
              Bale, Wolves keeper Wayne Hennessey and West Ham midfielder Jack
              Collison have been earmarked as Wales' stars of the future by Wales
              boss Toshack.</p>
              <p>The Caerphilly-born playmaker is the latest off the Cardiff production
              line of players to move to the Premier League following Chris Gunter,
              Danny Gabbidon, James Collins and Rob Earnshaw into the top league.</p>
              <p>He will join up with his new team mates at Arsenal for pre-season training in early July.</p>
              <p>A Cardiff City statement said: "We would like to wish Aaron every success in the top-flight."</p>
