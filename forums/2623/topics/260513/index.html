            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Lukasz Fabianski has warned Jens Lehmann that he expects to be Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper next season.</strong><br><br>Pole Fabianski, 22, joined the Gunners from Legia Warsaw in May and will vie with the German and Manuel Almunia for the goalkeeper's jersey.<br><br>He told BBC Sport: "Lehmann and Almunia are very good, but I'm not afraid of anyone. I'm confident of my skills.<br><br>"I want to be first choice at Arsenal as much as they do. My message is clear - I'm ready to fight from day one."<br><br>Lehmann, who signed a new one-year contract with the Gunners in April, insists he has nothing to fear from Fabianski, despite being 15 years his senior.<br><br>He said: "When I am physically fit and have nothing distracting me mentally, then nobody can match me for experience."<br><br>Yet the ambitious Fabianski, who has made four appearances for his country and was voted the Polish league's best goalkeeper for the last two seasons, has other ideas.<br><br>"Of course I can wait a little bit for my chance, but I'm not coming to Arsenal just to be there," he said in his first interview with the English media.<br><br>"I want to become a regular first-team player. Hopefully I'll do it from the very beginning, because I'm ready for this.<br><br>"That was my goal from the start. Being at a club and playing are two different things, I want to play.<br><br>"Now I will focus on working hard every day and competing for the number one jersey."<br><br>There have been reports that Fabianski could be sent on loan at the start of next season, with Watford a possible destination, yet he is adamant he is going nowhere.<br><br>"Nobody has proposed anything to me and I'm not going anywhere," he said.<br><br>"I want to be at Arsenal from the start of the season and learn everything about my new team and team-mates.<br><br>"I need to get accustomed to training at Arsenal and the atmosphere in the locker room. That's how I see my future at this club."<br><br>The Gunners have been monitoring the young keeper for several seasons.<br><br>He spent four days training at the club in the summer of 2004 and Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has kept tabs on him since then.<br><br>"Most of the time I practised alone with the goalkeeping coach because most of the Arsenal players were on holiday. But on my last day I was joined by Manuel Almunia and we trained together for some time.<br><br>"At the end of my time Mr Wenger told me, 'Be careful, we will watch you'."<br><br>Fabianski went on to have two sensational seasons with Legia Warsaw and was included in Poland's squad for the 2006 World Cup.<br><br>Wenger decided to pounce last month after the Pole had been linked with several top European clubs, including Manchester United.<br><br>"At the start of last month I was invited to London by Arsenal and had a personal meeting with Mr Wenger," he said.<br><br>"I didn't have any expectations, but Mr Wenger told me he wanted me to join Arsenal.<br><br>"I tried to stay cool and not be too over-excited, but I felt very honoured.<br><br>"However, being at one of the great clubs in the world won't mean much unless I will start to play for Arsenal and show my abilities." </span></div>
