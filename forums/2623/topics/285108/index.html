I watched how they beat Sevilla in the Champions League and I think they sent out a big message to the rest of Europe. Sevilla is not an easy team to play, but Arsenal played a great game.'<br><br>The Gunners experienced a period of unrest in the summer with the shock exit of former vice-chairman David Dein and Henry's departure followed by uncertainty over Wenger's future until the manager agreed a new contract at the Emirates.<br><br>Henry revealed he has maintained his relationship with his fellow Frenchman, with whom he started his career at Monaco more than 10 years ago.<br><br>'Me and Arsene have been in contact a few times since I left. I always talk to him because even with the difference of age, the bond and respect is there,' Henry said.<br><br>'It is tremendous that he has signed a new contract. He has great eyes and just has a talent for spotting young talent. He is a great human being as well and that's what makes the difference. He makes players feel comfortable and always gets the best out of them.'</div>
