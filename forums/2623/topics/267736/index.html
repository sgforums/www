But Sagna thinks they can prove their critics wrong.<br><br>Â“We have the youth card and the fact that no one really rates us means that maybe we can surprise people,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“The young players want to prove what they can do and I want to prove what I can do. All of this together will help us have a good season.<br><br>Â“This is one of the best English sides, the one that plays the best football. The fact that it is a young team and there is a high-quality training ground are extra positives compared to other English teams.<br><br>Â“Arsenal is one of the biggest European clubs. If someone had told me that one day I would be an Arsenal player, I would not have believed them. It is a really positive move.Â”<br><br>Sagna made 87 appearances over the past three seasons for Auxerre, playing predominately at right-back. But Wenger was attracted to his fellow FrenchmanÂ’s versatility.<br><br>Â“We are delighted to have signed Bacary,Â” said Wenger. Â“He is a very capable defender and has played consistently well for Auxerre.<br><br>Â“He plays mainly at right-back but can also play along the defence or in midfield. He is strong, quick and enjoys defending, but also has a good offensive side to his game. He has a fighting spirit and will be a very good addition to our squad.Â”<br><br>Sagna is already good friends with Abou Diaby, Mathieu Flamini, Emmanuel Adebayor and Gallas, but says it was WengerÂ’s personal touch that convinced him to make the Emirates his new home.<br><br>Â“Arsene Wenger showed his determination when he wanted to attract me to the club when we spoke recently,Â” said Sagna.<br><br>Â“The fact that he personally contacted me recently, the fact this is such a big club and he has made so much effort to recruit me, it has seduced me. Everybody has talked about the pace and strength of the Premier League, but I shouldnÂ’t have any problems settling in and adapting.<br><br>Â“Players like Henry, Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit made it at Arsenal because they were willing and gave their<br>maximum. I am going to try to imitate them.<br><br>Â“It is quite a French-speaking club, everybody has put me at ease right from the start and I feel good.<br><br>Â“Abou Diaby spoke to me the last time the French national side got together and he only had good things to say about Arsenal. So far I am not disappointed.Â”<br><br>Wenger could now make a move for Yoan Gouffran, the 21-year-old striker who helped Caen earn promotion to the French top flight.<br><br>Caen president Jean-Francois Fortin, however, feels the youngster would benefit from staying put.<br><br>Â“Yoan is a young player who has not played in Ligue One and I am convinced the best thing for him is the stage here,Â” said Fortin.<br><br>Â“Unlike us, I am not sure the interested clubs could guarantee him a stage to perform like we can.Â”<br></div>
