With other teams, maybe they can't follow it until the end.<br><br>"Our opponents are always strong, but we always feel there will be one point where they can't stay with you and that is when we can score."<br><br>Arsenal emerged from a second successive test of their title credentials unscathed, having also drawn 1-1 at Liverpool last weekend with a late goal.<br><br>There are, of course, sure to be plenty of twists and turns ahead as the campaign unfolds.<br><br>However, it has certainly been a positive start from Wenger's side, whose last trophy was the FA Cup in 2005.<br><br>"The title race is still very far, but this point is good," said Fabregas. "Losing the game would have left them three points in front. So to stay top with an extra game is very good.<br><br>"But now we have to beat all of the teams that come here and also away from home.<br><br>"When you go to places like Liverpool, Stamford Bridge or Old Trafford, you have to try to win those games as well."<br><br>Arsenal had enjoyed long spells of possession, but often failed to find a decisive pass to open up the United defence.<br><br>Indeed, the home side were really only on top at the start of the second half and in the dying stages when they finally forced an equaliser in stoppage-time.<br><br>Of course, against teams of lesser strength, the Gunners are not expected to face such a quality rearguard.<br><br>"Consistency is very important," said Fabregas. "You don't win the title just by results against the big teams like this.<br><br>"We have to beat the lesser teams and then if we can get results against the top teams then it really helps us in the title race."<br><br>Fabregas declared: "We have to believe. Belief is the most important thing in football. If you don't believe then you have no chance."<br><br>Arsenal looked to be heading for a first defeat since April when Cristiano Ronaldo slotted home into an empty net with just eight minutes left after full-back Patrice Evra had drawn keeper Manuel Almunia into an unnecessary dash from his six-yard box.<br><br>However, this emerging Arsenal side just do not know when they are beaten and they produced a late surge on the United goal.<br><br>Evra sliced the ball onto the top of his own bar, and substitute Eduardo da Silva fired wide.<br><br>Then just when time seemed to have run out, Gallas was on hand at the far post to drill the ball over the line.<br><br>Even though keeper Edwin van der Sar palmed his shot out, it was well spotted by assistant referee Darren Cann - once on the books of Norwich City - who flagged the goal to Howard Webb.<br><br>The decision sparked wild jubilation for the home supporters, with Gallas running to the dugout to celebrate with his manager.<br><br>The former Chelsea defender, 30, has certainly grown into the role handed him this season following the departure of Thierry Henry.<br><br>Fabregas said: "William is a strong guy. He has shown at Chelsea and in the French national team as well as here that he is a big character.<br><br>"We respect him a lot. He is helping as captain, but everybody is a leader and that's the most important thing."</div>
