Maybe only Arsenal have the same but their approach is different to mine.<br><br>Â“If you were fickle you would say it is the same for both clubs, but it isnÂ’t. ItÂ’s totally different.<br><br>Â“Gael Clichy has been playing at Arsenal for years, getting used to his role behind Ashley Cole before he moved on. Then he comes into the team after a couple of years of preparation.<br><br>Â“Cesc Fabregas was there for three or four years. They were all on the bench and came on when things were going well.<br><br>Â“If your team is in a position where you are playing well and then you bring on, for example, Kevin-Prince Boateng or Adel Taarabt, itÂ’s an easy decision to make.<br><br>Â“Sometimes you have to play them no matter what.<br><br>"I felt I had to play Gareth Bale because he is a good option. The same goes for Younes Kaboul. Against Middlesbrough I played Michael Dawson, 22, Kaboul, 20, Bale, 18. That is probably the difference with the big clubs.<br><br>Â“Kaboul, Boateng and Bale didnÂ’t play in the Premier League until this season. Hopefully they will develop into very good players.Â”<br><br>Jol has come under fire after early-season results all but dashed the target of Champions League football next term. Jol, trying to improve on consecutive fifth-place finishes, insisted: Â“ItÂ’s not always about the scoreboard. ItÂ’s about the development of players like Kaboul, Bale and Aaron Lennon.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s been a bad start, but itÂ’s not as bad as it seems. Nothing is as it seems in football.<br><br>Â“I have to combine the results with the development. Even at Arsenal that is not the case.<br><br>Â“I can mention five or six players who chose to come to Tottenham ahead of other clubs.<br><br>Â“When you buy players, especially young players, youÂ’ve got to play them.<br><br>Â“Look at my team and you will see examples of young players getting the right opportunity here.<br><br>Â“If they see Tom Huddlestone, Lennon and Dawson playing, it is a good example for what someone new can achieve.<br><br>Â“How many years will it take them to develop? What are you on about Â— we finished fifth last year.<br><br>Â“My philosophy is to get players young, get them used to Spurs and the Premier League.Â”<br><br>Jol has revealed he wants striker Jermain Defoe to sign a new deal. Defoe, 24, has less than two years left on his existing contract.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> I disagree. spurs is just shite. the manager's a c u n t and the chief's a genital. even the ex german coach said spuds are shit. i mean not a big club. dun comapre arsenal to spurs. we're better. we're as good as the other top 3 clubs..but no no to spuds.</span></div>
