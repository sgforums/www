              <p>extracted from <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=524511&amp;cc=3888">soccernet</a></p>
              <p>Jens Lehmann claims he could have prevented Arsenal from going out of the Champions League, if only he had been given a chance.</p>
              <p>The 38-year-old goalkeeper spoke of his anger at being consigned to the bench and attacked both manager Arsene Wenger and the man who is keeping him out of the side, Manuel Almunia, in an interview with Germany's Kicker magazine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I stayed here to win the Champions League and I saw good chances to play, but I have not had these (chances) and that makes me very angry,' he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Germany number one was left to seething as he saw his European dream ended for another year following the Gunners' 4-2 defeat at Liverpool in Tuesday's quarter-final second leg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'For me personally, it is a tragedy, particularly since I did not have a chance to prevent it,' he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I have had such thoughts (about being able to prevent defeats) ever since the coach took me out of the team following the 0-0 against Milan.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lehmann turned down the chance to move to Borussia Dortmund during the winter break and pledged he would fight to regain his place in the Arsenal team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In doing so, he may have compromised his chances of remaining first choice for Germany at Euro 2008, and Lehmann cannot believe the gamble has not paid off, with Almunia still standing ahead of him in the Arsenal goal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'To be sitting on the bench behind somebody who only started to play when he was 30 is not funny,' he added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I am very angry.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, Lehmann feels he has been treated badly by Wenger, claiming he has not been given a fair chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: 'If the coach had spoken to me before the start of the season then I would have been able to decide if I wanted to sit on the bench.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'He has a different opinion and I don't really believe he can be happy with it.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Lehmann does not feel he will be able to prove Wenger wrong by shining at Euro 2008 with Germany, claiming his manager would probably not even notice he is there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'If he has not seen it yet then he won't see it at the European Championships either if I perform well,' said a bitter Lehmann.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>well said! for goodness sake, i felt for Lehmann cos he was never given a chance. Aluminia has been getting off-form lately n letting goal every match.</p>
              <p>Germany is going to be fav for Euro 2008, n Lehmann likely to be S.G.G.K featuring in the squad. tis is something dat Aluminia would nvr get the chance to play for spain.</p>
              <p>Lehmann is an old guard for the success of 49-unbeaten match hero, shouldnt wenger give him a final respect n farewell for his contribution?</p>

              <p>sometimes i feel wenger has damn weird decisions about the best squad available.</p>
              <p>i totally agree with lehmann's statements. he played well in the matches he was given, what right has almunia got over lehmann to get back a starting spot once he back from injury? he's never made a save to impress me, and sometimes, the goals he lets in... i know my lemon will save with ease. a motivated lehmann is fucking unbeatable, i have no idea why he was dropped in the first place. maybe for awhile to let him know he made mistakes, but you must remember lehmann is the better 'keeper, OK ARSENE?</p>
              <p>sad, he dont care about our opinions.</p>
              <p>"The best I normally wish for Chelsea Football Club is immediate death. But for one two legged tie I hope and pray they pound that shower of flukey, league shirking, fourth place, history surfing, not mounted a title challenge for 17 years, Scouse chancers into the oblivion their season merits." <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.arsepod.co.uk/wordpress1/">Goodplaya</a></p>
              <p>i quote this from some other thread, cuz i wanna save space. totally expressed what i had in mind.</p>

              <p>I agree. The motivated lehmann is fking unbeatable. That's how he manage to give arsenal the unbeaten season in his rookie season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Lehmann is old already. Next season confirm gone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Almunia is a joke and should not be compared with the same breath as lehmann.</p>

              <h1>Almunia comes to terms with Lehmann's 'hate'</h1>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Arsenal's goalkeeper is ready to face United knowing his team-mate couldn't think less of him</span></p>
              <p>I'm an easy-going person," Manuel Almunia says. "I like to treat
              everyone with respect and I see everyone as equals. I treat people the
              way I would like to be treated myself. To have someone here who hates
              me is just amazing. I know he hates me."</p>
              <p>There can be only one
              goalkeeper in every team so it is to be expected that the men fighting
              for that place occasionally clash. In Holland, as a substitute
              goalkeeper at PSV Eindhoven, Ronald Waterreus used to switch on the
              television in the middle of the night to make sure his room-mate and
              rival, Georg Koch, slept badly before games. David James will admit
              cold-shouldering Brad Friedel when the American signed for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>It is easy to understand, however, why Almunia, Arsenal's goalkeeper,
              has run out of patience with Jens Lehmann. All season, ever since
              Lehmann lost his place, the German has been belittling Almunia at every
              opportunity. He has described it as a "humiliation" to lose his place
              to a goalkeeper whose previous clubs include Osasuna B, Cartagena,
              Sabadell, Eibar and Recreativo Huelva.</p>
              <p>He
              has described himself sitting on the sidelines feeling "very angry" and
              having to "clench my fist in my pocket". His words have been laced with
              contempt and, with a carefully planned sense of timing, he claimed this
              week that Arsenal would still be in the Champions League if he had been
              in goal. "To be sitting on the bench behind somebody who only started
              to play when he was 30 is not funny."</p>
              <p>Until now, Almunia has
              chosen to rise above the jibes. This has been a difficult week for
              everyone at the Emirates and, as the team prepared for tomorrow's game
              at Manchester United, it became clear that their relationship has
              broken down irretrievably.</p>
              <p>"Every morning I wake up," says
              Almunia, "I know it is going to be the same. I've had to put up with it
              every day since he was out of the team and even before then. I wake up
              and I know what it is going to be like. But I don't care about him any
              more. He can say what he likes. I come into training and I work with
              Lukasz Fabianski and Vito Mannone. They are better goalkeepers than him
              anyway."</p>
              <p>Almunia is not a vindictive man. Far from it. Ask anyone
              at Arsenal about the 30-year-old from Pamplona and they will talk about
              him being one of the more popular members of Arsène Wenger's dressing
              room. That is why he is so appalled by Lehmann's behaviour. "It's his
              problem, not mine, and I don't see why I should try to talk to him
              about it. The truth is I don't want to talk to him. I came into
              training this morning and one of the press officers told me he had been
              saying bad things about me in the newspapers again. It didn't surprise
              me. The truth is I have got used to reading these things from him. If
              he was someone important to me, I would try to talk to him and see what
              the problem is. But he's not. So we don't talk."</p>
              <p>Lehmann, it
              should be pointed out, has history when it comes to falling out with
              rival goalkeepers and, famously, had a long-standing grudge with Oliver
              Kahn as they competed for the same place in the German national team.
              Yet Almunia, by all accounts, is a difficult man to dislike.</p>
              <p>"I've
              never been in a situation like this before in my career," he says.
              "Normally we goalkeepers have so much respect for each other. Why he
              doesn't respect me, I don't know. But I don't want any relationship
              with him. I try not to let what he says enter my mind because it's not
              important to me what he says or what he thinks."</p>
              <p>The people who
              matter to Almunia are his family and the rest of the Arsenal players.
              Plus, of course, Arsène Wenger. "I have had a lot of nice words from
              them," he says. "I've been in the first XI nearly all the season and
              I'm happy with my form. I've kept my level up and I think I can be
              satisfied with my performances. Apart from one person, the people here
              have shown a lot of confidence in me."</p>
              <p>Almunia has had to show
              the strength of his character because he has been under scrutiny ever
              since he displaced Lehmann. One newspaper likened him to Manuel from
              Fawlty Towers after Manchester United's 2-2 draw at the Emirates in
              November, but the volume has gradually been turned down on his critics.
              One certainty is that he has made fewer errors than the man who seems
              so intent on demeaning him. Lehmann, lest it be forgotten, was dropped
              because, in Wenger's opinion, the 38-year-old had become a danger to
              his own team.</p>
              <p>Since then, Lehmann has been increasingly getting
              under Wenger's skin and there was a telling scene at the manager's
              press conference yesterday when he was asked whether the German would
              get a new contract when his present deal expires at the end of this
              season. "Pardon?" said Wenger incredulously. The question was repeated
              and Wenger snorted with laughter. "The boss is trying to build a team
              of kind people," says Almunia. "He wants easy-going people who have
              character. He doesn't like arguments in the dressing room."</p>
              <p>The
              Spaniard signed his own contract extension last week and is confident
              of retaining his place even if, as seems highly likely, Wenger signs a
              replacement for Lehmann. "If another goalkeeper comes in he will be
              made welcome," he says. "I hope we can have a good atmosphere with all
              the goalkeepers working together. I signed my contract because my heart
              is with Arsenal."</p>
              <p>He is, however, still feeling depressed after
              what has been a chastening period for the club, culminating in them
              going out of the Champions League against Liverpool on Tuesday. "It's
              been a very difficult period," he says of a run that has also seen
              Wenger's side fall out of contention in the Premier League. "Nobody
              expected us to have such a bad time as this. Manchester United and
              Chelsea had a few bad games at the start of the season and we've had
              our bad period at the crucial point of the league. That has killed us.</p>
              <p>"If
              you have one player off form, it is fine because you can replace him.
              But when it's many players, all at the same time, the team will suffer.
              We are a young team and our squad is quite small. Maybe we've lost
              confidence, too. Everything seems to have affected us and it looks as
              though Eduardo's injury has in particular. The truth is that ever since
              that game, Birmingham away, we have not played well. The team have not
              given 100% and we have bad results."</p>
              <p>The scene in the away
              dressing room at Anfield was particularly emotional. "Everyone had
              their heads down, close to tears. It was very quiet, not a time for
              anyone to be blaming anybody else. I was devastated. I'm so upset and
              disappointed. But we have to come back stronger next year. We need a
              bigger squad, maybe some new players with greater experience, and then
              we'll be OK." And Almunia, one suspects, will not be heartbroken to
              know that the bad-tempered German who has been scoffing about his
              performances all season will not be around to see it.</p>
