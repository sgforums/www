            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal manager pays tribute to Mourinho<br><br><strong>Arsene Wenger has praised the 'quality' of Jose Mourinho and believes his exit from Chelsea is 'sad'.</strong><br><br>The Portuguese left The Blues on Thursday after a break down in his relationship with the club's hierarchy.<br><br>Premier League bosses have been queuing up to pay tribute to Mourinho and Arsenal chief Wenger has offered his verdict.<br><br>"It is basically sad because I feel Mourinho is a manager of quality," Wenger told the club's official website.<br><br>"I am a great believer in technical stability and therefore I don't think it is good news for football."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Respect</span></strong><br><br>On their fractious relationship Wenger added: "We didn't get on the best, but recently it has become better.<br><br>"That does not hide the fact I respected what he did and the quality of his work.<br><br>"Of course he is a great manager. He arrived when Chelsea were on the way up; they had a good side already and he did something more and made them winners.<br><br>"He deserves a lot of credit for that because it is never easy to win and in England it is maybe more difficult."<br><br><strong>Talented coach</strong><br><br>Wenger is also keen to see how Mourinho's replacement Avram Grant fares in the role of Chelsea manager.<br><br>The Frenchman added: "I know him very well from Israel. I have very good relations with Avram.<br><br>"When he was manager of Israel he visited some clubs and he came here through some common connections we had and since we have had very good relations.<br><br>"He is a very talented coach. I don't know if he is just filling in or will take over for the longer term, but we will see what kind of changes he makes."</div>
