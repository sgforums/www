"He knows how to find a key to every player - he is a coach sent by God.<br><br>"I still remember him saying: 'Alexander, I do not just buy any player; I watched you for two years. Everyone finds it hard at first, especially if you come from another country. I am convinced everything will work out.' Those words helped me a lot.<br><br>"I am loving being able to work under him. He supported me through the difficult times early on and carried on believing in me."<br><br>Arsenal's lack of success this season has been put down to their failure to finish chances, a problem Hleb admits he suffers from too.<br><br>However, the former Stuttgart star has vowed to work on his finishing to improve on his tally of three goals next term.<br><br>"It is a problem for me, and it was the same at Stuttgart," Hleb said.<br><br>"Often I get into shooting positions and then hear a team-mate calling for me to pass, maybe I need to be a bit more egotistical at times.<br><br>"It is something I have been working on. In training, the manager often gets me doing special exercise in which I am forced to finish the attack with a shot on goal.<br><br>"I think next season will be better."<br><br>Hleb also expects Arsenal to be much improved next season, as he added: "We are a very young team, but I would not say we are a team for the future - we are a team for now.<br><br>"We have got everything it takes to succeed." </span></div>
