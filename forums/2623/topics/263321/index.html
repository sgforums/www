            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c187/dancush89/high5.jpg"><br><br>Thierry Henry has dismissed fears that Arsenal will implode as a result of his departure, citing Cesc Fabregas' rise in the wake of Patrick Vieira's exit as evidence that life will go on at Emirates Stadium.<br><br>Henry's impending move to Barcelona has seen the doom mongers congregate in North London, with nervous glances now being cast towards the futures of Arsene Wenger and other key players.<br><br>However, departing captain Henry believes talk of Arsenal being a 'crisis club' is well wide of the mark, and that Wenger's men have the necessary quality in their ranks to cope with his departure.<br><br>"The set-up and the facilities are far too good and we still have a lot of the main people who are staying," Henry told the club's official website.<br><br>"As I have said so many times, the team here is growing and there is some amazing talent here and I do think this is the right time for Robin van Persie, Emmanuel Adebayor and Nicklas Bendtner who is coming back from Birmingham, to shine.<br><br>"Hopefully they will do it. As soon as you know they can do it, they will forget about me, that's the way it is.<br><br>"When Patrick left everyone was devastated, including me, and then after that a little guy came around called Cesc Fabregas and, although I didn't agree with it, everyone started saying 'who needs Patrick Vieira?' For me the guys we have here are amazing, but you always need Patrick Vieira.<br><br>"I don't believe what everybody is saying about the club collapsing, having a lack of players and everyone leaving. I think it is untrue.<br><br>"Cesc Fabregas is a world class player, Robin van Persie is a world class player, hopefully Adebayor will become a world class player, Tomas Rosicky is a world class player, Jens Lehmann is a world class player, Toure and Gallas are world class players. You can go through the whole squad like that.<br><br>"As I said to you, I will now become an Arsenal fan and will be looking at every result and I'm sure the team will be successful."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">whatever Henry. But thanks for the encouragement to arsenal fans =.=</span></div>
