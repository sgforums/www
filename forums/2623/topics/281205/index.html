I have the freedom to work how I want to work.<br><br>"I feel we have a way to run things like I love it here. We can employ a director of football as long as he does what I tell him to do."<br><br>Meanwhile, Wenger defended Robin Van PersieÂ’s claims that Arsenal bring a Â‘uniqueÂ’ ethic to football, insisting it was merely a show of confidence Â– not arrogance.<br><br>"Robin did not want to imply any superiority, but he just feels they are happy to play together," the Arsenal manager said.<br><br>"When he said he feels like they are playing on a different planet, he just feels it is easy to play and your confidence is high - they know that can go quickly.<br><br>"It was only two months ago that people were saying we had no chance of finishing in the top four.<br><br>"I had a massive belief in them, but how far they go is down to us. That is the challenge we have in front of us.Â”</div>
