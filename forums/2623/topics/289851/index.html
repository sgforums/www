Could he have stayed inside? He left his goal and didn't get the ball so he'll feel as if he made a mistake.

I didn't want to disturb the side,Â” he added.<br><br>"Until now, he has done very well. I believe in sticking with one goalkeeper.

He failed to make it and the French full back set up a simple second for Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>An injury-time goal from William Gallas saved a point and ArsenalÂ’s blushes. After the game, Wenger refused to cricitise his player but did suggest Almunia himself had not been pleased with the goal.<br><br>Â“He rushed out to block the cross and I feel he was unhappy with his decision-making,Â” said Wenger straight after the game. Â“But, would he have caught the ball? Could he have stayed inside? He left his goal and didn't get his ball so he'll feel as if he made a mistake. I'll have to watch it again.Â”<br><br>But Wenger still has faith in the 30-year-old.<br><br>Â“I believe in sticking with one goalkeeper,Â” he said. Â“You cannot tell him: 'No matter how many mistakes you make, you'll always be my goalkeeper.' But you have to give him at least two games.<br><br>Â“Lehmann was injured and Almunia has done extremely well since then for 10 games on the trot. I didn't want to disturb the side and until now, he has done very well.Â”<br><br>When asked if Lehmann would return for the midweek trip to Slavia Prague, the manager replied: Â“Not at the moment, no.Â”</div>
