I still have ambitions to play regularly."<br><br>Poom, who has won 112 caps, joined the Gunners from Sunderland in August 2005, initially on loan but on a permanent basis from January 2006.<br><br>Poom replaces Ben Foster, who was on loan at Watford from Manchester United.<br><br>The 35-year-old goalkeeper made just two first-team appearances for Arsenal, his Premiership debut for the club being in the last game of the season against Portsmouth.<br><br>But the Estonian coach Jelle Goes was unhappy Poom's first-team opportunities were so limited.<br><br>Poom said: "It's strange because I've played more international games for Estonia than I have for Arsenal.<br><br>"I haven't played regularly for a club for three seasons, because in my last year at Sunderland I had injury problems after having three operations.<br><br>"I want to test myself and I want to play for as long as possible. I haven't set a date on when I'm going to stop playing.<br><br>"I've missed a lot of football over the last few years due to injury and I'm still hungry to play and to improve as a goalkeeper."<br><br>Despite playing just two games for Arsenal, Poom has no regrets over joining the Gunners.<br><br>"I'm still proud to be the first Estonian to have been part of such a big club.<br><br>"I want to thank Arsene Wenger for taking a chance on me after the injury problems I had at Sunderland.<br><br>"I really enjoyed myself, apart from obviously not playing more games."</div>
