              <h1>Fabregas's return to Arsenal energises Wenger</h1>
              <p>LONDON (AFP) — Arsene Wenger believes the return of Cesc Fabregas in
                  Arsenal's 4-0 Champions League rout of FC Twente signals the real start
                  of his side's season.</p>
              <p>Fabregas was badly missed during Arsenal's first three matches as the Spanish midfielder recovered from a hamstring injury.</p>
              <p>The
                  Gunners laboured to a pair of unconvincing victories before slumping to
                  a dismal defeat at Fulham on Saturday, but it took just 66 minutes of
                  Fabregas's elegant influence at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday to
                  restore Wenger's belief that Arsenal can flourish this year.</p>
              <p>With
                  Fabregas pulling the strings in his first competitive appearance since
                  Spain's Euro 2008 final triumph in June, Arsenal were transformed and
                  Steve McClaren's Twente had no answer to their movement and penetration.</p>
              <p>Goals
                  from Samir Nasri, William Gallas, Theo Walcott and Nicklas Bendtner
                  sealed a 6-0 aggregate win in the third qualifying round and booked
                  Arsenal's place in Thursday's group stage draw.</p>
              <p>When Wenger took
                  Fabregas off midway through the second half to save the midfield
                  maestro for Saturday's clash against Newcastle, he departed to a
                  standing ovation and it was the Gunners boss who led the applause.</p>
              <p>"He brings calm and confidence to the side," Wenger said. "Overall we had a good balance with him in the side.</p>
              <p>"He could have stayed on, he was disappointed Twente didn't have a go because he always wants to test himself.</p>
              <p>"I took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury."</p>
              <p>Fabregas
                  is close to the finished article and his new team-mate Nasri already
                  looks like becoming another gem in Wenger's midfield.</p>
              <p>The French
                  winger, who came off with a stomach bug after being sick at half-time,
                  has had no trouble settling in since his pre-season move from Marseille
                  and broke the deadlock with a fine finish in the 27th minute.</p>
              <p>Robin
                  van Persie was the catalyst as he won possession on the edge of the
                  Twente penalty area. His tackle ran to Nasri, who wrong-footed two
                  defenders with a sublime turn before firing in a low shot that took a
                  slight deflection past Nicolay Mihaylov.</p>
              <p>Gallas enjoyed a moment
                  of redemption after his mistake at Fulham when his rampaging run set up
                  Bendtner in the 52nd minute. The forward's shot was blocked by Mihaylov
                  and rebounded for Gallas to slot home.</p>
              <p>Walcott got reward for a
                  menacing display when he exchanged passes with Bendtner and curled a
                  low shot past Mihaylov in the 66th minute.</p>
              <p>Bendtner's close-range strike from Denilson's backheel in the 89th minute capped the rout.</p>
              <p>"It was a big game for us," Wenger said. "We want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage.</p>
              <p>"I felt we were well organised, disciplined and focused. We were never really under threat.</p>
              <p>"I felt the whole team was sharp. Physically we were much better than Saturday.</p>
              <p>"We
                  have been struggling for goals but I was never really worried. It is
                  difficult when you start the season with a Champions League qualifier
                  and an international."</p>
              <p>McClaren admitted Twente caught the
                  backlash from Arsenal's loss at the weekend. "I was here on Tuesday and
                  they were talking about a crisis at Arsenal," he said. "Someone said it
                  was the best time to play them after they lost to Fulham but it was the
                  worst time.</p>
              <p>"Fabregas is a big player. He makes Arsenal tick. Once you see him on the teamsheet it's going to be hard.</p>
              <p>"We played with belief and competed with them in the first leg. We didn't do that here.</p>
              <p>"We
                  are hurt and disappointed. It's not how we expect Twente to play. We
                  must take that anger into Saturday's match when the season starts."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Nothing could go wrong with Fabregas as our CM/playmaker and with eboue in the subs proves that this is a winning formula.</em></p>
              <p><em>No eboue FTW!!!</em></p>
