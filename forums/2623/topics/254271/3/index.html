In the barren, desert formerly known as the Arsenal news round up, we have a rumour, a proper one. Our man ITK has a mate, who actually told the interflap about Denilsons arrival last transfer window, and also called the Baptista transfer before anyone else, so believe what you will.<br><br>We're buying it, any road and he reckons that the same mate, has told him, before the end of next week, we'll be signing Ã�ngel Di MarÃ­a from Argentinean side Rosario Central. Not a lot more than that is known, aside from Gilles Grimando has been in Argentina and has urged Wenger to make a bid. It's expected that Sir Wenger will make a move for the youngster as soon as he's back from his Italian holiday...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal set to scupper Liverpool's Malouda bid<br><br><a href="http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premiership/article2621481.ece" rel="nofollow">http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premiership/article2621481.ece</a><br><br><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics06_07/International/malouda_france.jpg"><br><br>Arsenal are planning to hijack Liverpool's bid to sign Florent Malouda because the France international's move to Anfield has stalled over personal terms.<br><br>Talks are expected to take place as early as tomorrow over a Â€15m (Â£10.2m) move from the French champions Lyon to Arsenal. Malouda, who was on international duty with France last night as they played their European Championship qualifier against Georgia, is then set to take a week's holiday before deciding his future.<br><br>There is also interest in the 26-year-old from Spain and Italy although the likelihood is he will move to England. Liverpool's manager, Rafael Benitez, wanted to make Malouda the first of his major signings this summer and there is a growing frustration from the Spaniard that nothing has been secured. The longer the delay, according to sources close to the player, the greater the chance he may go elsewhere.<br><br>That warning has alerted Arsenal who have now stepped in to register their interest in the left-winger, who was a key member of the French side that reached last year's World Cup final. He was recently voted the players' player of the year in France after helping Lyon to their sixth consecutive league title and scoring 10 goals in 27 league starts.<br><br>Arsenal have decided against a move for the Ajax winger Ryan Babel after considering bidding for the Dutch international in January. Although he would cost less than Malouda, Arsenal's manager, ArsÃ¨ne Wenger is unsure that Babel is of the highest standard. At the same time Arsenal's interest in Franck RibÃ©ry is set to end with the Marseilles winger expected to complete a Â€25m (Â£17m) move to Bayern Munich today. Liverpool, meanwhile, will hope that Marseilles will use some of that cash to sign Djibril CissÃ©permanently.<br><br>If Malouda does arrive at the Emirates Stadium, it will be intriguing to see where he fits into Wenger's plans and what it means for Alexander Hleb and Tomas Rosicky. It also heightens the chances of Fredrik Ljungberg, who has been told he can go, leaving the club on a free transfer. Wenger himself will conduct the negotiations with Malouda if the deal goes ahead and his strong relationship with the out-going Lyon coach GÃ©rard Houllier may be an advantage.<br><br>Despite signing a contract extension until 2011 last summer, Malouda announced several weeks ago that he wanted to leave Lyon with the club's president, Jean-Michel Aulas, setting a deadline of the end of June.<br><br>He wants to avoid the disruption caused at his club when Michael Essien was sold. The Ghanaian moved to Chelsea and their striker Didier Drogba said earlier this week that he would like to see Malouda move to Stamford Bridge. The two played together at the French club Guingamp and remain close friends.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malouda chooses Arsenal, not Liverpool<br><br>By Myles Palmer<br><br>I wasn't ready for this one on a Tuesday night.<br><br>Frankly, I wasn't expecting any Arsenal news this week.<br><br>But I was reminded of a general desire for exciting Arsenal news by a call from a friend which came at 9.45pm as we were watching Andrew Marr's brilliant History of Modern Britain, the third episode about the Seventies - Wilson, Callaghan, Heath, Bowie, Clockwork Orange -  told with great gusto and humour. We adore Andrew Marr.<br><br>So I chatted to my Gooner friend and talked him through what I think is happening, and what I think will happen, and promised that he will be my first call if I hear any interesting news.<br><br>At 10.45 pm I rang him back and we had a remarkably short conversation.<br><br>"That was quick ! Who have we signed?" he said.<br>"Malouda."<br>"What position?"<br>"Left wing."<br><br>THIS SCOOP comes from a very good source. But we shall have to wait and see what happens in the next few days.<br>If it's true, Rosicky will be delighted.<br>Arsenal's left flank can be worked by somebody who knows the job.<br><br>IT' WOULD BE NATURAL for Malouda to prefer Arsenal to Liverpool, as he knows Henry and Gallas very well. He also knows Vieira, Wiltord and Anelka, so he knows a lot about Arsene Wenger and how the manager operates.<br><br>Without Pires and Reyes, Wenger has needed a left winger. Like Reyes, Malouda is left footed but he is a totally, totally different player, a rugged, reliable, workmanlike grafter with a solid all-round game. Not an eye-catching flank man. A serious footballer but, for me, more of a midfielder than a winger. A very good signing if it happens. Because he is different to what Arsenal have now. He is not at all like Hleb, Rosicky or Walcott.<br><br>FLORENT MALOUDA is five foot eleven and has been at Lyon for four years. He will be 27 next week. He has 28 caps and three goals.<br><br><strong>Wow if this is true,it'll be great but however i watched malouda on youtube vid..he's not those winger that loves crossing but instead get into the box to shoot.</strong></div>

It's so outlandish that nobody is else picking this up. In all the possible scenarios out there, I would say Anelka returning to the Gunners is one of the craziest. Can you really see Wenger going back to the well to bring back a guy known more for his sulking than his skill?<br><br>Of course, this will probably come true just so they can throw it in my laughing face... Oh, and Thierry Henry is still a Gunner as of right now. And so is Jose Antonio Reyes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Thierry Henry has admitted he is off to Barcelona, because of uncertainty over Arsene Wenger's future. "I still must pass a medical on Monday but yes, I have chosen Barcelona," said Henry. "I will be 31 at the end of next season and I cannot take the chance to be at Arsenal without Arsene Wenger and David Dein. But I will miss the Arsenal fans dearly, they have supported me through thick and thin."
