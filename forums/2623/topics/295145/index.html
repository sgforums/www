            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenalpies.tv/FabClichy.JPG"><br><br>Gael Clichy hailed Arsenal's brilliant victory at Aston Villa as the strongest proof yet that his side can go on to win the title this season.<br><br>The Premier League leaders extended the gap at the top to five points following Saturday's 2-1 win over in-form Villa and, even if Manchester United win at Fulham tonight, Arsene Wenger's team will go six points clear if they win their game in hand at Newcastle on Wednesday.<br><br>"Those three points are really important," said Clichy. "It was a great result away from home and against a team who have been playing well. We were 1-0 down but once again we came back and showed great spirit.<br><br>"I think we showed we have the desire to make something this year and like the boss says we have quality and great strength in the team so we have to carry on like this because I think we can make something happen.<br><br>"We know that if we win against Newcastle we can make the gap even bigger so that's why it [the Villa win] was even more important."<br><br>At the weekend, Arsenal were without Cesc Fabregas for the first time in the league this season, as well as long-term absentee Robin van Persie, but their first-half display, featuring superb goals from the outstanding Mathieu Flamini and Emmanuel Adebayor, was their most scintillating this season.<br><br>Clichy warned Arsenal's title rivals they will be even more dazzling when those creative beacons return.<br><br>"We are looking forward to seeing Robin and Cesc again because with them it is even better but, even though we miss them both, the squad has enough quality to cope.<br><br>"It is a bit too early in the season to talk about being champions. We still have plenty of games to play. This week is a big week for us. We have to take game after game and I think we can do something but let's think about Newcastle first and we will see about the rest.<br><br>"I don't know if it will be a psychological blow to extend the lead but we know we can do it. I think we can get three points up there but Newcastle are a tough side to beat away. It is important to stay focused now."<br><br>The Frenchman says he is not surprised by Arsenal's remarkable run this season.<br><br>"Of course being top of the league is a great pleasure but since the first day in pre-season I told you that the team had plenty of quality and the spirit and Arsenal were ready for this season.<br><br>"Now we are in December and we have shown that week in, week out."<br><br>Despite the consistency of Arsenal's performances, Adebayor says it is premature to suggest they can go through the season unbeaten for the second time in five years.<br><br>He said: "I know people are starting to say already that we can go unbeaten but I know the most important thing is keep on doing a good job and keep on playing our football.<br><br>"Three or four months ago there were people saying 'we are not sure Arsenal are going to finish in the top four', and now they are mentioning we could go unbeaten for the season.<br><br>"The most important thing is to focus on our job. We don't care what people are saying. It is good that people are talking good things about the club and we are very happy about those things. The crucial thing is to keep our head on our shoulders, keep on doing a good job, keep on performing and at the end of the season we can talk about being unbeaten or not."</div>
