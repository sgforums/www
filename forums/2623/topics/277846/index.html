            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger expects an announcement on his contract extension on 'Thursday or Friday'.</strong><br><br>The Frenchman's current contract expires at the end of the 2007/2008 season and talks about an extension have been ongoing for several weeks.<br><br>Wenger had previously hinted that he will sign but it now looks inevitable that he will put pen-to-paper.<br><br>The tactician revealed that he feels he has a 'responsibility' to the team he has helped nurture and develop during his 11 years at the club.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motivated</span></strong><br><br>"Am I still motivated to go on at Arsenal? Yes absolutely. I am very motivated," Wenger told RMC radio.<br><br>"With all the young players I signed, I feel a kind of responsibility.<br><br>"I am in talks with Arsenal. I can't see any drawback to extend. There will be some news on Thursday or Friday."<br><br>Arsenal have enjoyed an unbeaten start to the season and some pundits are putting this down to the sale of Thierry Henry, which many believe has allowed the younger players to take on more responsibility.<br><br><strong>Young team</strong><br><br>"We had a nice start to the season. We still have our technical game, and we have a young team, that has got a little more experience," Wenger said.<br><br>"We lost the star of our club, Thierry Henry, so it has changed something indeed.<br><br>"But you know may be it has pushed the youngsters to take on more responsibilities.<br><br>"It is a little early to take stock after three matches at home. Our real challenges will be away from home against the big teams.<br><br>"I believe the Premier League title will be set during the direct oppositions among the biggest teams - Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool."</div>
