            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Arsene Wenger has admitted making a mistake in playing Freddie Ljungberg against Tottenham, after the Sweden captain was forced off with an injury in the first half of the 2-2 draw at White Hart Lane.</strong><br><br>However, the Gunners chief is backing Ljungberg to recapture his best form for the club if he can shake off the persistent run of injuries that have dogged his campaign.<br><br>The midfielder was a doubt for Saturday's North London derby due to a hamstring problem and duly appeared to aggravate the injury before he was substituted on 39 minutes.<br><br>Wenger has taken the blame for the latest fitness problem to befall the two-time Premiership winner after admitting that Ljungberg was short of fitness.<br><br>"I felt a bit guilty on Saturday because he just had one day training and I pushed him in. I feel I made a mistake," Wenger told the club's official website.<br><br>Ljungberg's form has suffered as a result of his persistent fitness problems, but Wenger is backing the Sweden skipper to return to his best if he can stay injury free.<br><br>West Ham were linked with a move for Ljungberg in January but Wenger appeared to rule out the possibility of a summer exit for Arsenal's longest serving player.<br><br>"He can be the player he was if he is injury-free," Wenger added. "He has a contract of two years and so normally he would be here."<br><br>Ljungberg's replacement on Saturday was Cesc Fabregas, and the talented Catalan midfielder helped transform the game with two assists despite struggling with a virus during the week.<br><br>The derby clash was also Fabregas's 150th appearance for The Gunners at the tender age of 19, and Wenger expects that the former Barcelona prodigy will develop strength to complement his style in the coming two years.<br><br>"Defensively he can get much better," Wenger said of Fabregas, who came second in the PFA Young Player of the Year award on Sunday night.<br><br>"Physically there is still an injection of power to come between 20 and 22. When that comes in, you become a finished man." </span></div>
