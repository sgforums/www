            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ARSENE WENGER has warned he will soon be terrorising the Premier League with a team of ENGLISH superkids.</strong><br><br>ArsenalÂ’s boss is often criticised for sticking with foreign players.<br><br>But he is increasingly confident a new generation of Emirates stars will come mainly from this country.<br><br>Wenger is on the verge of wrapping up a deal for Luke Freeman Â— a 15-year-old striker who has already played for GillinghamÂ’s first team.<br><br>English kids Kieran Gibbs, Mark Randall and Henri Lansbury have appeared in ArsenalÂ’s Carling Cup side this term Â— and Wenger insists this is only the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>The Gunners chief, preparing for todayÂ’s home clash with Birmingham, said: Â“We have top-class English youngsters at this club. We have two players under 14 and technically they have nothing to learn.<br><br>Â“From 14 to 20, we have a good level. It is the best group of English players since I have been here.<br><br>Â“Our target is to produce good players. It would be special if they are English and I hope it could be a legacy.<br><br>Â“Hopefully, some of them will be in the first-team squad next season. I would love to field an English Carling Cup team.<br><br>Â“I know how much the English national team means to people and I would love to contribute.Â”<br><br>Wenger Â— who once paid Notts County Â£2million for 15-year-old Jermaine Pennant Â— is excited at landing Freeman who also had trials at Newcastle, West Ham and Reading.<br><br>The initial fee is around Â£500,000. Gills chairman Paul Scally admitted: Â“Arsenal have been impeccable in their dealings over this Â— a lot of clubs could learn from them on how to conduct transfer business.Â”<br><br>Wenger added: Â“I wanted to buy English! We are positive about that.<br><br>Â“We want players as young as possible. If you are not on the case someone else will be. It is a competitive world.<br><br>Â“When good players come out, you know you are not on your own Â— you are competing with five clubs.<br><br>Â“Ideally, we would wait one or two more years but you cannot wait. Of course, the younger you sign players the margin of error becomes bigger.<br><br>Â“Sometimes you see a player at 13 and think Â‘Wow, he will be a brilliant playerÂ’ but then two years later he has disappeared.<br><br>Â“I have met the boy we hope to sign. He has a good personality, he is a striker and at 15 to play for the first team is already something special.Â”</div>
