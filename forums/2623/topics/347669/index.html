              <p>The 25-year-old was jeered off the pitch by his own
              supporters during a game to forget against Wigan at Emirates Stadium in
              early December.</p>
              <p>The fans' reaction that day has not stopped
              manager Arsene Wenger from picking Eboue with the Ivory Coast
              international playing in all but one of Arsenal's games since.</p>
              <p>Eboue
              admits that the fans' decision to boo him was hard to take but he has
              moved on with a little help from a number of Gunners followers.</p>
              <p>"I feel very well with the fans," he told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"It was very disappointing a few months ago because they boo me so it was disappointing.</p>
              <p>"So now I feel very, very well with them because they send me messages, they send me letters to say sorry.</p>
              <p>"I
              now feel very well when I play. I say thank you to my friends. They
              gave me a ring after the game to say forget that and think about the
              next game.</p>
              <p>"At the time it was difficult for me to forget but now I feel very, very well."</p>
