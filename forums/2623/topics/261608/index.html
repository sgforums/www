            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.aquadesign.be/im/news/images/img-2702.jpg"><br><br>PATRICK VIEIRA has issued a stark warning to Arsenal about the effects of two months of upheaval at the club.<br><br>And he admitted he is concerned there could be confusion among the players over the shock departure of vice-chairman David Dein and the long-term futures of manager Arsene Wenger and striker Thierry Henry.<br><br>Former Arsenal captain Vieira said: "It is a difficult time for Arsenal because the players need to know what's going to happen."<br>Advertisement<br>Click here to find out more!<br><br>Wenger's immediate shock at the exit of Dein in April has now been replaced by frustration and he has refused to commit himself beyond the year he has left on his contract at The Emirates. Wenger and Dein worked closely together on transfers and contracts and there is no doubt the manager feels a void has been left with his close friend no longer at the club.<br><br>And the link between star striker Henry and Barcelona grows stronger. The Catalan giants are ready to splash out Â£15million to build one of the most lethal spearheads in world football with Henry lining up alongside Samuel Eto'o and Ronaldinho at the Nou Camp.<br><br>Vieira is in no doubt the current uncertainty was provoked by the exit of Dein, who was thought by the rest of the board to have held detailed but unsanctioned talks with American billionaire Stan Kroenke about a potential takeover and was told to quit.<br><br>Vieira spent nine years - "the best of my footballing life so far" - at Arsenal and succeeded Tony Adams as captain. He retains an enormous affection for the club and has been to see them many times in their new Â£350m stadium.<br><br>But he fears the uncertainty currently surrounding the club could have a knock-on effect among the players, saying: "Arsenal are going through a difficult period - so many things have happened in the last few years."<br><br>Speaking in his homeland of Senegal, where he is monitoring the development of the Diambars Academy he set up four years ago to help youngsters in the former French colony in West Africa, he added: "It is a crucial time for Arsenal. David Dein has left and, whether you like him or not, he has been a fantastic servant for the club."<br><br>Vieira called the partnership between Dein and Wenger "the strong base" on which the Arsenal success story has been built over the last decade.<br><br>"One has gone now so the base is not as strong as it used to be," he said. "There are quality players there, young quality players. But all the speculation affects the team, there is no doubt about that. It concerns the players because they know Arsene signed them with David Dein.<br><br>"With him gone the players are asking what Arsene is going to do. Maybe if he goes they may say, 'I don't want to stay'. There are so many questions going round in the heads of the players.<br><br>"Players need to know who's going to be the manager, which players are coming and which are going. The next few months will be very important for Arsenal."<br><br>Vieira, who has just celebrated a league triumph in Italy with Inter Milan, said the talk of Henry's possible departure may well have had an impact. "The speculation doesn't help, When you know Arsene has one more year on his contract, that David Dein is not there any more, then of course you ask yourself what is going to happen.<br><br>"If Arsenal do lose Thierry Henry it will be a big blow for the club and for the players who stay there. But whatever is the best decision for Thierry, I'm sure he will take it."</div>
