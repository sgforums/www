            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Arsene Wenger has played down suggestions that persistent talk of a possible takeover could distract Arsenal from their efforts to clinch fourth place in the Premiership.</strong><br><br>The Gunners have seen American businessman Stan Kroenke increase his stake in the club to just over 11 per cent in the past week after snapping up ITV's shares and a small percentage of director Danny Fiszman's stake.<br><br>Rumours that the club could be the subject of a Malcolm Glazer style takeover have grown as a result, but Wenger believes the current board have no intention of selling up.<br><br>Furthermore, the French boss is confident that speculation of change at the highest level will not disrupt the team ahead of Saturday's crucial meeting with Bolton.<br><br>"I think the club and the board is resolute to keep control of the club, that's what I know and I can not tell you more than that," Wenger told the website.<br><br>"The chairman has said two things; one is he does not really know the intentions of this guy and two is that he is determined to keep the club under control with the board he has.<br><br>"That means 10 per cent of shares have moved from one pocket to another, but that does not change the life inside the club nor would it affect the area where decisions are taken."<br><br>The Gunners are currently just two points ahead of Bolton with a game in hand, and a fourth Premiership defeat in five games on Saturday would cast further scrutiny on the club's claims for a UEFA Champions League place.<br><br>Wenger admits finishing fourth is the very least the club expect, even if competition at the top end of the table is becoming more intense.<br><br>"It is the minimum target we want to reach at the start of every season, and it will be like that every year," Wenger added.<br><br>"You want to be in the Champions League again and to win it next year you have to be in. We want to be there and nobody else so I do not worry about what will happen if they get in.<br><br>"In England, you have the potential of 10 massive clubs and they will not always be asleep.<br><br>"To smash in and compete in the top four, you will now have Aston Villa, Newcastle, Tottenham. They are all big clubs with the same potential as Arsenal.<br><br>"Bolton? I do not know whether they have the same potential fans as, say, Newcastle. If Newcastle have a good team, they would get 60,000 people every week." </span></div>
