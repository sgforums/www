            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>William Gallas has admitted his frustration with how his first season for Arsenal has panned out, although the French defender insists he has no desire to leave Emirates Stadium.</strong><br><br>Gallas was prised from Chelsea last summer as Ashley Cole made his acrimonious exit from North London, but the French international has not enjoyed the same success to which he became accustomed with The Blues.<br><br>Arsene Wenger's side failed to mount a Premiership title bid, whilst cup success also eluded them for a second season in succession despite reaching the Carling Cup final.<br><br>During his time at Stamford Bridge, Gallas played a key role in back-to-back titles under Jose Mourinho, and the defender admits he was disappointed to finish his first season at Arsenal empty-handed.<br><br>"It has not gone as I would like, as any of us would like," said Gallas in The Times.<br><br>"Arsenal should be looking to do more than qualify for the Champions League. We should be winning trophies. That is why I came here."<br><br>Arsenal's struggles have led to speculation that Gallas could seek pastures new after just one year - with Real Madrid mooted as a potential destination - but the player insists he has no desire to quit Emirates Stadium.<br><br>"I am staying unless anyone tells me different," Gallas underlined.<br><br>Having swapped the industry of Chelsea for the artistry of Arsenal, the defender admits he has also been frustrated by his new team-mates' tendency to over-elaborate in front of goal.<br><br>Indeed, Gallas believes The Gunners can learn something from his former club's efficiency in the final third.<br><br>"We need to take our chances, to be ruthless," Gallas added.<br><br>"Sometimes we do play it around the penalty area too much. You can say that, in one respect, maybe we do need to be more like Chelsea." </span></div>
