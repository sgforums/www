We didnÂ’t play all that well but to steal the winner at the end was a great feeling.<br><br>Â“Everyone was buzzing after that. Fulham was a big game as well Â— another late win!<br><br>Â“The fact that they came close together made it even better.<br><br>Â“Sometimes those games where you win it late on are the best because youÂ’re not expecting it.<br><br>Â“But one result that stands out in my mind is losing to Arsenal at home in September. We went on a brilliant run of wins after that.Â”<br><br>That defeat came early enough in the season for people to start writing off Rooney and Co.<br><br>But that was enough to enforce UnitedÂ’s steely resolve.<br><br>Roo said: Â“We lost and everyone was saying Â‘The Reds are going to stumble after thisÂ’ but we kept on going and we were unbeaten until December in the league.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s one of the best things about this team, weÂ’re defiant after a defeat. We know we canÂ’t afford to let it affect us.<br><br>Â“That comes from the togetherness of the team. We always bounce back after a loss.Â”<br><br>Rooney finished on 23 goals in all competitions at the top of the United goalscoring charts Â— the same as Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>But he was happy to stand aside and allow the Portuguese superstar to pick up both the Player of the Year and the Young Player of the Year at the PFA awards.<br><br>But the United ace also paid tribute to Chelsea hotshot Didier Drogba and Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas.<br><br>Rooney added: Â“RonaldoÂ’s awards were fully deserved. I picked Drogba Â— we werenÂ’t allowed to pick team-mates.<br><br>Â“But he has been brilliant, as has Fabregas, who got my vote for Young Player of the Year.Â”<br><br>Rooney is on holiday but will undoubtedly have an ear open tomorrow when the fixtures for next season are announced.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Next year we will do a double against man yoo again rooney. But hope that we will lift the trophy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></div>
