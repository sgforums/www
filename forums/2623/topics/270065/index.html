            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Freddie Ljungberg has questioned Arsenal's ambition after leaving the club for West Ham.</strong><br><br>The Swede, who was the club's longest serving player prior to his move to Upton Park, felt the time was right to move on after nine years in North London.<br><br>Ljungberg admitted the departure of Thierry Henry played a part in his decision to leave and he also questioned the club's failure to match his own ambitions by bringing in new players.<br><br>"Two years ago when I signed my last contract we talked a lot about the future and about bringing great players to the club," said Ljungberg. "Despite building the new stadium we wanted to stay top in England and do well in Europe.<br><br>"For me that didn't really happen.<br><br>"I stayed because I wanted to stay loyal to Arsenal. But when Henry left this summer it felt like the end for me unfortunately.<br><br>"I felt like all the unbeaten players (from Arsenal's 'invincibles' of 2003/04) had left. I wanted to be loyal but I felt like it was the right time.<br><br>Despite his doubts over Arsenal's plans for the future, Ljungberg admitted it was a wrench to leave the club.<br><br>"I've been there for nine years, almost 10 years," continued Ljungberg.<br><br>"It's a big thing for me and I feel it in my heart a little bit.<br><br>"When I spoke to the boss, he wanted me to stay.<br><br>"But at the same time, I feel it had to be something very, very special for me to leave.<br><br>"I want to go forward and, with the people I have around me, I think it's going to be really good."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*The decline of Ljungberg*<br><br>The news that long-serving Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg has left the club to move to West Ham United was not unexpected but it will be a sad day nonetheless for many Gunners fans.</strong><br><br>The Swedish international had racked up nine seasons under the tutelage of Arsene Wenger but leaves just a year before he would have been due a testimonial.<br><br>But perhaps it was the perfect time for Ljungberg to depart, before his reputation at the North London club had became permanently sullied, for the past two campaigns have rarely seen him hit the heights that were once his trademark.<br><br>Indeed, in his final two terms at Arsenal, Ljungberg scored only one goal, a paltry return from a player who twice racked double figures in a single season.<br><br>Interestingly, Ljungberg's shooting accuracy never fell below 50% in his time at Arsenal but the goals simply dried up in his latter years.<br><br>2006-07 also saw him fail to create a Premiership goal for the first time since his debut campaign.<br><br>Ljungberg also managed a mere 18 games last season, only one more than Thierry Henry, another Gunners deserter this summer.<br><br>And while Henry will plan to add to his glittering reputation at Barcelona, the feeling persists that Ljungberg has used his fabled sense of timing to make his move at exactly the right moment.</div>
