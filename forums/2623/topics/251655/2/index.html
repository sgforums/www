            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Blues back in the mix - Le Tissier</strong><br><br>I don't think I'm alone in being surprised by the week Chelsea have had.<br><br>I expected them to beat Bolton and Liverpool, yet here they are with two bad results in the space of four days and suddenly the quadruple is a million miles away. And I don't think the Carling Cup and even the FA Cup, will be enough return for the money they have spent.<br><br>But, as bad as the week has been, I do think it can end on a high.<br><br>I expect United to drop points at Manchester City and because I have to stick by that, I think that will be just the lift Chelsea need to pick themselves up and beat Arsenal.<br><br>They will need to be a bit bolder than they were at Anfield though. Just one goal would have made all the difference and I do think that, although it is hard to criticise Jose Mourinho, I think perhaps they paid for their cautious approach.<br><br>Ricardo Carvalho was a huge loss, but with Khalid Bhoularouz fit enough for the bench, you can't help but wonder if he would have been a better replacement.<br><br>Moving Michael Essien back not only deprives them of a great midfielder, but also takes so much away from them going forward.<br><br>At least they have no other option here to go for the win. There will be more question marks against Mourinho - and let's face it, they've got the perfect excuse to get rid of him if they don't win here - but Chelsea have to forget those past two games.<br><br>The rumours about Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack's operation and the consequent fall-out from that did not help and it all has been far from rosy at Stamford Bridge all season, but they cannot afford to let that affect them here.<br><br>Arsenal still have that third place and one less Champions League qualifying round to aim for, so they will come forward, so we should be in for a fairly open game between two very good sides.<br><br>The Gunners will not be overly keen on gift-wrapping the title for Manchester United, but they won't be overly-disappointed about taking it away from Chelsea either.<br><br>But that third place is all they are interested in. They should come at Chelsea and set a high tempo as they like to do and as we've seen before, the two styles can make for a decent game.<br><br>Arsenal though, will need to take their chances. Although they got the win in the end against Fulham, they left it late and had to work hard for it, again through not taking their chances.<br><br>Their back four is looking a little more steady these days and William Gallas looks better with every game. But even he will not be able to stop his old team-mates taking the title race at least one game further.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">All text was said by former England midfielder, Matt Le Tissier..</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Chelsea make the short trip across the capital on Sunday to play Arsenal, aware that should they fail to match Manchester United's result on Saturday at Eastlands, then the title will be returning north.</strong><br><br>Jose Mourinho has reigned supreme since arriving in England in guiding Chelsea to back-to-back titles in his first two seasons at Stamford Bridge, but it now looks as though the old master at Old Trafford has got one over the cocksure pupil.<br><br>In any season there is a defining weekend and while Chelsea are far from waving the white flag, United's win at Everton last week, in coming back from two down, does look as though it will be a massive three points for Sir Alex Ferguson's side.<br><br>Following their European elimination in midweek to Liverpool, when allied to dropping points at Bolton in their last Premiership outing, the mood in Chelsea's dressing room is likely to be one of despondence and Mourinho will have to dig deep in his managerial bag of tricks to lift his players.<br><br>Andrei Shevchenko's absence at Anfield, somewhat predictably, manifest plenty of mischievous column inches as Chelsea offered a groin injury as explanation, but it is expected he could figure at Arsenal, meaning Salomon Kalou may drop to the bench.<br><br>Chelsea were also without Ricardo Carvalho on Tuesday night, courtesy of a knee injury, which means Michael Essien will continue to deputise alongside John Terry at the heart of their back four.<br><br>While Chelsea's mood will be one of apprehension and determination, Arsenal prepare for an end of season clash which matters little, given they have already qualified for the UEFA Champions League and have long since kissed goodbye to hopes of a title bid of their own.<br><br>The overriding sentiment at Emirates Stadium will be one of disappointment, when reflecting on the season as a whole, but Arsene Wenger will be eager for a strong finish and no quarter will be given.<br><br>Arsenal are without long-term absentees Thierry Henry, Robin van Persie and Theo Walcott, who have been joined in the treatment room this week by Freddie Ljungberg - who has been ruled out with a hamstring - along with Tomas Rosicky, rated at no more than 50/50.<br><br>Should Chelsea fail to win on their sojourn in North London then United will all but certainly wrap up the title, but if Manchester City do Chelsea a favour, then the title race could very much be back on come the final whistle. </span></div>
