But local bragging rights still mean so much to Arsenal supporters and Van Persie is well aware of it.<br><br>"When I see the fans in the street, they tell me that the Tottenham game is the one they want us to win," he told Arsenal.com.<br><br>"It means so much for these people, whether they are at the training ground, or when I am out shopping. It doesn't matter where, everyone speaks about this game. It means a lot.<br><br>"You can sense there is a special atmosphere. It is similar to the games against Chelsea and Manchester United in terms of atmosphere and that's what I like the most.<br><br>"I just love to play those games when the fans are on top of it, they are loving it and every single piece of action in the game gets the fans involved. It's great to be a part of it."<br><br>Van Persie has played in six North London derbies but, somewhat surprisingly, has yet to register a goal against Tottenham. He'd love to address that at the weekend but knows that Saturday's fixture is just the latest in a long line of huge games for Arsenal.<br><br>"I know it is a big game for the fans and it is for us as well. But there are big games every week - last weekend it was Chelsea and we were very happy because we played well. Spurs is massive but we have to win every game in the Premier League, not just against Spurs, if we want to be champions."</div>

Otherwise Arsenal have a clean bill of health before the visit of Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime, a very different situation to the many questions marks that were hanging over the squad ahead of the Chelsea game last Sunday.<br><br>Â“The injury news is quite good compared to last week,Â” ArsÃ¨ne Wenger told Arsenal TV Online on Thursday afternoon. Â“The only one who is problematic is Theo Walcott. He is not fit to practice. He has had flu and has not recovered completely. Everybody else is available.Â”<br><br>Therefore Emmanuel Eboue is fit despite being stretchered off against Avram GrantÂ’s side.<br><br>Arsenal TV Online subscribers will be able to see the full pre-match interview on Friday. In it Wenger talks about Juande RamosÂ’ revolution at Spurs, fansÂ’ behaviour, the importance of this derby, the performance at Blackburn, EduardoÂ’s finishing and Alex SongÂ’s defending, why Chelsea was the key win of the season and William GallasÂ’ goal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ramos: I don't fear Arsenal</strong><br><br>Juande Ramos is unlikely to be scared by anything in tomorrow's north London derby after his most terrifying moment in football.<br><br>The Tottenham boss was knocked unconscious when a fan threw a bottle filled with cement at his head when in charge of Sevilla in their cup derby with Real Betis last March.<br><br>Ramos was out cold for 11 minutes, had to be carried off the pitch and there were horrific scenes as paramedics frantically tried to revive him.<br><br>The incident happened nine months ago and, although he cannot remember much about it, Ramos is unlikely to feel intimidated by facing Spurs' bitter rivals Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.<br>Advertisement<br>Click here to find out more!<br><br>"I was knocked out but I want to forget that now. Somebody threw something at me, it hit me on the head and knocked me out," recalled Ramos.<br><br>"I don't expect it to ever happen again, not this weekend or next weekend. I hope it never happens again on a football pitch. The following week I was absolutely fine. The match was heated but I never could imagine something like that could happen. I don't remember anything after being struck, nor what happened on the pitch."<br><br>Ramos is used to fierce rivalries from his days in charge of Sevilla, but in north London the fixture has suffered in recent years due to the Gunners' dominance.<br><br>Tottenham have not beaten Arsenal for eight years. And Arsene Wenger's success has only turned up the pressure on Spurs bosses. Glenn Hoddle, Jacques Santini and Martin Jol have all paid the price for failing to break the Gunners' domination.<br><br>Ramos is the latest in a long line charged with stepping out of Wenger's shadow and bringing some silverware to White Hart Lane. But that task does not frighten Ramos even though he knows his progress so far, after two months at the helm, will be gauged by how his team fare against their neighbours.<br><br>"I don't understand the correlation between the problems previous managers have had here and the success of Arsenal," said Ramos.<br><br>"We cannot worry about what other teams are doing, we need to focus on ourselves.<br><br>"There's a big difference in the league table at the moment, but we are not as far behind as we were before. Little by little we will close that gap and that will come by getting results.<br><br>"We know it's a number of years since we beat Arsenal, but we have to try our best to get the right result.<br><br>"Arsenal play good football, are very attractive to watch and are the leaders.<br><br>"We are playing very effectively at the moment in terms of what we need to get results. We are playing well, more positively and are improving, which shows in the results. "I don't think it's a psychological barrier at all.<br><br>Arsenal have a great team with a big squad and that is the reason, but whoever is the best and most powerful team on the day will win."<br><br>Ramos believes he is introducing the attacking flair football that Tottenham fans want and brought him so much success at Sevilla.<br><br>He added: "I don't like to compare ourselves with Arsenal and myself with Arsene Wenger, even though I congratulate him for the job he has done.<br><br>"In the last few games we are showing we are getting to grips with the style we want here. At Sevilla I had a way of playing with a certain type of player so we would like to create that again. But the most important thing is results and getting points."<br><br>Ramos has yet to fully master English, although he says neither he nor new England boss Fabio Capello - who he regards as a close friend - will be held back by the language barrier.<br><br>Although he reckons it also has its advantages, saying: "I can't understand a word fans are saying!"</div>
