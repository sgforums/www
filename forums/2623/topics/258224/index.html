But we are confident he will stay.<br><br>"We need to be patient. It is fingers crossed but I have talked to him and I think he will stay."<br><br>Gilberto is relishing tonight's friendly, and facing David Beckham - even if he was surprised he was dropped in the first place. He added: "I was not surprised when he was recalled, but I was surprised when he was left out because he is a great player.<br><br>"It's good for the England team to have him back because from what I have seen he appears to be the leader of the team.<br><br>"Some people have criticised England players for not playing their best but the match against us is a chance for them to prove them wrong.<br><br>"England have some players whose style I really like, especially Steven Gerrard. Others need time to adjust." Brazil boss Dunga, with six wins and a draw from his first eight games in charge, has picked an allstar team, with the line-up including Barcelona star Ronaldinho.<br><br>Ronaldinho said: "Wembley is a historical temple of football and to be the first national team that wins there will be very emotive.<br><br>"For me if we win in London it will be a little revenge because this season with Barca we lost to Chelsea and Liverpool, and the Champions League was a dream for me. To win with Brazil will give me some pleasure."<br><br><strong>i hope the talk with gilberto will inspire henry to stay with the gunners till the end of time!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yea. Henry is a kind of player where he is good in playmaking, finishing, creating spaces and passing. So even he turn old, when he lose the X factor in speed, he still can be a playmaker. Hes a invaluable asset to Arsenal, Wenger make de right decision pls</div>
