We want him to give key passes and score goals - and I am convinced he will."<br><br>Wenger also expanded on his decision to hand William Gallas the captaincy when many others expected Gilberto Silva to be given the role - including the Brazilian midfielder himself.<br><br>"William means he has to be an example everywhere, not only on the pitch - but off the pitch as well and he is right," said Wenger.<br><br>"I was pleased with his attitude and the way he took on his role. I expected him to do that.<br><br>"Overall the important thing is that the team has that type of unity and togetherness and desire.<br><br>"I think the captain is an important position - but it is not as important as the team spirit."<br><br>And team spirit, according to Wenger is very high - despite reports that Gilberto was upset that he only learned he would not be captain via the Arsenal website.<br><br>Wenger added: "I respect Gilberto a lot. I had a face-to-face meeting with him and told him what I wanted to tell him. "<br><br>"I cannot justify every small decision, and explain it to everybody. You make a decision because you just want to make the right one."<br><br>And Wenger revealed that Arsenal's come-from-behind win against Fulham on Sunday has further enhanced the togetherness of the squad.<br><br>"I learnt what I knew before from the preparation - that we had great unity and desire and a great hunger as well," said Wenger.<br><br>"This came out in the game because we won a match that we certainly would not have won last year."<br><br></div>
