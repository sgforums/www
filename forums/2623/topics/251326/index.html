            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"><strong>As of 27 April 2007</strong></span><br><br><strong>Tomas Rosicky</strong><br><br>Tomas Rosicky will miss the visit of Fulham on Sunday because of a hamstring injury. The Czech picked up the injury during the 2-2 draw at Tottenham but might return to face Chelsea on May 6.<br><br><strong>Freddie Ljungberg</strong><br><br>Freddie Ljungberg suffered a hamstring injury during the 2-2 draw at Tottenham and will miss the Fulham game. He is also unlikely to feature against Chelsea on May 6. "I don't think Freddie will be available [for Chelsea]," said ArsÃ¨ne Wenger. "It is a recurrence, so you have to be a bit more careful. It is not a big [problem]. But he has pain where he had it before so he will be out for a few games."<br><br><strong>Robin van Persie</strong><br><br>ArsÃ¨ne Wenger has admitted that Robin van Persie is unlikely to play again this season. Before the international break, the Arsenal manager suggested his Dutch striker could be back for the final few games of the campaign. However it appears his broken metatarsal would benefit from complete rest until pre-season training. Wenger believes there is no point in risking Van Persie. Â“It is likely he will be out for the season," he said. We have spoken to the doctors and they told us that the longer you keep this kind of fracture without playing the less chance you have of a recurrence. So if he can play only one or two games then we will not take a gamble.Â”<br><br><strong>Theo Walcott</strong><br><br>The nagging shoulder injury that has ended Theo WalcottÂ’s season has also blighted his campaign according to ArsÃ¨ne Wenger. The winger has gone under the surgeonÂ’s scalpel to correct a troubling shoulder problem. Â“Until he had his shoulder injury he was very promising,Â” said Wenger following the defeat at Everton. Â“After he had his shoulder injury he was 50 per cent of what he was before. You could see that today. He is on for 10 minutes and his shoulder pops out. You cannot play football like that.Â”<br><br><strong>Thierry Henry</strong><br><br>Thierry Henry will not play for Arsenal again this season. The French striker damaged groin and stomach muscles against PSV Eindhoven in March and, as a consequence, will miss three months of domestic and international football."Thierry Henry will be out for a minimum of three months,Â” said ArsÃ¨ne Wenger on March 9. Â“Unfortunately this means he will now miss the rest of this season both domestically and internationally, but we are confident that he will be ready for the start of next season."</span></div>

It means the Arsenal manager may pair Julio Baptista and the returning Freddie Ljungberg up front. Elsewhere Gilberto and Jens Lehmann will be rested.</strong></span><br><br>Â“Rosicky is out, Aliadiere is out and Flamini is out,Â” said Wenger. Â“Adebayor is a doubt with a groin problem but Ljungberg is available.<br><br>Â“I will rest Gilberto because of some niggles and I will rest Jens Lehmann because I want to play Almunia in the last game.  Apart from that everybody is available.Â”<br><br>When asked about his front pairing he replied: Â“Baptista should play and maybe with Ljungberg.Â”</span></div>
