              <p>in the coming 2008/2009 season, which area should we strengthen and who should we buy?</p>
              <p>forthseeing that we will end up empty handed again this season :'(<br>i think arsene must really buy a world class striker and don't keep buying cheap bargain youngsters for the attack dept. we must and need a experienced and clinical finisher in front of goal. this has been the reason for the last few matches (if only henry has been around, i believed we will have a very good chance of landing the EPL and CL crowns).. this adebayor simply cannot make it.. and the brazilian-croatian also too young, needs more exposure too. maybe van persie can make it, as i like his touch and finishing last season but too bad he is too prone to injuries.</p>
              <p>for the midfield, we just need to add in one more central midfielder for cover (for this old gilberto), and keeps all the current crop of players. that should be good enough. ebobe should be revert back to defence (as cover for sagna).</p>
              <p>for the defence, we need to really beef up this dept. we need a really good and commanding central defender. i think gallas is not his usual coomanding self anymore (like what he is at chelsea), and this sendoros simply is too slow and clumsy and i always panicked when i see him having the ball. he is responsible for the goals conceded at liverpool.<br>toure need to have a really good parther in defence so that he will be at his best again. right side defence should be okay and we need a left side defender to cover clincy.</p>
              <p>and the last, we need a good and commanding goalkeeper too. ditch the alumunia, i dont believe he can be no 1 for arsenal. there are times that i feel the goals conceded can be saved if david seaman is around (probably lehman can prevent them) but this alumunia is really not good enough for a team like arsenal. dont know why arsene always like to play him. he should at least give lehman a chance.</p>
              <p>so.. arsene pls go out there in the transfer market and start breaking the bank to buy the best players for arsenal..</p>
              <p>anyone pls recommend your views and also some players for the new season.. :)</p>

              <p>we need a international goalkeeper, wingers to replace pires n central defenders who can play extremely well in marking.</p>
              <p>guess it might be a boost we sign a star striker like Villa. n some quality back up players in case our players injure.</p>
              <p>so far only Clichy, Sagna, Fabregas and Flamini (if he remain) position r untouchable. maybe Walcott can upgrade to striker given his rising occasion.</p>

              <p>u mean from some monkey forum? dat zocoss seems to having interests in arsenal more than his manure. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/04/240/Football_Premier_League_Arsenal_Liverpool_Nic_769154.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></p>
              <p> <span><strong><em>Arsene Wenger is reportedly determined to 'stick to his principles' and will resist calls to make significant additions to his current squad at Arsenal in the summer despite their recent collapse.</em></strong></span></p>
              <div>
              <p><em> According to The Times, Wenger is 'adamant that his young players have the talent and the temperament to win leading trophies and will give many of them the chance to do so next season.' Despite being offered a £35m transfer budget by the club's board, Wenger is set to only make a few tweaks to his squad and will stubbornly resist the temptation to make a 'big-name signing.'</em></p>
              <p><em> Although Wenger has reportedly acknowledged the need to sign an 'an experienced defender' - possibly at the expense of either Philippe Senderos or Johan Djourou - The Times says that 'he is likely to focus his efforts on securing the best of the upcoming generation, with Hatem Ben Arfa, the 20-year-old Lyons winger, a top target.'</em></p>
              <p><em> The general inexperience of the current Arsenal squad has been cited as a salient factor in their Premiership decline and exit from the Champions League. With an average age of around 23, it is the youngest of the Big Four. However, with its two elder statesmen, Gilberto Silva and Jens Lehmann, both bound to depart in the summer, the probability is that Arsenal's squad will be even more youthful next season. Having already insisted that he plans to give more games to the likes of Theo Walcott and Nicklas Bendtner in 2008/09, Wenger is also understood to be planning to solve the Gunners' obvious deficiency on the flanks by recalling Carlos Vela and Fran Merida from their current loan spells in Spain.</em></p>

              <p>Walcott's getting better, look at his assists, definitely for the future. Wenger should buy Neuer, Quaresma since porto in danger of getting relegated and of course Ben Arfa.i don't think we should sell Gilberto, he can act as a backup in case Flamini is tired or out. in defence, we should get someone like Vidic from Man U.</p>
              <p>Sell Senderos!!ITS A MUST!</p>

              <p>problem wif wenger is if the club have lack of ambition, chance is next time arsenal club might becoming a Gurang Guni club for Barcelona, RM or Milan to buy our players.</p>
              <p>i kinda disappointed wif wenger when he did not find any replacement for Henry n Pires.</p>
