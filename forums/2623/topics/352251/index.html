              <p>The Czech Republic international has not played for
              the Gunners since January last year due to a problem with his hamstring
              tendon.</p>
              <p>After initially struggling to diagnose the injury it was
              then thought that the midfielder would be back in time for the start of
              this season.</p>
              <p>Since then several comebacks have been pencilled in
              only for the 28-year-old's hamstring to flare up as soon as the
              training regime was stepped up.</p>
              <p>But a return to action in the next few weeks was thought to be a real possibility, with talk of a reserve game mooted.</p>
              <h4>Sidelined</h4>
              <p>But all of that has now been quashed with the former Dortmund playmaker facing at least another two weeks on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>"Tomas has had a little set-back of one week so he will be out for two weeks again," manager Arsene Wenger told the <em>club's official website</em>.</p>
              <p>"We have to be more patient than in the start. I told you two weeks ago that he would be back in full training but he will not.</p>
              <p>"He'll be back in full training in two weeks time now."</p>

              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Long-term absentee Tomas Rosicky has revealed that he is not worried about his latest injury setback. </strong></p>
              <p>The Arsenal midfielder has been out of action for over
              a year with a hamstring tendon injury and after numerous failed
              comebacks still finds himself sidelined.</p>
              <p>This time, after manager
              Arsene Wenger had confirmed that the Czech Republic ace would return to
              first team training in two weeks, a groin injury has delayed his latest
              comeback by an extra week.</p>
              <p>Despite yet more disappointment for
              the 28-year-old he insists that he has not been perturbed and declares
              he feels almost back to normal.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to jinx it, but it seems that my football life is getting back to normal," he told his own website.</p>
              <h4>Nothing serious</h4>
              <p>"Had
              the groin problem not occurred, and the groin injury is nothing
              serious, I would have most likely been already training with the first
              team.</p>
              <p>"The most important thing is that the place where I have the cursed hamstring is okay and endures the training sessions."</p>
              <p>The
              groin injury is likely to rule Rosicky out of the upcoming
              international matches but he appears to be over the worst of an injury
              which forced him to question whether he would ever play again.</p>
              <p>"I can't wait to start playing and the stress which made me feel low in the past is now gone," he added.</p>
              <p>"During the injury I was having various thoughts in my mind. For instance, that I would never play football again.</p>
              <p>"Fortunately
              with the return to a normal football routine with training sessions, in
              which I have constantly been doing improvements, the stress has gone
              away.</p>
              <p>"The groin is not a thing which should prevent me from returning and I feel safe."</p>
