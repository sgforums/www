              <p>Joey Barton made his
              unceremonious return to football last Saturday, taking to the field for
              the final few minutes of a 3-0 flattening at the hands of Arsenal,
              booed by the entirety of the Emirates Stadium. His first act upon
              taking the field was a heavy and potentially dangerous tackle on Samir
              Nasri, and despite winning the ball, the manner in which he dove in and
              goaded the Frenchman thereafter was not to come without consequence.<br><br>Moments
              later, in an off the ball incident, Nasri tripped Barton and, having
              not been seen by the referee, escaped punishment. It was as if the
              former Marseille man was making a statement that he would not be
              bullied in the Premier League, and despite taking a barrage of
              criticism from Kevin Keegan, who tried to bring the player to the club,
              he has also made himself a few friends for giving Barton, a renowned
              thug, a taste of his own medicine.<br><br>It is by now known across the
              country and beyond just what Joey Barton has become during his
              footballing career. The midfielder has been hit with various assault
              charges - most infamously on former Manchester City team-mate Ousmane
              Dabo - for which he recently served a prison sentence. He has since had
              his Nike sponsorship revoked and was on the verge of leaving St James'
              Park only for Keegan, in one of his final acts as manager before
              quitting the club for a second time, pleaded for him to stay and to be
              supported.<br><br>He has been hit with a 12-game ban by the Football
              Association, six of which are suspended. Therefore, a recently
              convicted criminal will face only double the initial punishment faced
              for a two-footed tackle. Arsenal captain William Gallas, who leapt to
              Nasri's defence upon the final whistle last Saturday, believes the ban
              should have been far more severe. “In my opinion [the ban] is not long
              enough, especially when you think about his attack on Ousmane Dabo and
              everything he has done besides,” the Arsenal captain told the <em>Sunday Express</em>. "I don't understand The Football Association."<br><br>Gallas,
              himself something of a hate figure for his notorious bad attitude, then
              made a controversial remark of his own, contending that Barton deserved
              being tripped by Nasri in light of his various misdemeanours. Keegan
              rightly contended in his post-match press conference that when
              considering the referee's assistant had seen the challenge from the
              touchline, it was his duty to flag and for Nasri to be shown a red card.<br><strong><br>The
              Gunners' skipper, with unashamed bias against Barton, felt differently.
              "The moment Barton came on to the pitch [against Arsenal] he made a bad
              challenge on Samir Nasri," he said, continuing, "Samir responded with
              an act that maybe wasn't especially nice. But bearing in mind the
              player he did it to, then fair enough."</strong></p>
