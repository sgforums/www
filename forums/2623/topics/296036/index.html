Then there are players like Nicklas Bendtner and Theo Walcott, who have come on and are knocking at the door."<br><br>Gunners captain William Gallas insists his team-mates have the stomach for a sustained title challenge.<br><br>"When a manager is under pressure, they ask the players to fight during 90 minutes," he said.<br><br>"I think Newcastle is a good example [for Middlesbrough] because the players didn't want to lose the game. They played for themselves and for the manager.<br><br>"We will be tired - but we can find the power to be ready for 90 minutes.<br><br>"The best thing is to win every game. We have to come back from there with a victory. It is important for the future."<br><br></div>
