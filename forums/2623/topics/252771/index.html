            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger can 'understand the pain' felt by Chelsea following their exit from the Champions League - but has no intentions of showing the Blues much sympathy at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.<br><br>It has been a difficult week for the Blues, who saw their hopes of retaining the Premiership title dented as Manchester United opened up a five-point gap at the top before they then suffered Champions League semi-final heartache at Liverpool.<br><br>While Wenger's men have certainly not been consistent this season, the Arsenal manager takes no sense of satisfaction from the misfortunes of other teams.<br><br>He said: 'Of course I feel sorry for Chelsea. The players are players and you understand that no matter how much rich a club is, you understand how painful it is to go out as a player or a coach. You respect that.'<br><br>Although the Gunners could effectively end the Blues' title challenge on Sunday, Wenger insists proving their own worth is the only motivation his players need.<br><br>'For us, it is a chance to beat them,' he said. 'We just want to win our games and to show we are ready for next season to fight at the top.<br><br>'It will be a good opportunity to do that on Sunday, to show how good we can be next season.'<br><br>Chelsea beat Arsenal in the Carling Cup final which was marred by a mass brawl and resulted in players from both sides being suspended as well as Â£100,000 fines for the clubs.<br><br>Wenger, though, maintains Sunday will not be about exacting revenge.<br><br>He added: 'Our desire is to beat them. If we played Manchester United, then it would be exactly the same.'<br><br>Wenger feels Ashley Cole may not feature against his old club on Sunday.<br><br>The England left-back moved from Arsenal on the closing day of the August transfer window, with William Gallas heading in the opposite direction.<br><br>The circumstances of the switch, however, left a sour taste for many Gunners fans.<br><br>Wenger would prefer to remember the part Cole, 26, played in their successes.<br><br>'Ashley Cole is a winner and can raise his game in the big games. When you had to perform, he was always there and was a big-game player,' said the Gunners boss.<br><br>'I want us to respect Ashley Cole for what he has done for the club. I do not want the fans to boo him, but you cannot expect anything in football.'<br><br>Chelsea have reached the FA Cup final, but could well end the campaign with only victory at the Millennium Stadium to show for all their endeavours - not to mention investment in the team.<br><br>Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry belittled Chelsea's achievements this season following their Champions League exit at the hands of the Reds, claiming 'when you have invested Â£500million it is a fantastic season to win the League Cup.'<br><br>Wenger, though, maintained: 'That is disrespectful. They will have money now Liverpool and it does not mean they will win everything. It makes headlines, but it is not really football.'<br></div>
