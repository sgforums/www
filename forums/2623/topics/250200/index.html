At the moment I am doing both jobs - the one that David Dein used to do and my own.<br><br>"I was in a good position before because I would handle the football side and David would do the ugly stuff, the business.<br><br>"Now it is all down to me. It is difficult because that side of it is very time-consuming."<br><br>The Arsenal boss has also performed a U-turn on his thoughts for potential foreign investment into the club.<br><br>In the wake of American investor Stan Kroenke increasing his stake in The Gunners on Friday, Wenger was quoted as querying the trend of foreign investment in Premiership clubs.<br><br>"I'm not against foreign ownership of clubs. How could I be?" added Wenger.<br><br>"I am a foreign manager and there are many foreign players at Arsenal and in the Premiership.<br><br>"But it has to be done in the right way. If it happens at Arsenal it would not mean I'd quit the club."</span></div>
