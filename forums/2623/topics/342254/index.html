              <p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will look for "experience" and "spark" if he bolsters his squad in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>The Gunners currently sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League table after a disappointing start to the season, with most critics saying Wenger must strengthen if the club are to pull themselves back into the title race.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman has previously been coy over his plans to spend but has now indicated he will look to add to his squad to compensate for the long-term injuries to Cesc Fabregas, Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky.</p>
              <p>"The transfer window opens (on Thursday) and, although we are not close to signing anyone at the moment, if we do buy I think what we need is maybe someone with a bit of experience," Wenger wrote in his programme notes ahead of the 1-0 victory over Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>"We already have many young players so, if we buy, it will be somebody who is ready to play straight away. A loan deal could also be a possibility.</p>
              <p>"Cesc is a long way from playing again, so are Tomas Rosicky and Theo Walcott, and these are three creative players that we count on at the start of the season. So what we might need is someone who can create a little spark."</p>
              <p>Zenit St Petersburg star Andrei Arshavin has been mooted as a target, but Wenger has refused to divulge the names of his potential recruitments.</p>
              <p>"I don't need to announce a name," Wenger said with a smile when asked by the French television channel <em>Canal Plus </em>about Arshavin.</p>
              <p>"Because when you do that there is 50 per cent less chance of making the signing. But I need a creative midfielder and eventually another midfielder, because we are short."</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Andrei Arshavin's agent insists his client remains a New Year transfer target for Arsenal. </strong></p>
              <p>The Russian playmaker, currently on the books of Zenit
              St Petersburg, has been told that he is free to move on during the
              January transfer window, should a suitable approach for his services be
              lodged.</p>
              <p>His availability has alerted a number of Europe's top
              clubs, with the 27-year-old widely regarded as one of the continent's
              most prodigious talents.</p>
              <p>Tottenham, Arsenal, Real Madrid and
              Barcelona have all been linked with the midfielder, and are unlikely to
              be put off by a reported £12million price tag.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger has
              already confirmed that he is in the market for creativity, with the
              Gunners keen to find cover for the injured Cesc Fabregas.</p>
              <h4>Interest</h4>
              <p>With
              North London now rumoured to be Arshavin's most likely destination, his
              agent has confirmed that Arsenal remain a viable option.</p>
              <p>"We know that Arsene Wenger likes the look of Arshavin," Dennis Lachter said in the <em>Daily Mirror</em>.</p>
              <p>"But I like the look of Angelina Jolie and it doesn't always mean you get what you want.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal were interested in signing him last summer and they still are, so we will wait and see what happens.</p>
              <p>"There has been a lot of interest in him this time as well from England, Spain and Italy."</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Andrei Arshavin's agent has indicated that his client would be willing to buy out his contract at Zenit St Petersburg. </strong></p>
              <p>The Russian playmaker is growing increasingly frustrated with the ongoing saga surrounding his future.</p>
              <p>He
              has made no secret of his desire to secure a move away from his
              homeland during the January transfer window, but has so far failed to
              secure such a switch.</p>
              <p>Premier League giants Arsenal are believed
              to be leading the chase for his signature, but Zenit's ever-increasing
              demands continue to delay any potential agreement.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately in this matter there is no movement," Arshavin's agent Dennis Lachter told the Russia press.</p>
              <p>"The sticking point is, of course, money and rather the totally unacceptable amount of Zenit's demands for Andrei.</p>
              <p>"The position of the club remains unchanged and that is the reality that we have faced for a long time.</p>
              <p>"If
              the situation remains unchanged we will use Article 17 of the Fifa
              rules and buy out the contract of Andrei at the club, which could
              happen as early as November this year.</p>
              <h4>Free agent</h4>
              <p>"In
              that situation, Zenit would have to be satisfied with a much smaller
              amount than they are offered by representatives of Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"If Andrei becomes a free agent, he will get many proposals, from England, Italy and Spain."</p>
              <p>Arsenal
              are reported to have tabled a £12million pound offer for Arshavin, but
              Zenit believe their prized asset is worth more than that in the current
              market.</p>
              <p>"The situation has not changed since Friday, which means
              Arsenal would like to pay only £12m, not one cent more," said Zenit's
              general director Maxim Mitrofanov.</p>
              <p>"And we, at Zenit, are ready to discuss with them about maybe a better offer from our side.</p>
              <p>"We are ready to make a step forward to them, but they should do the same.</p>
              <p>"However, I have told the people from Arsenal we are ready to discuss a lot of things to make the situation easier for them.</p>
              <p>"They
              have a deadline, as I understand, until 26th January, because after
              that, they should have some time to get another player and I respect
              this position."</p>

              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Zenit St Petersburg
              have issued an ultimatum to Arsenal to conclude a deal for playmaker
              Andrei Arshavin on Saturday, or risk missing out on him entirely. </strong></p>
              <p>Reports suggest talks between the clubs have broken down over the transfer fee to be paid to the Russian club.</p>
              <p>The
              Gunners have reportedly offered a package totalling £15million, of
              which £12million would be paid up front, with a further £3million to be
              added in bonuses, appearance fees and other conditions.</p>
              <p>But the
              St Petersburg club are still angling for an increase in the transfer
              fee, and are now pushing to conclude the deal on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"If Arsenal don't accept our terms, then Arshavin will not be sold to them," Zenit general director Maksim Mitrofanov told <em>Sport Express</em>.</p>
              <p>"In any case this will be resolved by Saturday evening."</p>
              <h4>Other interest</h4>
              <p>Mitrofanov also revealed interest in Arshavin from other Premier League clubs.</p>
              <p>"Arshavin may still end up in England," he said.</p>
              <p>"Several other clubs are interested in him, who haven't yet issued an official approach, but who are ready to do so."</p>
              <p>Arshavin
              added: "I can only wait and see how the situation resolves itself. I
              know about Arsenal's offer and the £12+3million plan, and I consider
              that according to the current state of the market to be more than
              adequate.</p>
              <p>"But clearly I am not the one who will make the decision."</p>

              <p class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p>Arsenal remain hopeful of completing the dramatic signing of Russian playmaker Andrei Arshavin after a frenetic day of negotiations in north London. But they will have to wait until the morning to wait to see if they can add the Russian to their squad.</p>
              <p>GettyImages</p>
              <p>Arshavin: Still waiting.<br>The 27-year-old's proposed move missed the 5pm transfer deadline and though Arsenal remain confident that the player is theirs, they will have to wait until Tuesday morning for the Premier League to confirm that the deal can go through via their ratification process.</p>
              <p>"Tomorrow we will find out for sure if it's gone through," said Dennis Lachter to the BBC. Weather conditions meant Premier League staff who had headed home were not able to return and the deal could not be completed. Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger and Arsenal remained confident they would have positive news on the signing of a player to fill the role and the number 13 shirt vacated by Alexander Hleb when he joined Barcelona last year.</p>
              <p>If Arshavin does become a Gunner, it is likely to cost manager Arsene Wenger around £15m - a club record. Russian radio has said that Zenit St Petersburg will receive an initial £12.5m.</p>
              <p>The transfer looked likely to proceed in a relatively straightforward fashion when the Zenit St Petersburg midfielder was pictured in Hertfordshire this morning, having flown into the country on Sunday.</p>
              <p>That appeared to be a signal that Arsene Wenger's interest in the player was about to yield results, but sources close to the deal then revealed that Arshavin was on his way back to a London airport and the transfer was on the brink of collapse.</p>
              <p>But negotiations continued behind the scenes - with the asking price, personal terms and a possible payment from Arshavin to Zenit all mooted as potential sticking points - and a final deal may still be struck.</p>
              <p>Zenit, though, look to be readying themselves for life without their star attraction and have finalised the capture of Hungarian midfielder Szabolcs Huszti.</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Andrey Arshavin has
              officially completed his transfer from Zenit St Petersburg to Arsenal,
              signing a three-and-a-half-year deal with the Gunners. </strong></p>
              <p>The Russia international passed a medical and agreed
              personal terms with Arsenal on Monday, but the switch to Emirates
              Stadium was not sealed until the day after the deadline, following
              delayed ratification from the Premier League.</p>
              <p>The move follows a
              hugely protracted saga which included lengthy negotiations between the
              Gunners and Zenit over the attacker's fee, with the Uefa Cup holders
              pushing for a lump sum of £15million.</p>
              <p>Arshavin and Zenit were
              also in talks over a final payment that threatened to scupper the move,
              but the deal has now been rubber-stamped after the matter was resolved
              and the paperwork finalised on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>A statement on the club's <em>official website</em> read: "Arsenal Football Club is delighted to announce that Russian
              international midfielder Andrey Arshavin has joined the Gunners from
              Zenit St Petersburg on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee."</p>
              <h4>Happy</h4>
              <p>And Arshavin told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "I am happy to be here. I became a Gunner some time ago and I'm happy now. I will do my best."</p>
              <p>It
              had been hoped the talented schemer could make his Arsenal debut
              against bitter North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, live on
              <em>Sky Sports 1 &amp; HD1</em>, as the club seek to break back into the top four.</p>
              <p>But Arsenal's new No.23 cast some doubt over whether he will be ready to be thrown into Premier League action so swiftly.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "I must be ready by Friday or Saturday, but I am not fit now. It
              will be decided by Arsene (Wenger) if I can play or not."</p>
              <p>Arshavin admitted the protracted deal had been a testing time, but he was happy the saga had finally been concluded.</p>
              <p>He added: "It was very hard days for me, but now it doesn't matter, now I am a Gunner, that is what is important."</p>
