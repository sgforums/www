Â“I know that Arsene was maybe interested but there were perhaps some people on the board who couldnÂ’t accept how I left in the first place. But at the same time they bought me for Â£500,000 and sold me for Â£22m, they paid for a new training ground from that and all the rest.<br><br>Â“When I had to leave I left but they did very well in terms of money. If they canÂ’t accept that . . . I didnÂ’t want any money and thanks to me they got lots of money. I donÂ’t know why theyÂ’re being like that.Â”<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Le sulk......</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted from Timeonline by Martin Samuel:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nicolas Anelka losing waiting game</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Nicolas Anelka is waiting for a big club. Nicolas Anelka is always waiting for a big club. He was waiting for a big club when he was at Arsenal, he was waiting for a big club when he was at Liverpool. He was probably waiting for a big club when he was at Real Madrid.<br><br>Â“I know all the players who are at Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Barcelona,Â” he says. Â“I know I am at their level.Â” Except he is not; he is at Bolton Wanderers because, in the end, he ran out of big clubs and only small ones would take him.<br><br>And Anelka is so completely in a class of his own in Sammy LeeÂ’s team that it seems only a matter of time before he adds to the Â£68 million or so that has been spent on him over the past decade, but this time he is being made to wait. Each of the four elite Barclays Premier League clubs had a need for a striker this summer and none beat a path to AnelkaÂ’s door.<br><br>It does not help that he had been around the block with two of them already Â– Arsenal, the club he left in poisonous circumstances in 1999, and Liverpool, where a loan move did not evolve into a permanent transfer three years later. Chelsea could do with a foil to take the weight from Didier Drogba and, Lord knows, United have been crying out for a prolific goalscorer since Louis Saha went lame. Anelka was mentioned, but at the Reebok Stadium he remains.<br><br>He will be wealthy and his frequent-flyer miles are to be envied but, really, what a waste. At 28, Anelka reviews his career and seems mystified at the bad blood and rancour, but there have been too many confrontations, too many sulks and ill-tempered exits for it to be coincidence. His appearance record for France, just 41 caps, tells another fractious tale.<br><br>He must know something has gone wrong because his list of employers displays a steady downward progression: Arsenal, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool at the start, more recently Manchester City, FenerbahÃ§e and Bolton. Even his five Premier League goals this season have not been enough to stem BoltonÂ’s decline under Lee. This is a player who should be defining key matches in the Champions League or the title race; instead, Bolton have lost on three of the occasions on which Anelka has scored, the limited performances of his teammates rendering his talents redundant.<br><br>He claims that managers such as Sam Allardyce and ArsÃ¨ne Wenger have no problems with him, yet Allardyce moved on to bigger things at Newcastle United and Anelka was left behind.<br><br>As for Wenger, there were suggestions in the summer that he wanted to take Anelka back to Arsenal but his board, mindful of the bad feeling when he left for Madrid, would have none of it. A case of those Anelka met on the way up ensuring he remains on the way down.<br><br>Â“I would have scored twice as many goals in a bigger team, at a bigger club,Â” Anelka insists. Yet he was with bigger teams, he was at bigger clubs. He blew them off and now they have done the same to him. Anelka is too good for Bolton, but that is his problem; he was always too good for everybody. </span></div>
