              <h1>Lehmann set to make farewell home appearance</h1>
              
              <p>The 38-year-old is in line to retain the goalkeeper's jersey with
                  regular number one Manuel Almunia still struggling to overcome a wrist
                  problem which ruled him out of the defeat at Manchester United last
                  weekend, which effectively ended the Gunners' slim title hopes.</p>
              <p>Lehmann performed admirably at Old Trafford, even though he was unable
                  to do much about United's goals, which came from a penalty by Cristiano
                  Ronaldo and a superb free-kick over the wall from Owen Hargreaves.</p>
              <p>Even though the outspoken German - who turned down the chance to move
                  to former club Borussia Dortmund in January - has not mixed his words
                  over team selection, branding Arsenal's Champions League exit to
                  Liverpool 'a disaster' as he watched from the bench once again at
                  Anfield, manager Arsene Wenger insists their disagreements are 'always
                  full of respect'.</p>
              <p>Lehmann - who has made more than 180 appearances since signing from
                  Dortmund in July 2003, but only 11 this season - is on stand-by to keep
                  goal for what could be the final time at Emirates Stadium against
                  Reading on Saturday, with Arsenal's last home game scheduled for May 4.</p>
              <p>Wenger confirmed Almunia will undergo a late fitness test ahead of the visit of the relegation-battling Royals.</p>
              <p>'Maybe Manuel Almunia will be available, I don't know,' Wenger told
                  Arsenal's official website. 'I will make a decision on Friday morning.
                  He got injured in training on the Friday before Manchester.</p>
              <p>'We sent him for a scan and there was an inflammation so he could not play.'</p>
              <p>Arsenal, whose season has unravelled over the past six weeks, will
                  again be without midfielder Mathieu Flamini and full-back Bacary Sagna
                  this weekend as both men continue to recover from ankle problems.</p>
              <p>Justin Hoyte is out of contention after suffering a slight hamstring
                  injury when playing for the reserves, but Brazil youngster Denilson is
                  now available following a similar worry.</p>
              <p>Wenger, meanwhile, has not yet confirmed whether winger Tomas Rosicky
                  has, as according to the player's own official website, returned to the
                  Czech Republic in a bid to be fit again from a troublesome knee problem
                  for this summer's European Championships.</p>
              <p>Reports have also suggested striker Eduardo da Silva has now been
                  allowed to return to Brazil to continue his rehabilitation following
                  his horrific broken leg at Birmingham, which proved to be the turning
                  point in Arsenal's season.</p>
