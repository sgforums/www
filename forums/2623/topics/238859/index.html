            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has spoken of his frustration at his lack of action recently.<br><br>The German international has been rested for Arsenal in the Carling Cup and FA Cup this season.<br><br>Lehmann has played in only five of Arsenal's 12 games so far this year with Manuel Almunia getting a chance in the domestic cup competitions.<br><br>The 37-year-old, who is hoping to earn a new long-term deal at Arsenal, is not happy that he is not playing on a regular basis.<br><br>When asked if Arsenal's mounting fixture congestion was taking its toll on the squad, Lehmann said: "I don't know. Ask the other players. I don't play twice a week.<br><br>"For me the break between games is probably too long but we have this rubbish system in England with all the cup games and you have to go with that."<br><br>Meanwhile, Almunia is looking forward to this weekend's Carling Cup final with Chelsea and is determined to fight for the number one shirt at Arsenal with Arsene Wenger saying he has been impressed by the Spaniard this term.<br><br>"Like everyone, I am happy when I am playing and upset when I am back on the bench," said Almunia.<br><br>"I get on fine with Jens. We respect each other and there is no problem between us. But the only person who helps me to improve is the goalkeeping coach Gerry Peyton.<br><br>"I am glad to hear that because I know the boss is very happy with my performances. The most important thing for me right now is the Carling Cup final and I am very excited about that.<br><br>"This game is my finest moment in England and am very proud for all the young players and for myself as well.<br><br>"This match will show how strong Arsenal's future can be. We have many young players who have had great games for the club this season and I think they can do the same in the Carling Cup final this weekend.<br><br>"The so-called 'second' team is playing fantastic and many people are now asking why this team doesn't play in the Premiership and the Champions League as well.<br><br>"That is something for the boss to decide but sooner or later these young players will be big stars."</div>
