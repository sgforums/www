            <div class='col-md body'>the match is very disappointing n boring. our boys seem to be having off-day after xmas. in fact it is the worst performance considering the fact we have all our 1st-team playing.<br><br>fabregas is one of guilty one who kept passing ball to opponents. n our boys seem to be scare of scoring dat they keep passing the ball to one another??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> even though portsmouth players play defensive in the box the whole time, our boys should try aiming for goals outside the box rite? dun have to pass the ball everytime to ade especially he sux.<br><br>n this ade seem disappearing the whole time... where is his usual self when he chase the ball from opponents? he should quit football if arsenal lose BPL becos of him!<br><br>the result prove fatal for us as now we r chasing instead of leading. hopefully this will wake the boys up for being complacent.<br><br>wenger need to buy a star striker tis coming january. ade simply too ordinary n dun seem to be the type scoring goals, plus RVP is too injury-prone, somemore now our midfielders seem to be goal-shy too.</div>
