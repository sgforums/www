Selecting in form players and dropping off form players sounds pretty natural to me dun u think? Adebayor will still get his chance when he shows that he is in form while being a substitute...After all depriving an in form bendtner is just unfair to him, and dropping adebayor will allow him to reflect on his mistakes more...just a practical suggestion, i dun hate adebayor just think he isnt performing up to standard</div>
