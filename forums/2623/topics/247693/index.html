This has been a real dissapointing season for me and from the looks of things, securing 4th spot is going to be be real fight.<br><br>i really hope Arsenal stays strong.

            <div class='col-md body'>Arse shld get the fourth spot - no doubts.  They have enough talent &amp; experience to see themselves there.<br><br>the problem i think its because the youngster still have not the time playing together and gelling.  Many of them are thrown into the cauldron with the injuries to RVP and Thierry Henry and what nots.<br><br>Reyes is coming back but he is not happy at Arsenal and Batispta is not faring well in Emirates.  Its suay for Arsenal in a way because almost all their strike force is decimated - the likes of Theo.<br><br>But their midfielder is still quite formidable and like the matches before, they created tons of chances but fail to put away any.  They are relying on Adebayor now but he is not the kind to deliver day in day out, he needs a foil and there is currently none.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>arsenal's stink starts when they keep holding draw wif minor clubs wif minor competition cup matches, it costs them to play more matches n increase injuries among their players.<br><br>rite now they have no more cup worries, but still kena by biasness of englisg pig referees' judgment.<br><br>another factor is the lack of confidence among the young players. they perform well but luck are not on their side. tis cost the morale of the players to be low...</div>
