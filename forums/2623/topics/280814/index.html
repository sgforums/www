            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/Images/f/flamini_0708sevilla.jpg"><br><br>t's quite conceivable that Mathieu Flamini could have lined up against Arsenal this season.<br><br>The French midfielder was close to a move away from Emirates Stadium in the summer but, after a heart-to-heart with ArsÃ¨ne Wenger, decided to stay and fight for his first-team place.<br><br>Flamini has risen to the challenge. Handed a starting berth while Gilberto recuperated after the Copa America, the 22-year-old has been an unsung hero in Arsenal's flying start to the season. Far from lingering on the fringes, Flamini is now a central part of Wenger's plans.<br><br>After another high-octane performance against Sevilla on Wednesday night, Flamini spoke with the air of a man who knows he made the right choice when he mulled over whether to stay or go.<br><br>"It's true I was close to leaving because I didnÂ’t play enough so I spoke to the coach and we had a good discussion," he said.<br><br>"Now IÂ’m here, IÂ’m very happy to be here and weÂ’re playing great football. The boss told me he had confidence in me and I said, Â‘Alright, I am going to stay and IÂ’ll prove that I can play'.<br><br>"I think I am doing an important job because I have to win the ball and stay in front of the defence. I am trying to do the maximum for players like Cesc [Fabregas] and Alex Hleb and Tomas Rosicky.<br><br>"This season Cesc is a bit more free, playing a little bit higher than me and so he has more chances to score and more chances to give some passes and I think that is important. The more I play the more it gives me confidence."<br><br>It's easy to understand why Flamini suspected his future lay away from Emirates Stadium. Wenger has an embarrassment of riches in central midfield with Fabregas, Gilberto, Denilson, Abou Diaby and Alex Song all vying for a first-team spot when the season kicked off.<br><br>Lassana Diarra's arrival on transfer deadline day has further intensified the competition for places. Nonetheless, Flamini's versatility - he is well equipped to cover in either full-back position - gives him an important edge. He certainly relishes the challenge.<br><br>"Arsenal is a big club with high ambitions so the competition is here but it will make you better," said Flamini.<br><br>"Sometimes I have to move, like last time when I played right back. It is important to teach players to play everywhere. For example, Michael Essien at Chelsea is asked to play right back and he plays there.<br><br>"I like to play in midfield because itÂ’s my natural position and I always enjoy to play there. But when I have to play for the team at right back I am trying to do my best.<br><br>"At the moment I am playing every game so I will go one game by one game and see what happens. If I am picked to play I play, if not itÂ’s not a problem. The boss makes the decision and I respect his decision."<br><br>On current form, it will be hard for Wenger to leave Flamini out.</div>
