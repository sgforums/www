How can it be anything else?Â”<br><br>The French star added: Â“As I have said many times, at the moment I am an Arsenal player.<br><br>Â“But everyone knows that a lot of stuff has happened at the club recently that wasnÂ’t supposed to happen.<br><br>Â“In terms of the departure of Mr Dein, the bosses have been unsettled and a lot of players at the club have been unsettled.<br><br>Â“So the only thing I can tell you is right now I am an Arsenal player but I cannot deny itÂ’s nice to hear about Milan.Â”<br><br>Henry, 29, appeared to commit the rest of his career to Arsenal last year when he signed a new four-year contract worth Â£110,000-a-week.<br><br>But his future does not look so certain after vice-chairman Dein was forced out in a boardroom power struggle in April.<br><br>Henry confessed: Â“I was devastated when Mr Dein left the club. I donÂ’t know what happened and I donÂ’t want to know. But whatever went on, Mr Dein leaving was not a clever move.<br><br>Â“Although no one is bigger than the club, Arsene Wenger and Mr Dein are really close to being Arsenal.<br><br>Â“They are the two people who come really close to saying that.<br><br>Â“Everybody who knows Mr Dein understands that the guy loves football.<br><br>Â“He knew everybody at the stadium, the name of everyone Â— whether you play for the youth team or clean the dressing room.<br><br>Â“He is the type of guy who used to turn up to watch the reserves or the Under-17 team whether it was raining, snowing or windy.<br><br>Â“He would be there on his own at the training ground.<br><br>Â“So if you ask me if there was one person on the board I would not like to see leaving, I would have said Mr Dein.<br><br>Â“Unfortunately it is out of my hands. I donÂ’t agree with what has happened but sometimes thatÂ’s the way things are. We just have to move on.Â”<br><br>Henry added that last seasonÂ’s move to the Emirates Stadium has affected ArsenalÂ’s ability to challenge for major honours.<br><br>After two years without a trophy, many Arsenal fans fear their club are falling behind their big-spending rivals Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool.<br><br>And yesterday WengerÂ’s hopes of signing Franck Ribery were finally scuppered when the Marseille winger opted to join German giants Bayern Munich.<br><br>The Arsenal chief was hopelessly outbid as the French side held out for a Â£23million deal.<br><br>Henry said: Â“Everyone knows all our resources went into building the new stadium. Maybe if we didnÂ’t have a new stadium then we would have had more players and maybe done better.<br><br>Â“That is why I would like to give credit to some of the youngsters at Arsenal. The potential is definitely there so letÂ’s hope we can put it all together and bring back some more silverware.<br><br>Â“Manchester United didnÂ’t win the League for three years and finally they did it. You have to keep going.Â”<br><br><strong>Henry has said umpteen times he's gonna stay. But why all this rumors keep pouring in. And Mr Dein really affected most of the arsenal squad eh?</strong></div>
