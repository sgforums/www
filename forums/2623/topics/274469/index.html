            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.4thegame.com/media/00/03/67/clichy_gael_afc_profile_2006.jpg"><br><br>The Gunners moved a step closer to the lucrative group stages of the Champions League following a hard-fought 2-0 victory at Sparta Prague in the first leg of their third-round qualifier on Wednesday night.<br><br>The home side certainly applied plenty of pressure, looking to unsettle Arsenal at every opportunity.<br><br>Former West Ham defender Tomas Repka was keen to lead by example, having spoken on Czech TV in the build-up to the match about how best to get on top of Arsene Wenger's men.<br><br>Arsenal, though, weathered the storm and snatched a goal through Cesc Fabregas 72 minutes in before Alexander Hleb crucially doubled the advantage on the stroke of full-time.<br><br>Clichy, who set up the opener, believes the performance can only stand the Gunners in good stead for the other battles which lie ahead, both at home and in Europe over the next nine months.<br><br>"Maybe they think this is the way to play against Arsenal, however, we have to show that we are not the same team as before and are ready for the challenge," he declared.<br><br>"Everything is about mentality and we believe we have the quality in our football.<br><br>"We showed it against Sparta and will do it again [at Blackburn] on Sunday."<br><br>Clichy added: "We are waiting for the challenge and we are waiting for the teams to come.<br><br>"Every weekend, we play against a side like this in England. This season, we believe we have the football quality and the physical quality."<br><br>Repka - who spent five seasons with the Hammers before returning to his homeland in January 2006 - took just two minutes to make his presence felt with a clattering challenge on Robin van Persie.<br><br>The 33-year-old was also involved in a clash with Fabregas, and was forced off before the break through injury.<br><br>Full-back Clichy revealed Arsenal were briefed to expect some rough treatment.<br><br>"We were ready - the boss warned us beforehand that they would come to try to kick us from the start," he said.<br><br>"Repka said it before the game, that they were waiting for us, to kick us and that is what they did. Fortunately we won.<br><br>"He [Repka] talked a lot about it before the game we saw it on TV, and then he got injured, which of course I am not happy about.<br><br>"But sometimes you have to play your best instead of talking. I hope it is not a big injury for him and that he will be back for the next game."<br><br>Arsenal's new-found determination helped them come from behind to beat Fulham at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, when Hleb had also netted in the dying moments.<br><br>Wenger praised the never-say-die attitude of his players, and Clichy reflected: "It shows we do not give up until the end, and that is the way it should be.<br><br>"Maybe the last couple of years, it was the other way, perhaps we were giving up a bit too quick, or were not focused until the end.<br><br>"This year, we are a different team with a different spirit, and we are going to try to make it happen every week, and we will see at the end of the season."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> Yeah, i believe arsenal can overcome every obstacle they face now!</span></div>
