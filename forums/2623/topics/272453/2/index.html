But the Brazilian may not be ready until September.<br><br>Â“We have a three-week plan to build him up again,Â” said Wenger. Â“He did not play the last game of the Copa America and had three and a half weeks off. It will take two or three weeks to get him ready. If you donÂ’t do that he will suffer during rest of the season.Â”<br><br>Arsenal TV Online subscribers will be able to see the full interview with ArsÃ¨ne on Friday morning. In it, he talks about the new season, challenging for the title, his business over the summer, the transfer market in general, the hope of more signings, the captaincy, injuries and Fulham.</div>

That opens the door for the 24-year-old signed from Dinamo Zagreb if he can shake off his own injury.<br><br>The manager said: Â“Gilberto is not ready, Adebayor is not fit but it should be a question of days for him. Eduardo has a small ankle problem and has a test on Saturday morning. He has more chance to play than not to play.<br><br>Â“Certainly I would not be scared to play him. Maybe he will need a little bit of time but he is a fighter. He has the ability to score goals, he is quick and a team player so you are never scared to put in these players.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Match preview</strong><br><br>By Richard Clarke<br><br>On the eve of the new Premier League season, ArsÃ¨ne Wenger was asked when the next era in the history of Arsenal Football Cub would begin, he replied with one word - "today".<br><br>The departure of Thierry Henry this summer may end up acting as the dividing line between the Â“InvinciblesÂ” and the next great Arsenal side. This season will go a long way to deciding whether the current squad can achieve that status. But, at his first Friday press conference of the campaign, the manager was certainly bristling with confidence.<br><br>Â“I feel this team learned their trade last year and they found it was not easy,Â” said Wenger. Â“Now they are ready to go.<br><br>Â“You have to accept that the team will be different and you cannot compare any individual. We've had a few good strikers at Arsenal and in 130 years, nobody scored more goals than Thierry Henry so you cannot put that kind of pressure on anybody else.<br><br>Â“So yes we will be a different team. The only thing I can say is that we have a strong belief, a great desire for success, a great togetherness and we are very hungry. And the fact that everyone doubts us reinforces that.Â”<br><br>Wenger accepts his side are the underdogs of the top four as far as the title race goes. However it is important to remember that an Arsenal side mostly shorn of summer departures Thierry Henry and Freddie Ljungberg actually performed well in the head-to-heads with Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool last term. It is the away games against the struggling sides and home draws with mid-table visitors that really needs improvement in comparison to last year.<br><br>Â“We lost the title in games against the teams from [places] 10 to 20 in the League,Â” said Wenger. Â“In the top four [results] we were the best, in the top 10 we were second and against 10-20 we were fourth. So we lost the title last year against Sheffield United, Fulham, West Ham. These sorts of teams.<br><br>Â“Also I must say we had a difficult start at Emirates Stadium but in the second part of the season we did reasonably well. We have built a history there now but, at the same time, Fulham is a derby and they will make it difficult. It is the first game of the season so everyone is a bit edgy but I am confident we will make it difficult for everybody who visits us this season.Â”<br><br>The Craven Cottage side will do likewise of course. Lawrie Sanchez built his reputation by beating the likes of Spain and England while in charge of Northern Ireland. He has taken many of his countrymen to West London over the summer.<br><br>On the injury front, Arsenal have Gilberto (fatigue) and Emmanuel Adebayor (groin) injured. Eduardo is expected to start assuming he passes SaturdayÂ’s test on his ankle knock.<br><br>Â“It is very important for us to begin the season well,Â” said Wenger. Â“Last year we were seven points behind after three games. We drew with Aston Villa, we lost at Manchester City then we played Middlesbrough and lost two more points. It was difficult [already] and we had not played any of the contenders.<br><br>Â“I feel we have a slight advantage of stability [over Fulham]. We know how to play our game and have not changed our squad that much. But, at the same time, we donÂ’t want to speculate on any weakness of our opponents. It is important that we focus on expressing our strength.Â”<br><br>At the end of his time with the media, Wenger was asked for his main hope for the season. He gave a telling answer.<br><br>Â“My hope?Â” he mused. Â“I would say it is more a desire and inner belief. Hope needs to wait for someone outside to do something for you. We have an inner strength in this squad and my belief is that we will do much better than people expect us to do.Â”<br><br>The next nine months will give us our answer.</div>
