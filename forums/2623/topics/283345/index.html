            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/07/09/240/Wenger3_574425.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger has every right to feel "life is beautiful" at the moment for his Arsenal side, but accepts that could all change very quickly.<br><br>The Gunners travelled to Romania for Tuesday's Champions League clash with Steaua Bucharest sitting pretty at the top of the Barclays Premier League.<br><br>Victory in eastern Europe would make it eight in a row for Wenger's emerging squad, who have shown few signs of missing star man Thierry Henry, sold to Barcelona during the summer.<br><br>The Arsenal manager, however, has seen enough football during his 11 seasons in charge to know how quickly the scenario could change.<br><br>The Frenchman said: "I take pride in the fact people go home having felt that for one-and-a-half hours, life is beautiful and that is why professional football exists.<br><br>"We get compliments when people enjoy watching your team - and that is the biggest compliment you can get because all the rest is basically for you and the ego."<br><br>Wenger continued: "As a manager you try to have a balance. Sometimes we were criticised for overplaying and not being efficient and being swept away by teams who often make the game physical against Arsenal.<br><br>"There is no ideal way. As a manager you have to get to your team what is in accordance with your personality and try to do it well.<br><br>"After that some people like more direct play, I have nothing against that - we play the game I like and my players like."<br><br>The Gunners boss, though, was quick to play down comparisons with the 'Invincibles', who swept to the league title unbeaten in 2003-04.<br><br>Wenger stressed: "At the moment only similarities in the short term - we are consistent.<br><br>"The challenge we face is the other team has been very, very consistent in the long term. That demands special stamina and motivation and that is something we have not proven yet."<br><br>And Wenger is well aware trophies are not won in the autumn.<br><br>"We have played a few games and done well, but we have not achieved anything," he added. "Any team in the league can do that.<br><br>"We are nowhere. We are in a position of fighting with Manchester United and Manchester City.<br><br>"We all prefer to say 'well done' - but that is not enough. What is a real team is to achieve something together. We are a team who are miles away from having done that."<br><br>Arsenal have certainly added some bite to their approach this season, with both Cesc Fabregas and Mathieu Flamini - who faces a fitness test on a groin problem ahead of the game - giving little quarter at the heart of the midfield.<br><br>As Blackburn and West Ham have discovered lately, it will take more than a determined approach to unsettle this current Gunners team.<br><br>It is an edge Wenger's side had been missing in recent seasons, with the likes of Martin Keown and long-time enforcer Patrick Vieira having revelled in such roles during Arsenal's dominant spell at the turn of the century.<br><br>Wenger admitted, though, that his team then did have disciplinary problems and collect too many red cards.<br><br>He said: "I was embarrassed when it happened sometimes, when we did not behave well.<br><br>"I was not embarrassed when I felt that the player, after much provocation, responded overboard.<br><br>"There was a young Patrick Vieira, when he was really a young lion, and being intimidated easily and he was annoyed because he got tackled five times from behind.<br><br>"I can understand - but when we did not behave well it was disappointing."<br><br>Arsenal were more than impressive in the way they swept aside Sevilla 3-0 in their opening Champions League clash at Emirates Stadium in what was supposed to represent the toughest test of Group H.<br><br>Steaua may not have lost to English opposition in European competition, but are hardly a side firing on all cylinders.<br><br>The Romanians are struggling for domestic form and lost their opening Champions League game to Slavia Prague, a match followed by the resignation of former international star Gheorghe Hagi as manager, supposedly due to interference in team affairs from owner Gigi Becali.<br><br>Nevertheless, new coach Massimo Pedrazzini maintains Steaua are "not scared" of Arsenal.<br><br>Wenger knows his men must produce the goods again tomorrow with the team having a history of poor results in eastern Europe.<br><br>"We have to show that we can improve that record," he said. "It is a strange atmosphere always over there, it is darker and less glamorous and you don't feel on a high.<br><br>"They are always good teams who are up for it against Arsenal.<br><br>"It is a different kind of test - can you raise your level in a less exciting environment and perhaps still a very difficult one?"<br><br>(reopens) Wenger maintains the internal problems Steaua may be going through will have little impact on tomorrow night's match.<br><br>Speaking at tonight's official UEFA press conference in Bucharest, Wenger said: "We are used to playing teams who have problems - but Arsenal have a very good unity factor for the opponent teams.<br><br>"When you play against them, they suddenly discover they have no problem at all."<br><br>The Gunners boss insisted: "Our target is to be at our best, and not speculate on any weakness of our opponents.<br><br>"Steaua have a big tradition here and I have a big respect for Romanian football."<br><br>Wenger stressed any suggestions of anyone else interfering with team affairs other than the manager would not happen at Arsenal.<br><br>"I do not think I will be in this position, because the way we are organised at Arsenal is completely different," said Wenger.<br><br>"I have a technical responsibility that nobody else at the club has."<br><br>Full-back Gael Clichy insisted the Gunners will not be phased by what is expected to be a stern test in difficult conditions.<br><br>"We are on a good run and just want to be focused on the quality of our own game tomorrow, then everything will be fine," he said.<br><br>"We have great players and great quality in the team and have been playing really well since the beginning of the season.<br><br>"It will be difficult - when a team is playing against Arsenal, they will be ready for it, but we are ready for it as well."<br><br>Clichy added: "Everyone believes in the team.<br><br>"Since the first game of pre-season we were all looking forwards to it because we wanted to show to everyone who have written off Arsenal's title chances this year that we are ready for it.<br><br>"Now everyone is starting to see that, and we want to carry on this good run."<br><br>Striker Robin van Persie, meanwhile, has an ankle problem, and is another who faces a late fitness test.<br><br>Wenger said: "We have travelled with 19 players, and all are of top quality so I will adapt.<br><br>"Maybe up front we could be a little bit short without Adebayor and van Persie, but I think at least one of the two will be capable to play."<br><br>The Arsenal manager was also not concerned by the choice of referee for tomorrow's match - Terje Hauge.<br><br>The Norwegian was in charge of the Gunners defeat in the 2006 Champions League final to a goal from Henrik Larsson which Wenger felt was offside.</div>
