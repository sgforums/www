              <p><strong>Tomas Rosicky has no idea whether or not he will be fit to help Arsenal in their bid for Barclays Premier League and European glory. The Czech midfielder has not played since limping off seven minutes into the game against Newcastle on January 26.</strong></p>
              <p>Rosicky, 27, admits it has been frustrating to watch from the sidelines as Arsenal moved into the quarter-finals of the Champions League with a brilliant win over holders AC Milan in the San Siro, but have been unable to try to turn their fortunes in the Premier League around following four successive draws.</p>
              <p>The Gunners head to Chelsea tomorrow on 'Grand Slam' Sunday, when the top four all go head to head, and then prepare for a European double-header against Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Rosicky, though, cannot put a time frame on his expected return from a niggling problem in his knee where the ligament anchors the joint. "There is no prospect, I don't know for the present," Rosicky told Czech newspaper Sport. "I have missed football badly. I have never had such a long break. "I take it as this simply is a part of football and strong individuals must cope with it - and I will cope with it.</p>
              <p>"It will not stop me nor break me down, but I have realised how much I love football." Wenger admits winger Rosicky is a big loss to his offensive options. "The lads also say that in the dressing room too, that they need me," the midfielder said.</p>
              <p>"I would love to be back on the pitch, it is not easy for me. I have to put up with it." Rosicky added: "What can I do about it? I can do nothing but wait before it fades away. "We have done almost everything, we tried it through pain. "There have been cases when I managed to set it in motion, but it did not help a lot. I simply need it to cool down."</p>
              <p>Wenger, meanwhile, suggested the injury could even rule Rosicky out of this summer's European Championships. The Arsenal manager said: "It is impossible to say when he will return. "It is a frustration for me and him as well. He's a very genuine guy who wants to play.</p>
              <p>"Tomas has an absolutely genuine attitude and is 100% committed, but he's just not ready." Wenger added: "I want him to be happy and play as quickly as possible and if it is for Arsenal it is even better. If it is for the Czechs, okay.</p>
              <p>"Tomas is not a guy who will hold back to play well in the Euro Championship. He is a guy who wants to do well for Arsenal." Wenger, meanwhile, has been left less than impressed by reports Inter Milan made an illegal approach for midfielder Alexander Hleb during the Gunners' recent trip to Italy.</p>
              <p>The Serie A club have categorically denied any contact took place, while colleagues of the player's agent Claudio Vigorelli insist the pair simply "went for an ice-cream".</p>
              <p>Wenger, though, said: "I was concerned and I didn't like that it happened. "If the agent came to the team hotel then he should have asked me for permission to see the players. You cannot just see the players like that."</p>
              <p>It is understood, however, the matter will not be taken further.</p>
