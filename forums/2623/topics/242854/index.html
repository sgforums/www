            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"> Arsene Wenger has confirmed Theo Walcott will undergo shoulder surgery soon, but expects the Arsenal youngster to come back and fulfil his promise.<br><br>Walcott's season will be ended when he goes under the knife in a bid to cure a long-standing problem with his left shoulder.<br><br>The England starlet was originally pencilled in for surgery following the Carling Cup final, but the operation was delayed following his impressive display and injury to Abou Diaby against Chelsea.<br><br>However, Walcott has opted for surgery now rather than waiting and Wenger does not expect it to hamper the youngster's promising progress.<br><br>"I think we did not see enough of Theo because of his shoulder," said Wenger. "He was very, very promising before his shoulder injury.<br><br>"Sometimes it pops out now in training. Now, he wants to get it done.<br><br>"I feel he will be a great player, and you have seen glimpses of him - but first he needs to get his shoulder right."<br><br>The surgery means Walcott will miss the Wembley curtain-raiser between England's Under 21s and their Italian counterparts on 24th March.<br><br>"I gave him a choice," Wenger added. "He said: 'I want to do it as quickly as possible'."<br><br>Walcott has revealed he has had shoulder troubles since joining The Gunners, and it has been gradually getting worse.<br><br>"It is my left shoulder, and I have had the problem since I joined, it was from my Southampton days," he said.<br><br>"I have been playing with it and it has been fine, but it has been getting worse the last couple of months.<br><br>"I think the best thing for me in the long run is to have the operation." </span></div>
