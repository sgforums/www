              <h1>Seedorf: We Will Beat Inexperienced Arsenal</h1>
              <p><img src="http://blogs.news.com.au/images/uploads/seedorf2.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="240"></p>
              <h2><span style="color: #000000;">Clarence Seedorf believes that AC Milan will be able to use their
              experience in Europe to help them beat Arsenal in the Champions League
              in midweek.</span></h2>
              <p>The Dutch midfielder recognised that the Gunners are a strong side, but
              thinks that they will not have the guile to overcome the wily old heads
              in the Rossoneri side.<br><br>With the first leg at the Emirates this week, Seedorf thinks that the tie will be settled in Italy.<br><br>"In
              my view, although Arsenal are one of the best teams in Europe and have
              been playing very well lately, they lack experience," he told Sunday
              Mirror.<br><br>"We are champions of Europe and have won this competition seven times. We know how to handle these occasions.<br><br>"We have experience and we also have cunning, especially when it comes to ties over two legs.<br><br>"Arsenal have a great record at home but. But the second leg being at the San Siro will be our advantage." <br><br>Seedorf
              then admitted that he is a fan of Cesc Fàbregas, but does not think
              that the Arsenal midfielder has the ability to outwit Gennaro Gattuso.<br><br>"Fàbregas is one of the best midfielders in the world," he added. <br><br>"But we have quite a few world class midfielders, including Gattuso. I think Fábregas will find it tough up against him."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One word for seedorf: Hao lian</p>

              <p><strong>By Matt Fortune</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Arsène Wenger has earmarked Brazilian playmaker Kaka as AC Milan’s dangerman. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The World Player of the Year has overcome injury in time for Wednesday’s Champions League clash at Emirates Stadium — a place Kaka has fond memories of. In his first appearance at the Gunners’ home, in September 2006, the 25 year-old scored a wonderful solo goal in Brazil’s 3-0 victory against Argentina. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Blessed with pace, vision and a penchant for the spectacular, Kaka is capable of changing a game in a flash. A fact Manchester United, Liverpool and Celtic found out to their cost in last season’s premier European competition.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>“Kaka made the difference last year in this competition,” said Wenger on Friday. “He scored 10 goals in 11 games. He made the difference against Celtic. <br> <br>“He's the guy who can dominate a situation and in 10 seconds get to the other side of the box and score a goal. <br> <br>“We need to be more cautious in the centre than we usually are. He's especially dangerous at counter-attacking. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I don't know if I'll use Gilberto for him. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>“My main worry is to get 11 fit players for the Milan game.”</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>omg.. Gilberto to defend KAKA? Wenger , no more stunt pls..tor long.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"></p>

              tomorrow and maybe he is not available on Wednesday. He has a big
              family problem."</p>
              <h3>Philippe Senderos</h3>
              <p>Philippe Senderos is a doubt for Saturday's game. "He has not
              practised all week because of a thigh and a knee problem," said the
              manager on Thursday.</p>
              <h3>Theo Walcott</h3>
              <p>Theo Walcott was a late drop-out for the Blackburn game and will be
              missing once more at the weekend. "Theo was down to play on Monday but
              he had a thigh problem," said Wenger. "He will be short for Saturday
              again and I wanted to play him there."</p>
              <h3>Manuel Almunia</h3>
              <p>Manuel Almunia has not fully recovered from sicknes but would
              not feature against Manchester United in any case - Wenger has
              confirmed that Jens Lehmann is keeping goal in the FA Cup this season.</p>
              <h3>Abou Diaby</h3>
              <p>Abou Diaby was injured during the 2-1 win at Manchester City but
              there is no time frame on when he will return. "Diaby, in fairness,
              picked the injury up at Man City," said the manager. "We sent him on
              international duty with information explaining that he was injured and
              they did not play him."</p>
              <h3>Tomas Rosicky</h3>
              <p>Tomas Rosicky sustained a slight hamstring problem during the FA Cup
              fixture with Newcastle and has not featured since. He will not play at
              Old Trafford on Saturday.</p>
              <h3>Robin van Persie</h3>
              <p>Robin van Persie has been sidelined since he picked up a thigh
              injury during the Carling Cup Semi-Final first leg against Tottenham
              and will not be rushed back. "As for Robin, it has all gone well," said
              the manager earlier this month. "After last time we have decided not to
              push him and give him the needed time. I don't want to set any
              timescale because that means, if he is not ready by that date, I might
              feel I have to push him."</p>
              <h3>Denilson</h3>
              <p>The Brazilian midfielder was withdrawn midway through the first-half
              of the Carling Cup Semi-Final second-leg defeat against Tottenham. "He
              will be out for three or four weeks," said Wenger after the match. "He
              has a hamstring [problem]."</p>
              <h3>Johan Djourou</h3>
              <p>Johan has missed the last six games after picking up a groin injury
              in the Carling Cup Semi-Final against Tottenham and he is some way from
              recovery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone is infected with "RVP" disease.</p>

              <h1>Arsenal a danger to all on the break, warns Capello</h1>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44298000/jpg/_44298883_capello_angryjpg.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="300"></p>
              <p>Fabio Capello has spent less than two months on his voyage of
              discovery in English football, but he has already made his mind up
              about the quality of Arsenal. The England manager described them
              yesterday as "one of the very top teams in Europe" and warned his
              former club Milan that they could not have a more difficult task when
              they visit the Emirates in the Champions League tomorrow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are some aspects of life in England upon which Capello is
              prepared to reserve judgement – the question of England's next captain
              for example – but when it comes to Arsenal he has already intimated
              that he would like his national team to play the same way as the
              Premier League leaders. He said yesterday the counter-attacking style
              of Arsène Wenger's team would be a challenge even for the European Cup
              holders and their weight of experience in the competition.</p>
              <p>Capello
              said that Milan, whom he led to a Champions League triumph in 1994 and
              who lie fourth in Serie A with their two first-choice goalkeepers
              injured, would have to try to score an away goal to give themselves a
              chance. "Since the draw I've felt that Milan could not have got a worse
              proposition than Arsenal," Capello said. "I believe that at this time
              Arsenal are one of the very top teams in Europe. They combine great
              quality with great speed. They will be very different from the team
              beaten 4-0 at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal defend with 10 men and
              attack with six. They are a very well organised side, full of talented
              players. If you leave them any space, they counter-attack with four to
              five players at such pace that the opposition cannot figure out what's
              hitting them. Milan can count on their huge experience and, as I've
              said, they always give their best and more on such occasions. But to
              have a chance with Arsenal they'll have to be in top physical
              condition."</p>
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti's team arrive in London today with
              Clarence Seedorf and Pato serious doubts for tomorrow's game. They have
              already lost their Brazilian goalkeeper Dida and his understudy Zeljko
              Kalac is suffering from a hand injury, which could mean a rare outing
              for the 38-year-old veteran Valerio Fiori, who has not played since
              December 2003. The World Footballer of the Year, Kaka, made a return in
              Sunday's 0-0 draw with Parma, during which Paolo Maldini came on for
              his 1,000th appearance for Milan. Ronaldo is out for the long term.</p>
              <p>Capello
              said that Manchester United had managed to negate the threat of Cesc
              Fabregas in the FA Cup tie on Saturday, which had proved "a key factor
              for their dominance". He added: "We know that Milan can rise to the
              challenge in crucial matches, but this is a very difficult time to face
              Arsenal. But [Emmanuel] Adebayor, [Mathieu] Flamini, [Gaël] Clichy will
              be back against Milan, for a very different Arsenal team.</p>
              <p>"They
              [Milan] will need their quality players in their best form, and it is
              vital for the likes of Kaka and Seedorf to recover in time. They will
              need a strong midfield to face Arsenal, [Andrea] Pirlo is a must. If
              Pato recovers in time it will be a big bonus for them. Arsenal have
              Adebayor on extraordinary form, but the whole team play great football.
              Milan will have to endeavour to score an away goal, which would give
              them a boost for the San Siro game."</p>
              <p>Wenger's claims that his
              Arsenal team have played more matches so far this season than any other
              side in Europe – 42 games – will be his justification for such a
              half-hearted exit from the FA Cup at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, he
              should reap the benefits tomorrow with Adebayor, Clichy and Flamini all
              available. Bacary Sagna and Tomas Rosicky could also be back in
              contention.</p>

              <h1>Fábregas wary of 'killers' Milan</h1>
              <p>Cesc Fábregas believes Arsenal can win the European Cup and Premier
              League this season but has warned his team-mates that Milan, tomorrow's
              opponents in the Champions League, are capable of "killing" opponents
              at the blink of an eye.</p>
              <p>"Everyone talks that they are not doing well
              in the league, that they are not playing well," he said. "But these
              kind of teams can kill you in one second. They have massive players
              like Kaka, [Andrea] Pirlo and [Alberto] Gilardino - this kind of
              world-class player - and we have to be careful. Still I think we have a
              good chance."</p>
              <p>Fábregas said Arsenal were "quite
              confident" of winning the Premier League but cautioned against losing
              focus with a five-point lead as he insisted the squad could land a
              domestic-European double. "We are capable, definitely, we have no doubt
              about that," he told CNN International's World Sport. "But, of course,
              we will have to wait and see." The midfielder said he would choose the
              Premier League before European success if forced to pick.</p>
              <p>Arsenal
              were widely expected to struggle after Thierry Henry's sale and
              Fábregas, who said he was not keen on the Premier League plan to take
              games overseas, revealed meetings of staff and players sparked a
              positive response. "We said: 'Look, we can do two things - we can go
              down because Thierry has left and say we are never going to win
              anything again or we can all step up [and] be winners.'"</p>

              <p>"Denilson is back in the squad and Theo Walcott is in too. But Johan Djourou, Robin van Persie, Abou Diaby, Tomas Rosicky are all still out."</p>
