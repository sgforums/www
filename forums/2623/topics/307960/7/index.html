              <p>A deserved victory . I thought we played extremely well and put Milan on the backline for most of the game . Overall , the team did well but I do notice that Diaby and Eboue had minimal contributions . It's either giving the ball away cheaply or choose to solo and get tackled rather than playing the ball to a better-positioned team-mate . On hindsight , I also felt that we could have scored more .</p>

              <p>Good game and Arsenal were the deserved winners.  Meelan didn't seem to pay any heed to the Gunner's FA Cup tie against Man Utd and allowed Fabregas space to play.  Good move by Wenger to introduce Walcott in the second half to pit against a tiring Maldini.  An inevitable introduction I should think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For a moment I actually thought Adebayor missed the goal. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <h3>Champions League: AC Milan 0-2 Arsenal - Match Report</h3>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/dotcomreport.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal stormed into the Quarter-Finals of the Champions League after a magnificent victory at Milan on Tuesday evening.</p>
              <p>It was a huge night for Arsène Wenger's side. They were up against
              not only the holders but Europe's most successful side in recent years
              and, at home, their bright campaign had been stuttering of late.</p>
              <p>But they responded with a performance of determination, poise and
              patience. It was capped five minutes from time by a goal from Cesc
              Fabregas. Along with Mathieu Flamini, the Spaniard had dominated the
              famous names in the Milan midfield. Perhaps it was a new-found respect
              that meant they afford him a little too much space to let fly from
              fully 30 yards.</p>
              <p>As the ball bounced into the net, the Arsenal fans erupted. Fabregas
              slid on his knees towards the dug-out then ran off kissing the badge on
              this shirt.</p>
              <p>Adebayor slotted home another in the final minute seal a win that
              felt every bit as good as the 5-1 on this ground against Inter in
              2003... or the 1-0 win at Real Madrid... or the 1-0 win at Juventus in
              1980.</p>
              <p>It was Milan's first defeat at home by English opposition and perhaps Arsenal's greatest away win in European competition.</p>
              <p>And it was utterly, utterly deserved.</p>
              <p>It is a well-worn phrase but the San Siro really is a cathedral of
              football. And, as in every place of worship, the atmosphere is
              dependent on the strength of belief among the congregation.</p>
              <p>Before kick-off this evening, the Milanese fans seemed to have an
              almost evangelistic belief in their side. Most of the independent
              observers were with them.</p>
              <p>Wenger side's saw only one change from the weekend. Emmanuel Eboue,
              whose current ban does not include European football, replaced Theo
              Walcott on the right. Alex Hleb was deployed as a half-striker behind
              Adebayor.</p>
              <p>Although it had been a highly tactical game overall, the second half
              of the first leg had been attacking and enthralling. The start of the
              return rubber began the same way.</p>
              <p>In the fifth minute, Pato burst to the byline and saw his angled
              shot deflected over. From the corner, Paolo Maldini nodded on at the
              near post and there was a moment of consternation in the six-yard box
              before Arsenal cleared. In the minutes that followed William Gallas and
              Mathieu Flamini had to nod inquisitive free-kicks away from the danger
              area.</p>
              <p>Milan had started not like traditional cagey Italians but akin to an up-and-at-'em English side.</p>
              <p>Arsenal knew they might be counterattacking tonight. And they showed
              some stomach of the job when Adebayor held up a long ball forward
              before laying the ball back to Diaby, who sidefooted wide.</p>
              <p>However Milan would respond with better chances - Filippo Inzaghi's
              volley and Pato's chip. Almunia held on to both. Inzaghi was starting
              to look lively. The veteran flicked a header wide and drove into the
              sidenetting midway through the half as Milan continued to press.</p>
              <p>Arsenal were being stretched and stretched. But Adebayor's fine
              drive in the 27th minute gave them not only respite but hope. Hleb
              weaved forward and eventually Diaby nudged the ball to the Togolese
              striker whose curling sidefoot had to be touched over by Milan keeper
              Zeljko Kalac.</p>
              <p>The visitors grew in confidence from the chance and started to build
              moves with a little more patience. The whistles from the home crowd
              suggested the tide was turning.</p>
              <p>That was hammered home in the 32nd minute when Arsenal worked their
              way down the left flank and Adebayor found Fabregas on the edge of the
              area. His rasping effort beat Kalac and rattled the bar.</p>
              <p>Arsenal were now stretching Milan with Fabregas and Hleb pulling the strings to try and give Adebayor a clear sight of goal.</p>
              <p>It never quite happened before the break but the home 'congregation' was noticeably quieter.</p>
              <p>They were so nearly silenced two minutes after the interval when
              Fabregas raked a corner through the area to the far post where Senderos
              ghosted in to thud an effort into the chest of Kalic. If it had gone a
              foot either side it would have been the opener.</p>
              <p>Arsenal were starting to find regular space in the Milan area - and
              the home fans did not like it one bit. In the 50th minute, Eboue fired
              wide from six yards when he might have tested Kalac.</p>
              <p>Although Pirlo's bobbling free-kick was somewhat nervously turned
              around the post by Almunia shortly afterwards, Arsenal still had the
              upper hand.</p>
              <p>Just past the hour Kaka's mazy running saw him outpace Fabregas and then outwit Sagna before firing wide.</p>
              <p>After that, for the first time on the night, the game started to
              lose focus. Not surprisingly both managers threw on attacking
              substitutes - Alberto Gilardino and Walcott respectively</p>
              <p>The new addition for the visitors nearly set up Adebayor in the 73rd
              minute but his deflected cutback just would not come down in time for
              the striker. Five minutes later, Pato cut inside Clichy and curled an
              effort just wide.</p>
              <p>The tension was now becoming palpable. Milan were the masters of
              brinkmanship but Arsenal had been the better side over the two ties.
              They deserved to go through, all they had to do was score.</p>
              <p>Fabregas obliged five minutes from time when the home side afforded him too much space and he tried his luck from distance.</p>
              <p>Milan suddenly looked an old side and their response was minimal. It
              was no surprise to see Walcott fly down the right in the final minute

              <h1>Wenger: 'Who says we can't win both trophies?'</h1>
              <p>He had just dominated the midfield against the most celebrated team
              in European football and last night Cesc Fabregas laid down a challenge
              to his Arsenal team-mates that seems more possible with every game: to
              win the Champions League and the Premier League this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After scoring the first goal in the 2-0 win to set up a first ever
              victory by an English team over Milan at San Siro, Fabregas said: "We
              don't have 25 internationals like Chelsea so we can't challenge for all
              four trophies, but we are in contentions for the two that we really
              want. We are top of the Premier League and we are in the quarter -inals
              of the Champions League after beating the holders at home, so why can't
              we win them both?"</p>
              <p>Fabregas's views were echoed by his manager,
              Arsène Wenger who said that Arsenal, could go on to win the Champions
              League this season. The Frenchman said that his team had demonstrated
              their quality by recovering from the trauma of Eduardo da Silva's
              injury and a faltering Premier League season to eliminate the holders.</p>
              <p>A
              place in the quarter-finals to go with their spot at the top of the
              Premier League was, Wenger said, all the evidence required that his
              team were not in crisis.</p>
              <p>"I said we could win it before now,"
              Wenger said. "The competition is very hard. It's a cup competition and
              you have to take it like that. On the day, we were maybe better than
              Milan. We might play them on Friday and it could be different. We'll go
              for it. We're in the quarter-finals, so why should we not believe we
              can do it?"</p>
              <p>He continued: "What gives me an extra satisfaction
              was that the team went really for it. You sometimes feel as a manager
              that there is something in the team. You know that, for them to get a
              step higher up, they need to deliver in a game like that. I hope that
              result will strengthen the belief in the team. We'd like to take
              advantage of that belief while keeping a balance between that belief
              and humility. That is what allows you to be consistent."</p>
              <p>With
              some sections of the Milan crowd appearing to applaud Arsenal's
              performance as they left San Siro, Wenger said that his team had
              flourished under the pressure of a goalless first leg at the Emirates
              Stadium. "They have grown. They deserved a lot of credit. We've dropped
              off in terms of confidence in the Premier League recently and we've not
              been in the most positive environment recently. To find the mental
              strength – I like that we did. We found the mental strength to play
              without any restrictions, and that makes me proud.</p>
              <p>"I believe
              that Fabregas, [Alexander] Hleb and [Mathieu] Flamini in the middle of
              the park delivered. They didn't give Milan room. They defended very
              well and, when we had the ball, they had support from the flanks in
              [Bacary] Sagna and [Gaël] Clichy and supported them well. That gives
              them solutions. They did a good job defensively as well as going
              forward. The whole team did a good defensive job."</p>
              <p>For the man of
              the moment, it was, Fabregas said, "a dream come true". He added: "To
              win in Milan 2-0, it is amazing. William [Gallas] said before the game
              enjoy the atmosphere. That is what we did. But this is just the
              beginning. We are now in the quarter-finals but we have not done
              anything. It is just one more step."</p>
              <p>Wenger said the game was
              comparable to when Thierry Henry scored the winner in a 1-0 victory
              against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu almost two years ago. "It's similar
              to winning in Madrid," Wenger said. "We knocked out the holders. It
              shows that 0-0 at home is not a bad result. This team is very young but
              they've won at Bernabeu, and now at San Siro, and you need some quality
              to do that."</p>

              <p>Manager Carlo Ancelotti, who saw his Milan side dominated by a determined and vigorous Arsenal last night, had nothing but praise for his opponent.</p>
              <p>Arsenal played to their usual high tempo and put pressure on the current European champions.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: "I think over the 180 minutes they were able to play the way they know how and Milan didn't achieve that with consistency.</p>
              <p>"The credit goes to Arsenal, who pushed us all over the field and kept the pressure up.</p>
              <p>"We tried and then conceded just as things seemed to be going our way. It's a shame.</p>
              <p>"There are no regrets. I don't think we could have done anything more tonight, as Arsenal packed the midfield and made it very difficult for us to play, so everyone did all they could at this moment in time.</p>
              <p>"We're disappointed, but this is football, some you win and some you lose. We have to get back on our feet and keep going.</p>
              <p>"The team did all it could tonight, so now we must focus on the future objective, which is fourth place."</p>
