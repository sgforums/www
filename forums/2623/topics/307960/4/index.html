              <h3>Champions League: Arsenal 0-0 Milan - Match Report</h3>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/dotcomreport.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="178"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a stale-mate in the chess match.</p>
              <p>Arsenal will go goalless to the San Siro in a fortnight's time after
              they failed to breakthrough Milan's resolute defence on a night of
              high-tension at Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>The first half of this first leg was coy and cagey. The second was
              more open but equally tactical with the home side broadly in control.
              Emmanuel Eboue, Eduardo and Emmanuel Adebayor all might have given
              Arsenal a crucial lead. The Togolese striker also headed against the
              bar with the last touch of the match.</p>
              <p>But Italian sides are the masters of brinkmanship - especially one
              with the experience of this Milan outfit. And Carlo Ancelotti's team
              caused sufficient moments of consternation in the home defence to
              suggest to they can threaten more on home soil.</p>
              <p>However Arsène Wenger will be equally optimistic given his side's dominance on the night.</p>
              <p>It promises to be one hell of a second leg.</p>
              <p>After the deep disappointment of Saturday, Wenger was able to
              welcome back Bacary Sagna, Mathieu Flamini, Adebayor and Gael Clichy
              into his starting line-up. All had been absent entirely or barely-fit
              substitutes at Old Trafford. Denilson and Theo Walcott were also back
              from injury to buoy the bench. Despite reports, giant Australian keeper
              Zeljko Kalac did start for Milan after recovering from a hand injury.</p>
              <p>On paper, visiting side was a mini 'Who's Who' of world football.
              Maldini, Gattuso, Seedorf, Nesta, Pirlo, Ambrosini and, of course, Kaka
              were names we knew well. Tonight, Emirates Stadium could judge whether
              the likes of Fabregas, Flamini, Adebayor, Toure, Gallas and Clichy now
              had more resonance.</p>
              <p>This particular corner of North London had been red-and-black for
              much of the afternoon. The San Siro is known a footballing cathedral
              but perhaps Emirates Stadium is starting to draw a congregation of its
              own these days.</p>
              <p>As the first whistle approached, red-and-white began to match, then
              overtake the red-and-black. But whatever your colours tonight you were
              tense. It was going to be one of those nervy European nights.</p>
              <p>Arsenal had to reshuffle inside seven minutes. Kolo Toure bore the brunt of Pato's drive and Philippe Senderos came on.</p>
              <p>Between the injury and the substitution, Clarence Seedorf sent over
              a corner and Paolo Maldini's flashing header was expertly turned aside
              by Lehmann.</p>
              <p>Adebayor nodded wide from Emmanuel Eboue's inviting cross almost
              immediately and, as the half wore, the Togolese striker would emerge as
              Arsenal's greatest threat.</p>
              <p>The Milan defenders were wary of the 23-year-old's direct and
              muscular front-running. His reputation had obviously reached Northern
              Italy.</p>
              <p>To be honest, the first half was turning into an enigmatic affair;
              the quality of each side was obvious but neither side was prepared push
              forward to any extent.</p>
              <p>It took 36 minutes for a flowing move to produce a shot on goal.
              Eboue fooled his marker and cut in from the byline to fed Flamini. His
              first-time shot was saved by Kalac.</p>
              <p>It was an indication that Arsenal were easing into the ascendancy.
              Before the break, Adebayor's heavy pass cost Fabregas a clear shot on
              goal and the home fans had claims for a penalty after Flamini had
              tricked his way into the area.</p>
              <p>But it had been a largely sterile first half.</p>
              <p>Five minutes after the restart it was Milan's turn to lose a man.
              Alessandro Nesta went off seemingly concussed and Marek Jankulovski
              came on. And, again in symmetry to the first half, the visitors nearly
              conceded from a corner when Kaka turned a nervous header inches past
              his own post.</p>
              <p>The Milan goal was starting to come under scrutiny. Alex Hleb
              stormed down the right and Eboue swept a shot just wide while Adebayor
              scored an offside goal and was then denied by the onrushing Kalac.</p>
              <p>In the 55th minute, Fabregas fed Eduardo on the edge of the area and he flashed a rasping shot inches over the bar.</p>
              <p>Arsenal had taken control. Now they had to score the goal their football deserved.</p>
              <p>However, just past the hour, the home side literally had a shot
              across the bows when Massimo Oddo appeared at the far post to fire over
              the bar. A few minutes later, Kaka sliced an effort wide as Milan
              continued to suggest they had regained their composure.</p>
              <p>In fact, with 20 minutes left, it was Arsenal turn to look rattled
              as Pato bustled through and Clichy hurried cleared his line before a
              melee ensued.</p>
              <p>Just after Nicklas Bendtner had replaced Eduardo, Fabregas forced a
              low save from Kalac. Ten minutes the Australian held onto an altogether
              more dangerous shot from the Spaniard from a similar distance.</p>
              <p>Substitute Alberto Gilardino nearly nodded home at the near post
              with four minutes left but Lehmann grabbed the ball on the line.</p>
              <p>Arsenal continued to pressure and, with a minute left, Bendtner blazed over at the near post.</p>
              <p>It seemed to be their last chance to make home advantage tell before
              Adebayor rattled the bar from a cross by substitute Theo Walcott.</p>
              <p>So nearly the perfect ending.</p>

              <p>dont think milan's playing style will be much different than today's.</p>
              <p>after this our youngsters will hopefully have more experience and confidence so as to perform better in the next leg.</p>
