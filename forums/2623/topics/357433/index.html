              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal captain Cesc
              Fabregas and Hull City manager Phil Brown have both been charged with
              improper conduct by the Football Association. </strong></p>
              <p>The charges come as a result of the duo's behaviour
              during Arsenal's 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final victory over Hull at Emirates
              Stadium in mid-March.</p>
              <p>Gunners midfielder Fabregas was accused of spitting at Tigers assistant manager Brian Horton in the aftermath of the match.</p>
              <p>Hull boss Brown maintained he saw Fabregas spit towards Horton in the tunnel at the end of the match.</p>
              <p>Fabregas
              denied any wrongdoing in the incident but, after examining video
              evidence and statements from Hull, the FA has charged the Spain
              international, on two counts, and Brown.</p>
              <p>A statement on the FA's <em>official website</em> said: "Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas and Hull City manager Phil Brown have both been charged with improper conduct.</p>
              <h4>Behaviour</h4>
              <p>"The charges relate to matters arising from the FA Cup match between Arsenal and Hull at the Emirates Stadium on 17th March.</p>
              <p>"Fabregas faces two charges of improper conduct relating to his conduct on the pitch following the game.</p>
              <p>"One
              charge concerns his behaviour in coming onto the pitch after the final
              whistle, the second charge relates to an alleged spitting incident. The
              charges are based on submissions from Hull City and video evidence."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              Brown's charge includes bringing the game into disrepute relating to
              comments made regarding referee Mike Riley following the fixture.</p>
              <p>The
              statement added: "Brown is charged with improper conduct and/or
              bringing the game into disrepute in relation to media comments made
              after the game concerning referee Mike Riley."</p>
              <p>The pair have until 12th May to respond to the charges.</p>
              <h5>Defence</h5>
              <p>Hull chairman Paul Duffen was not surprised by the charges and is backing his staff over the claims.</p>
              <p>"I
              have always welcomed the Football Association's investigation into
              events at the Emirates Stadium following the final whistle of our FA
              Cup quarter-final," said Duffen.</p>
              <p>"It is no surprise to me that
              the FA have decided to bring the charges that they have announced this
              afternoon as I have always been confident in Phil Brown's and Brian
              Horton's accounts of events on that day.</p>
              <p>"I will not comment
              further at this time as this matter is the subject of a disciplinary
              charge, but I have always known that Phil and Brian tell the truth."</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsene Wenger has
              yet to decide if Arsenal will appeal against the two charges of
              improper conduct levelled against Cesc Fabregas by the Football
              Association. </strong></p>
              <p>Gunners captain Fabregas has been charged as a result
              of his behaviour in the aftermath of the 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final win
              over Hull at Emirates Stadium on 17th March.</p>
              <p>The Spain
              international did not play in the fixture due to a knee injury, but he
              was on the pitch after the final whistle and it was alleged he spat at
              Tigers assistant Brian Horton.</p>
              <p>Fabregas denied any wrongdoing
              and, after studying reports and video evidence, Wenger maintains that
              there is not a case against the midfielder, who could be suspended if
              the charges are proven.</p>
              <p>But the Arsenal boss has hinted that the
              club will not appeal before a deadline of 12th May, saying: "Fabregas
              has been charged for improper conduct on the night.</p>
              <h4>Co-operate</h4>
              <p>"I always said we are always very open to co-operate with any investigation.</p>
              <p>"I
              personally looked at the reports, at the video evidence and there is
              nothing in there against Cesc. I don't know if we will appeal - I will
              see what we can do about that.</p>
              <p>"At the start, I am not a great
              fan of appealing because I said we are very open to co-operate and now
              I don't think we should stop that.</p>
              <p>"I am very positive that there was enough evidence in what I have seen that the case should have been dropped."</p>
