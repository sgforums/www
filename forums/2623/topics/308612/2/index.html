              <p>i am more than convinced it was intentional and taylor's very intention was to break eduardo's leg.</p>

              <p>taylor sld be given more than just 1 red card. next time soccer team can just engage a bunch of muay thai boxer to play their game, break the opp. leg n given just 1 red card</p>

              <h1><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=511107&amp;cc=4716">Croatia in shock after Eduardo injury</a></h1>
              <p>ZAGREB, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Arsenal striker Eduardo, who broke his leg on Saturday, is irreplaceable in Croatia's Euro 2008 team, coach Slaven Bilic was quoted as saying on Monday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bilic also told local media that Eduardo's recovery was paramount, over and above his loss to the Croatia team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eduardo, who turned 25 on Monday, broke his left leg in the third minute of Arsenal's Premier League match at Birmingham City and had surgery on Saturday night.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Brazilian-born striker's recovery will take at least six months, doctors said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We have a solid choice of strikers, but he is irreplaceable,' said Bilic, whose team face co-hosts Austria, Germany and Poland in Group B at the tournament in June being staged jointly by Switzerland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'However, I don't want to think now about our Euro 2008 performance without Eduardo. I just want him to be well and fully recover,' Bilic told the Vecernji List daily.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Croatian media widely reported the incident, which made prime-time news over the weekend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Local dailies immediately sent reporters to London to follow the story and expressed shock over the horrendous tackle by Martin Taylor and regret at Eduardo having to miss Euro 2008.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Taylor's brutal start (to the match) destroyed the ambition of a small but great soccer nation to hope for a European title,' an editorial in the Jutarnji List daily said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Eduardo's injury was like a death in the beautiful game.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The daily said it was regretful that Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had backtracked on his initial reaction to the injury when he said Taylor, who was sent off for the tackle, should be banned from football for life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Wenger was right in what he first said. It was not so nice to hear that he toned it down later,' the daily said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a poll published in the daily, 41 percent were said Taylor should be banned for life and 25 percent favoured a long suspension.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eduardo sent an open letter from his London hospital to Croatian media saying: 'I wholeheartedly thank all fans, (national) team mates and the coach for the strong support they have shown.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It means a lot to me. I really did not expect my injury to resound so strongly in the media.'</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Eduardo has given his account of the terrible events at Birmingham City on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The Croatian, 25 on Monday, broke his leg following a challenge from
              Blues defender Martin Taylor in the third minute of the game at St
              Andrews. He was taken to hospital and underwent surgery that night. The
              striker has since returned to a London-based hospital for further
              treatment.</p>
              <p>Speaking for the first time after the incident, the summer signing 
              from Dinamo Zagreb ruled himself out of the rest of the season and Euro
              2008 in the summer. However, he added that he is 'determined to
              overcome this injury'.</p>
              <p>“I don't remember the incident very well and it is not something
              that I want to see again on television or in the newspapers," said
              Eduardo.</p>
              <p>"All I remember is that when I fell, I looked down at my foot and it
              had turned the other way. The rest is just a blank. It was an
              unfortunate situation but these things can happen in football.<br> <br>“I
              am unsure at the moment of the extent of the injury and how long I will
              be out of action for but I know that I won't be able to play for
              Arsenal for the rest of the season or be ready in time for the Euros
              this summer.</p>
              <p>"But I'm not worried about that. My concentration and determination
              is on making as quick a recovery as possible. I am determined to
              overcome this injury.<br> <br>“I would like to thank the medical team
              here at Arsenal for their efforts as well as the staff at Selly Oak
              Hospital who carried out the operation on Saturday night. Everyone
              there made me feel as comfortable as possible. </p>
              <p>"I would also like to say how touched I am by the many messages of
              support I have received and to be surrounded by my loved ones at this
              time.”</p>

              <h2 class="ss-header hstyle2 main-headline">Bendtner defends Taylor tackle</h2>
              <p class="ss-text-bold">Nicklas Bendtner insists that Martin Taylor is not a malicious player and would not have meant to hurt Eduardo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Arsenal striker saw his team-mate suffer an horrendous
              broken leg after a clumsy tackle from the Birmingham defender at St
              Andrews on Saturday, but fails to understand the criticism which has
              been levelled at Taylor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bendtner spent last season on loan with Blues and knows that the
              centre-back is not the sort of character who would purposely set out to
              injure a fellow professional.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Skills</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Eduardo showed good skills to go around one defender and used
              quick feet when he saw the other defender, but was taken out," he told <em>Arsenal TV</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The referee had no decision but to send Martin off. Due to being at Birmingham I know Martin is not a player like this though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But given what happened you can't say it was anything other than a red card.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Eduardo is a strong character and good person. He's done really
              well at Arsenal and I hope he will be back as quickly as possible."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The injury compounded a miserable day for the Gunners in the
              West Midlands, as they also saw Gael Clichy concede a contentious late
              penalty which allowed Birmingham to grab a 2-2 draw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The French full-back appeared to win the ball in a tangle with
              Stuart Parnaby, but referee Mike Dean pointed to the spot and Arsenal
              saw two vital points slip away in their bid to wrestle the Premier
              League title from Manchester united.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Mistake</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It was a terrible day because of all the things that happened, the injury and the decisions," Bendtner said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We're down because the (penalty) decision has had an effect on the title race.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When you lose points because of a mistake from the referee and not because of the way you play, then it's even worse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The injury made it difficult but we knew we had to try and win the game because it was very important for us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We did everything we could but then a mistake from the referee cost us the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"From the replays it seems that the referee got it wrong. The
              ball was kicked really hard so obviously Gael got a touch on the ball.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The linesman said nothing, so we feel hard done by. I'm really sorry the decision went against Gael.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But the title race is still in our hands and we just have to do the best we can."</p>

              <h2 class="ss-header hstyle2 main-headline">Eduardo to return this year</h2>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Arsenal believe that
              striker Eduardo da Silva will make a full recovery from his horror leg
              break and could be back in action in nine months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Brazil-born Croatia international was left in agony by
              Martin Taylor's third minute challenge during Saturday's Premier League
              clash with Birmingham at St Andrews.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Gunners have revealed that the force of the challenge broke
              Eduardo's left fibula and dislocated his ankle, with Taylor being shown
              an immediate red card.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Birmingham centre-back has visited Eduardo in hospital, with
              Blues manager Alex McLeish revealing Taylor is 'mentally shattered' by
              the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eduardo, who is expected to be discharged from a London hospital
              in the next few days, could be back in action for Arsene Wenger's men
              before the end of the year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Time-scale</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A statement on the club's <em>official website</em> said: "The
              club can confirm that following the incident during Saturday's match at
              Birmingham City, Eduardo has fractured his left fibula and sustained an
              open dislocation of his ankle joint in the same leg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He was immediately taken to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham
              where he underwent surgery on Saturday evening. The operation was
              successful and Eduardo was transferred to a London-based hospital on
              Sunday afternoon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Earlier today (Monday, 25th February), the orthopaedic surgeon
              and Arsenal medical staff assessed the extent of the damage and
              possible time-scale for a full recovery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"All being well, Eduardo will have his leg in plaster and using
              crutches for the next six to eight weeks. After that time, partial
              weight-bearing exercises will be scheduled into a slow rehabilitation
              process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It is hoped that Eduardo will be running again in six months' time and making a full recovery after nine months."</p>

              <p>Defender Martin Taylor says that he will be happy when Brazilian Eduardo da Silva is back playing again.</p>
              <p>Speaking for the first-time since breaking Eduardo's leg in a tackle, Taylor also revealed details of his visit to the Croatian international when he was in a Birmingham hospital.</p>
              <p>Taylor said: "I'll be really happy on the day when I see he is back in the Arsenal and Croatia line-up and when he is scoring goals again.</p>
              <p>"The injury was terrible enough. When he gets back to fitness and he puts the ball in the net for Arsenal for the first time, we will all feel much better.</p>
              <p>"People will be able to see that accidents like these are the nature of football and you can recover from it.</p>
              <p>"I went to see him on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately, he was still recovering from an operation, so first thing on Sunday morning I went to the hospital and he was really good to see me.</p>
              <p>"I thought maybe he wouldn't want to see me, which would have been fair enough because of the trauma.</p>
              <p>"Although there was a language barrier, I just said that I didn't mean him any harm at all and that I hoped he made a quick recovery.</p>
              <p>"He took it on board and nodded. I was just really glad we could communicate. He is obviously a really strong man.</p>
              <p>"Since then, I have read in the papers that he would be happy for me to visit him. That's something I'd like to do."</p>
