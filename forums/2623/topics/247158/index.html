            <div class='col-md body'><strong>West Ham United shattered Arsenal's unbeaten record at Emirates Stadium thanks to Bobby Zamora's goal, but Robert Green was in inspired form for the Premiership strugglers.</strong><br><br>Zamora's cool finish in first-half injury-time earned The Hammers a third consecutive win in a game which seemed to encapsulate Arsenal's season.<br><br>Green produced a series of stunning saves to thwart The Gunners, who also hit the woodwork twice as Arsene Wenger's side slipped to a first defeat at the Emirates.<br><br>Coincidentally, West Ham were also the last team to beat Arsenal at Highbury and the three points will heighten hopes Alan Curbishley can lift the club out of the relegation zone.<br><br>West Ham spent much of the opening 20 minutes chasing shadows as Arsenal's clever movement and incisive passing pulled the visitors this way and that.<br><br>The Gunners could have been in front inside two minutes as Freddie Ljungberg and Tomas Rosicky combined to release Cesc Fabregas, but the young Spaniard's shot was smothered by Green.<br><br>The Hammers keeper was overworked in the early stages as he held Emmanuel Adebayor's curling effort after the striker had made a mug of James Collins.<br><br>Opportunities continued to come Arsenal's way as Adebayor lifted his shot over the bar from a Ljungberg pull-back before Green proved his worth again.<br><br>Rosicky's precision pass sent Ljungberg between the two centre-halves, but Green was out quickly to block the Swede's attempt.<br><br>Emmanuel Eboue and Alexander Hleb were then involved in a clever move to set up Rosicky, but he sliced his left-footed shot wide in front of goal.<br><br>West Ham were limited to rare counter-attacks, but were unable to test Jens Lehmann as Rosicky arced another shot wide at the opposite end.<br><br>Green then produced a sprawling save from Rosicky's thumping drive before Nigel Reo-Coker's poor pass denied Carlos Tevez a run on Lehmann's goal.<br><br>Fabregas' impudent chip failed to catch out Green before The Hammers took the lead in injury-time at the end of the first half.<br><br>Lucas Neill's long pass sent Zamora - possibly from an offside position - clear and the striker lifted a superb lob over the exposed Lehmann.<br><br>The second half followed a similar pattern to the first, but not before Zamora's knock-down saw Lee Bowyer drill a first-time shot into the arms of Lehmann.<br><br>From there, Green waged a one-man battle to keep Arsenal at bay - and West Ham in the Premiership - as he produced several important saves.<br><br>After the ball fell kindly for Gilberto Silva, the Brazilian's low shot from the edge of the area was brilliantly turned round the post by Green.<br><br>And the Hammers keeper then conjured up an even better save as Adebayor was allowed to steal in unmarked to meet Fabregas' free-kick, but his header was magnificently kept out by a one-handed reflex stop from Green.<br><br>Arsenal finally found a way past Green on the hour mark, but Fabregas' turn and shot from the edge of the area crashed back off the crossbar.<br><br>Gilberto then headed a golden chance wide from close range after Eboue's cross had been diverted onwards by Anton Ferdinand.<br><br>Jeremie Aliadiere was introduced for Hleb and the substitute had an immediate chance to equalise, but shot into the side-netting after the ball rolled invitingly into his path.<br><br>Green produced a flying save to catch Fabregas' header and then had the post come to his rescue as Gilberto's prod, after Julio Baptista had flicked on Rosicky's cross, clipped the upright.<br><br>West Ham, for all they were hanging on, could have stolen a second goal late on as Mark Noble's pass played in Luis Boa Morte, but the substitute's dink was over Lehmann and wide of the target.</div>
