And the No.32 he wears on his back is still more than the 24 first-teams starts he has made for Arsenal.<br><br>Nicklas Bendtner, his strike partner last night, has scored more goals - five - since returning from his loan spell at Birmingham last season than Walcott's four in his Arsenal career.<br><br>A semi-final at the home of their local rivals in front of the new England manager was a chance for Walcott to show he can deliver on the big stage.<br><br>But instead, with his Arsenal side badly needing inspiration, he fluffed his lines. The 18-year-old was pushed around by Spurs centre-backs Ledley King and Michael Dawson like two bullies picking on a little boy on his first day at a new school. Even Lee Young-Pyo seemed to tower over him.<br><br>Even before the break the frustrated Arsenal fans were calling for the introduction of the physical presence of Emmanuel Adebayor from the bench. And when the Togo striker did make a belated appearance on 65 minutes, it was Walcott who made way. And within seconds, Adebayor had found the back of the net.<br><br>Wenger said of Walcott at the weekend: "He will get to where I expect him to be, but at the moment he is not." The wait goes on.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">EXCLUSIVE: Walcott being sent out on loan</span><br><br>Aresne Wenger will consider sending Theo Walcott out on loan as the fall-out from Tuesday's 5-1 mauling by Tottenham continues. Sportsmail can reveal that a number of Barclays Premier League clubs were contacted yesterday about the prospect of taking the 18-year-old until the end of the season.</strong><br><br>Arsenal boss Wenger claimed his side's Carling Cup defeat had shown him 'who was not ready for the first team' and Walcott could be one of the casualties before the transfer window closes.<br><br>Although Wenger maintains that Walcott, who cost Â£13million as a 16-year-old, can still develop into a top-class striker, his patience snapped after he failed to make an impression in the semi-final second leg at White Hart Lane.<br><br>Walcott had scored in the Emirates leg, but defender Ledley King subdued him in the return and he was finally substituted in the 65th minute.<br><br>His confidence has been shattered in recent weeks, but at times he has threatened to emerge as a genuine force in the first team. He looked the part and scored twice against Slavia Prague in the Champions League, but he was on the bench at Liverpool.<br><br>Wenger criticised the former Southampton striker last week saying: "He is not where I would like him to be."<br><br>He underlined his point by leaving him out of the squad at Fulham. Walcott has struggled to live up to expectations since signing and a loan may suit all parties.<br><br>A stumbling block may be his starting position. One of the Premier League clubs contacted want him to play on the right wing, but Wenger will insist he starts up front.<br><br></div>
