              <p>i am a Gunners fan but i have to say that i have lost confidence in Arsene Wenger's tactics as well as his overly-optimistic and not realistic attitude. Up till this point of time, where Arsenal's big guns are out and they are relying on their reserves, Arsene Wenger is still reluctant to sign big players, and even if he does so, he is only signing Alonso. He also keeps denying that the title race is over. When have a team that was 5th place at Christmas gone on to win the title? Although there are only 10 points difference, even if Man Utd drop 10 points, Chelsea or Liverpool would still be ahead of Arsenal.</p>
              <p>also, after watching the match yesterday and a few other similar matches, i am really disheartened at arsene leading arsenal anymore.</p>
              <p>when arsenal unveiled their lineup against villa, i was shocked, there were so many defensive players and so few attacking players. that is why we are not scoring goals. and even with so many defensive players, we are conceding more than teams like fulham. 22 goals in 19 matches is such a bad record.let's look at the lineup: excluding almunia, the defensive players fielded were sagna, silvestre, gallas, toure, denilson, eboue, diaby, song. that makes it 8 out of 10 defensive players! you might say that diaby was playing attacking midfield but look at his size and heigh 1.9m, he is better off being a defensive midfield as his speed and skill are below par. also look at his goals to match ratio. 4 goals in 49 matches, even players like patrick vieira and gilberto did better than that. surely few attacking midfielders are so incompetant. in the 82nd minute, Arsene even had the guts to take out Nasri and put in yet ANOTHER defensive player, clichy. that makes it 9 defensive players out of 10 players. this is utterly ridiculous, ,meaning that all the resonsibility lies on robin van persie, the only one to have a decent scoring record. normally teams like man utd, chelsea etc., and even the Arsenal invincibles have only 5 defensive players, (4 defenders and 1 defensive midfield). but arsenal have set a record of fielding 9 defensive players. i wonder what will happen in the next match.  would arsene wenger now replace van persie with djorou. that would be nice. they could have a 10-0-0 formation.</p>

              <p>i am also a gunner fan... i have to admit that i do share your thoughts... arsene wenger has lost it....</p>
              <p>the team is full of youngsters, and they are all so small size and lack the fight in them.</p>
              <p>when we lose just a few crucial player like adebayor and cesc, that is more than enough for other teams to kill us.</p>
              <p>i seriously hope that arsene wenger starts buying some DM and CB during the jan window, if not we can forget about the champions league next season. I doubt we will win anything this season.</p>
              <p>everyone is under-performing and i hate this arsenal team, so what if they are talented (arsene says so), i simply hate them all, win one match draw the next and the lose the next few, simply cannot pull a few wins together. So what if they won man utd and chelsea, when they lose to the lower teams. This is simply shit, stop relying on youngsters and get some experience in.</p>
              <p>Mr arsene wenger, you have simply lost it this season.</p>

              <p>Arsenal is in decadence under Wenger. He is over reliant on youths, his beautiful football ideology is stupid and seems to be looking for bargain deals. Plus those youngsters are too inconsistent, even people like V. Persie.</p>
              <p>My Arsenal supporter friends also feel Arsenal cmi already.</p>
              <p>Wenger should be replaced I think he is bringing down the Arsenal team. Like can't seem to catch up with the times. If not, they might slowly slide down from 4th position to god knows where in the coming years</p>
