              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsene Wenger admits he considered resting Theo Walcott for Arsenal's 4-0 victory at Blackburn Rovers. </strong></p>
              <p>Walcott was in sparkling form for England in midweek
              as the teenage attacker grabbed a hat-trick in the World Cup qualifying
              win in Croatia.</p>
              <p>The temptation to take Walcott out of the
              spotlight played on Wenger's mind, but the youngster set up the opener
              for Robin van Persie before Emmanuel Adebayor plundered a hat-trick.</p>
              <p>Asked if he considered resting Walcott, Wenger told <em>Sky Sports</em>: "Yes, I rotate the players and I did rest completely Nicklas Bendtner, who didn't play at all.</p>
              <p>"He
              had a little ankle problem and played two games for Denmark. We gave
              some time to Jack Wilshere, 16, and Aaron Ramsey, 17. It's good we have
              a young squad, but very talented."</p>
              <h4>Defensive praise</h4>
              <p>Though there was an emphatic nature to the scoreline at Ewood Park, Arsenal boss Wenger was also keen to praise his defence.</p>
              <p>He
              added: "I think we did well and it was a good defensive performance.
              Just because we scored four goals, you may think it was all Arsenal,
              but Blackburn played well.</p>
              <p>"They were dangerous as well going forward and we had to defend very well, especially on crosses in the first half.</p>
              <p>"The second goal before half-time certainly was a big blow for them and, after that, three and four came logically."</p>
              <p>Wenger
              also believes his players are starting to hit their stride this season
              after making it three wins in a row in all competitions.</p>
              <p>"I believe that fluency is one of our strengths and to be clinical was very important today," he continued.</p>
              <p>"We
              have found slowly our rhythm and our pace. We scored four against
              Twente, three against Newcastle and four today and we slowly get
              confident and physically ready to play."</p>
