              <p>The Frenchman has been linked with a move away from St James' Park following reports that he is unsettled on Tyneside.</p>
              <p>N'Zogbia, who started 27 Premier League matches last season, has four years remaining on his current deal.</p>
              <p>However, the 22-year-old has revealed that he will hold talks with manager Kevin Keegan to discuss his future at the club.</p>
              <h4>Dream</h4>
              <p>N'Zogbia told <em>France Football</em>:
              "At the end of last season I didn't play a lot, so that has given me
              desire to play somewhere else. When I will talk with the coach it will
              be clearer. My priority is to play.</p>
              <p>"I have dreamt about Arsenal
              since I was kid. I would be delighted to join the Gunners. It is a
              famous team that has big coverage in France. But Tottenham is exciting
              too.</p>
              <p>"I have never played in Ligue 1. That could be an experience
              in my career. But frankly, it is not my current priority. I am playing
              in one of the best leagues in the world. And I feel a little like at
              home here."</p>
