We have so many games in December, so it is very difficult to be concentrated on this kind of thing as we are playing every three days.<br><br>"I am just focused on every game and for the contract, we will see a bit later."<br><br>Flamini looked set to leave Emirates Stadium in the summer when being linked to big clubs in both Italy and Spain, but in the end he stayed under WengerÂ’s wing and has not looked back since.<br><br>The combative star believes The Gunners have demonstrated in their performances this season that they are ready to battle for the title Â– a fighting quality that has perhaps eluded them in recent years.<br><br>"We have proven that against Villa and other games away, and we did it again on Sunday," the midfielder said. "We won the fight and at the end we played our own game.<br><br>"The team spirit was fantastic again and when you see that on the pitch, you believe we can win every game.<br><br>"Everybody else thinks we could not do it, but we did because we were strong.<br><br>"Last season we were missing a little bit in the fight in these kind of games. This year we have it. The spirit is fantastic, and are working for each other."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sign a new deal pelase flamster!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></div>
