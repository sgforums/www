            <div class='col-md body'>Cesc Fabregas has admitted even he was surprised by his sudden rise into the Arsenal first-team at such a young age.<br><br>Still only 19, Fabregas' Premiership debut came at the start of the 2004/05 season as he was thrust in by Arsene Wenger to challenge Gilberto and Patrick Vieira for a place in The Gunners' midfield.<br><br>Having arrived at Arsenal from Barcelona in 2003, the Spanish midfielder was shocked to find himself playing regularly in the Premiership little more than a year later.<br><br>"I certainly wasn't thinking about it (making the first-team)," Fabregas told The Times. "I knew they were great players, but I also never really thought of the first team at that point.<br><br>"I mean, I was there to play for the youth team, I never imagined I would have to worry about the first team's midfield, let alone those two.<br><br>"I was 16 years old, normally players get a chance when they turn 22 or thereabouts. I thought it would be the same for me. I certainly did not imagine that, in less than a year, I'd be playing regularly alongside them."<br><br>Fabregas has since gone on and replaced Vieira as the leader in Arsenal's midfield after the Frenchman's departure for Juventus in 2005.<br><br>The youngster was out to prove he was the new midfield enforcer when they came face-to-face in the UEFA Champions League the following season.<br><br>"The truth is that someone, I won't say who, told me to go in hard and show Vieira that I was not going to be intimidated by him," Fabregas said.<br><br>"He was and remains one of my heroes, but, on the pitch, it was going to be all business."<br><br>Fabregas believes he has been able to adapt to the physical nature of the English game and has bulked out a great deal.<br><br>He added: "Gilberto says that he always has to come and defend me, but he's a big liar. The truth is that I've learnt to take care of myself.<br><br>"A season or two ago I was perhaps a bit more lightweight and maybe some opponents took some liberties with me.<br><br>"Now I think I'm tougher and I need to be, because given the way we play now and the way our opponents play, I have a lot less space than before. Usually there's a guy on me from the very first minute, so I had to stiffen up."</div>
