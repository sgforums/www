              <p>United wrapped up a third consecutive top-flight crown with a 0-0 draw at home to the Gunners on Saturday afternoon.</p>
              <p>Arsenal
              will finish the domestic season in fourth place, having also been
              knocked out of the UEFA Champions League by United at the semi-final
              stage.</p>
              <p>Wenger paid tribute to United's success, but hopes his youthful Gunners team can match the newly-crowned champions next term.</p>
              <h4>Learned</h4>
              <p>"Deep down I wish it was us not Manchester United," said Wenger of the title party going on within earshot.</p>
              <p>"But that is sport. They were the better team this year, so congratulations to them.</p>
              <p>"We have to make sure that it is on our side next year.</p>
              <p>"Things
              can change quickly, but what we have seen today shows we have the
              quality to be up there. We have to keep believing in these players and
              work hard.</p>
              <p>"They have learned a lot this year."</p>
              <p>So
              committed to the Arsenal cause is Wenger that he is believed to have
              turned down the chance to coach Bayern Munich before Louis van Gaal was
              appointed at the Allianz Arena this week.</p>
              <p>Wenger refused to
              answer directly when asked about the issue, preferring instead to focus
              on Arsenal's exploits in a season he does not feel was quite the
              disaster many made it out to be.</p>
              <p>"We were not that far off," he said.</p>
              <p>"Since
              November we have lost one game and that was after the disappointment of
              losing to Manchester United in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"We were close in the Champions League and close in the FA Cup and have been remarkably consistent since November.</p>
              <p>"At
              the moment the team is not getting the credit it deserves, but it is
              down to us to come back next year and show the same consistency."</p>
