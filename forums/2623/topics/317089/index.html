              <h1>Ben Arfa Cool On Arsenal Link</h1>
              <p>Hatem Ben Arfa says he will wait to see what happens regarding Arsenal's reported interest in igning him.<br> <br> The pacy Lyon winger has been linked to both The Gunners and Marseille,
              with Lyon boss Alain Perrin apparently not convinced enmough abnout his
              talent to give him regular run-outs for Les Gones.<br> <br> Ben Arfa, 21, was voted Ligue 1's Young Player of the Season on Sunday,
              despite not getting many starts lately, and has been asked about his
              future after Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger last week said that he wants
              to sign a ‘creative midfielder.’ <br> <br> The France international has reportedly been scouted by Arsenal, and in
              response to questions about a possible summer move to North London, he
              told L'<br> Equipe: “I do not pay attention to this. If I had to pay attention to everything that is in the papers…<br> <br> “That is true that we have spoken about Arsenal, but we will see how it is going to happen.<br> <br> “If I stay at Lyon, it is to play. Wherever I go, it will be to play.<br> <br> “The season is not over yet, two games are remaining [one in Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France final].<br> <br> “Today I am at Lyon. We will see what tomorrow is made of.<br> <br> “I try to give my maximum and to give everything when I am on the pitch.<br> <br> “It is frustrating when I am on the bench but it is part of the job.”</p>

              <h1>Ben Arfa Confirms Arsenal Talks</h1>
              <p><strong>Talks have taken place  </strong></p>
              <p>The French international, who has accumulated five caps for his
              country, has been heavily linked with a move to the Emirates Stadium
              over the last week, and the winger has suggested that talks are
              ongoing. </p>
              <p>"It is true that we have spoken about and to Arsenal, but we will see how it is going to happen," Ben Arfa told L’Equipe.    </p>
              <p><strong>First-team football a priority  </strong></p>
              <p>Whatever happens this summer, the twenty-two year old has stressed
              that he will only be playing for a club where he will be a regular
              first team player next season. </p>
              <p>"If I stay at Lyon, it is to play. Wherever else I go, it will be to play,” added Ben Afra. </p>
              <p><strong>Season still on</strong></p>
              <p>Ben Afra, who is valued at around £13 million, says that his
              immediate priority is the completion of the domestic season in France. </p>
              <p>"The season is not over yet, two games are remaining (one in the
              league, followed by the Coupe de France final). Today I am at Lyon. We
              will see what tomorrow is made of. I try to give my maximum and to give
              everything when I am on the pitch," he concluded.    </p>
              <p>The left-sided player appeared in all eight of his team’s Champions
              League matches this season before their eventual exit to Manchester
              United in the round-of-sixteen.</p>
