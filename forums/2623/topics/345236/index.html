              <p>How bout some good news to lift the spirits of Arsenal fans!</p>
              <p><img src="http://bleacherreport.com/images_root/image_pictures/0189/0548/46946_feature.jpg" alt="" width="358" height="243"></p>
              <p>At a soaking wet Britannia Stadium last night, 10-man Arsenal
              secured a 2-2 draw with Stoke in the Barclays Premier Reserve League.</p>
              <p>Prior to kick-off, all talk was of the second outing in the reserve
              team for Arsenal's Eduardo after his horrific leg break nearly a year
              ago. The Croatian international had made his comeback in a reserve game
              against Portsmouth but only lasted until half-time, going off with a
              slight hamstring injury.</p>
              <p>However, last night was great news for Arsenal fans as Eduardo
              managed to complete a full 90 minutes of football. Although he didn't
              look his sharpest, he grew into the match and there were flashes from
              the Brazilian born forward.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's number nine even managed to find the net with a neat
              finish, sadly it was ruled offside. On a good note it shouldn't be too
              long more until Eduardo makes his return to the first team squad, if
              not against Cardiff in the FA Cup on Sunday, then against West Ham the
              following week.</p>
              <p>One would think it would be hard to overshadow such a moment as Eduardo's first full 90 minutes since his awful injury.</p>

              <p>Well it was mightly overshadowed in the most brilliant of ways, step forward Jack Wilshere.</p>
              <p>For months, Arsene Wenger has been waxing lyrical about the
              17-year-old Englishman who has come through the ranks at the Arsenal
              academy. Wilshere has been compared to Liam Brady, Liam Brady said it
              was an honour to be mentioned in the same breath as Wilshere.</p>
              <p>Wait, an Arsenal legend has said it is an honour to be mentioned in the same light as a 17-year-old boy?</p>
              <p>Yes and last night Arsenal fans saw why with a brace from the Arsenal midfielder known as Jackie Boy.</p>
              <p>The Potters went ahead from an Ashley Page effort in the 19th minute
              which was cancelled out five minutes later by a stunning Jack Wilshere
              goal that had more than a mere tinge of Liam Brady to it.</p>
              <p>Sometimes words are not enough to describe a thing of beauty, so you will just have to judge for yourself.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/30szr68.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="184"></p>
              <p>If this is not poetry in motion, then what is?</p>
              <p>Stoke then went in front yet again just before the hour mark and
              things were made all the worse for the Gunners when Captain Mark
              Randall was given a straight red card.</p>
              <p>However, within minutes of going behind Arsenal were back to level terms thanks to<span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>–</span>yes, you guessed it<span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>–</span>Jack Wilshere.</p>
              <p>Both sides had chances to nick a victory in the end but it finished all square at the final whistle.</p>
              <p>Arsenal fans will look forward to seeing more of Eduardo and indeed Jack Wilshere as the weeks progress.</p>
              <p>Oh, just in case any clubs are getting any ideas<span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>–</span>Jack Wilshere is on an eight year contract, go find your own Liam Brady!</p>
