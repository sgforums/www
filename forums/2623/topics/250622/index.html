It is possible that I could return to La Liga at any time."<br><br>However, Fabregas has denied the claims that a move is imminent, saying he sees his immediate future with The Gunners.<br><br>Meanwhile, Real Madrid striker Robinho has announced his intention to quit professional football at the age of 30 to teach young children how to play the game.<br><br>The 23-year-old Brazil star intends to finish his career with former club Santos and then to help youngsters.<br><br>"My idea is to play professional football until the age of 30, retire at Santos and then dedicate myself to teaching football to young children," he told the South American press.<br><br>"I want to return to Santos to win the Copa Libertadores before hanging up my boots."<br><br>For now, however, Robinho is focused only on helping Real, and feels he is starting to settle in at the club.<br><br>"Obviously, I don't like to spend so much time sitting on the bench because, like all players, I want to be on the pitch.<br><br>"I hope I can help my team in each match as I feel more secure now and want to be able to do my bit."</span></div>
