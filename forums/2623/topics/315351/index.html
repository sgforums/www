              <p>Arsène Wenger has yet to decide if <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/player.asp?thisNav=news&amp;plid=66633&amp;clid=4421&amp;cpid=703">William Gallas</a> will stay on as Arsenal captain next season.</p>
              <p>The French central defender took the arm-band at the start of the
              current campaign after Thierry Henry moved to Barcelona. However
              Arsenal's failure to win a trophy has brought everyone at the Club
              under the microscope, manager and captain alike.</p>
              <p>At his press conference on Friday, Wenger was asked directly if
              Gallas would be leading the team out next season. He refused to commit
              either way but praised the 30-year-old for his efforts and said a
              decision would be made after reflection in the summer.</p>
              <p>"I cannot answer that question at the moment," said the 58-year-old.
              "I want to analyse the season after it has finished. At the moment he
              will be my captain until the end of the season.</p>
              <p>"I believe he has learned a lot this year and I can only say that
              his commitment and desire to do well was exceptional. For the rest, I
              wouldn't like to go into any individual assessment at the moment.</p>
              <p>"I made that decision and I have to stand up for that decision, I
              have to protect the team and the individuals as well at the moment.
              They get criticised and maybe we deserve critics at the moment.</p>
              <p>"But, overall, the team has made good progress this year and the most important thing is we finish well now."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Screw Captain William. I want Flamini to be captain if he signs a new contract or our wonderkid Cesc!</em></p>

              <p>he should have put Gilberto as captain for this and next season.. and then when Gilberto retires, put the armband on Fabregas since Cesc is already running the whole of the Arsenal midfield..</p>
              <p>by then, Cesc would be older and wiser.. and would be ready for the responsibility... also, then, Cesc would be considered a "veteran" of many seasons...</p>
              <p>i think Wenger dropped the ball this time...</p>
              <p>Gallas is not the best captain, and by not putting it on Gilberto, demoralised the hell out of a pretty good leader</p>

              <p>Doubt Gilberto will stay, maybe put Toure as captain and hand it to Fabregas when he's older provided he does not leave</p>
