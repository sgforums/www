            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wenger guarded over future</strong><br><br>Arsene Wenger tonight vowed to speak about his Arsenal future 'at the right moment'.<br><br>Wenger has a year to run on his current deal and Arsenal fans, reeling from the departure of Thierry Henry to Barcelona, will be praying he decides to extend it.<br><br>But the Frenchman was in relaxed mood when quizzed about his future after Arsenal's 2-0 friendly win over Barnet at Underhill.<br><br>Asked if he thought he would stay beyond his existing contract, he told Sky Sports News: 'I have shown my commitment in the past.'<br><br>Pressed on whether that meant he would be staying, he added: 'I will come out at the right moment......maybe when you don't ask me the question.'<br><br>Cesc Fabregas, a target for Real Madrid, has given Wenger a boost by committing his future to the Gunners.<br><br>'I think Cesc has shown many times that he is committed to the club and Cesc in my mind will never leave,' said Wenger.<br><br>'He has six or seven years of contract left and we have lost Thierry Henry. We want to keep things as stable as possible.'<br><br>Wenger is confident that Arsenal can cope in the post-Henry era.<br><br>'I think we have good potential to do it,' he stressed. 'I think we will focus more on sharing the responsibility that Thierry had up front. There will be more focus on team play and not relying so much on one individual.<br><br>'I also think there are some players will take on more responsibility - like (Robin) Van Persie, like (Emmanuel) Adebayor, like (Theo) Walcott, like Eduardo, who has just joined us. There are certain players who raise their game when you have a departure like that.'<br><br>Wenger is expecting another departure with Jose Antonio Reyes, who was on loan to Real Madrid last season, keen to make the move permanent.<br><br>'I think he will go. I think it will help him to go to Spain because there is no way you can have an unhappy player.'<br><br>Arsenal's win over League Two outfit came courtesy of goals from Adebayor and Nacer Bazarite.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Wenger wanted Henry stay*<br><br>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has confirmed he did not want star striker Thierry Henry to leave for Barcelona this summer.</strong><br><br>The France international joined the Spanish giants last month following a successful eight-year spell with The Gunners.<br><br>Arsenal fans were disappointed to see their idol depart and Wenger has confirmed is was ultimately the French ace who decided to end his tenure in England.<br><br>Wenger believes Henry may have reached a point where he needs to win trophies and may not have been prepared to wait for Arsenal's youngsters to mature.<br><br>"Of course you don't want to lose a world-class player without having thought about it," he told the News of the World. "At the end of the day, it was his decision.<br><br>"He wanted to leave. You don't make a decision like that in a minute. You check to see if the player is really completely sure of what he wants to do.<br><br>"But Thierry Henry's decision is down to him. It's not my decision. He wanted to make the move.<br><br>"He's nearly 30. Maybe he didn't have the patience anymore to let the young team develop. You can understand that. It was a tough decision."<br><br>Meanwhile, Wenger believes Freddie Ljungberg will be an Arsenal player next season after failing to secure a summer move away from the Emirates.<br><br>The experienced Gunners boss is confident that following a failed Fiorentina switch Ljungberg will be with the North Londoners come August.<br><br>"At the moment Freddie stays," he continued. "I expect him to be here because he has not left yet and I'm 90 per cent sure he will be."</div>
