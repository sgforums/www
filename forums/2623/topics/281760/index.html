"He is a great player but it was not easy to play alongside him.<br><br>"We were a bit inhibited by him - dependent on everything he wanted to do and his demands. Now it is different."<br><br>Fabregas has been in inspirational form for the Gunners so far this season and has already scored six goals in nine games.<br><br>He was again on the mark as he grabbed a goal in helping his side to thrashing Derby 5-0 and he insisted the doom merchants only served to galvanise Arsenal when Henry left.<br><br>"Everyone was saying that this year without Henry we would be nowhere and that has motivated everyone."</div>

The pace of the game, the attacking style.<br><br>"I feel like a kid playing in the street."<br><br>Fabregas proceeded to candidly reveal that Henry's move to Camp Nou lifted a weight of apprehension from those that felt intimidated by the Frenchman's presence.<br><br>It would be fair to suggest Arsenal have played with an unbridled enthusiasm and freedom this season, that was conspicuous by its absence in Henry's final campaign with the club.</div>
