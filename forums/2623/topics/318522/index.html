              <p>The Belarus
              international has been heavily linked with a move away from the
              Emirates, having earned strong interest from Internazionale, Barcelona
              and Real Madrid.<br><br>And agent Niki Spilevski revealed that the
              27-year-old will leave North London this summer, following crunch talks
              with Gunners boss Arsene Wenger.<br><br>“I can officially confirm that a short time ago Alexander decided that he will leave Arsenal and join another club,” he said. <br><br>“Of course Arsenal and Arsene wanted him to stay but they have accepted the player’s choice.”</p>
              <p><strong>Change</strong><br><br>Hleb moved to Arsenal for â‚¤11.2 million from
              Bundesliga outfit VfB Stuttgart in 2005, and has since established
              himself alongside Cesc Fabregas as one of the team’s key creative
              outlets.<br><br>But the midfielder has grown weary of the
              hustle-and-bustle of London, and Spilevski confirmed that his client
              seeks a fresh challenge.<br><br>“That is his choice,” he said. “He has understood that the right time has come for him to make a change. <br><br>“Alex
              has spent three good seasons at Arsenal and he wasn’t sure he could
              maintain the same level that he has been showing if he stayed. <br><br>“It’s
              also true that he felt uncomfortable off the field. Alexander wants a
              change of scene. That’s had a large part to play in his decision. <br><br>“Alex informed the club of his desire to move to another club.”<br><br><strong>Talks</strong><br><br>Wenger
              was livid upon learning that Hleb held talks with Inter officials
              before the end of the season, and threatened to banish the player to
              the reserves.<br><br>The Frenchman feared Hleb would enact article 17,
              a FIFA rule that allows players to buy out their own contract if they
              have played in a particular country for a certain amount of time.<br><br>But Spilevski denied that his client would exploit the clause, and insisted that Hleb’s future should be sorted during the week.<br><br>“We are not using article 17 of the FIFA rule,” he said. “I can’t tell you anything about where he will be playing yet. <br><br>“Talks
              are underway, and I don’t have the right to make them public. I think
              that the issue of his new club will be clarified in the next few days.”</p>

              <p>The Belarus
              international initially struggled at Arsenal following his â‚¤11 million
              move from VfB Stuttgart in 2005, many labelling him a flop by the end
              of his second season in England.<br><br>But the 27-year-old finally
              clicked last season to become one of the Gunners’ key creative outlets,
              combining with Cesc Fabregas to form a lethal attacking thrust from
              midfield.</p>
              <p>The former BATE man has still failed to settle completely to life in
              London, however, and in recent weeks has been strongly linked with the
              likes of Inter Milan, Barcelona and Real Madrid.<br><br>Hleb claims his
              time at the Emirates has been a real eye-opener, admitting he was
              completely unprepared for the pace and power of the Premier League,
              despite his experience in Germany.<br><br><strong>The Best</strong><br><br>"I have learned in England that there is still so much to improve," Hleb told <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine</em>. "I have always dreamed of playing in a great club. Now I have learned that it is not so easy and a lot of work.<br><br>"The
              first year was a killer. I felt very lonely. It was clear that The
              Premier League would be a challenge - but with this pace, I have not
              expected this. The Bundesliga is still a good league, but a season in
              England feels like two in Germany.<br><br>"I will tell you an example:
              When I was here at the beginning, everything went chop chop, so fast.
              The pace was madness, even in training. I look for the ball in front of
              me, then where I can play it - when I looked down again the ball was
              gone.<br><br>"The English league is the best league in the world."</p>

              <p>The Barcelona-based
              daily reports that the Belarussian midfielder met with Txiki
              Begiristain, Barça's technical secretary, yesterday in Germany.<br><br>The
              meeting between the two in Kaiserslautern apparently went well, meaning
              that, if Hleb is to join up with the blaugrana, all they must do now is
              reach a transfer agreement with Arsenal.<br><br>However, this is where
              the difficulty lies, for other clubs are interested in the midfielder.
              Inter Milan of Italy are one of them, while Real Madrid coach Bernd
              Schuster admitted his admiration for the Gunner yesterday.</p>
              <p>What's more, the man himself stated that the Premier League is the best
              in the world, and may even look to remain in England while also leaving
              the Emirates, unlikely though that may be.<br><br>In any case, El Mundo Deportivo believe that an asking price of between €15m and €20m may be requested of any suitor.</p>

              <p>The future of the
              Belarus international has been cast into doubt in recent weeks after
              statements from Hleb’s agent Nikolai Shpilevski claiming last week that
              Wenger had accepted the player’s wish to leave Emirates Stadium.<br> <br>However,
              the playmaker has not completely ruled out a move and has said that if
              he does depart, it would be to Italy or Spain and not to another
              Premier League side.<br> <br>Real Madrid and Inter Milan have both
              shown their interest in weeks gone by, while reports in Spain on
              Wednesday claimed that Barcelona have a verbal agreement to sign the former Stuttgart star.<br> <br>However, the
              27-year-old has angrily rejected suggestions that he has publicly
              stated his desire to leave the North London club and claims he would
              never show such disrespect to manager Arsene Wenger.<br> <br>“I also see everything on television and the newspapers," Hleb told Setanta Sports.<br> <br> "I
              have a contract at Arsenal until 2010. I have also read [that I have
              said I want to leave], but I do not know who has written it. That is
              nonsense.<br><br>“I have also read that I wanted to move because Arsenal would win nothing, this too is nonsense.<br> <br>“But
              I would really not like to comment on the issue really because there is
              nothing more to say, because the club means so much to me.<br> <br>“I
              have learned so much from Arsene Wenger. This man has always supported
              me and given me the chance to come to Arsenal. I would therefore never
              say anything negative about Arsenal.<br> <br>“If I’ll go, then only in a different league, in any case, in England, there is only Arsenal for me.”<br> <br>Hleb
              enjoyed a superb season for Arsenal, perhaps his best since arriving in
              England, but ultimately The Gunners ended up empty-handed when as their
              bids for the Premier League and the Champions League ran out of steam,
              with both trophies being won by Manchester United.<br> <br><strong>Empty-Handed</strong><br> <br>And
              at 27, Hleb admits he is concerned at finishing his career with a bare
              trophy cabinet after coming through three seasons in North London
              empty-handed.<br><br>“Titles are the most important thing,” Hleb added.<br> <br>“You can play very well, perhaps one of the best ever, but after the career you ask what you have won.<br> <br>“To
              win a title is also the most important thing for me. The clock is
              ticking but it is simply not happening. It is very difficult.<br> <br>“In this year I thought that I would win two titles, but as I said everything went wrong.<br> <br>“I do not know what happened. Suddenly everything was gone. It is a pity because this season it was going very well.<br> <br>“I
              think I played quite well, even though it could have been better. I am
              satisfied. Only with the end that we have no title, I am obviously not
              satisfied.”</p>

              told the press that Internazionale, under the tutelage of ex-Chelsea
              boss José Mourinho, have cooled their interest in the midfielder, and
              with Real Madrid yet to make their move, Barcelona are in the driver's

              <p>"But it's a shame that we didn't get to take him to Italy as he was well-admired at Inter.<br><br>"Mourinho has chosen a different path, focusing on his own players."<br><br>Hleb is rumoured to have already agreed personal terms with Barça, meaning that the club must now seek an accord with Arsenal.</p>

              club look set to continue the rebuilding of their squad as they plan on
              mounting a serious European challenge upon their return to the

              his wish to leave the Gunners on multiple occasions and an array of
              top-flight clubs is believed to be interested in his services.<br><br>Although
              Barcelona were reportedly leading the chase for the 27-year-old
              midfielder, Bayern Munich's interest may well hinder his move to Camp
              Nou.</p>
              <p>A transfer to Allianz Arena would represent Hleb's return to Germany
              after six years of play at VfB Stuttgart, which ended in 2005 when he
              moved to England.<br><br>It is believed that the Bavarian club are
              ready to put together an offer worth €15 million for Hleb, a figure
              Arsenal will agree with, according to reports.</p>

              <p>Having lost Mathieu Flamini to AC Milan, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger
              is looking to bring in a new top-class holding midfielder - and sees
              Ivory Coast international Yaya Toure, brother of Gunner Kolo Toure, as
              the ideal replacement for Flamini.<br> <br> According to some reports, Barcekona have already agreed terms with
              Hleb's agent regarding his side of the proposed transfer - but the
              Catalan giants appear reluctant to include Toure as part of the deal.<br> <br> "Nothing has been decided as yet," said Begiristain.<br> <br> "But we want Yaya to stay with us and he is not on the market.<br> <br> "[Barca's new manager Josep] Guardiola considers him to be an important player in his new project."<br> <br> Toure has previously said he would love to be playing in the same club
              side as his elder brother Kolo, and it seems Arsenal, irritated by the
              public courting of some of their players by Spanish and Italian clubs,
              are prepared to play hardball and only agree transfers that offer them
              something as well.</p>

              <p>The Belorussian has
              made it clear that he is keen to leave the Emirates this summer and the
              Blaugrana looked to be favourites to secure his services, but the
              prolonged chase could be called off.<br><br>Arsenal are reportedly
              holding out for €20m and Barça are refusing to go to that amount
              because they do not feel that the former Stuttgart playmaker is worth
              that.<br><br>Hleb has also not been seen to do enough to help persuade
              the Gunners to let him go to Camp Nou and the Catalan outfit may well
              take their search elsewhere.</p>
