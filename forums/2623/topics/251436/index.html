            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal kept up the pressure on third-placed Liverpool following a 3-1 victory over Fulham, which leaves Lawrie Sanchez's men with much to do to stay in the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>The fast-fading Cottagers have failed to win for 10 league matches, and are just one point above the relegation zone after being well beaten at Emirates Stadium, despite a brief rally when they levelled through Simon Davies.<br><br>Julio Baptista, on loan from Real Madrid, had fired the Gunners into an early lead, only for the hosts to be pegged back inside the final 13 minutes following a mistake by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.<br><br>Â• Wenger wants 'good communication' with board<br><br>However, victory was secured through a fine finish from Emmanuel Adebayor and Gilberto's late penalty.<br><br>Given the rest of the weekend's results and the impending visit of Liverpool, it could well be an all-or-nothing trip to Middlesbrough on the final day of the season for Fulham if they are to remain in the top-flight.<br><br>Arsenal, meanwhile, will head into their last two matches of the season - against Chelsea and then at Portsmouth - with renewed hope they can at least salvage a third place finish from what has been a campaign of disappointment at their impressive new home.<br><br>There was a minute's applause before the match in honour of the late former Arsenal and England midfielder Alan Ball, as well as ex-Gunner Arthur Milton, who had played both football and cricket for his country.<br><br>The home faithful did not have to wait long before they were on their feet again as Arsenal raced into the lead after just four minutes.<br><br>Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor held the ball up on the edge of the box, before knocking it back to Alexander Hleb and accepting a quick return.<br><br>The big African then ghosted into the right side of the area, and chipped a cross back to the far post.<br><br>Baptista got in front of rightback Liam Rosenior to power a header past Antti Niemi for his 10th goal of the season.<br><br>Arsenal had so often this season trailed here to early goals - a trait which proved costly to their hopes of challenging for the title.<br><br>There seemed no such problems this afternoon, however, as Fulham looked everything like a side in freefall at the wrong end of the table.<br><br>On 15 minutes, Arsenal had another great chance.<br><br>Full-back Gael Clichy broke quickly down the right, and cut the ball back from the edge of the area to Fabregas.<br><br>He in turn fed Baptista on the overlap, but this time the Brazilian, on loan from Real Madrid, drilled his shot horribly wide.<br><br>In a rare moment of action at the other end, Rosenior almost atoned for his error when he drilled a 20-yard half-volley over the ball.<br><br>As the half-hour mark passed, Hleb was sent away down the right, and his cut-back from the goalline found Cesc Fabregas on the penalty spot.<br><br>The Spaniard went to place the ball in the bottom corner, but somehow Niemi got down to his left to produce a brilliant reaction save.<br><br>The Finn was at it again when, on 32 minutes, he produced an acrobatic flying stop to keep out a bullet header from Adebayor following Clichy's left-wing cross.<br><br>Fulham, to their credit, slowly started to see more of the ball as half-time approached.<br><br>However the visitors were unable to find a decisive pass in the final third to unlock the home defence.<br><br>Once again, Arsenal pressed from kick-off following the restart and it should have been 2-0 on 48 minutes.<br><br>Hleb fed the ball to Adebayor on the edge of the Fulham penalty area.<br><br>The Togo striker made space for himself, and shaped to shoot.<br><br>However, Philippe Christanval recovered ground well and pressurised Adebayor enough for him to blast the ball horribly wide.<br><br>There was then a warning for Arsenal, however, when midfielder Claus Jensen flashed a low 18-yard drive across goal.<br><br>Fulham continued to frustrate the home side and enjoyed a decent spell of their own as the hour mark approached.<br><br>Fulham grabbed a lifeline with 13 minutes left when Lehmann came to punch a deep left-wing cross, under pressure from substitute Heidar Helguson.<br><br>The German - who signed a new, one-year deal with the Gunners on Friday - failed to make decent contact.<br><br>The loose ball fell to Simon Davies on the edge of the box, and he swiftly lobbed in back into the net.<br><br>Lehmann had to then save from Brown at the near post - before Arsenal restored their lead with a quick counter-attack on 84 minutes.<br><br>Fabregas picked out Adebayor on the edge of the Fulham area. He turned inside Christanval before dispatching a low strike into the bottom left corner.<br><br>Gilberto wrapped things up from the penalty spot after Brown had brought down Hleb.<br><br># Wenger wants 'good communication' with board<br><br>Arsene Wenger conceded his team had yet again been wasteful in front of goal.<br><br>He said: 'We started well and created many chances but then slowly dropped our level and became average. Fulham came back to 1-1 and that woke us up.<br><br>'We had many chances and couldn't finish the game off. They never gave up and when they came back we had to have a good reaction again.'<br><br>Wenger was then asked about his relationship with the Gunners board, with speculation continuing that David Dein's departure may yet impact on his future at the club beyond next summer.<br><br>'It is important to have good communication and good confidence from the board to make good decisions, I always had that since I arrived,' he added.<br><br>'I had a very strong relationship with David, so if there is a new era without David we have to find the right balance, but the confidence of the board is always there.'<br><br>Cottagers boss Sanchez felt his side were guilty of being 'naive' in chasing a win after Davies' equaliser.<br><br>'Football can be cruel at times. When you've worked as hard as we have, to come away with a 3-1 defeat is very cruel.<br><br>'In the first half we should have been out of the equation and I said to the players at half-time `now is the chance to show what you can do', but ultimately we shot ourselves in the foot.<br><br>'Arsenal do waste chances, you've got to give (goalkeeper) Antti Niemi credit for making some great saves but when they only scored one goal I was happy, and I thought we ground them down in the second half.<br><br>'But we forgot what we were here for - which was to be solid - and we got caught.<br><br>'It's naivety, a little rush of blood to the head. But we learn from it, and I said to the boys `if you give us that second-half performance again in the next two games we will be all right.'</div>
