There will be news on the contract next week."<br><br>Wenger has told Usmanov he does not need fresh investment to make Arsenal successful.<br><br>Chelsea and Manchester United have spent heavily but Wenger is convinced his policy of developing young talent rather than making big-money signings will yield silverware.<br><br>"If I want to buy a player today then I have money available," he said.<br><br>"Maybe I'll need money in four, five or six years but that will depend on how much money the other clubs have and what the average salary is.<br><br>"I believe I can compete and be successful because I have a team that can win the Premiership and do well in the Champions League. That's why I'm here.<br><br>"There are many ways to work in the game. We buy good players when they come onto the market, but generally we have gone for a different solution and we will continue to do that.<br><br>"I'm not saying other clubs have got it wrong. Instead we're doing it our way and are happy with that. It's my decision to take this route."<br><br>Arsenal have been drawn alongside Sevilla or AEK Athens, Steaua Bucharest and Slavia Prague in Group H of the Champions League with Wenger claiming the opening game will be crucial.<br><br>"We have two eastern European countries in Bucharest, who are traditionally a good technical side, and Slavia Prague, who caused the shock of the qualifiers," he said.<br><br>"They knocked Ajax out in a convincing way because they won two games. I don't think we have to speak about Sevilla because they are one of the four or five best teams in Europe.<br><br>"We start at home to Sevilla, which will be very important to us. To beat Sevilla at home will give us a very good chance to qualify."</div>
