            <div class='col-md body'>Thierry Henry's agent will 'seek legal advice' after France Football magazine published a report that the player has agreed terms with Barcelona.<br><br>The Arsenal star's future has been the subject of speculation again this summer despite him signing a four-year contract with the Gunners last summer.<br><br>But his agent Jerome Anderson was categoric in denying the magazine's claims.<br><br>In a statement released to PA Sport, he said: 'No meetings have ever taken place between Jerome Anderson and Barcelona in France or anywhere else, and Jerome Anderson will be seeking legal advice against France Football.'<br><br>The report claims Anderson and Barca sporting director Txiki Beguiristain spoke last week regarding a three-year deal with an option of a fourth year, a claim Anderson has now strongly denied. Last week Henry told ESPNsoccernet that it was 'great to hear' reports of interest in him from European champions AC Milan, but stressed 'I am an Arsenal player at the moment'.<br><br>Henry went on to say he had been 'devastated' by the departure of vice-chairman David Dein, who left after a dispute with his fellow directors over the increased involvement of American businessman Stan Kroenke.<br><br>'The bosses have been unsettled and a lot of players at the club have been unsettled,' he added.<br><br>'I was devastated when Mr Dein left the club. I don't know what happened and I don't want to know but whatever went on, Mr Dein leaving was not a clever move.<br><br>'Although no-one is bigger than the club, Arsene Wenger and Mr Dein are really close to being Arsenal.<br><br>'So if you ask me if there was one person on the board I would not like to see leaving, I would have said Mr Dein.<br><br>'Unfortunately it is out of my hands. I don't agree with what has happened but sometimes that's the way things are. We just have to move on.'<br><br>Barca were linked with the player last summer before he signed his new contract with Arsenal, and Beguiristain was quoted in the English press saying his club were still monitoring Henry's situation.<br><br>'If he has the desire to play here, then we can see if it's going to happen or not,' Beguiristain told the Sunday Express.<br><br>'Barcelona remains the same. It is the perfect place for players who want to come here. I always say the same thing - it's down to the players to decide.'<br></div>
