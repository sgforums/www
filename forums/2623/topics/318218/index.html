              <p>The French
              international, hailed by many as the new Zinedine Zidane, has been
              linked with a move to the likes of Real Madrid and Juventus over the
              past two years.<br><br>He has continued to impress during his side's
              fleeting appearances in Europe but, despite signing a contract
              extension just weeks ago, looks set to leave the club this summer.<br><br>The
              signs were ominous on the final league day of the season, when the
              midfielder himself said it could be his last game for the club.</p>
              <p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has time and time again insisted that
              big players will be sought after ahead of big names. Nasri is somewhat
              a combination of both.<br><br>Though he may not be a household name just yet, his association with Zidane in itself has sent his market value sky-rocketing. <em>La Provence</em> contends that the Gunners, notoriously cautious in their transfer
              dealings, will have to shell out €17 million (which comes to
              approximately £13.5 million) to land the player.
              Arsenal were prepared to pay £10m initially, and have since improved
              their offer. Though it has not been accepted, an agreement is said to
              be close.</p>

              <h1>Nasri To Complete Arsenal Move Today</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/24505_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="165"></p>
              <p>The 20-year-old has established himself as one of the hottest prospects
              in Europe over the past few seasons and has been heavily linked with
              the Gunners in recent weeks.<br><br>Marseille-based newspaper <em>La Provence</em> reported last week that Nasri was on the verge of agreeing a â‚¤12.5 million move to the Emirates, and French daily <em>L’Equipe</em> has claimed the playmaker will travel to London to undergo a medical and agree personal terms.<br><br>The
              Algerian-descended playmaker only recently signed a new contract
              designed to keep him at Stade Velodrome until 2012, but it has since
              emerged the deal includes a release clause set at around â‚¤12 million.<br><br>Nasri
              is expected to replace the unsettled Aleksandr Hleb, who has received
              strong interest from Inter Milan and has recently been linked with
              Barcelona.<br><br>Gunner boss Arsene Wenger is likely to install Nasri
              on either flank, continuing his tradition of converting natural
              playmakers into wide midfielders, as he has done with the likes of
              Hleb, Tomas Rosicky and Robert Pires. <br><br>Nasri is expected to
              arrive in London in the morning, and will meet with Arsenal officials
              to agree personal terms before undergoing a medical at Shenley.<br><br>He
              will then be taken on a tour of the Emirates Stadium, and have his
              picture taken for the club’s official website, before flying out around
              7:30pm to hook up with France national team in Clairefontaine for their
              pre-EURO 2008 training camp.</p>

              <p>Marseille daily <em>La Provence</em> is reporting that the deal will be finalised "at the start of next
              week" after intense speculation over the past fortnight linking the
              player with a big money move.<br><br>It s thought the midfield maestro
              will cost the Gunners £11-13 million, having just recently signed a
              contract extension with l'OM, which many believed would keep him at the
              club for at least another year.<br><br>He has in the past been likened
              with the great Zinedine Zidane and, fittingly, courted by Zizou's two
              most prominent former clubs, Juventus and Real Madrid. However, speculated interest never materialised into a formal offer
              from either side, and Arsenal, who have had more tenuous and less
              publicised links with the player, look like the club who will make the
              swoop this summer.<br><br>Nasri's agent has confirmed that talks are in
              progress with the London club, but reports emerged yesterday hinting
              that the 20-year-old was in no hurry to leave his hometown club.<br><br>The
              press has been persistent in pushing this deal as final, but now the
              saga may finally be coming to an end, and Arsenal making the big-money
              signing that the fans had been calling for.<br><br>It is thought that
              Marseille will use the money generated from the Nasri transfer to
              finance a move for Lyon winger Hatem Ben Arfa - who was also linked
              with Arsenal - who, despite looking set to leave the seven-time Ligue 1
              winners, will not be leaving his native France...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is hopeful Marseille hero Samir Nasri will sign before Euro 2008 starts.</p>
              <p>The France international’s name has been at the top of The Gunners’
              shopping list over the past two weeks and it appears the playmaker will
              be transferred from L’OM before June 7.</p>
              <p>Wenger is a massive admirer of his fellow countryman, who has a
              certain experience of international and Champions League football
              having made his debut at the age of 17.</p>
              <p>Wenger is adamant an agreement could be reached in the very near future, and even before the European Championships start.</p>
              <p>“It has chances to happen,” he said about Nasri’s move to Emirates Stadium during the Sunday TV show Telefoot on Tf1.</p>
              <p>“And if it happens, it will be before the start of Euros.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>WOW!!!Le boss hinting already!!</em></p>

              <p>Samir Nasri tonight
              confirmed to French radio station RTL that his transfer to English
              giants Arsenal is progressing “normally” and the deal should be
              concluded over the course of the next few days. <br><br>Arsenal appear
              to be linked with every hot young French talent however it appears that
              there was substance in the rumours that Nasri's could move to north
              London.  <br><br>Nasri's interview with RTL was the first time that he
              has spoken of his move to the Gunners, who he is “99% certain” of
              joining in time for the start of next season. <br><br>The saga started immediately after the final game of
              the season, a dramatic victory over Strasbourg, when Nasri hinted that
              it would be his last for Marseille. Speculation that the talented
              creative midfielder would move to Arsenal was fuelled by his agent and
              finally the deal is close to being closed. <br><br>Marseille's
              brightest prospect had a highly effective performance in yesterday's
              2-0 victory over Ecuador with the French national side, linking well
              with Nicolas Anelka and Bafetimbi Gomis to act as a catalyst for the
              opening goal.  <br><br>Raymond Domenech elected to keep the 20 year-old
              in his 30 man squad on the back of this showing and other impressive
              performances towards the end of a season that Nasri helped guide
              Marseille to third spot in the French league and therefore a potential
              Champions League berth. <br><br>Nasri will turn 21 during the European
              Championships and will wish to celebrate his birthday with an
              appearance in the final with les Bleus.</p>

              <p>The top rated French
              playmaker is reportedly close to agreeing a £12.5 move to from
              Fiorentina, and the talks are apparently so advanced that some news
              publications in England claimed that the deal was already finalised
              earlier this week. <br><br>That is definitely not the case yet ,
              however, and Wenger has warned not to expect any new developments until
              after the European Championship.<br><br>“Nasri, he interests me,” Wenger confirmed to a French reporter.</p>
              <p>“I hope I will do it after the Euros.<br><br>“It is more complicated
              now because the wage differences [between the French and the English
              league] are not as big as they used to be.<br><br>“Just watch [Karim] Benzema. He is 20 and recently signed a new deal," he added.<br><br>“It
              is very difficult [to transfer players from the French league] but
              England is considered one of the two top leagues and the best players
              want to play against the best players.”<br><em><strong><br></strong></em></p>

              <p>French international midfielder Samir Nasri has agreed to join Arsenal from Olympique Marseille on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee.</p>
              <p>Nasri (21), who made two appearances for France in Euro 2008, was voted as the French Ligue 1 'Young Player of the Year' for 2006/07 and was also Olympique Marseille's Player of the Year for 2007.</p>
              <p>Nasri, has made twelve appearances (scoring twice) for the French national team, making his debut for his country in March 2007 in the 1-0 friendly win over Austria. He was also a French Under-21 international and part of the French Under-17s who won the European Championships in 2004.</p>
              <p>The young attacking midfielder made 145 appearances (scoring 11 goals) for Olympique Marseille, during which time he won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2005, was a French Cup runner-up in 2006 and 2007 and helped his side into third place in Ligue 1 last season, thus securing a UEFA Champions League place for next season.</p>
              <p>Manager Arsène Wenger said: "We are delighted to be signing Samir Nasri. He is young, quick and technically an outstanding player. He has shown great potential with his performances for Marseille and the French national team over the past two seasons and he will add great quality to our squad."</p>
              <p>Nasri added: "I'm very happy to become an Arsenal player, it means such a lot to me. This is a very important step in my life as a football player because Arsenal is a massive club. I really hope everything will go well for me here. I will do my best for Arsenal and its fans and I am honoured to be part of such a great football club."</p>
              </span></div>
              <p>Samir Nasri is due to join up with his new Arsenal team mates for pre-season training on 21st July.</p>
