            <div class='col-md body'><strong>William Gallas has told his Arsenal team-mates to regroup and learn from their mistakes in the 5-1 defeat to Tottenham.</strong><br><br>The Gunners' dreams of making it through to the Carling Cup final disappeared as they were thumped by their North London rivals.<br><br>Gallas admits there could be few complaints about the outcome but was upset by the way Arsenal failed to cope with the pressure of trying to come from behind.<br><br>He has also played down any suggestion that Arsenal may have been overconfident against a side they had not lost to since November 1999.<br><br>"It is difficult to accept this defeat and 5-1 is too much," Gallas told the club's official website.<br><br>"All the players are very disappointed and sad. I think Tottenham were better than us and we have to accept that.<br><br>"During the warm-up I said to the players it would be difficult because they have not beaten us and I said we have to be careful.<br><br>"We started the game well but we then conceded the goal and then everything was not good for us.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nervous</span></strong><br><br>"Sometimes it is difficult and it is not easy for some players to be calm. We were too nervous. We have to learn from that."<br><br>Gallas does not believe the defeat will derail Arsenal's challenge for other trophies, and he expects the right response from his team in the FA Cup clash with Newcastle on Saturday.<br><br>He urged: "Now we just have to be strong and forget everything because, on Saturday, we have another big game which will not be easy<br><br>"Newcastle have a new manager and they want a result at the Emirates.<br><br>"We have to win that game because we have ambition. But the fans are upset and we are upset. All the club are upset and we have to accept it."</div>
