              <p><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m3/aug2007/5/1/B592A454-0568-B703-7F82F9B17E7B9676.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Arsenal starlet Theo Walcott has admitted his form this season has "fallen short" of the standards he set himself.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Walcott,
                  19, gave an honest appraisal of himself despite Gunners boss Arsene
                  Wenger claiming he played his best game in an Arsenal shirt in
                  Saturday's win over Reading.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">It
                  comes just two weeks after the winger's amazing 70-yard run in
                  Arsenal's Champions League defeat at Liverpool, which showed his
                  massive potential.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But Walcott is frustrated he has not started more games two years after his record-breaking £12m move from Southampton.</p>
              <div id="mpu1" class="ad0 ad-mpu" style="display: block;"></div>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">He
                  said: "At the start of this season I wanted to make 20 to 25 starts and
                  score five goals. At the moment I'm on 17 starts and five goals, so it
                  looks like I will fall short of that.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"I would have liked to have played more, especially lately because I feel I have been playing quite well."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Walcott's
                  Arsenal transfer, and his call-up to England's World Cup squad two
                  years ago, meant his development was played out in the public eye while
                  most teenagers would be making their mistakes in the reserves.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">That
                  has heaped pressure on him and he has endured a difficult season,
                  especially after Arsenal's Carling Cup semi-final thrashing at
                  Tottenham when he was singled out for criticism.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But
                  Walcott has turned things around in the latter part of the season by
                  getting an England recall to Fabio Capello's last squad for the
                  friendly in France and that now famous run at Anfield.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But
                  he insists that his incredible dribble against Liverpool counted for
                  nothing as Arsenal went out. "It is frustrating," he added. "Sky showed
                  that run quite a lot and made something of it. It's a shame that we did
                  not go through but I know myself what I have done.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"My
                  display at Liverpool is the sort of thing I want to do when I start
                  games: get the defenders on the back foot so they don't know what I'm
                  going to do next.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"I
                  don't want to be coming off the bench all the time. I want to get in
                  the starting line-up and I know I need to produce what I do in practise
                  when I start the games. That's my next target.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"To
                  be honest, I did not expect to be back with England this soon. But I
                  have the experience of being around the squad, so that definitely helps.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"Hopefully
                  I can start some games for Arsenal and show Mr Capello what I can do. I
                  want to concentrate on Arsenal first and foremost, but England have a
                  couple of friendlies coming up and I would like to be involved."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><em>Blame Le boss for this. This kid has potential and is 60 000 times better than Ebouseless.</em></p>
