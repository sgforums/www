            <div class='col-md body'>Half Time!<br><br>Sheffield United 0<br><br>Arsenal FC 1 (Eduardo - 8min)<br><br>I felt that Eduardo struck the ball really well, for the rest of the game, i think the Arsenal young lads didnt have the guts to shoot the ball even though there is space. But nonetheless, decent passing but some poor finishing.</div>
