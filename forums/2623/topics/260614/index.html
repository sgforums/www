And Henry is the first name on their lists, although HenryÂ’s agent insists there have been no discussions with Barca over the hitman.<br><br>Arsenal have already taken delivery of their first summer signing, picking up Poland keeper Lukasz Fabianski, 22, from Legia Warsaw.<br><br>Left-back Gallas quit arch-rivals Chelsea for the Gunners last August after a series of bust-ups with Jose Mourinho over his position.<br><br>And Gallas now insists he wants to be a father figure to WengerÂ’s next crop of young stars-in-the-making.<br><br>The 29-year-old said: Â“I have some personal targets for next season, which are the same as the teamÂ’s objectives.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m hungry to win matches and titles. Once you reach the age of 30 the best moments come when you lift a trophy.<br><br>Â“And I am proud to take on the role of one of the senior players at the club. I talk to the youngsters and give them advice. IÂ’ve begun playing the big-brother role with the young players and I am happy to do so.<br><br>Â“I will be 30 in August and you have to pass on your experience to the young ones at your team.<br><br>Â“Last season was a transitional period for me. I had to adapt to a new club and new team-mates.<br><br>Â“I was out injured for three months but still did not give up. I am a warrior and I battle all the time.<br><br>Â“It meant I needed to disregard a whole host of matters and I reckon I have come through it all pretty well.Â”<br><br>Emirates chief Wenger will only guarantee that he will stay at Arsenal until his current contract expires in a yearÂ’s time.<br><br>And Spanish whizkid Fabregas, 20, has admitted his own future at the club hinges on WengerÂ’s plans after a year of unsettling turmoil.<br><br>Keeper Fabianski insists he is at Arsenal for the long haul and wants to make it to the top in the Premiership.<br><br>He said: Â“I am not coming to Arsenal just to be there. I want to become a regular first-team player.<br><br>Â“Hopefully, I will do it from the very beginning because I am ready for this.Â”<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wtf is wrong with gallas? Let Henry go? Is he out of his mind?? for once i wish he could just shut his trap. He's been moaning since he arrived at arsenal</span></div>
