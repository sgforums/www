            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Opening night nerves and the unmerciful dominance of a title contender made for a wretched bow into S.League football for the Korean Super Reds, as they fell 5-1 at the Bishan Stadium.<br><br>Home United showed why they are tipped as the favourites for the S.League title this season as they pinged the scoreboard with goals from Kone Hamed, Indra Sahdan, Shahril Ishak with a double and Qiu Li.<br><br>A penalty a minute from full-time was converted by Kim Hyun Jun but it was scant consolation for the Koreans.<br><br>Home served warning as early as the second minute when Ivorian winger HamedÂ’s free kick from the right stung keeper Kim Ji Soo's side netting.<br><br>Hamed would not be denied for long though, latching onto Indra's pass and firing home a low shot which Kim could only palm into the net.<br><br>A clear bundle of nerves, the 19-year-old keeper then spilled Lenan Govindaraju's harmless-looking shot for a corner.<br><br>His agony lasted until the 12th minute, before he made way for first choice custodian Im Su Dong, who was ill before the match.<br><br>Â“The starting goalkeeper was actually the reserve, but he started today as (Im) was sick,?said Super Reds team manager Kim Kyoung Soo.<br><br>Â“However, he was so nervous that the coach felt he had to make a tactical decision.?<br><br>Coach Hoong In Woong's side provided replacement keeper Im with the same scanty cover they had given the unfortunate starter though, with skipper Kim Sang Eun particularly culpable.<br><br>The 22-year-old was given a taste of Home icon Indra's feted pace and finishing in the 19th minute, as the Home forward took down Shi Jiayi's pass, surged beyond Kim and finished for 2-0.<br><br>Against a Home midfield boasting craft in the shape of Singapore international Shi and steel from Ivorian Fode Diakite, the Super Reds were made to look a pedestrian side out of their depth.<br><br>With Shahril enjoying a roaming role behind Indra, Home dictated matters and increased to their lead to a comfortable three in the 28th minute.<br><br>Breaking through on the left, Shahril nicked the ball off a hapless Lee Sang Jin and slammed in his side's third.<br><br>Three up before the half-hour, Home palpably dropped a gear or two, yet the Super Reds were unable to trouble keeper Lionel Lewis.<br><br>Half-time was a relief for the Koreans, yet the second half would bring more woe.<br><br>Indra's low cross from the right looked to have been covered by skipper Kim, but managed to snake through to Shahril in the box.<br><br>The Singapore international cheekily twisted past a flailing Kim, before hitting the top corner of keeper Im's goal. Four and easy for Home, in the 59th minute.<br><br>The only question that remained was how many more goals Home would score, and if the beleaguered Kim would figure. And figure in Home's fifth he did, desperately bringing down Protectors substitute Qiu Li in the 75th minute.<br><br>The Chinese striker, all too aware of the competition in Home's forward array this season with the likes of Indra and Cameroonian Kengne Ludovick around, headed straight for the dead-ball just outside the box.<br><br>Hamed had fired a freekick from a similar position high and wide minutes earlier, but Qiu was having none of that as he nailed a case for his inclusion, bending a fine effort around the wall and past Im's desperate dive.<br><br>Five down, the Koreans threw caution to the wind and for the first time in the match, started to cause the Home defence some concern. But not too much though, as Lionel and company dealt with a series of whipped in long balls.<br><br>The Super Reds were handed a consolation three minutes from the end though, as Kim Hyun Jun tangled with S Subramani in the box.<br><br>Referee Shamsul Maidin's award of a penalty looked a tad harsh but forward Kim was not about to look a gift horse in the mouth, converting the spotkick he had earnt himself.<br><br>The Super Reds still had a hammer-blow of a scoreline to look at when Shamsul blew for full-time, and team manager Kim Kyoung Soo laid the blame at his callow side's nerves.<br><br>"All the boys were very nervous today as this was their first game (in the S.League)," he said.<br><br>"Some players did not follow the coachÂ’s instructions. In our view, the S.League this year is different compared to last year. It has gotten faster and more skillful."<br><br>Home assistant coach Surachai Jaturapattarapong meanwhile expressed surprise at the ease of his side's win.<br><br>"They made so many mistakes. Once we went 5-0 up, we took it too easy. We have not hit top form yet, but we can be better," said the Thai.</span></div>
