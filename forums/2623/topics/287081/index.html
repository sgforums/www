            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.4thegame.com/wanadoo/media/00/02/11/wenger.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger will enjoy a glass of fine wine on his birthday on Monday and reflect on Arsenal's impressive start to the new campaign.<br><br>But the Frenchman maintains the best present he could receive will be for that improvement to continue.<br><br>The Gunners chalked up an 11th straight win in all competitions when they saw off the resolute challenge of managerless Bolton 2-0 at Emirates Stadium on Saturday to keep themselves ahead of Manchester United at the top of the Barclays Premier League.<br><br>Wenger's emerging side continue their European campaign with the visit of Slavia Prague on Tuesday night, before two key domestic fixtures away to Liverpool and against United at home.<br><br>Many feel those games will prove a yardstick by which to measure Arsenal's hopes of mounting a sustained push for the league title, which they last won in 2004.<br><br>Wenger's hunger for more success certainly shows little sign of abating as he turns 58.<br><br>When asked what gift he would expect from his squad, Wenger quipped: "For them to play better on Tuesday than they did against Bolton!<br><br>"I just want people to be happy and it's important to keep the spirit that we have at the moment.<br><br>"As a manager, there is nothing better to think that you have contributed to the happiness of people.<br><br>"I don't want them to stay as they are - I want them to improve - but I want them to keep that attitude."<br><br>Wenger, though, will not be cracking open the champagne just yet.<br><br>"It's a day like every other day," the Arsenal manager insisted when quizzed further on his intended birthday celebrations.<br><br>"I already have many socks, so I don't need them.<br><br>"Maybe I will have a glass of wine at home, but that is it. I was never a great one for celebrating birthdays.<br><br>"I will watch Newcastle against Tottenham, have a quiet night and prepare for the next day's game."<br><br>Wenger believes the manner of the victory over Bolton shows his side can no longer be "bullied" into submission.<br><br>Arsenal were frustrated for long spells of the match by the no-nonsense approach of the visitors, currently led by coach Archie Knox as they search for a successor to Sammy Lee.<br><br>However, following the introduction of substitutes Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky just after the hour, the game finally turned in favour of the hosts.<br><br>Kolo Toure drove in a low 25-yard strike following a free-kick, before England under-21 winger Walcott set up Rosicky for a tap in after good work down the right.<br><br>"The time when we could be bullied is certainly over," declared Wenger.<br><br>"We can respond when it happens now and on that front we are much stronger than we were.<br><br>"I feel the players, especially here where the pitch is so good, can escape the bad tackles and keep the ball moving quickly.<br><br>"We have shown that we have strength and this was another step for us.<br><br>"We know we dealt with the big games very well last season so we should be confident that we can do that again.<br><br>"When there is consistency, there is always quality. How far can we go? I don't know. But I have great belief we can go a long way."<br><br>Wenger added: "The Liverpool game will be big for us and then we have Manchester United. If we get over those two hurdles, we will be in a very good position."<br><br>Toure, meanwhile, knows beating the likes of Liverpool and United would count for little if they did not continue to see off the so-called lesser sides in the league.<br><br>"The season is really long and even if we win both of those games you might not end up as champions," the Ivory Coast defender said.<br><br>"We proved that last season - we beat them both and still were not champions.<br><br>"Last season we did really well against the big teams, but we slipped up against the teams that people expect us to beat.<br><br>"That is why this season we have to concentrate on the game in front of us, never mind it's Liverpool or Manchester United."<br><br>Toure added: "We have to keep the same focus for each game, and also hope that we get a bit lucky in games and keep winning.<br><br>"We are more mature now, we know what to expect in those games and have shown we can play against some really top players."<br></div>
