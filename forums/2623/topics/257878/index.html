I'm actually getting annoyed that we're finishing at the end of the top four."<br>Henry, in Beijing on a promotional tour for sporting goods manufacturer Reebok, contrasted the current Arsenal team with the side that won the title without losing a match in 2004.<br>"I've been in the side who stayed unbeaten a whole season, so I do know what it takes to win the league," he said.<br>"Sometimes having a lot of youngsters in your squad you cannot have the same spirit or the same result that you had the year we stayed unbeaten.<br>"We had guys who had been in the game for 15 or 10 years and who had won a lot of stuff.<br>"You know, winning is very difficult, you don't just arrive there. I was not, and am still not, a finished product, but I certainly wasn't a finished product at 20."<br>Henry said he did not know what plans there were for strengthening the squad this summer.<br>"Talking about resources, it's out of my hands, it's not what I do at the club," he said.<br>"The only thing I would like to say is that it has to happen from the pitch.<br>"There's a lot of stuff happened in the club recently, maybe it has to start again and fresher."<br><br><strong>Even the skipper is pissed off with little experienced players. yeah AW,ur fav Boy wants more experience and quality players!! *chants ribery*</strong></div>
