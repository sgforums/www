            <div class='col-md body'>Tomas Rosicky has explained how he 'badly needed' his first Premiership goal in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Wigan.<br><br>The Czech Republic international scored with five minutes to go to hand The Gunners a late victory on Sunday and his joy was heightened by the fact that the header was his first league goal in nine months.<br><br>Rosicky had scored in both the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League since moving to Emirates Stadium in the summer, but the schemer admitted it was a relief to open his Premiership account against The Latics.<br><br>"So I have finally experienced it," said Rosicky on his official website.<br><br>"This goal against Wigan came at the right moment as the last time I scored in the league was in May 2006 when I scored for Dortmund against Hannover.<br><br>"Since that time I have been struggling to score.<br><br>"Of course I have been scoring for the national team and for Arsenal in other competitions but I needed badly to score in the Premiership as well.<br><br>"I can now be twice as happy as I scored with a header which, as far as I can remember, has never happened before."<br><br>Rosicky is now looking to rest his weary body over the coming days after having to travel to Belgium for a friendly on Wednesday.<br><br>"Now what we need the most is to have a rest. Personally I felt very tired after I returned from the international break, but it was because of all the travelling not the game," Rosicky continued.<br><br>"After all, you spend plenty of time at airports and it does not help your body.<br><br>"This makes clear my schedule for the near future. Expect the busy playing schedule, I will rest."</div>
