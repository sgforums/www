              <p>Chantome, 20, is a
              defensive midfielder and may act as a direct replacement for Mathieu
              Flamini, who is joining Milan when his contract runs out this summer.<br><br>The
              PSG youngster has managed to hold down a regular place in the France
              under-21 side and may well be looking to leave, after his side barely
              avoided relegation following a miserable league campaign.<br><br>They did, however, gain UEFA Cup qualification via League Cup glory, and got to the final of the French
              Cup, where they will face Lyon who, after winning their seventh
              successive league title already, will be eyeing their first ever
              domestic double.<br><br>Whether the youngster chooses to join Coquelin
              in London remains to be seen, as does whether Arsene Wenger -
              notoriously miserly in the transfer market - will pay the required fee
              to bring Marseille's Samir Nasri, 'the new Zidane', to the club.</p>

              <h1>Ghanaian Prodigy 'Ready' For Arsenal Opportunity</h1>
              <p>The 16-year-old will undergo a two-week trial with the Gunners next
              month, having impressed Arsene Wenger and his scouts with his
              performances for Accra-based side Hearts of Oak.<br><br>And the
              midfielder is confident of making the grade in England, insisting he
              has no doubts about his ability to perform on the big stage.<br><br>“I am ready to play under coach Wenger and I will be happy to show the world what I can do,” Torric said. <br><br>“I like the style of play of Arsenal because of the silky skills and that is what I can add to the team. <br><br>“If
              I am given the chance I know I can play in the first team - I am not
              afraid. We play before big crowds and even though they call me a small
              boy I am not afraid of them.” <br><br><strong>Price</strong><br><br>Arsenal’s
              record of converting teenage talent into senior superstars will no
              doubt leave Torric’s representatives confident that the youngster will
              be given every opportunity to flourish in North London.<br><br>But his
              agent Prince Omar Ibrahim warned that the Gunners must be prepared to
              stump up the â‚¤1.5 million fee if they wish to snare one of Africa’s
              hottest prospects.<br><br>“We have received the documents from Arsenal inviting Torric for trials from June,” he said. <br><br>“We
              have taken the future development of the player into consideration and
              we all know that there is no coach better than Arsene Wenger who can do
              the work Torric. <br><br>“We must not forget that for a multi-talented
              young African player he needs an African environment to probably
              flourish. Arsenal offers that more than any other team with several
              African players at the club. <br><br>“But Arsenal must be ready to pay
              the price demanded by his club and also assure us that he will develop
              well. Torric is the next big thing to hit world football and you need
              to see his unbelievable qualities. <br><br>“At this age to be playing in Ghana’s midfield full of talented players should tell you a lot.”</p>
              <p><em>he's not looking at France this time around</em></p>

              <p><br>a club like arsenal should be winning the champions league and EPL. but since very difficult to win, win the FA cup and Carling cup better than nothing. at least we can say we win 2 trophies. the "double". so to win the FA and carling cup, we need to play our 1st team. then play the reserve team in the EPL and Champions league, since most likely wont win play the reserves better. then let them get raped left, right, front, back by milan, barca, real, man u, juventus. then they go back home to wenger cry like pussy like senderos. and they will know what its means to play against these world class superstars. i am being realistic stating a fact. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p><br>a club like arsenal should be winning the champions league and EPL. but since very difficult to win, win the FA cup and Carling cup better than nothing. at least we can say we win 2 trophies. the "double". so to win the FA and carling cup, we need to play our 1st team. then play the reserve team in the EPL and Champions league, since most likely wont win play the reserves better. then let them get raped left, right, front, back by milan, barca, real, man u, juventus. then they go back home to wenger cry like pussy like senderos. and they will know what its means to play against these world class superstars. i am being realistic stating a fact. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
