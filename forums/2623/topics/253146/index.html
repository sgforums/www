            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Abu Ogogo began his first season in the Academy as a midfielder and is ending it as a full-back and itÂ’s in defence where he wants to ply his trade.<br><br>Â“I now think it is my best position,Â” says the 17 year-old, who has excelled at right-back in recent months. Â“I first played in the role against Aston Villa at the beginning of the season and the coaches felt I did okay. It was a bit strange for me but over time I grew into the role and it now feels like I have been playing there all my life.<br><br>Â“I still do extra work to improve in the role. I stay back after training sometimes to work on overlapping and crosses. I enjoy the position because you are involved in defence and attack and, to be honest, I feel comfortable with the work you have to put in up and down the flanks.Â”<br><br>Abu was in this yearÂ’s FA Youth Cup team that were seconds away from the Final, but he cites that disappointment as the inspiration for the under- 18sÂ’ strong finish to the season.<br><br>Â“We have had a good season and we were all desperate to have something to show for it. WeÂ’d experienced the pain of losing in the semi-final of the FA Youth Cup and that loss helped us further strengthen our winning mentality. We ended up winning our division with games to spare. We are now looking to get to the Final of the Academy play-offs so that we can add some silverware to show for what has been a good season. We have to play Leicester over two legs and if we get past them we get a chance to play in a really big game again. The matches at Emirates Stadium were fantastic, especially when we played in front of over 38,000 against Manchester United.<br><br>"That said,Â” explains the youngster, Â“weÂ’re not really thinking too much about the Final. The priority is getting past Leicester and thatÂ’s what weÂ’re all focused on. Leicester are a good side who won their division well. We have not played them this season and so I expect a tough game, but we have confidence in our ability and I believe we can win.Â”<br><br>Once the season ends, all the players will have half a mind on next season, but relaxing over the summer will also be important.<br><br>Â“We all have some tasks that Steve Bould has asked us to keep working on," said Ogogo. "Mine are to improve my pace and power over the summer and I have some quick feet drills and a weights programme to help with that, but apart from some jogging, IÂ’ll mainly be trying to relax and re-charge for next season.Â”<br><br>One of the big targets for at least nine of the first years who featured in the FA Youth Cup run this season is to win it next year, but Abu knows that there is going to be a lot of competition for places next term.<br><br>Â“The nine of us who played against Manchester United all really want to have another go next year, but we all know that our place is not guaranteed. There are a lot of good players coming through to play in the under-18s next year and there will be competition for places. I think that is healthy and will raise standards even higher. We all know that we will have to earn our places.Â”<br><br>Abu drew great pride from the way the young players performed in the Carling Cup this season and is hopefulof featuring next term, but he holds a guilty secret.<br><br>Â“I was so proud of the players, especially because I have played with so many. They were superb against ChelseaÂ’s first team and I was upset for them because of the way the game finished and the loss hurt.<br><br>But,Â” he admits, slightly lowering his voice, Â“I have to be honest and say that the disappointment was lightened a bit for me because I am a life-long Chelsea fan!Â”</span></div>
