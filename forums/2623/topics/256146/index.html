            <div class='col-md body'>ARSENE WENGER has told Arsenal fans they must put their "trust" in him to bring success back to the club next season.<br><br>Wenger saw his young team finish empty-handed for the second successive campaign and even the most diehard supporters are questioning whether they can challenge Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool next year.<br><br>But the Gunners boss has delivered a strong message to the fans and insisted that his outstanding young players like Cesc Fabregas, Abou Diaby and Emmanuel Eboue will come of age next season.<br>Advertisement<br>Click here to find out more!<br><br>And he also did his best to dispel doubts about his own future by making it clear that he is planning for next season.<br><br>"I believe that at the moment our fans think we have fantastic potential, but that they also have the anxiety of whether or not they will deliver," admitted Wenger in an interview in the new official Arsenal magazine.<br><br>"And I tell our fans that they will deliver. They will. They have to continue to believe in the team.<br><br>"At the moment that is the only question mark. Nobody questions the quality in our team, the potential we have. But everybody is asking: Will they deliver? Well they have to trust us.<br><br>"There is a mixture here of mental strengths, of potential, but there is also a naivety, and sometimes we have not been ruthless enough. It is these two ingredients that have to be improved.<br><br>"This side can be absolutely outstanding. But to win trophies, you have to be a killer. You have to have everything together."<br><br>Wenger also made it clear that, despite regular accusations from supporters that they overelaborate and should be more direct, he will stick with his footballing beliefs to try and put Arsenal back on top of the Premiership.<br><br>"I believe that we have to be faithful to the way we see the game," he said.<br><br>"Our fans will not accept it if tomorrow they start seeing direct, kicking football from us. I feel as well that our style suits the players we have, and their characteristics.<br><br>"We have players with a high technical level. What people under-estimate is what this team have done, with the age of our players, is absolutely amazing.<br><br>"That potential will come out, I'm 100 per cent convinced of that, and come out quickly. You have to accept that it takes some time for a team to transform into efficiency."<br><br>Wenger believes Arsenal are still adjusting to their new surroundings in the Emirates after so many years of success at Highbury.<br><br>But he pointed to the fact that his young players did a league double over Manchester United, drew with Chelsea twice and beat Liverpool to prove they are moving in the right direction.<br><br>He added: "Every day I am thinking about next season. Ever since we qualified for the top four my mind has been on next season.<br><br>"The game against Chelsea was a bit of an illustration of our season - going 1-0 up, not killing the game off, and then finishing with a 1-1 draw.<br><br>"So my thinking is stability, improve the balance of the team, and then get tuned in so we can all start the new season in a strong way.<br><br>"The key is stability, and then the possible addition of one or two players who I think can add to what we are trying to do. But the key is to be strong, with a consistent belief in this team.<br><br>"My target is to keep the quality of our game at the level it is, try to improve it, but also give a little bit of a better balance to the team in the areas where we can be stronger."<br><br><strong><br>Well spoken by Le Boss. But talk is cheap. I want arsenal to prove it nxt season.</strong></div>
