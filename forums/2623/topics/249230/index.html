            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>JENAS STRIKE STUNS GUNNERS</strong><br><br>A stunning last-gasp strike from Jermaine Jenas saw Tottenham Hotspur snatch a point from the jaws of defeat as they somehow rescued a 2-2 draw at home to Arsenal in the 154th North London derby.<br><br>The Gunners looked to have put a difficult week behind them with a victory at the home of their great rivals after a dominant second half display, but Jenas popped up in the final seconds to drive a superb shot past Jens Lehmann and give Spurs a valuable point in their bid for Uefa Cup football.<br><br>Having had to contend with headlines predicting doom and gloom, and a possible managerial exit, after David Dein's departure this week, Arsenal overcame Robbie Keane's opener with a stirring comeback thanks to goals from Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor.<br><br>However, Jenas' late intervention ensured they could not move ahead of Liverpool into third, even if the draw extended their unbeaten run over Spurs to 15 games.<br><br>A high-octane opening at White Hart Lane saw Spurs make a confident start, with danger man Dimitar Berbatov only just failing to flick the ball over Jens Lehmann as the keeper came out to challenge.<br><br>Didier Zokora also dragged a shot wide as Spurs took the game to their bitter rivals, with The Gunners struggling to implement their usual passing game in the face of an energetic display from Jol's side.<br><br>However, the red half of North London thought they had taken the lead on 14 minutes when Adebayor rifled home, but Freddie Ljungberg had been adjudged offside when producing a clever backheel to steer the ball to the Togolese striker.<br><br>The two combined again when Adebayor laid the ball off to Ljungberg in the box, but the Swedish international's first-time shot was wild and flew high over the bar.<br><br>The Gunners continued to look ill at ease despite threatening on two occasions, and Berbatov continued to cause problems when, from a corner, his awkward presence caused both Abou Diaby and the Spurs man to be booked for tangling - with Lehmann also receiving a remarkable eighth caution of the season for his input in the incident.<br><br>When the set-piece was finally taken, Dawson rose highest to head the ball down and Keane - having peeled away from Gael Clichy - reacted quickly to nod the ball past Lehmann and send the White Hart Lane crowd into raptures.<br><br>Didier Zokora also went into the referee's book for a foul on Tomas Rosicky, and the Ivorian midfielder looked to make amends when he collected an intelligent ball from Berbatov and curled a dangerous effort just off target.<br><br>Arsenal's inclusion of Ljungberg from the start had been somewhat surprising given the Swede had been struggling with a hamstring problem, and after the injury flared up again Cesc Fabregas was introduced for his 150th appearance for the club.<br><br>The Spanish schemer almost made an immediate impact when his clever reverse pass played Emmanuel Eboue in, but after the defender's shot hit the post Adebayor could only sky the rebound over from eight yards out.<br><br>Keane and Rosicky both threatened further, before the half ended with Spurs in the ascendancy and enjoying a one-goal advantage over their bitter rivals.<br><br>Arsenal begun the second period with renewed vigour though, and after working the ball nicely across the pitch only a finish from Gilberto was lacking on 47 minutes.<br><br>The Gunners were inches away from drawing level when Kolo Toure leapt to meet a Fabregas corner and saw his fine header cannon off the post, whilst Rosicky's impromptu follow-up effort was also claimed easily by Paul Robinson.<br><br>Fabregas attempted to make it three goals in three games when he skewed a volley wide, and as the pressure continued to mount Adebayor produced a looping header that bounced agonisingly off the bar.<br><br>Tottenham's goal was certainly living a charmed life having seen the woodwork hit on three separate occasions, but Jol's luck ran out on 64 minutes when Toure levelled matters as he stole away from Pascal Chimbonda at the far post and tapped home Fabregas' deep free-kick.<br><br>The Gunners refused to rest on their laurels and sent on Julio Baptista for Rosicky as they poured forward in search of a winner, and 'The Beast' was in the midst of it immediately as his shot from the edge of the box was blocked by Michael Dawson.<br><br>Spurs were struggling to resist the red tide, and on 78 minutes their weakness from set pieces came back to haunt them as Fabregas produced another fine delivery from wide.<br><br>Jermaine Jenas mistimed his jump and Adebayor was free to direct a fine header past Robinson for his third goal against Spurs in three games this season.<br><br>Baptista could have added a third in the dying minutes to seal the victory, but the Brazilian showed the lack of prowess that has so frustrated Gunners fans when he directed an easy header well wide of the post after good work from Adebayor.<br><br>Arsenal certainly paid for the miss when, with just seconds to go, Jenas hammered home a quite beautiful strike to take Spurs into seventh place.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
