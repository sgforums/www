              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">THIERRY HENRY insists Arsenal can still lift the Premier League title.</p>
              <p class="article">But the Gunners legend admits they must shackle the best player in the world 
              in 37-goal Cristiano Ronaldo to achieve it.</p>
              <p class="article">Arsene Wenger’s side face Manchester United at Old Trafford tomorrow knowing 
              victory will put them three points behind Alex Ferguson’s side.</p>
              <p class="article">And Barcelona star Henry insists Arsenal must not let their dramatic Champions 
              League defeat at Liverpool affect them.</p>
              <p class="article">Last season Emmanuel Adebayor bagged a late winner at Old Trafford while Henry 
              did the same at the Emirates.</p>
              <p class="article">And Henry said: It’s not about the loss at Liverpool affecting them or not. 
              The world knows that they need to win at Old Trafford, no more, no less.</p>
              <p class="article">If there is a team who can beat Manchester United it’s Arsenal. Last year 
              Arsenal did the double against them.</p>
              <p class="article">I didn’t play at Old Trafford but Ade had an amazing game and scored. Then I 
              scored the winner at the Emirates.</p>
              <h4>Henry: You never know</h4>
              <p class="article">There’s still a possibility of Arsenal winning this title. There’s five games 
              remaining so 15 points.</p>
              <p class="article">The difference between Man United and Arsenal is six points. You never know 
              what can happen.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea and Manchester United are still in the Champions League and it’s 
              never an easy task to combine the two.</p>
              <p class="article">United’s last game against Middlesbrough showed that if you have a go at them 
              it is possible, even though they had players injured. Rio was injured and 
              Vidic too.</p>
              <p class="article">Henry was on the edge of his seat watching the pulsating Liverpool-Arsenal 
              Euro tie and was left gutted by the outcome.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: I was like anyone who loves Arsenal. I was sad because they were so 
              close to going through.</p>
              <p class="article">I was watching the game at the hotel where Barcelona were before our game 
              with Schalke with some of my team-mates. Everybody was glued to the TV as 
              you couldn’t get your eyes off it.</p>
              <p class="article">It was just ridiculous — the pace of the game, the chances, the tackles. When 
              Ade scored I went down on my knees. I was just so happy for him.</p>
              <p class="article">I was so happy for Theo because he made a great run. Everybody expects so 
              much from him and in five seconds he showed what he can do.</p>
              <p class="article">It was a big relief. But then within a minute, straight after, Ryan Babel won 
              the penalty and then he did it again and put the ball in the back of the 
              net. It happened so quickly.</p>

              <p class="article">Henry’s Barca face United in the Champions League semi-finals and he admits 
              Ronaldo is the best player in the world at the moment.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: This is Cristiano Ronaldo’s year. He will be World Player of the 
              Year. There’s nobody else. The way he’s playing is just ridiculous.</p>
              <p class="article">I respect him a hell of a lot — especially the way he came back from the 
              World Cup.</p>
              <p class="article">The whole of England was waiting for him to kill him, waiting for him to 
              fail, and he didn’t.</p>
              <p class="article">Barcelona have struggled in La Liga this season but will have their own 
              wonderkid Leo Messi back in action against United after a lengthy lay-off 
              with a thigh problem.</p>
              <p class="article">Henry added: I’m sure that everybody will think United are favourites because 
              of the way they’re playing but in the Champions League it’s different. So 
              many times we’ve seen upsets.</p>
              <p class="article">We’re having some problems in the league — it could have been better.</p>
              <p class="article">But we’re still in the semi-finals of the Champions League and still have a 
              chance of winning the biggest trophy.</p>
              <p class="article">I am confident we can knock United out. We haven’t lost a game in the 
              Champions League.</p>
