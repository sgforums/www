That would be a nice thing, because we've not beaten them for nine years," Jol stated.<br><br>"The main thing for us is getting points on the board. We have to change things. We're in a position we don't like and we have to improve on that.<br><br>"There is not a big gap so if we get the win we'll be fine."<br><br>Gunners boost<br><br>Arsenal have been boosted by manager Arsene Wenger's decision to sign a new contract at Emirates Stadium and Jol believes continuity is their strength.<br><br>"That is their main quality, that there is a lot of continuity at that club," he continued.<br><br>"They are an ambitious club and they want to win the title and I like that. For Arsenal, being fourth is maybe not enough for them.<br><br>"Arsenal would have liked to have won things last year and they didn't, but there was still no panic.<br><br>"We want to achieve our goals. Where we end up? You can make a judgement on that at the end of the season."<br><br>No excuses<br><br>Jol is refusing to make excuses ahead of this weekend's game by stating fatigue could be a problem for his players following a busy week of international action.<br><br>"Everyone can say (international week) is a problem, but on the other hand the other teams have the same problem.<br><br>"The better you are the more internationals you have. The only thing you can do is prepare your team as best as possible.<br><br>"It's certainly positive for us that we have five, six or maybe more players that haven't played games this week."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">sp*rs are so obsesse in beating arsenal. </span></div>
