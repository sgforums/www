            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Francesc Fabregas Soler </strong></span><br><br>Midfielder<br>Born: May 4, 1987<br>Birthplace: Vilessoc de Mar, Spain<br>Height: 5' 9''<br>Weight: 10.9 Pos: M<br>Age: 19<br><br>After emerging into English football through Arsene Wenger's tried and tested route of the League Cup, Fabregas has become one of the most highly-rated youngsters in the world cup.<br>Supremely skillful and with composure with belies his young years, this Spanish midfield wizard looks certain to become a true star of the modern game.<br><br>Fabregas' performances when filling in for the injured Patrick Vieira, Edu and Gilberto Silva for much 2004/05 led to him becoming a fully fledged member of the first team squad earlier than planned - but there was no way the Gunners' coaching staff could have held him back.<br><br>In March 2006 he made his 50th Premiership start - despite still being two months short of his 19th birthday. He had become a certain starter for Arsenal.<br><br>The midfielder had also begun to make waves on the international scene. That same month he was handed his debut for Spain when starting the international friendly against Ivory Coast - and playing the whole match - to become Spain's youngest cap for 70 years.<br><br>He had previously been named Player of the Tournament and also won the Golden Boot at the Under-18 World Cup in Spain colours.<br><br>That led to much speculation about interest from Real Madrid. And although the player was said to be flattered by the link Arsenal were determined to keep hold of one of the brightest prospects in the game.<br><br>'Cesc', as he prefers to be known, first made history in October 2003 when he became the youngest player to turn out for Arsenal, in a League Cup tie against Rotherham United.<br><br>The Spaniard, who moved to Highbury in the summer of 2003 from Barcelona, was aged just 16 years 177 days when he took to the pitch for the Gunners for the first time.<br><br>He scored on his second appearance for Arsenal, a 5-1 Carling Cup thrashing of Wolverhampton Wanderers - making him the youngest ever Arsenal goalscorer.<br><br>He was welcomed fully into the first team squad for the 2004/05 season, playing the whole of the Community Shield victory over Manchester United.<br><br>And the midfield starlet kept his place for the 4-1 victory at Everton on the opening day of the Premiership season.<br><br>His performances with Vieira out injured were superb, energetic, skillful and quality.<br><br>The midfielder opened his Premiership account for the Gunners in a 3-0 home win over Blackburn Rovers, still aged only 17.<br><br>'Cesc' is a precocious talent of the highest order. His ability for one so young is actually quite frightening.<br><br>He had a hugely influential first month of the season, although the return to fitness of Vieira curtailed his involvement.<br><br>And he was rewarded with a new long-term contract in mid-September 2004. And that was extended again in August 2005 to run until the summer of 2011.<br><br>Fabregas was one of the few bright spots of a hugely disappointing season for the Gunners in 2005/06. With Vieira having left for Juventus, Fabregas became the focal point of the midfield and looking like a seasoned pro rather than a youngster starting out in the game as he approached 100 club appearances.<br></div>
