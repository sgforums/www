            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">By his own admission it has been quite a season for Johan Djourou.<br><br>The 20-year-old defender has made 29 appearances for ArsÃ¨ne WengerÂ’s first team so far Â— a total he thought unlikely back in September.<br><br>Injuries to Philippe Senderos and William Gallas presented a chance to the Swiss international and itÂ’s one he grasped with both hands.<br><br>Djourou scored the winner for the Reserves in their 1-0 win at Fulham on Tuesday and afterwards he expressed his delight at having stepped up a level this term. The youngster is unsure whether he will be called upon again in the coming weeks but immediately set his sights on the future.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve definitely played more games than I expected this season,Â” Djourou told Arsenal.com. Â“When youÂ’re a young player youÂ’re expecting to be more on the bench and going through a learning process. But this season the boss [Wenger] has shown he has confidence in me, which is great for young players. ItÂ’s been an amazing season to be playing at a level you donÂ’t expect to play at so much when youÂ’re so young.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m always ready to play but maybe at the moment the situation is harder because William [Gallas] and others are back. I think itÂ’s all part of the learning process. IÂ’m still young and I can learn a lot from those players and itÂ’s good to watch them play. Of course when youÂ’re young you want to play every game but I think I have to wait my turn. IÂ’ve got time to come.Â”<br><br>As an observer in recent weeks Djourou believes ArsenalÂ’s failure to convert chances into goals has cost them dear. The 20-year-old said it could all be a knock-on effect of the Champions League exit to PSV but warned that dwelling on it for too long could ultimately cost the Gunners a place in next yearÂ’s competition.<br><br>Â“I think the Champions League was a big blow because we were really expected to do well in that competition. I think we have to get ourselves going again and catch the points to be safe for the Champions League next year.<br><br>Â“The atmosphere in the dressing room is very good. All the players know what we have to do. We must try to get the team togetherness again and try to do as well as we did [this time] last year. WeÂ’re not pointing fingers. WeÂ’re all together in this.Â”<br><br>Recent results mean the game against Bolton on Saturday has become arguably the most important of the season. Victory would all but secure ArsenalÂ’s place in the top four and, according to Djourou, defeat is not an option.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s important we get the three points,Â” he said. Â“Everyone knows how tough it is to play Bolton, be it at home or there [at the Reebok]. TheyÂ’re a really, really hard team to break down. TheyÂ’re very aggressive. They play long balls but they also have attacking, technical players in the side.<br><br>Â“TheyÂ’re a very difficult team to play, we have to be ready for that, but I think we can handle them and win on Saturday."</span></div>
