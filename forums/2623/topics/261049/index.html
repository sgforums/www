He has been growing in stature and I think he has been growing as a person.<br><br>"He has been a young boy who achieved a lot in a very short period of time. He needs to learn he hasn't reached his full potential. He has had a few collisions with the manager in the national team but I think he has learnt from it.<br><br>"You can see now that he is listening to what people say and I can only see him becoming a very good player."<br><br>Arsene Wenger is believed to have earmarked Bendtner as one of his four main strikers next season.<br><br>Sorensen added: "Nicklas is only 19 but he has got the physique as well as the skill and is good in the air. I think he will be a good asset for Arsenal. Give him maybe a couple of years he will be in the first team.<br><br>"If he gets his chance with Arsenal next season, it is up to him to show he is as good as he has shown in the national team and at Birmingham during last season.<br><br>"He has scored goals in internationals - and not goals against minnows. He has scored already against Portugal and Germany. He has scored some big goals.<br><br>"He is a big hope for the future as a striker. We are not a big country and don't have many fantastic players. Hopefully he will turn out to be a top European striker."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> I do hope he will be a future potential player</span></div>
