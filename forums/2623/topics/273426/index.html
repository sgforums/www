But last season's top four teams will be the top four teams again.<br><br>"The only club that can challenge them is probably Tottenham if you look at the quality available to manager Martin Jol on a consistent basis.<br><br>"After finishing fifth for the last two years Tottenham are the one team you would worry about breaking into that top four.<br><br>"But Arsenal will be there or thereabouts. They've got a good group of players that can keep them in the top four."<br><br>Opinion is divided on whether allowing Henry to join Barcelona for Â£16.1million was a wise move as the French striker's exit appears to have left the club exposed up front.<br><br>But Sanchez believes Robin van Persie is ready to fill Henry's shoes and insists Arsenal fans should have faith in Wenger on account of his astonishing track record in the transfer market.<br><br>"I think Arsenal needed Henry when they moved to the Emirates Stadium, it was important that they had their talisman at the new stadium," he said.<br>advertisement<br><br>"I think Arsene Wenger has been very, very good at moving players on at the right times.<br><br>"Many people thought Arsenal would miss Patrick Vieira then all of a sudden Cesc Fabregas emerges.<br><br>"People say they'll miss Henry but van Persie has looked like a world beater in pre-season.<br><br>"Arsene has been very good in his timing of moving players on and getting top dollar for players who have probably already seen their best days."<br><br>Fulham have confirmed the signing of highly-rated Australian prospect Adrian Leijer from Melbourne Victory for an undisclosed fee.<br><br>The 21-year-old defender was voted last season's A-League young player of the year and joins on a three-year contract.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What crap.
