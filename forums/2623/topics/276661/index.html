Ashley Cole and Thierry Henry hardly played towards the end of their Arsenal careers, ostensibly because they were 'injured'.<br><br>In light of this, the Times are reporting that Lehmann is seeking to orchestrate a move away from Arsenal to a club where he will be guaranteed first choice football.<br><br>"I don't know how long Lehmann will be out," Wenger confirmed. "He's never happy when he's injured and he's never happy when he's not playing."<br><br>When asked if he could guarantee Lehmann would be Arsenal number one this season, Wenger said: "You're asking me to say something that I can never say."<br><br>"You asked me to give a message to Almunia that, no matter how he plays after a few games, he will be automatically out. You can never say that; that means his performance is not important.<br><br>"We are in a competitive world. Of course, at the start of the season, you have a number one and then a number two comes in and you have to give him a chance. I think Almunia is good enough to give me a problem. You go from game to game and there is no guarantee for anybody."<br><br>"I have the highest respect for Jens. I bought him here at 33 and made him number one, and since he has always been number one. When he is fit I have to assess the situation. There is no guarantee for anybody. We are in a competitive world."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">wow i loike! Almunia has a chance now that he CAN be number one.</span></div>

The Germany international sounded out several clubs on returning home for treatment on an Achilles problem last weekend, but has yet to receive an offer after falling out of favour at the Emirates Stadium. </strong><br><br>Lehmann is being rested after making two horrendous errors in ArsenalÂ’s first two Barclays Premier League fixtures, against Fulham and Blackburn Rovers, amid claims that his Achilles complaint has worsened.<br><br>The 37-year-old was fit enough to play for Germany in last WednesdayÂ’s 2-1 win over England at Wembley and he exchanged strong words with Wenger at ArsenalÂ’s training ground when told of his fate two days later.<br><br>Lehmann fears that being dropped by Arsenal could harm his international chances before next summerÂ’s European Championship finals and will listen to any offers he receives in the coming days. The former Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper attracted interest from Hertha Berlin and Seville before signing a one-year contract extension with Arsenal towards the end of last season, but is running out of time to force an exit.<br><br>LehmannÂ’s mood will not have been improved by WengerÂ’s words yesterday, with the Frenchman confirming that Manuel Almunia will play in tonightÂ’s Champions League third qualifying round, second-leg tie against Sparta Prague and the goalkeeperÂ’s shirt is the SpaniardÂ’s to lose.<br><br></div>
