"We are one of the most important teams in Europe.<br><br>"Definitely we have to be fighting for the title because it would not be Arsenal if we are not doing this."<br><br>He added: "Collectively this side is very good. That is what we have to keep showing to ourselves, that we are good enough to fight for everything."<br><br>Many have questioned the impact of captain Henry's departure to Barcelona, but Fabregas remains optimistic.<br><br>Asked if the club can cope with Henry's departure, he said: "Definitely. Thierry has been really, really important to this club over the past eight years.<br><br>"We have scored a lot of goals because of him but now he is gone and we have to move on. We wish him all the best at Barcelona.<br><br>"But we have a great set of world-class players. We should not have a problem if we are all going the same way 100 per cent.<br><br>"But of course we know that Thierry will be a big miss."<br><br>Wenger's future has also been under scrutiny since David Dein left the club, and Fabregas has said on several occasions that he could follow his manager out of Arsenal should he leave.<br><br>However, while he admits it is Wenger's decision, he is confident the Frenchman will stay.<br><br>"We all hope he is going to stay because I don't think this club would have the same philosophy of playing football [without him]. And of course it would be a big miss for the club.<br><br>"He has brought most of us here and given us the opportunity. But we don't have to worry about that. It is his future and he can decide for himself.<br><br>"But we all believe he is going to stay for a lot of years."</div>
