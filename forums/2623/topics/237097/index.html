            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal moved to within a point of third-placed Liverpool after coming from a goal down to defeat a spirited Wigan Athletic side 2-1.<br><br>The Gunners made hard work of their home clash with The Latics, as Denny Lanzaat sensationally gave Wigan a half-time lead with a fine long-distance strike.<br><br>In fact, the Premiership strugglers should have ncreased their lead, but Emile Heskey squandered two great chances before Arsenal claimed victory in the final nine minutes at The Emirates Stadium.<br><br>An unfortunate Fitz Hall own-goal brought the North Londoners level before Tomas Rosicky headed home Arsenal's winner.<br><br>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger brought back Theo Walcott and Julio Baptista to the starting XI, while Johan Djourou came in at centre-back for the suspended Philippe Senderos.<br><br>Walcott and Baptista's inclusion meant Emmanuel Adebayor and Mathieu Flamini were left on the substitutes' bench.<br><br>Wigan boss Paul Jewell, meanwhile, brought back striker Heskey, left-back Leighton Baines and right-back Hall to his starting line-up.<br><br>Goalkeeper Chris Kirkland was also available to start for The Latics, despite a shoulder injury keeping out of England's midweek friendly with Spain on Wednesday.<br><br>Despite the perilous position of being fourth from bottom, Wigan's organisation and attacking intent unsettled Arsenal throughout the first 45 minutes.<br><br>In fact, it was an open start from both sides at The Emirates, with Wigan's Lee McCulloch heading a flicked throw-in high over Jens Lehmann's crossbar.<br><br>McCulloch then caused more concern for Arsenal's back-line when his cross from the left deflected off of Justin Hoyte to Heskey at the far post, but the former Liverpool and Birmingham City hit-man was unable to direct his shot on target.<br><br>Buoyed by the home crowd, The Gunners soon responded with captain Thierry Henry forcing Kirkland into a routine save with a long-range free kick before Rosicky saw his effort find the mid-section of the England custodian.<br><br>The Latics were not happy to keep their hosts at bay and had efforts of their own, with Lehmann needing to make a decent stop to Landzaat's fierce strike before Rosicky missed the target with a close-range effort after Henry had put him through at the other end.<br><br>Henry then wasted a better Arsenal chance on the counter-attack, with the France international sailing a strike high and wide of the target after Walcott had picked him out unmarked at the far post.<br><br>Baines then wasted an excellent Wigan chance after his byline cross from the left flew into arms of Lehmann before another Henry free-kick brought another confident save from Kirkland.<br><br>Wigan's defence then had a brief scare when Emmerson Boyce nearly sliced Rosicky's low cross from left into own net, but he was relieved to see the ball fly just past the far post.<br><br>Jewell's side were frustrating their hosts as the half went on, and they made life more difficult for Arsenal when they claimed the lead with a stunning strike from Landzaat on 35 minutes.<br><br>After January signing Julius Aghahowa had done well to chase down Matt Jackson's ball forward, the Nigerian striker's pass was inadvertently cleared out to Landzaat.<br><br>The former AZ Alkmaar man then teed up a right-foot strike from long-range, and with a bit of movement in the air, sailed the ball past a helpless Lehmann for only his second goal of the season.<br><br>The goal stunned The Gunners, and they were fortunate not to be two goals down before the break, as Lehmann just got his finger tips to Heskey's first-time strike to deflect the ball onto the post before it was cleared.<br><br>Arsenal should then have levelled with the last real action of the half, but Henry's leaping header went past the far post after he connected with Gael Clichy's byline cross.<br><br>The second half saw more attacking purpose from Arsenal, but Heskey had another superb chance to increase Wigan's lead shortly after the restart.<br><br>The former England striker latched on to Ryan Taylor's forward ball before lobbing his shot over Lehmann's crossbar.<br><br>Despite holding a slender one-goal lead, Arsenal struggled to break Wigan's resilient defence down, with Julio Baptista firing wide after Rosicky headed the ball into his path on the edge of the box.<br><br>Walcott then wasted another Arsenal chance, as he woefully struck Hall's poor clearance high and wide of Kirkland's goal.<br><br>At the other end, Josip Skoko nearly emulated team-mate Landzaat with a rasping drive that flew just over Lehmann's crossbar after Hoyte failed to deal with Baines's cross from the left.<br><br>Still in search of an equaliser, Wenger introduced Jeremie Aliadiere and Flamini for Hoyte and Walcott, but Wigan were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty.<br><br>Flamini was fortunate to get away with a tug on Heskey's shirt, as both players went for the ball in the Arsenal box, but referee Phil Dowd waved away any appeals.<br><br>Latics boss Jewell was then left fuming even more, as Arsenal pulled level nine minutes from the end.<br><br>Substitute Adebayor picked out Flamini on the right flank, and despite the Frenchman looking to be in an offside position, his low cross saw a sliding Hall get an unfortunate touch to the ball to put it into his own net for 1-1.<br><br>The goal swung the momentum in Arsenal's favour, and after Henry missed a decent chance for a winner, fine play saw Adebayor again feed a ball forward to Baptista on the left and his fine cross found Rosicky unmarked to head home his first goal in the Premiership.<br><br>The result keeps Arsenal within touching distance of Liverpool and third place, while Wigan missed the chance to put more distance between themselves and the Premiership's bottom three.</div>
