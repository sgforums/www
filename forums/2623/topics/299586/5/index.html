            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Premier League: Everton 1-4 Arsenal - Match Report</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/Images/dotcomreport.jpg"><br><br>Arsenal are back on top of the Premier League.<br><br>They were restored to the summit thanks to Manchester UnitedÂ’s defeat and then their own remarkable 4-1 comeback in a tempestuous game at Goodison Park on Saturday evening that saw both sides reduced to 10 men.<br><br>Tim CahillÂ’s goal deservedly gave the home side the advantage at the break. But within 12 minutes of the restart Arsenal had snatched the lead thanks to a fine brace from Eduardo, his first strikes in the Premier League.<br><br>Nicklas BendtnerÂ’s dismissal in the 73rd minute threatened to unsettle the visitors as they started to look to the final whistle. But, in the end, they were handed a third goal when Emmanuel Abedayor profited from hesitancy between Joseph Yobo and Tim Howard.<br><br>Mikel Arteta threw out an arm at Cesc Fabregas in the 84th minute and also saw red. It undermined EvertonÂ’s late rally and substitute Tomas Rosicky added a fourth in injury time.<br><br>This was far from ArsenalÂ’s best performance of the season but it did illustrate, perhaps more than any other game this term, the type of qualities they will need to win the title.<br><br>And, of course, they are now clear at the top by two points.<br><br>Wenger made three changes from the side held to a 0-0 draw at Portsmouth on Boxing Day. All smacked of rotation in order to accommodate the busy Christmas period. Emmanuel Eboue was rested entirely while Adebayor and Rosicky were left on the bench. As a result Bendtner and Eduardo were paired up front while Abou Diaby came in on the left. Alex Hleb went from support striker to right midfielder.<br><br>Just before kick-off, the visiting Arsenal supporters heard confirmation of Manchester UnitedÂ’s defeat at West Ham. It meant WengerÂ’s men would resume the lead of the Premier League with victory this evening. That was no formality however. They faced an Everton side who had a record of W12 D2 L1 in their last 15 games.<br><br>The start was scrappy. Arsenal were lively and inquisitive in the opening minutes however the best chance they conjured up was a goal-bound Fabregas shot that was blocked on the edge of the area. In fact Everton keeper Tim Howard would have worry-free first half.<br><br>As the game wore on, the home side took over - though Almunia was hardly overworked either. Gradually Arteta and Cahill started to find space in midfield while YakubuÂ’s muscle was proving a handful for the Arsenal defence. In the 19th minute the Nigerian went shoulder to shoulder with Kolo Toure, the visitorsÂ’ strongest player, and won a corner on the left-hand side.<br><br>Arteta whipped it into the six-yard box and the Arsenal defence hesitated. That was all that was required. The ball bobbled to the far post where a combination of YakubuÂ’s head and CahillÂ’s foot turned it home off the post. Eventually the strike was credited to the Australian but, from an Arsenal perspective, it had been all too easy.<br><br>Everton had been rightly confident before the goal. Afterwards they were full of vigour and determination. Steven Pienaar pulled an effort six yards wide of goal, Phil Neville drove over following a flowing move and, just before the whistle, Arteta forced a low save from Almunia.<br><br>Arsenal rallied briefly as the seconds ticked away but they could hardly argue with the scoreline at the interval.<br><br>But what a change after the restart.<br><br>Three minutes in, ClichyÂ’s long ball forward caught the home defence napping. It flew over the backtracking Phil Jagielka and fell to the scampering Eduardo who showed commendable nerve to steer home his shot under pressure from three recovering defenders.<br><br>It was the CroatianÂ’s first goal in 10 Premier League appearances and ArsenalÂ’s 800th in the competition under Wenger.<br><br>Everton were suddenly subdued while the visitors had a spring in their step and a bite in their challenge.<br><br>However just before Arsenal took the lead, the home side spurned a superb chance to score a second themselves. Joleon Lescott fired over a cross from the left and Yakubu escaped from Toure to steer a powerful header wide.<br><br>Still Everton had already paid painful witness to EduardoÂ’s poaching ability and, in the 58th minute, he added a second. The 24-year-old collected BendtnerÂ’s flick on the edge of the area, nudged the ball past Jagielka, ran around the other side and then slipped the ball past Howard.<br><br>A wonderful finish from an expert poacher.<br><br>Everton were stung. They did not deserve to be losing on the balance of play while Arsenal were attempting to pull off to a classic snatch-and-grab Â— the staple diet of Premier League champions.<br><br>However their chances of a clean getaway were dented in the 73rd minute when Bendtner picked up a second booking for a foul on Andy Johnson.<br><br>It was certainly a rash challenge but the dismissal was all the more distressing as Adebayor had been waiting to come on for a couple of minutes. With Eduardo on a hat-trick, it would seem safe to assume the Dane was about to be substituted.<br><br>The red card only added to the mounting Everton momentum.  Almunia saved from both JohnsonÂ’s flick-on and Lee CarsleyÂ’s low shot in the 76th minute.<br><br>However for all their reputation for flowing football, it was a route-one goal that sealed the game two minutes later. Adebayor nipped in as Joseph Yobo tried to shepherd AlmuniaÂ’s long punt forward towards his keeper. The Togolese strikerÂ’s touch bounced off HowardÂ’s leg and fell kindly for him to race clear and tap the ball into the empty net.<br><br>The drama was not over. Six minutes from time Arteta received a straight red card for lashing out at Fabregas. The second dismissal brought a simmering game to the boil in the final few minutes<br><br>Rosicky fired in a fourth at the death. That was harsh on Everton who had bossed the game for much of the first half.<br><br>But, as well as a fluent side, Arsenal are a ruthless side these days.<br><br>And they are all the better for it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Eduardo da Silva's first Premier League goals helped Arsenal beat Everton and ensured they leapfrogged Manchester United at the top of the table.</strong><br><br>Arsenal had to come from behind after Tim Cahill poked in on 19 minutes but Eduardo levelled after the break and coolly slotted another on 58 minutes.<br><br>Nicklas Bendtner was then sent off but Emmanuel Adebayor hit a third after a mix-up in Everton's defence.<br><br>Mikel Arteta saw red after an elbow before Tomas Rosicky scored late on.<br><br>Arteta appeared to strike Cesc Fabregas in the face and the 84th-minute incident sparked ugly scenes as players from both sides squared up to each other.<br><br>Until that point it had been a game played in a competitive spirit, which for large spells Everton had dominated - particularly in the first half.<br><br>Initially, Arsenal were struggling to shrug off their recent sluggishness, while Everton looked confident, assured and exactly like the form team they were going into the match.<br><br>Gunner boss Arsene Wenger had opted to shuffle his attack, leaving out Adebayor and bringing in Bendtner and Eduardo - a pairing with only one Premier League goal between them.<br><br>And the way Everton's midfield, particularly the terrier-like Phil Neville, set about stopping Arsenal's supply line it looked like the tally could well remain the same.<br><br>There was no time on the ball for the likes of Fabregas, as Everton played with more snap in their tackles and also constructed the slicker passing moves.<br><br>Unfortunately Neville's wild shot did not match the sweet build-up to a chance which included a back heel from Yakubu as Everton swaggered with confidence.<br><br>However, Everton had already taken the lead by then at a stage in the match that had more pace than precision about it.<br><br>Midway through the opening half, an Everton corner caused a goalmouth scramble and the ball popped up off Bendtner's knee, serving to tee it up for Cahill to poke in.<br><br>From then on, the Toffees assumed almost full control as they played with plenty of panache in the pouring rain.<br><br>But for all their superiority in terms of possession and territory, Everton failed to create any clear openings.<br><br>And almost immediately after the break - just 90 seconds after the restart - they were penalised.<br><br>A long ball from Gael Clichy, deep in his own half, caught Everton off guard and Eduardo showed superb composure to collect the ball and stroke a shot into the right corner.<br><br>It was a moment defender Phil Jagielka, who looked to have hesitated rather than clear the danger, would have wanted to forget but he was to be terrorised further just minutes later.<br><br>This time Jagielka was outsmarted by Eduardo as the Croatia international played the ball one side of him and collected it from the other, before calmly slipping the ball beyond Howard.<br><br>Everton could only reflect on a chance for Yakubu moments earlier, when the striker should have put his side 2-1 up but misdirected a header when unmarked in the box.<br><br>The action, though, was far from finished and Bendtner was given his marching orders for a second yellow card after a high challenge on Andrew Johnson.<br><br>Everton, who had been pushing hard for an equaliser, now had a numerical advantage and clearly sensed they could get back into the game.<br><br>But they shot themselves in the foot when Joseph Yobo and keeper Howard left the ball to each other on the edge of the box, allowing Adebayor to steal in and smash the ball into an empty net.<br><br>And their misery was compounded when Arteta was also sent down the tunnel after clashing with Fabregas, sparking a mass confrontation.<br><br>Incredibly there was still time for Rosicky to finish off an Arsenal counter-attack, zipping a shot into the corner to complete the scoring.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FABREGAS FURORE OVERSHADOWS WIN<br><br><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/07/12/240/Cesc_Fabregas_down_tempers_flare_Everton_v_Ar_616263.jpg"><br><br>Cesc Fabregas stands accused of getting fellow Spaniard Mikel Arteta sent off in an acrimonious Barclays Premier League clash at Goodison Park which saw Arsenal reclaim top spot. Midfielder Fabregas was caught by Arteta's arm six minutes before the end of the Gunners' 4-1 defeat of Everton and flung himself to the ground clutching his face. </strong><br><br>Everton boss David Moyes was furious and the home fans chanted "cheat, cheat" at the 20 year-old as referee Martin Atkinson showed Arteta the red card. Moyes' after-match condemnation of Fabregas was laced with sarcasm as he said: "Fabregas obviously has a broken jaw or he would not have rolled around like he did."<br><br>Moyes' anger was heightened by the fact Arteta will now miss three games while Arsenal youngster Nicklas Bendtner will only miss one for his earlier dismissal for a shocking tackle on Andrew Johnson. Bendtner had already been booked and was shown only a second yellow card for the lunge at Johnson. Moyes said: "I don't make the rules, it was probably the wrong decision by the referee to show a yellow for (Bendtner's) tackle, it should have been a straight red. "It doesn't help our case, but it's over now. I can't do anything about it.<br><br>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger defended Fabregas, insisting: "Arteta touched Fabregas, I asked him if he felt it was intentional because I had not seen it clearly, but he said he was caught. "I do not think Fabregas made more of it than it was, I was told he (Arteta) touched him close to the ear and Cesc felt a big pain. Whether it is a red card or not is down to the referee."<br><br>Everton had dominated the first half with Tim Cahill giving them a deserved lead in the 19th minute. But the Toffees came unstuck in the second period when Brazilian-born Croatia international Eduardo da Silva scored two quick goals.<br><br>The second, however, was contentious and Moyes added: "Everybody in the crowd saw the lad handle for their second goal, everyone knew."<br><br>Moyes could still not resist a dig, having had his physical, long-ball tactics criticised by Wenger in the past. He said: "For all the stuff talked about the way they play, it was not their usual type of goals that beat us.<br><br>"We cannot hide that we made mistakes for the goals, but I will take some convincing that Arsenal were better than us. "It was us who played the football and Arsenal who went direct. I'd find it hard to view it differently."<br><br>Again did not seen it clearly Mr Wenger?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I wonder did he saw Eduardo used his hands to control the ball before scoring the all important 2nd goal as well... But knowing Wenger, I guess not also... I think he suffer from selective vision problem...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
