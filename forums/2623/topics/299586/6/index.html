            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by zocoss:<br><strong>[b]FABREGAS FURORE OVERSHADOWS WIN<br><br><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/07/12/240/Cesc_Fabregas_down_tempers_flare_Everton_v_Ar_616263.jpg"><br><br>Cesc Fabregas stands accused of getting fellow Spaniard Mikel Arteta sent off in an acrimonious Barclays Premier League clash at Goodison Park which saw Arsenal reclaim top spot. Midfielder Fabregas was caught by Arteta's arm six minutes before the end of the Gunners' 4-1 defeat of Everton and flung himself to the ground clutching his face. </strong><br><br>Everton boss David Moyes was furious and the home fans chanted "cheat, cheat" at the 20 year-old as referee Martin Atkinson showed Arteta the red card. Moyes' after-match condemnation of Fabregas was laced with sarcasm as he said: "Fabregas obviously has a broken jaw or he would not have rolled around like he did."<br><br>Moyes' anger was heightened by the fact Arteta will now miss three games while Arsenal youngster Nicklas Bendtner will only miss one for his earlier dismissal for a shocking tackle on Andrew Johnson. Bendtner had already been booked and was shown only a second yellow card for the lunge at Johnson. Moyes said: "I don't make the rules, it was probably the wrong decision by the referee to show a yellow for (Bendtner's) tackle, it should have been a straight red. "It doesn't help our case, but it's over now. I can't do anything about it.<br><br>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger defended Fabregas, insisting: "Arteta touched Fabregas, I asked him if he felt it was intentional because I had not seen it clearly, but he said he was caught. "I do not think Fabregas made more of it than it was, I was told he (Arteta) touched him close to the ear and Cesc felt a big pain. Whether it is a red card or not is down to the referee."<br><br>Everton had dominated the first half with Tim Cahill giving them a deserved lead in the 19th minute. But the Toffees came unstuck in the second period when Brazilian-born Croatia international Eduardo da Silva scored two quick goals.<br><br>The second, however, was contentious and Moyes added: "Everybody in the crowd saw the lad handle for their second goal, everyone knew."<br><br>Moyes could still not resist a dig, having had his physical, long-ball tactics criticised by Wenger in the past. He said: "For all the stuff talked about the way they play, it was not their usual type of goals that beat us.<br><br>"We cannot hide that we made mistakes for the goals, but I will take some convincing that Arsenal were better than us. "It was us who played the football and Arsenal who went direct. I'd find it hard to view it differently."<br><br>Again did not seen it clearly Mr Wenger?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I wonder did he saw Eduardo used his hands to control the ball before scoring the all important 2nd goal as well... But knowing Wenger, I guess not also... I think he suffer from selective vision problem...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/b]</blockquote>Moyes is a farking sore loser c-unt. two of his players dived and was left unpunished.</div>
