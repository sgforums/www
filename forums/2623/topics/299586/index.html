            <div class='col-md body'>past seasons...everton parked their bus whenver they're on the lead or when they wanted a draw..they know if they play an attacking style football,they will be crushed by arsenal. Last time everton tried to play that and they were thumped by arsenal..7-0. So i guess everton will try to get a goal ASAP and defend..but i believe AW has LEARNT HIS LESSON ( hopefully) and play 442 so we can tear apart their defence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cahill: Watch Out Arsenal</strong><br><br>EvertonÂ’s attacking-midfielder Tim Cahill believes the ToffeesÂ’ confidence is high after bouncing back from their defeat to Manchester United. They beat Bolton 2-0 at home on Boxing Day with Cahill himself adding to Phil NevilleÂ’s rare strike.<br><br>Everton have only lost one in 14 Â– to United Â– and Aussie Cahill is optimistic about their chances against Arsenal.<br><br>"I really believe we have a great chance of achieving something. It is all about how we apply ourselves," the Australian told the Daily Mail.<br><br>"We probably will not see a lot of the ball. But if we get a chance, we have got to try and take it.<br><br>"Arsenal will be coming here knowing they are facing a massive game.<br><br>"These are the matches the boys look forward to. We were buzzing at Manchester United and we will be buzzing again when we play one of the elite teams in the world."<br><br>Everton lie in 6th place in the Premiership table. They received a huge boost when Cahill recently returned from his injury hell and the Aussie knows this hectic period is crucial for all teams with top-six ambitions.<br><br>"We are flying and are just happy to be in this position," said the 28-year-old.<br><br>"I think consistency is the key to where we stand. There are a lot of players in good form.<br><br>"We are taking things a game at a time - but for the club, everything is going really well.<br><br>"This is the time of year when you can make or break your season. This is where you see how things will pan out.<br><br>"We need to try and get maximum points if we possibly can and push ourselves up the table."</div>
