            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Thierry Henry insists age is not a factor behind his injury troubles, merely the amount of games he has been playing.<br><br>The Arsenal captain expects to be out of action for up to five months after picking up groin and stomach injuries.<br><br>There have been suggestions that age is catching up with the France international, but the 29-year-old has dismissed such a notion.<br><br>Instead, citing the example of other players who have suffered with form and fitness after last summer's World Cup, Henry believes the number of matches he has played has contributed significantly to his injury travails.<br><br>"The doc has told me I am out for four or five months," Henry told The Sun. "But this injury is not very surprising.<br><br>"Players are not robots. Since last autumn, I have had a back problem that even gets to my leg. I have had to make physical efforts to play with that problem and my body has finally said no. You can't do anything about it.<br><br>"The injury is not a relief. But at least I know I will have time to get myself ready for the new season. This will be something new for me.<br><br>"During the winter, I had a thigh injury. I was already close to breaking down.<br><br>"This injury isn't down to age. It's the number of games played that causes the injury. Look at Ribery, Makelele, Gallas, Vieira, they are also injured. Even Ronaldinho is dead.<br><br>"Same for Deco. Or Gerrard. This is not the great and the real Gerrard. The players doing well now are those who played less last season.<br><br>"Drogba's Chelsea were out of the Champions League at the last 16 stage then. Ronaldo and Scholes with Manchester United didn't even get past the group stage.<br><br>"There is no mystery, but I am already missing football."</span></div>
