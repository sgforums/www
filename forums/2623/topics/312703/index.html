              <div class="post-body entry-content">
              <p><strong><em>Ed: This is a rant by a commenter on this site which I think expresses well the sentiments and comments of a lot fans, inclusive of those who are not necessarily from these shores. See what you think about it.<br><br>By Anonymous</em> <br><br>The media reaction on the Eduardo story has been a farce and it is sheer jealousy that drives them. <br><br>Wenger is one of the top three managers in Europe and all English managers are shite. <br><br>Arsenal play a brand of football England couldn't even achieve on the PS3. <br><br>Wenger has knocked back the England job so many times. <br><br>Eduardo embarrassed England and knocked them out of the Euros. <br><br>Nothing but jealousy I say.<br><br>Had it been Rooney we'd never hear the end of it. With an ethos like this no wonder England's national side is the biggest joke in world football. <br><br>The way Taylor has been made the victim is just more proof that virtually every member of the British press is just a racist xenophobic idiot with an agenda. It is sad and pathetic. <br><br>No wonder England players keep getting sent off in international tournaments. I also love the way they try to make out all the red cards under AW make Arsenal a dirty side. Ha ha says the national team with John Terry as captain and Gary Neville at right-back. <br><br>Arsenal play some of the best football n Europe and have the 2nd best disciplinary record in the league over the past 5 years. FACT. But since when did facts matter to the media idiots? <br><br>Don't get angered by the media. Just kick back, relax and laugh at them as the national team exit and get humiliated in yet another penalty shoot-out. <br><br>Laugh at all the sad xenophobe fans who paint their faces and reckon they'll win every game 3-0 and end up getting embarrassed. <br><br>Laugh at a team that has won NOTHING in over 40 years. Laugh at a media that told the world it had a 'Golden generation' for the 2006 World Cup. Laugh at Steve McClaren.<br><br>And then compare and contrast with all the wonderful players Arsene Wenger has produced, the Invincibles, the two doubles, the FA Cups, the Champions league final, the players nominated for World and European player awards. <br><br>And also laugh at the Spuds not winning a league title in over 47 years!<br><br>It's good to be a Gooner. It’s miserable to be a jealous bitter England fan. <br><br>This country loves underdog losers like Taylor and Birmingham. There is a general mistrust of winners, which is why Gallas gets so much stick for showing how much he cares but, when Terry pisses in a nightclub or fights with his manager it is 'PASSION'.<br><br>Ha ha ha. <br><br>The more bile they spew the more I love it. It just shows how desperate they are. Imagine that. The fate of a country of 50 million people apparently, lies within the hands of one Frenchman. Can you believe that? <br><br>I love the way Arsene is single-handedly responsible for the demise of Engish football. Question: who was to blame for the 30 years before that?!<br><br>Here's another poser...Do you reckon that if Arsenal were as rubbish as say...Birmingham or Derby or if they were mid-table like the Spuds and not won a thing of note in 10 years. Do you reckon the media would be so obsessed with Wenger and Arsenal and trying to slam them at every chance? <br><br>So why the obsession with Arsene's Arsenal then? Why not pick on Allardyce who bought foreigners all the time at Bolton and Newcastle? <br><br>Or why not rant at McTwat at Birmingham for signing McFadden and playing with a team of mostly foreigners? <br><br>Why not have a go at Ferguson for not developing any English players at all (in the last 10 years) and only spending stupid cash (that not everyone can afford) on Rooney, Rio and Hargreaves?<br><br>In Fergie's case it is because the media are pussies and don't want to upset all the glory-hunting Mancs around the world. In the case of everyone else? Because they are shit.<br><br>And it is a compliment to Wenger this poisonous jealous envy. His team play sumptuous football and only serves to highlight the gulf in class between foreign players and English ones. How they must hate it...<br><br>And why do people keep going on about that Gallas kick at Nani? Is Nani and ManYoo such a bunch of big pussies that they think that was horrible? Does anybody remember Roy Keane? Right then.<br><br>That gallas 'kick' wouldn’t have knocked out a 7 year-old. Although that poor little Nani must have a graze somewhere I am sure...<br><br>And finally, funny how this FA Cup win for ManYoo seems to make them so excited. Did Arsenal care? Nope. Are Arsenal 3 points clear of ManYoo despite Mancs spending £50 million more on players?<br><br>LOL<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>
              <p>very interesting read. i find the article quite true, if Eduardo is english, will those media n FA took action for harsh tackle?</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">CESC FABREGAS thinks everybody hates Arsenal — and he does not understand why.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/67/285x214/39605_1.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="214"></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #999999;">FABREGAS getting paranoia and thinks everybody hates Arsenal.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Gunners have gone five league games without a win and fallen six points behind leaders Manchester United. After heading the pack by five points, Arsenal are now in third behind Chelsea and Fabregas thinks he can see the glee in people’s eyes.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Gunners midfielder said: “I feel every time we lose or we don’t play well it’s like everybody’s happy. “I still don’t understand why everybody is against people who try to play nice football. “We’ve been playing fantastic football. But it’s true people like to see us lose. That’s the way I feel.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal have not thrown in the title towel though. They still have to visit Old Trafford on April 13 while United must go to Chelsea 13 days later. But Fabregas admits the Gunners cannot afford any more slip-ups in their last six games as they prepare for their match against Liverpool.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Spaniard said: “If we want to win the league we cannot lose any more points. We have to think positive. “We have to believe we can do it. Whatever happens we fight to the end — that is what we are recognised for. “We can change things. Man United have to go to Chelsea and we’re going to Old Trafford to win. Of course we can win there. We did it last season and we’ve done if a few times in recent years so why not this time?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“We have to go game by game. And every game is a final right to the end of the season.” Arsenal have not won a domestic game since February 11 before last night. The Gunners slumped to a 4-0 defeat at United in the FA Cup in their following match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Fabregas says things started to go wrong when they drew 2-2 with Birmingham. Eduardo suffered his horrific leg break at St Andrew’s and Gael Clichy conceded a last-minute penalty which allowed Brum to grab a point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Three more draws followed, then Arsenal lost 2-1 to Chelsea last Sunday after taking the lead. Fabregas said: “A little bit of everything has gone wrong in the last few weeks. “It all started at Birmingham where we could have killed the game before they equalised. “We could have made it 3-1 and then, after that little mistake by Gael, they had a penalty. “But even then you can say it was not a penalty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Against Chelsea, two players were offside for the first goal. Then we made a few mistakes at the back and paid for that. With talent like 24-year-olds Robin Van Persie, Emmanuel Adebayor and Emmanuel Eboue plus Fabregas in the ranks, Arsenal have the potential to win trophies for years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the possibility of going three seasons without any silverware is something Fab does not want to think about. And he has his eyes on Premier League and Champions League glory come May.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fabregas, 20, said: “We don’t want to be talking every year about the future. “We want to win this season and we have shown we have the team to do it.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if matters do not go according to plan, Arsenal will have to look to at least finish second in the league to avoid having to play a Champions League qualifier in the summer.</p>
