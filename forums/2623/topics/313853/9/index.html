              <p>Actually if you all look at it carefully, Arsenal played well in the first half. The only problem i felt was their finishing wasn't there... If they had someone like Henry of Torres in their squad, they would have taken the lead in the first half. Maybe even by 2 goals...</p>
              <p>To be fair, i think at the end it was a justifiable result... I don't belief any die hard gunners fans can even say it was a clean goal... Adebayor's goal shouldn't have counted cos clearly he used his left hand to hit the ball into the net intentionally... That fellow was cheating... So i feel the end result was a correct one... Anyway, I thought Lehmann had a good game cos any lesser player might have missed the penalty after what he did...</p>

              <p><br>hanor, Arsenal still the best club for me. we were even written off when Henry left us before the season n no one think we could even qualify for top 4 spot.</p>
              <p>but the young guns have proven everyone wrong by having a good start until this stage.</p>
              <p>i believe it's the case of running out of luck. it really the case of <span style="font-family: MS Song;">å¤©å¦’è‹±æ‰�!</span></p>

              <p>that's it... another barren season again...</p>
              <p>i think it's all arsene's fault.. he failed to strengthen the team in the important dept and also on the reserves.. look at manu, liverpool and chelsea. manu n chelsea buy so many players even though their squad already so strong. and the likes of newcastle, spurs and a lot of other smaller clubs all spend more than arsenal in the transfer market!<br>to think that we are one of the big 4 clubs aiming to challenge for the EPL and champions league and are not spending and buying enough quality players! wtf is arsene thinking and wtf is he saving all the money for!</p>
              <p>if we continue to have this kind of concept and do not buy quality players, sooner or later our best players in this current team will leave us! definitely will leave coz they see no ambition in the club..</p>
              <p>next season, it will be the same old story again....</p>
