              <h3 class="HL">Wenger - We can still win title if we beat United</h3>
              <p>Arsène Wenger believes Arsenal can still scoop the Premier League
              but, if they are to pull it off, they must win at leaders Manchester
              United on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman has his gaze firmly fixed on the Champions League
              right now but, speaking at Anfield ahead of Tuesday night's
              Quarter-Final second leg, the manager was prepared to fly in the face
              of perceived opinion to declare his side still to be title contenders.</p>
              <p>Many considered their bid had quietly slipped away on Saturday when
              they drew 1-1 with Liverpool at Emirates Stadium. However, the
              following day, Manchester United were held 2-2 at Middlesbrough
              themselves therefore sustaining a six-point lead over third-place 
              Arsenal with just five games remaining. However, the next one sees
              Wenger's men visit Old Trafford. The 58-year-old's proclamations
              preclude a win there - no mean feat - however he was talking with
              confidence on Monday evening.</p>
              <p>“Personally I still believe we will finish champions in the League,"
              said Wenger. "Their result [on Sunday] helped a lot. If they'd won, I'd
              have thought we couldn't [win the title] but, now, I still believe
              we'll do it. That is why that result was a boost.</p>
              <p>"We did have a dip recently, it's true. We can't deny that. But
              football is strange sometimes. We feel as well that, yes we dropped a
              few points, but we've been consistent since the beginning of the
              season. So it's possible we can win the last five games.</p>
              <p>"Of course, I said that before the Liverpool game as well, but I did
              say [then] five games and one draw would make it. However it is still
              compulsory that we win at Old Trafford.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Stop giving us false hopes Le boss. Just stop it I plead you.</em></p>

              <p>very painful to watch. can we ever win or draw given dat our defenders cmi?</p>
              <p>like thong, i might bet against arsenal for tis match. but none of us arsenal supporters will want us to lose to those lowly scums rite?</p>
              <p>n after tis match, i hope wenger to field Lehmann instead of Aluminia to play the rest of the season just to give lehmann a great memories before he leave us. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>now the question is can flamini n rvp play in tis match?</p>
              <p>also the team seem to have divided apart. if i could recall, when capt gallas scored, NONE of the players except walcott came to hug him. this problem also happened to Bendtner when he scored a goal.</p>
              <p>Wenger need to look into the internal politic of the team. next season we could have some key players leaving if tis issue is not solve.</p>

              <h3 class="HL">Wenger - Title would be greatest achievement</h3>
              <p>Winning the title this season would be the biggest achievement of Arsène Wenger's 24-year, trophy-laden career.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal manager made that bold statement ahead of his side's
              trip to Old Trafford on Sunday. Wenger knows he needs nothing less than
              victory to have any hope of hauling back Manchester United's six-point
              lead. Also Arsenal are hardly going into the game on a high after their
              Champions League exit in midweek while Sir Alex Ferguson's side
              strolled into the Semi-Finals with a straightforward win over Roma.</p>
              <p>Wenger has won 11 major trophies in his career (two in France, two
              in Japan and seven at Arsenal). In addition his sides have perhaps
              played the best football seen in Britain for a generation. But, in the
              circumstances, the Frenchman would put a 2008 Premier League title win
              at the top of his CV.</p>

              <h1>Carrick wary of threat of wounded Gunners</h1>
              <p> <br>  </p>
              <p>Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick believes Arsenal will be desperate to prove on Sunday they are not a spent force.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger's side tumbled out of the Champions League this week after
              losing 5-3 on aggregate to Liverpool and they arrive at Old Trafford needing a
              win to keep alive their faint title hopes.</p>
              <p>United are six points clear of their rivals at the top of the table but
              Carrick is expecting a stiff test as they go for glory on two fronts.
              He said: 'I am sure the Liverpool disappointment will be out of Arsenal's
              system when the match starts.
              'It is a different game completely for them now and it is a big one. I don't
              know if it is make or break for them. Every game at this time of the season is
              huge.
              'They will be right up for it and we face a real challenge.
              'There is a lot at stake for both of us. We are aware that it will still be
              as tough as it would ever have been against them.
              'But this is what you want to be involved in and the game on Sunday is
              massive.'
              Carrick added: 'I am enjoying my football here and who wouldn't.
              'We are involved in two competitions and in with a fighting chance in both of
              them.
              'We have given ourselves a great chance in the league and done what we wanted
              to do in Europe.'
              Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney are both almost certain to be restored to
              the starting line-up after being rested in midweek.
              United, however, still excelled to reach the semi-finals of the Champions
              League by beating Roma 3-0 on aggregate to set up a mouth-watering clash against
              Barcelona.
              Ronaldo is delighted to have taken his game to a higher level this season.
              'I am happy with my improvement,' said the 37-goal Portugal winger. 'I am
              sure I am a better player now than I was one year ago.
              'I hope that trend continues. I definitely have more chances now and that is
              because my team-mates help me.
              'This squad is the best I have been involved in since joining United. It is
              more consistent and more mature than any other side.'</p>
