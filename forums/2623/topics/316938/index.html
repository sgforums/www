              <h1>Adebayor demands an £80,000-a-week deal from Arsenal and threatens to quit if he doesn't get it</h1>
              <p>Arsene Wenger fears his young
              Arsenal team are in danger of breaking
              up after it emerged that Emmanuel
              Adebayor has demanded £80,000 a
              week to stay at the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 24-year-old striker signed a new contract
              last summer worth a weekly £35,000, but he has
              told Wenger he wants to be paid in line with the
              top players in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_03/adebayor0805_468x680.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="680"></p>
              <p>The manager fears a salary and transfer explosion
              this summer, with Manchester United,
              Chelsea and Liverpool expected to spend
              upwards of £50m each on top-class signings.</p>
              <p>Despite claiming he can compete with United
              and Chelsea on the field over the next few years,
              Wenger has privately expressed fears that
              Arsenal will soon be too far behind the top
              teams in financial terms.</p>
              <p>Mathieu Flamini became the first to walk out
              when he agreed a move to AC Milan earlier in the week, turning down Arsenal's
              £55,000-a-week offer, and it is feared
              others may follow.</p>
              <p>Alexander Hleb is
              determined to move to Inter Milan
              in the summer and Jens Lehmann
              has played his last game.</p>
              <p>Adebayor, after suffering an initial
              knockback, is expected to make
              more noises following Sunday's final
              game of the season at Sunderland.</p>
              <p>His agent Stephane Courbis said:
              'Now is not the time to talk about his
              contract. We'll wait until next week.'</p>
              <p>Hleb's agent Nikolai Shpilevski said
              last night: 'Alexander is preparing to
              make one of the most important
              moves of his life. He is leaving
              Arsenal even though they want to
              offer him a new long-term contract
              and better conditions. There's no
              way back now.'</p>
              <p>Wenger claimed his current team
              could eclipse the 2004 'Invincibles',
              but Arsenal are falling behind the
              top clubs in Europe in terms of
              transfer fees and salaries.</p>
              <p>Despite claims from former chief executive
              Keith Edelman that the manager has
              a pot of gold at his disposal, it is
              thought Wenger's hands are tied in
              the transfer market, largely due to
              the crippling cost of their two-yearold
              Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>All that could be solved if the club
              were to accept the help of Russian
              billionaire Alisher Usmanov, but
              chairman Peter Hill-Wood and
              director Danny Fiszman say no.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, along with Chelsea, have
              been offered the chance to sign
              Thierry Henry, but Wenger has
              turned down the opportunity.</p>
              <p>Henry was deemed a 'special case'
              when he signed a contract worth
              £130,000 a week at the Emirates in
              the aftermath of the defeat in the
              2006 Champions League final, but
              Arsenal are no longer in a position to
              pay that kind of figure.</p>
              <p>Chelsea, who bid £50m for Henry
              when Roman Abramovich arrived in
              English football, also considered
              taking him back from Barcelona but
              have decided against it.</p>

Adebayor, though, has vehemently denied the reports and pledged his allegiance to Arsene Wenger's men.</p>
              <p>"I am very happy here. Reports which suggest I have threatened to quit are rubbish," he said in a statement this afternoon. "I love the club and the fans.

              <p>After an impressive season for Arsenal in which he scored 30 goals,
              Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor has inevitably aroused the interest of
              other clubs keen o bolster their attacking options - among them
              Barcelona and AC Milan.<br> <br> The two most recent winners of the Champions League have both endured
              disappointing seasons and are expected to undertake significant
              restructuring of their squads this summer. Adebayor has been linked in
              the media with a possible move to either Camp Nou or the San Siro.</p>
              <p>But while he is happy to see his name mentioned with illustrious clubs,
              Adebayor insists he is committed to Arsene Wenger’s team.<br> <br> “It is a pleasure,” he told L’Equipe. “For a young 24-year-old
              Togolese, seeing in the newspapers that Barcelona or Milan are
              following you is very flattering.<br> <br> “For the moment, I feel good at Arsenal. We will see what is going to happen in the future.”<br> <br> He admitted that the expertience of falling just short of the big
              prizes with nthe Gunners this season had spurred him on to aim higher.<br> <br> “It encourages me to go higher," he explained.  “We had a dream season… and I don’t know what happened at the end!<br> <br> “But I can tell you that we learnt a lot. Fabregas, Walcott or even myself, we will be one year older next year.<br> <br> “It means more experience. I feel like we have understood one thing. People will have to count with us next season.”</p>
              <p><em>who says he's not wanted? if he leaves, we will be in deep shyt as Van Persie cannot stay out of injuries while Bendtner is not as good as Ade</em></p>
