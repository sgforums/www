            <div class='col-md body'>tribalfooball.com - March 04, 2007<br><br>Reading are convinced Arsene Wenger's rant against match officials last week helped Arsenal in Saturday's win at Emirates stadium.<br><br>Royals boss Steve Coppell said: "To be fair, it was a party political broadcast. You're listening to Arsene and thinking: 'Yeah, he's right'. They do commit the least fouls and they are the most fouled against.<br><br>"It's not a question of quantity, mind you, it's a question of the quality of fouls. But it was one hell of a convincing argument."<br><br><span style="color: green;">One first-half incident supported Coppell's point perfectly.<br><br>Denilson went over the ball in midfield with the apparent intention of stamping on Reading striker Dave Kitson but somehow the 19-year-old Arsenal midfielder hurt himself in the challenge and was left writhing around on the ground.<br><br>Referee Chris Foy gave the free-kick to Arsenal and inexplicably booked Kitson, who limped out of the stadium with one gash just below his knee and another halfway down his shin.<br><br>Kitson said: "I've seen it again on the television and I won it fair and square. But I didn't realise at the time that Denilson jumped in on me with two feet. I've got the scar to prove it and if my foot had been planted on the floor then it would have broken my leg - and I've been booked for it!<br><br>"The only reason he gave a freekick was because we broke away and it was painfully clear that any time we made a little bit of ground the referee was going to pull it up and give a decision for Arsenal." </span><br><br>Wenger spent all last week fuming about the suspension of three players - Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Adebayor and Emmanuel Eboue - after the stormy game against Chelsea. His comments may eventually result in a touchline ban but Reading's players believe they had an impact on Saturday's game.<br><br>Kitson said: "Arsene played a masterstroke in saying what he did and we've had the repercussions of it today because the official didn't give us a thing. What was said during the week had a direct effect on this game.<br><br>"Arsenal are a fantastic team and they played so well. But if you come here and the referee is not on your side then you have no chance."<br><br>Asked if some managers tried to influence referees through the media, Coppell gasped in mock surprise and said: "Heaven forbid. There's so much politicking with the big teams. 'He said this' and 'Why doesn't he be quiet?' and 'We've done this'. It's all a bit bemusing for us newcomers."<br></div>
