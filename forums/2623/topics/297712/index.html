"But we need to continue to develop our game and take points."<br><br>Grant felt that his team were unlucky to lose after wasting several second-half chances.<br><br>"We deserved at least a point," he added.<br><br>"In the first half we defended very well and we were better in the second half and you can see that goalkeeper Manuel Almunia had his best game for Arsenal."<br><br>Arsenal boss Wenger applauded the mental strength of his players as they bounced back from their defeat at Middlesbrough on 9 December.<br><br>"We lost our first game of the season last weekend and this was a mental test," commented Wenger.<br><br>"The defence was outstanding as they kept a clean sheet. We came back against a big team and got the job done, so congratulations to the players.<br><br>"In the first half it was a game that was locked tactically, we needed to create some space and the goal opened up the game.<br><br>"In the second half we had four or five chances to score the second goal. Overall, I felt that three points was just about right."<br><br>Goalscorer Gallas, a former Chelsea player, was pleased to see his team back on top of the table.<br><br>"It is good that we are still top because we put pressure on Manchester United," he said.<br><br>"They have to know that we're there and we'll be there until the end of the season. We know we have to work every game and we will not give up."</div>
