            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger warned the rest of the Premier League that his side are true title contenders, following their 5-0 home demolition of lowly Derby County.<br><br>The Gunners were written off by many pundits following the summer exit of Thierry Henry, but they have started the new season in fine style, following up their 3-0 Champions League win over Sevilla with another impressive display.<br><br>Wenger said afterwards: "This team means business. We are not there to show off, we want to achieve something together.<br><br>"We kept a good concentration on the quality of our game. It was really enjoyable to watch.<br><br>"Emmanuel Adebayor looks stronger physically and you see that in many challenges. There is a huge force coming out of him. He had that already, but now he looks calmer in his finishing.<br><br>"We try to play football we love here. When we don't win we are criticised, when we win people love us. But, above all, we are faithful to the idea we have of the game.<br><br>"We have played six games, four times at home, so we are conscious next week at West Ham will be another test. We won in a convincing way at Tottenham, we could have won at Blackburn so let us keep it going.<br><br>"There is still room for improvement and the target is to get better and better and hopefully peak in April and May."<br><br>Wenger also paid tribute to midfield maestro Cesc Fabregas, who scored for the sixth game in a row this season.<br><br>The Frenchman added: "Cesc is naturally very hard on himself. That struck me even when he was 16.<br><br>"He is very demanding of himself. He has his feet on the ground and I think he will deal well with that situation."</div>
