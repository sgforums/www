            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">ArsÃ¨ne Wenger believes Arsenal will be ready to fight for the Premiership title next season however heÂ’ll not necessarily add to his squad over the summer.<br><br>The Frenchman takes his side to Portsmouth on Sunday for the final game of the campaign safe in the knowledge that they will finish third or fourth in the table. However a slow start to the season ensured they were never really contenders for the top spot.<br><br>Wenger has previously talked of the need for one or perhaps two Â“super, super classÂ” players. However, speaking before the weekend games, he suggested any purchase must be considered in the light of the youngsters who have emerged this season.<br><br>Â“The problem is that because we have had a disappointing season, everybody wants you to buy,Â” said Wenger.<br><br>Â“I have to really think if that is needed or not because there is an element in our team that they will progress because they are young. Also, what do I need to add, if I do need to add something?<br><br>Â“I will do what I feel is right for the team and for the Club but the situation is not always to buy. Manchester United let Ruud van Nistelrooy go, they bought only Michael Carrick and now they play for the Premiership.Â”<br><br>Wenger went on: Â“We will be ready to go [for the title] next season if we have the right mixture.<br><br>Â“We need to find a better balance in our team in some positions then we will be ready.Â”</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tats crap... now is a gd example of insufficient signings... players will still get injured... players will still get their bad day... henry will still get surrounded by whole defence... ur left wing will still be dead when rosicky gets injured... so please dun be so giam n sign some superstars to at least boost the morale n take the pressure off henry n co...<br><br>add: dun compare with manu cos they got championship form + 12th player...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wenger does have some talent among the current players, but one problem is over-reliance on Henry. Also, with Henry out injured so long, Arsenal not only lost their captain but one of the players who provides the experience needed.<br><br>And not just a slightly older player from elsewhere, but one who has already played extensively in the premiership. Rosicky is experienced as a player but it has only been his first year in EPL afterall. I think Wenger should get one or two other experienced players from within the premiership.<br><br>In the past there were players like Bergkamp around. This year not only Henry but EPL veteran Ljunberg has featured very little as well.</div>
