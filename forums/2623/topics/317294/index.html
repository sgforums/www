              <p><span><strong> Arsenal turn to £10M Barcelona ace Toure</strong></span></p>
              <p><span> Arsenal are chasing Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure.</span></p>
              <p><span> The <em>People</em> says Gunners boss Arsene
              Wenger is hoping Yaya will do what no player has yet managed at Arsenal
              - fill the boots of Patrick Vieira.</span></p>
              <p><span>Midfielder Yaya - who is 25 on Tuesday - has been identified by Wenger as the man to bring some bite back to his side.</span></p>
              <p><span>Yaya, whose brother Kolo is a likely candidate
              to skipper Arsenal next season, had a trial with the Gunners in 2002
              but Wenger decided not to offer him a deal.</span></p>
              <p><span>And two years ago, the player was also linked with a move back to the north London outfit.</span></p>
              <p><span>Now, however, Wenger is ready to make his move
              and, with Barcelona looking to appoint former star defender Pep
              Guardiola as boss this summer, a £10m deal is in the offing. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong> Arsenal chasing Stuttgart striker Gomez</strong></span></p>
              <p><span> Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is leading the chase to sign Stuttgart striker Mario Gomez according to reports.</span></p>
              <p><span> Gomez, 22, currently plays for Stuttgart and is making a huge name for
              himself in the Bundesliga. Last year he was voted the German player of
              the year and this season he is currently the second highest top scorer
              in the Bundesliga, behind Luca Toni, having scored 18 goals in 23
              appearances.</span></p>
              <p><span>His goals have brought him to the attention of
              Wenger and the young striker is thought to be interesting the Arsenal
              manager who is looking to bolster his strike force.</span></p>
              <p><span>Gomez, who despite the Spanish sounding name -
              his father is Spanish but his mother German, has already broken into
              the German national side. </span></p>
              <p><span>The striker will be looking to make an impact this summer at Euro 2008 and if he does, no doubt his price tag will rocket. </span></p>

              <h1>Yaya To Arsenal?</h1>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger will be looking to bolster his options in
              central midfield over the summer following the departure of Mathieu
              Flamini for AC Milan.<br><br>The January sale of Lassana Diarra and the
              declining form of Gilberto Silva leaves Arsenal rather thinner in the
              middle of the park than they would like, sparking speculation that
              Wenger will splash out in the transfer window.<br><br>And according to <em>The People</em>,
              the Frenchman has pegged Toure to fill the void left by not only
              Flamini’s departure, but that of former skipper Patrick Vieira in 2005.<br><br>The
              former AS Monaco man has been linked with Arsenal several times over
              the last six years, due to the fact his brother and fellow Ivory Coast
              international Kolo Toure plays for the club.<br><br>And with the Toure
              the elder set to receive the captain’s armband next season, and Barca
              preparing to enter a new phase under Josep Guardiola, the time could
              not be riper for Toure the younger to make a â‚¤10 million switch to
              North London.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Barcelona star Yaya Toure admits it 'would be fantastic' to join older brother Kolo at Arsenal next season.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old was one of the few, along with Lionel Messi, to enjoy a good season at Barca in a disappointing campaign that saw the Catalan club end the year empty-handed yet again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But with a new coach in Josep Guardiola and a grand-scale clearout proposed at the Nou Camp, Toure could head for the exit door just a year after moving from Monaco.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I am conscious of interest from certain Premier League clubs,' Toure told <em>L'Equipe</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I can't say anything for the moment, but it's true that it would be great to play for a big club with my brother.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'That would be fantastic, but you never know.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is reportedly ready to table a £10million bid for Toure - a player whose skills he is well aware of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Ivory Coast midfielder had a pre-season trial at Arsenal, but failed to seal a permanent move and joined Olympiacos in summer 2005 instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While Toure would love to link up with his brother he also professed his admiration for new Barca boss Guardiola - a player he models himself on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We had a very difficult season and it was very hard for us, because we are winners in spirit,' Toure added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We have so many talented players, I can't understand how we are so far from Real Madrid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Guardiola was one of my favourite players.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'He is a leader of the game who plays just in front of the defence and he played football how it should be played.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I loved watching him when I was learning my skill.'</p>

              <p><strong>Gunners boss keen on Zarate</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.newsquest.co.uk/image.php?id=974368&amp;type=full" alt=""></p>
              <p>ARSENAL are believed to be weighing up a move for talented Argentinian forward Mauro Zarate.</p>
              <p>The 21-year-old scored four goals in six starts for Birmingham City after signing on loan from Qatar outfit Al-Sadd in January.</p>
              <p>Blues officials had been in negotiations with the player's agents
              over extending the loan deal through to next season, but he quit the
              club following their relegation from the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Now the Gunners are reported to be one of two Premier League clubs showing an interest in signing the youngster.</p>
              <p>"Mauro's going to be an attractive proposition to Premier League
              clubs - in fact I know he is," Birmingham boss Alex McLeish told the
              Birmingham Mail.</p>
              <p>"I said, at times, if he went into a team a little bit technically
              more proficient than us - and I meant that with no disrespect to our
              boys - he would be even better.</p>

              <p>"He's a real talent and it's just a shame that our situation counted against us."</p>
              <p>Al-Sadd are said to be demanding £20 million for Zarate's signature,
              so a season-long loan deal would appear to be the most likely option
              for the north Londoners.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The Gunners are keen to bolster their midfield options following
              the departure of Mathieu Flamini to Milan and have identified the
              French international as their prime target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 21-year-old signed a new long-term contract at Stade
              Velodrome just a fortnight ago, but it is understood that the deal was
              only agreed in order to settle a transfer protocol with the Ligue 1
              club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Marseille are subsequently in a position to demand 17.8million
              euros (£14million) for the player, a figure which Arsene Wenger may
              struggle to meet.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">If the Gunners fail in their attempts to
              bring the playmaker to Emirates Stadium, Internazionale and Real Madrid
              are expected to renew the interest they showed in Nasri last year.</span></p>

              <h4>Offers</h4>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>Eric Gerets admits that the likelihood of
              keeping the midfielder in France looks slim and expects one of Europe's
              top clubs to come knocking during the close season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Before thinking about bringing in reinforcements over the
              summer we need to know who is going to stay, and above all the players
              I want to keep," the Marseille boss told <em>L'Equipe</em>.</p>

              <p>"If there is a big offer for Samir, then of course he will leave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I can't criticize the club because it is the same everywhere. When there is a huge offer made, players leave."</p>

              <h1>Wenger looks at Aquilani as Flamini replacement</h1>

              <p>The 23-year-old Italy international has been capped four times and is
              seen by Arsene Wenger as a possible replacement for the departed
              Mathieu Flamini. Arsenal have already outlined personal terms.</p>
              <p>Wenger is also interested in Marseille's ï¿ G15million-rated
              20-year-old playmaker Samir Nasri, who has talked of playing his last
              game for the French club.</p>
              <p>FC Laval's midfielder Francis Coquelin, 17, is also expected to join Arsenal after a successful trial earlier this month.</p>
