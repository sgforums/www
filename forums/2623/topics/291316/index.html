            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/Images/w/wenger_0708e.jpg"><br><br>If you want to waste some money today then bet on ArsÃ¨ne Wenger to be next Premier League manager to leave his job.<br><br>Paddy Power, Arsenal.comÂ’s official betting partner, rate that particular option at 100/1. That is the longest odds for any top-flight boss. However, in reality, you could probably add a good few noughts to that ratio given that WengerÂ’s vibrant young side will reclaim top spot in the table with a two-goal victory at Reading this evening.<br><br>However it was not always this way. The Arsenal manager feels the best piece of luck he had in his career was NOT to start at a big club and, he argues, the only relegation of his coaching life taught him much.<br><br>Â“It is always difficult measure how lucky I have been,Â” he said. Â“To start as a youth team coach in a low first division club [in France] and finish here? Certainly with bad luck it doesnÂ’t happen but itÂ’s difficult to compare the situations.<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t think anybody came to me and said Â‘here is the red carpet for you into a special jobÂ’ and gave me a big club straight away. I know the biggest luck I have had is that I didnÂ’t start at Arsenal, I had to fight.Â”<br><br>Wenger certainly had to battle at Nancy, his first job in management. The small side from the Lorraine region plucked him out of Cannes youth set-up in 1984 and were immediately rewarded when he guided them to a healthy 11th place in his first season. In his second season they finished third from bottom and survived via a play-off but, a year later, they succumbed to the seemingly inevitable demotion. However his relative success had alerted the attention of Monaco.<br><br>Â“Yes, I experienced [relegation] when I was quite young,Â” said Wenger. Â“It was a good learning process as I was on my own completely without any assistants.<br><br>Â“The pressure at the bottom is different to pressure at the top. At Nancy we made miracles every year because we where always favourites to go down. When I left they offered me the chance to take over at the club completely. They offered me a contract of five years. But at the time I was only 36 and I decided then to go to Monaco. It is a miracle I had big clubs to go to. But that still happens now, big clubs always look for good young managers.Â”</div>
