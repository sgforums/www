            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/07/04/330/CescFabregasandEmmanuelAdebayor_216689.jpg"><br><br>Arsenal FC striker Emmanuel Adebayor labelled team-mate Cesc Fabregas "one of the best players in the world" after the Spaniard inspired Wednesday's impressive 3-0 win over Sevilla FC in UEFA Champions League Group H. Fabregas took his goal tally for the season to six by firing in a deflected shot on 27 minutes, then set up further strikes for Robin van Persie and Eduardo da Silva as the Gunners got their campaign off to an ideal start.<br><br>'World class'<br>He had made an identical contribution against Tottenham Hotspur FC four days earlier - when Adebayor benefited from two Fabregas assists - and the Togolese striker was keen to single the 20-year-old out for praise. "He's definitely one of the best players in the world right now," Adebayor told uefa.com. "Last season Cesc was already good but he's even better now. He didn't score many last year, now he scores in every game. But it's his all-round contribution that makes him world class."<br><br>Outstanding form<br>Sevilla had been expected to pose considerable problems to Arsenal on their competition debut, having won the UEFA Cup in successive seasons, but ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's men were the more dangerous side throughout, seamlessly transferring their outstanding Premier League form on to the European stage. "There's a great spirit in the team and we feel we can score at any moment," enthused Adebayor, whose strong running and link-up play was a vital part of Arsenal's performance.<br><br>'Strong finish'<br>"Tonight we scored in [added] time - it was the same on Saturday," the 23-year-old continued. "That's really important because it shows we are finishing strongly. The goals are also coming from different sources. I've scored three, Robin has three, Eduardo has scored two and he's hardly even played."<br><br>'Fantastic result'<br>Left-back GaÃ«l Clichy was also delighted with the victory but is refusing to get carried away with Arsenal's fine start to the season. "Everything has gone well so far and we're delighted to have beaten Sevilla," the Frenchman told uefa.com. "On paper, they're our toughest opponents [in Group H] so to win 3-0 is fantastic. Every since I was a boy my coaches have told me how important it is to win your first game. It sets the tone. Hopefully we will go from strength to strength now. But there's a long way to go. Just because we won here, doesn't mean we'll win in Sevilla. We also have difficult trips to Bucharest and Prague to negotiate. But it's a perfect start."</div>
