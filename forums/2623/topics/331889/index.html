              </p><h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">DENILSON may be only 20 — but this week has left him feeling like an OAP.</h2>
              <p class="article">Arsene Wenger’s teenage understudies turned on the style to humiliate 
              Sheffield United 6-0 in the Carling Cup on Tuesday.</p>
              <p class="article">The ‘Old Arsenal Players’ like Samba star Denilson return today as the Gunners 
              look to cement their place at the top of the table at home to Hull City.</p>
              <p class="article">While some believe Wenger’s squad lacks experience, the Brazilian is convinced 
              their youth could work to their advantage over a long season.</p>
              <p class="article">And the former Sao Paulo man believes they have enough quality in their ranks 
              to go all the way at home and abroad.</p>
              <p class="article">Denilson said: “The age of the squad is a positive thing and I do believe that 
              it can play in our favour.</p>
              <p class="article">“If we can keep combining the irreverence of younger players with the 
              experience of some of the older guys we can be really tough to beat.</p>
              <p class="article">“And within the team, all the players are focused on the objectives we have 
              for this season, which is winning titles.</p>
              <p class="article">“There is no doubt that we have what it takes to not only win the Premier 
              League but also to win the Champions League.”</p>
              <p class="article">One of those youngsters is England winger Theo Walcott, who has taken the 
              headlines away from some of his team-mates with his sensational form for 
              club and country.</p>
              <p class="article">Denilson has been as impressed as anyone by the 19-year-old and believes he 
              will continue to get better.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “Walcott is a wonderful player, full of talent. He is playing really 
              well at the moment.</p>
              <p class="article">“This is not only positive for Arsenal but it is also important for England. I 
              am sure he can help both the club and the national team to achieve great 
              things.”</p>
              <p class="article">While Walcott has hogged the limelight, Denilson has quietly started to make 
              an impact after two years at the Emirates.</p>
              <p class="article">The young Brazilian has become a key part of Arsene Wenger’s first team this 
              season following the summer departure of Mathieu Flamini.</p>
              <p class="article">Two goals in five league games and an effective partnership with Cesc Fabregas 
              in midfield have helped Arsenal storm to the top of the table.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">And Denilson is relishing the challenge of trying to fill the boots left three 
              years ago by Patrick Vieira.</p>
              <p class="article">He would love to go down in history alongside the French ace or his fellow 
              Brazilian Gilberto Silva as a Gunners legend.</p>
              <p class="article">Denilson said: “Any comparisons with Vieira are great for me because he was 
              really a player that left his mark on this club. He helped Arsenal to 
              achieve beautiful things so it’s an important reference for me.</p>
              <p class="article">“But it’s the same with Gilberto Silva. He is also an example for me to 
              follow.</p>
              <p class="article">“But they have both made their mark and now it is my time to write my history 
              in the pages of Arsenal.”</p>
              <p class="article">Now he has finally nailed down a regular place in the first team, Denilson is 
              in no mood to give up his shirt.</p>
              <p class="article">He scored his first Arsenal goal in the home victory over Newcastle and added 
              another in last week’s win at Bolton.</p>
              <p class="article">And Denilson said: “I am very happy with what I’ve been doing on the pitch.</p>
              <p class="article">“It has been a great start for me and for the team. As games go by, I get more 
              confident.</p>
              <p class="article">“I hope to keep giving good performances to our fans. My first goal was very 
              important for me and made me very, very happy. It was dedicated to my 
              mother, who passed away in 1999.”</p>
              <p class="article">He believes he already owes a lot to Wenger, who paid out £3.4million in 
              August 2006 to bring him to North London.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: “He talks a lot with me and he gives me a lot of confidence and says 
              that I am on the right way.</p>
              <p class="article">“I am very happy and thankful for all the support and confidence he is giving 
              me.”</p>
