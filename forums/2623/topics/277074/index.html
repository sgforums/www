            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal managing director Keith Edelman claims the Gunners are in a 'very strong position' to reject a takeover bid and do not need foreign investment.</strong><br><br>Edelman has made his feelings clear following the announcement that former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein is to sell 14.58 per cent share in the club.<br><br>Dein is set to sell to a company called Red and White, which is jointly owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and London-based investor Farhad Moshiri.<br><br>However, Edelman believes Arsenal are already well placed to compete with a number of other clubs in the Premier League who have recently welcomed new foreign owners.<br><br>"The club is in a very strong position financially and you are going to see that at the end of September when we release our results," said Edelman.<br><br>"We have ample cash resources for the manager to invest in his team and his squad. He was able to get all of his targets this year well within his budget which means his budget will be increased next year.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Financial strength</span></strong><br><br>"We are in a very good position, we realise David has sold his shares to Red and White owned by Mr Usmanov, we note that but don't believe it changes anything for Arsenal FC.<br><br>"The current shareholders on the board control over 45% of shares and we believe the way the club is being run and the financial strength of the club will come through.<br><br>"The club is in a very good position, and the stadium is producing very large cash balances for us."<br><br>Edelman is also keen for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger to commit his future to the club.<br><br>"Arsene's a great manager and has produced outstanding teams," Edelman added.<br><br>"We think we are on the verge of another outstanding team of young players and we would like Arsene to join with us in enjoying that experience."</div>
