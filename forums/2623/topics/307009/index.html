              <p>Cameroon has made it to the final of the African Nations where they are expected to play Côte D'Ivoire or Egypt after beating hosts Ghana 0-1 in the semi-finals.</p>
              <p>Alex Song predictably was on the bench for Cameroon's first game against Egypt in the group stages being a young player who is not in the first team at his club. However, Cameroon leaked 4 goals against Egypt in that game. Most notably in that game was the fire counter-attacking by Egypt that led to swift goals.</p>
              <p>Cameroon's midfield was incapable of stopping the flow of Egypt in that game. Being a proud footballing nation, there was a lot of discontent in the Cameroon media leading to some changes in the second game.</p>
              <p>Alex was promoted and has played a defensive midfield role for Cameroon for the last 4 games. He has been widely seen in Cameroon as their best performer in the tournament. Alex is a conservative player like Gilberto and Marc Vivien Foe whose position he has taken in Cameroon. He mops up and rarely gets involved in anything else.</p>
              <p>However, during the quarter-finals against Tunisia he had clearly gained enough confidence in himself and from the team to start going forward a little. He also seemed the only person in the Cameroon midfield that could combine well with Eto'o. He set-up a goal with a cross for his second assist in the tournament against Tunisia and has grown in confidence since.</p>
              <p>In today's game against Ghana I was looking forward to seeing how he would cope against Essien to assess his level. Unfortunately, Essien had to play in centre-back for Ghana but Alex stood out in his maturity, tackling, understanding and one-touch passing.</p>
              <p>Cameroon played with dreadfully boring long balls so the Cameroon midfield was rarely involved in creative play but were constantly required for defensive situations and Alex was very impressive.</p>
              <p>I was kind of hoping Cameroon would lose so he could come back and support Arsenal's depleted midfield but it will be a good test for him against either the Ivorian or Egyptian midfield.</p>
              <p>As I said before, Alex is much more like Gilberto than Flamini. Arsenal's style is better adapted for Flamini at the moment because the team defends as a whole and attacks together. Flamini is as involved in attack as he is with closing down defensively. In addition, Arsène Wenger has been trying Alex at centre-back so maybe Wenger believes his long term-future is at centre-back.</p>
              <p>He has good qualities for a defensive midfielder and a centre-back. He has very good positional sense; he rarely goes to ground when tackling and he closes players out to stop opposition momentum rather than tackle them and tackles them only if he thinks he will be beaten.</p>
              <p>So he is very much like Gilberto – he gives fouls away without getting a yellow card and usually not in dangerous positions. He makes sure the tackle or closing down happens before it gets to a dangerous position – I must say he has to improve this part of his game.</p>
              <p>It may yet happen that he plays at centre-back in the final since Andre Bikey of Reading who plays centre-back for Cameroon was sent off during the Ghana game. I also noticed that Alex was limping at the final whistle so we have to wait and see.</p>
              <p>I look forward to him coming back. This may be one case where the African Nations Cup has helped Arsenal give a player good playing time.</p>

              <p>He was brilliant against blackburn during the carling cup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its sad that his position is controlled by both brilliant players,cesc and flamini.</p>
