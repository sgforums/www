            <div class='col-md body'>Arsene Wenger last night claimed Arsenal have the toughest draw in the Champions League - then promised to knock the holders out of Europe.<br><br>Arsenal boss Wenger saw his young Gunners drawn against AC Milan in the last 16 in what he believes is the toughest test of all for the English clubs.<br><br>But Wenger insists Arsenal can get through and repeat their European run of two years ago when they beat Juventus and Real Madrid on their way to the final.<br><br>Milan are the reigning champions and also beat Boca Juniors this week to win the World Club Championship while star player, Kaka, was also voted FIFA's World Player of the Year.<br>Advertisement<br>Click here to find out more!<br><br>But Wenger says his team will not be intimidated by the Italian giants, who are struggling in Serie A.<br><br>Wenger said: "It's interesting and exciting. Do I believe that we can do that? I say yes. We will be playing the world champion and the European champion. So if we beat them, we will be the world champion! AC can be really average in the championship but can raise their game on big occasions. That is surprising. They look invincible in Europe but beatable in Italy.<br><br>"They had an average championship even last year and this year again. We have to analyse what gets them there on the special occasion.<br><br>"That means it's the hardest draw on paper. But I don't believe there is a lot of difference between Inter and AC at the moment.<br><br>"But you pass the next round and then of course you believe you can do it, because you will have knocked the holders out and why should we not believe we can do it?<br><br>"I believe we can knock AC Milan out and, after, why should we reduce our ambitions to do that? It is a similar run to two years ago, but maybe more difficult. I still believe my squad can improve.<br><br>"What I would like now is to focus on the Championship, be in a comfortable position when we play Milan, that we can focus on the champions League." Wenger also reckons his own midfield superstar, Cesc Fabregas, can measure up against Kaka.<br><br>"I believe Fabregas is a different player than Kaka," he added. "Kaka is more, how you say, nine-minus or 10-plus - that means he's in this zone where he's not completely a striker, less than nine but a bit more than a 10, because he doesn't like to come completely deep and build the game up.<br><br>"And Fabregas is a complete midfielder, so they could play well together!"</div>
