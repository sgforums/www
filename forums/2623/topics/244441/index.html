            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"> Arsene Wenger has accelerated his war of words with France coach Raymond Domenech, with the Arsenal boss reacting furiously to recent criticism from his compatriot.<br><br>The two Frenchman have been at loggerheads over the fitness problems suffered by Gunners captain Thierry Henry since the World Cup, as Wenger blames Les Bleus for over-using his star forward who is now out for the remainder of the season.<br><br>Domenech recently declared that 'Wenger is tiring me' in response to continued criticism from North London, and has voiced his surprise about the attacks from the Gunners boss and Lyon coach Gerard Houllier.<br><br>Now Wenger has again trained his sights on the France boss, accusing Domenech of acting stupidly in antagonising the managers and the clubs who supply him with his players.<br><br>"They treat us like fools, they use demagogic short-cuts, I hope you will publish it," said Wenger in Sport.<br><br>"It is necessary to respect the clubs and not provoke them because it can't go on like this.<br><br>"His reaction is stupid, not clever and below the belt.<br><br>"There will be no sticking things back together, I guarantee you. Firstly you have to respect people.<br><br>"Everybody has the right to express different ideas, but my club won't accept this treatment for a long time."<br><br>Domenech had hoped to have drawn a line under the row with Wenger in order to concentrate on France's Euro 2008 qualifier with Lithuania.<br><br>However, the Arsenal boss has dug his heels in and questioned why nobody in France is scrutinising the national boss's actions.<br><br>"I have managed after a World Cup five times," stated Wenger.<br><br>"Look at the number of French internationals who are unavailable today. Do you think that they have been well managed.<br><br>"Nobody asks these questions in France, why?<br><br>"They have badly managed the situation after the World Cup, and I'm not even speaking about the older players (Zinedine Zidane, Claude Makelele and Lilian Thuram) who they discarded before recalling them." </span></div>
