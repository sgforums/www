              <p>Arsenal is left with the Champs' League as most realistic
                                          chance of silverware this season and are infact lucky they are
                                          meeting Man U of the 3 other semi-finalists. Man U in europe seems
                                          like the most beatable and least convincing as compared to
                                          Barcelona and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>But with their back four changing so constantly and injuries
                                          having limited the seasons of players like Van Persie and today's
                                          goalscorer. it really seems like it isn't Arsenal's year so

                  <p>Well, Van Persie is really a better player overall although maybe not quite match fit. Moreover Van Persie has more experience in a big game in England and has definitely played against Chelsea more.</p>
                  <p>Arshavin has done well so far but I'd say still some way to go before he's considered established himself in England.</p>
                  <p>Eduardo has seen too little action too to be in a match as big as this, at least that's what I feel.</p>
                  <p>No comments about Denilson though, lucky not to be sent off.</p>

                  Wah Got so serious or not, didn't notice anything like that. Besides, Silvestre isn't one of the players I look out for. It was more entertaining to be watching Drogba play well which he did.
              
              Drogba is not easily pushed off the ball and he showed good touch of the ball to beat the keeper. I'd say it's more down to Drogba's qualities that the goal came. There was another instance earlier in the game he was already in the penalty box with the ball and the defender couldn't get the ball off him. Drogba himself was the one who didn't slipped up a bit and let the ball go out of play.

              CRon has not been as seemingly unstoppable this season, and Man U hardly seem like a fearsome team just based on their two matches against Porto alone.
              
              They won the second leg mainly because Porto just wasn't good enough. They had chances to make it 1-1 and win on away goals rule and a better keeper might have saved Ronaldo's shot.
              
              A better team with better finishing would have punished Man U that night. You have a point though in saying better to have Almunia and Djourou back. Silvestre himself was never playing regular football even before joining Arsenal.
              
              In any case, Arsenal are better off not facing Barcelona or the team that just beat them today.
