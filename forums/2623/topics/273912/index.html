            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/Images/w/wenger_0708fulham.jpg"><br><br><strong>On a late fightback...</strong><br>"Well, we had a terrible start and we played against a good Fulham side, against a good goalkeeper. Apart from that I thought we were resilient, we didn't give up for 90 minutes. We were physically strong, mentally strong, and that's the kind of result that changes the team, you know? We had our backs to the wall, we didn't give in and in the end we won the game. Maybe you could say it's lucky, but I don't believe too much in luck."<br><br><strong>On Fulham...</strong><br>"Fulham finished very, very tired because they run a lot, after the ball. They did fight a lot and I must say Fulham had qualities. They could have scored the second goal and that would have ended our hopes tonight. "<br><br><strong>On starting with three points...</strong><br>"This is the kind of the result that can change the season for a team, because we know we were one-nil down and came back and won the game, and that's at least a positive start. To lose that game today would certainly have been a big blow to the team because everybody says, it's after Thierry Henry has left, to start with a a loss would have been really, really difficult."<br><br><strong>On Jen's early mistake...</strong><br>"First of all I was surprised he made a mistake because you know he is an experienced keeper and you want to deal well with your first ball. I think he changed his mind and then he was not quick enough to respond to his brain, because then he lost his co-ordination and made a mistake. Maybe he was guilty of changing his mind, I have not spoken to him. He's certainly the happiest boy in the dressing room tonight."<br><br><strong>On accusations of diving...</strong><br>"No. Hleb is adamant there was a 100 per cent penalty on him. I'm ready to look at that on the video because on the bench it's impossible to say or not, but it didn't look to me like he dived."<br><br><strong>On the pressure...</strong><br>"I was not stressed today because I felt that the players would give everything to win. And as long as you that in the team, and you have quality on the pitch, you always have hope. I saw that some of their defenders started to have cramps. I felt, if you continue to the last second, it's just sometimes a yard that makes a little bit more fatigue, and you know some of them will not respond any more if you continue to give them a problem."<br><br><strong>On Hleb playing behind the striker...</strong><br>"Hleb is doing very well in there, I felt that sometimes Van Persie was a bit isolated, when Bendtner came on and was supporting him it was a bit easier. But sometimes it depends on the games."<br><br></div>
