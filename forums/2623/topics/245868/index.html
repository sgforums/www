            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">SAFFC have an excellent chance to join rivals Home United at the head of the S.League standings when they host Chinese newcomers Liaoning Guangyuan at Choa Chu Kang Stadium on Saturday night.<br><br>The unbeaten Warriors are likely to field the same team that overwhelmed Balestier Khalsa 4-2 on Monday - or at least that appears to be the hint from coach Richard Bok, who has announced he has a full squad to choose from for this match.<br><br>Tactical considerations apart, there is really no reason to expect much change.<br><br>While talismanic striker Aleksandar Duric was taken off in the second half at Toa Payoh, it was only a precautionary measure, with all the players facing a tight schedule.<br><br>It may be a different story for Liaoning, who were beaten at home by Tampines Rovers side last Sunday.<br><br>This game will be no easier for the Chinese, and coach Ding Zhe could well ring the changes in an attempt to hold their own against the title-holders and maybe come off with a point at least.<br><br>The visitors know that will be a tall order, not least because the squad has been whittled down by a spate of injuries and mentally weakened by a difficult start to the campaign that has also seen them sustain narrow losses to the Young Lions and Home United.<br><br>After their home loss to Tampines, the coach explained that his players are suffering from their desire to make up for lost time, and have been compensating with some rushed patterns of play.<br><br>Â“My players are young and sometimes they are overly anxious to succeed, so they will need to show more patience,Â” said Ding.<br><br>Strikers Yao Li and Zhu Kai have been struggling with injuries as of late but both will be in the squad and could probably come on in the second half, according to the clubÂ’s vice-chairman, Steven Lee.<br><br>Â“The coach told me he is aiming to take a point away from Choa Chu Kang,Â” he noted.<br><br>In LiaoningÂ’s last appearance their inspirational defender Chen Bo needed a heavy bandage to stem the flow of blood from a head wound.<br><br>The utility player and former Sinchi man has since gone to get the gash stitched up, but is such a key figure that Liaoning are likely to risk him against SAFFC.<br><br>Â“Chen will be playing,Â” Lee reassured.<br><br>This game could be the one where the real Liaoning stands up to be counted. At least the affable Ding certainly hopes so.<br><br>With another week to go before SAFFC's next AFC Cup match, they are unlikely to be distracted. Even with another home game - against the Korean Super Reds - to come after this one, the Warriors look ready to take the Liaoning game in their stride.<br><br>Now that the forwards are starting to score regularly, the only concern might be the defence which has leaked five goals in three matches, perhaps giving Liaoning some cause for hope.<br><br>But with Razif Mahamud steadily recovering from injury, Bok can look forward to a tough joust for places in central defence, which has been filled by Kenji Arai and Daniel Bennett so far.<br><br>Regardless of the selection Bok names, one thing is assured - Liaoning will continue its stiff introduction to S.League life against top-drawer opponents, and the players will go into this match with plenty to prove to themselves.</span></div>
