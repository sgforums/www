            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/07/08/330/Bendtner_551430.jpg"><br><br>Nicklas Bendtner believes the Carling Cup exploits of Arsenal's young Gunners shows the future of the club on the field is in safe hands.<br><br>The average age of the starting XI for Tuesday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle at Emirates Stadium was just 21, with four teenagers in the side.<br><br>It proved a sound judgement by manager Arsene Wenger to give youth a chance, as Arsenal looked impressive throughout and eventually booked a place in the last 16 following late goals from Bendtner and midfielder Denilson.<br><br>Wenger is sure any of the latest crop of talented kids could hold a place down in the first team on a regular basis.<br><br>Bendtner, 19, could be given his chance to stake a claim during the African Nations Cup in early 2008, when the likes of Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor will be away on international duty.<br><br>The big Dane chalked up his first senior goal for the club with a powerful header - and is no doubt being schooled the Arsenal way will bring its own rewards.<br><br>"All through the club, including all the young players, everyone knows what it's all about and the way to play football," said Bendtner, back at Emirates Stadium after spending a season on loan with Birmingham.<br><br>"We play passing football all the time in training. We are all used to it and can all do it and we showed that again.<br><br>"At the moment the confidence is really really high.<br><br>"The win over Newcastle was just another showing of what the club is going through at the moment.<br><br>"We are doing everything really well. Everyone is really happy and wants to play for the club."<br><br>The young striker, though, accepts he will have to be patient, with Adebayor - who scored a hat-trick last weekend - set to return for the trip to West Ham on Saturday as Arsenal look to maintain their place at the top of the Barclays Premier League.<br><br>Bendtner said: "We have a strong squad at the moment. Adebayor has done really well against Derby.<br><br>"I am going to hope for my chance.<br><br>"Anything can happen. There will be injuries as well.<br><br>"If I am involved, great. If not, I will keep working hard."<br><br>With his side having produced a brilliant start to the campaign following seven successive wins and the club's parent company this week returning strong financial results, the victory on Tuesday night would seem to suggest Arsenal have a very bright future indeed.<br><br>It had all looked so different during the summer as the Gunners faced a somewhat uncertain future following the sale of star man Thierry Henry to Barcelona and no big-name replacement.<br><br>Wenger certainly has money to spend - around Â£70million - should he wish to do so.<br><br>The Arsenal manager, however, does not intend to rush out into the January sales just for the sake of it.<br><br>He reflected: "Money is there if I want it, but I will only spend it if I think it is necessary.<br><br>"Money is there to help you create good team, but when you feel you already have a good team, you do not need to spend."<br><br>Wenger declared: "I believe in this side, and have said that many times.<br><br>"That is not down to how much money is or is not available - it is purely down to the fact that I believe this side is good enough to achieve something together."<br><br>Arsenal have raced to the top of the table without the services of their captain William Gallas, who has been sidelined since the second league game of the season with a groin problem.<br><br>A return can not come soon enough for the former Chelsea man.<br><br>"This is a difficult time for me," Gallas said. "I'm very sad that I'm still injured and I have to be strong in my head.<br><br>"This is my second injury I have had at Arsenal and sometimes you want to know why it is happening.<br><br>"I don't want to cry about it but when you work hard, and you feel the pain, it's difficult to accept."<br><br>Wenger indicated the veteran centre-half may be in contention this weekend, if all goes to plan.<br><br>However, that may have been somewhat optimistic.<br><br>Gallas said in last night's programme notes: "I don't want to set a target.<br><br>"We are top of the table, though, and playing well so I want to be part of it."<br></div>
