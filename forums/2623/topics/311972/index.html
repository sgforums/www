              <p><span id="main1"> Arsene Wenger insists Arsenal will win the Barclays Premier League if they remain unbeaten for the rest of the season.<br><br>The
              Gunners head into 'Grand Slam' Sunday - when the top four all go head
              to head - having seen a lead clawed back and then overtaken by
              Manchester United as their form stuttered.<br><br>However, despite four consecutive draws, Wenger insists his men are in good shape heading into the run-in.<br><br> </span>  <a style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;" name="continueNews"> <span id="main2"> "I feel that since the beginning of the season we have been the most consistent team," said the Arsenal manager.<br><br>"We
              have lost just one game, and that was under very special circumstances,
              so that consistency will come out for good at the end of the season.<br><br>"If we win our big games and if we continue to be consistent then I am sure we will finish in front of the other sides.<br><br>"I cannot imagine we will lose the league if we have lost only one game at the end of the season."<br><br>The Arsenal manager insisted: "We have got the strength of character to win the title, believe me.<br><br>"That
              is my firm belief and at the game tomorrow you will see. Since the
              first day of the season I have said that I believe in this team, come
              back in May and we will speak about it then.<br><br>"There's always a
              first time and until you win people have doubts about you, they're
              questioning you - but the strong ones keep going."<br><br>Following
              last weekend's results, when Arsenal scraped a 1-1 draw at home to
              Middlesbrough, Wenger conceded some of the belief within his squad had
              faded as he surveyed a deflated dressing room.<br><br>However, the Arsenal manager insists the reaction this week has reinvigorated everyone for the battles ahead.<br><br>Wenger
              continued: "I believe that we had a little slow down after Birmingham
              (when they drew 2-2 and Eduardo da Silva was badly hurt) but I feel now
              in training that we're over that.<br><br>"This is a good opportunity for us to show that.<br><br>"On 'Grand Slam' Sunday all four teams have a very good reason to try and win the game.<br><br>"When
              we go into this game, we'll know the result of the United game against
              Liverpool - that could even increase the pressure on the game.<br><br>"But
              the mental strength we have in my squad, and the hunger that's in there
              for us to do well, I'm sure will come out in the final sprint."<br><br>While
              United won their game in hand against Bolton on Wednesday night to move
              three points clear at the top, Chelsea failed to close up on Arsenal
              after they drew 4-4 at Tottenham despite having led 3-1. Wenger watched
              the tape of the Spurs game, which he noted was "kind of crazy in the
              last 20 minutes and got out of control".<br><br>Wenger added: "I expect them to play well against us and I think we will win the game if we play well.<br><br>"Let's focus on us, to be at our best again, on us winning the game."</span></a></p>
