            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://english.aljazeera.net/mritems/images/2007/10/7/1_230318_1_2.jpg"><br><br><strong>Arsene Wenger appears to be building his third great Arsenal side after the 1998 double winners and the 'Invincible' class of 2004.</strong><br><br>Here TEAMtalk looks at three key performers in each team and gives its verdict on which Wenger line-up was the best.<br><br>THE DEFENSIVE ROCK<br><br>1998: TONY ADAMS<br><br>2004: SOL CAMPBELL<br><br>2007: KOLO TOURE<br><br>Adams was an old-fashioned English stopper, great in the air and strong in the tackle. What he lacked in pace he made up for with a good understanding of the game. Some doubted whether he would survive the Wenger revolution, but he flourished under the Frenchman.<br><br>Campbell played 35 of the 38 unbeaten Premier League games in 2003-04. Perhaps not as dominant in the air as Adams but with pace to burn.<br><br>Toure has been wearing the captain's armband of late, adding leadership to his other supreme defensive qualities. Shades it ahead of the other two by virtue of also being a vital part of the 2004 side as well as the current line-up, racking up 36 starts in that campaign at just 23 years of age.<br><br>TOP GUN - TOURE<br><br>THE MIDFIELD DYNAMO<br><br>1998: EMMANUEL PETIT<br><br>2004: PATRICK VIEIRA<br><br>2007: CESC FABREGAS<br><br>French midfielder Petit joined Arsenal three months shy of his 27th birthday and certainly Wenger got the best of him. It was a spectacular campaign for Petit, who instantly showed he had the steel to compete in English football, allied to supreme passing ability. Ended the year as a world champion with France.<br><br>Alongside Petit that year was Vieira, who in just short of nine years in north London set the standards by which all Arsenal midfielders are judged. Uncompromising in his defensive duties and brilliant going forward.<br><br>Fabregas inherited Vieira's number four shirt but commands midfield through supreme technique rather than his intimidating presence.<br><br>TOP GUN - VIEIRA<br><br>THE STAR STRIKER<br><br>1998: DENNIS BERGKAMP<br><br>2004: THIERRY HENRY<br><br>2007: ROBIN VAN PERSIE<br><br>A scorer of great goals rather than a great goalscorer, Bergkamp nevertheless managed 16 in 29 league games in the 1997-98 season and was just as crucial to the 2004 success as a brilliant foil to Henry.<br><br>The 2004 season saw Henry at the peak of his powers, blasting 30 goals in 37 league games. Wenger decided the time was right to let the French ace leave for Barcelona but his service to the Gunners is unsurpassed, as is his goals record.<br><br>Van Persie and Emmanuel Adebayor are now the favoured partnership of Wenger, with the Dutchman showing signs that if he can finally have a season free of injury he possesses the invention and eye for goal to ultimately rival Bergkamp and Henry in the affections of Gunners fans.<br><br>TOP GUN - HENRY<br><br>OVERALL VERDICT: With five of the players above contributing to the 2004 line-up, they have to be regarded as the best side Wenger has assembled to date, though the class of 2007 might just match their achievement.</div>
