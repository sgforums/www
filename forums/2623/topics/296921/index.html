Dropped points at Newcastle and Middlesbrough and injuries to key players have seen the Gunners suffer a pre-Christmas blip.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Losses</span></strong><br><br>However, Cech believes his own side have been just as unfortunate - and have coped admirably.<br><br>"We have also had to cope without big players," said Cech.<br><br>"John Terry, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard have all been missing for small spells. Now Drogba is out but we are still winning points.<br><br>"Arsenal have shown they are a good side, but I think we are catching them up. We are only three points behind now and unbeaten in 16 games".<br><br>Star midfielder Frank Lampard echoed the importance of Sunday's fixture - and senses that now is a good time to travel to the Emirates.<br><br>"It's a massive game for us on Sunday," he said.<br><br>"Arsenal have been fantastic this season, but obviously they've slipped up a bit in the last couple of days.<br><br>"Although that happens to everyone - it's a great opportunity for us to go there and close the gap on them a little bit more."</div>

We've been closing it steadily over the last month, but we'll need to be at our best.<br><br>"It's virtually impossible to go through the season unbeaten, so I don't put their result at Boro down to tiredness - it's just that teams always 'up' their game against the leaders and we'll have our own way of playing against them. I'm not worried about where goals will come from as we're capable of scoring from all over the park."<br><br>Chelsea have admitted an FA charge that their players failed to "conduct themselves in an orderly fashion" against Derby on November 24.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> what is this kunt uttering nonsense abt?

That is one of the greatest feelings I have ever had as a footballer."<br><br>"My main memory of last season is that the win at Liverpool kick-started us towards the title. It proved we were strong enough.<br><br>"We are going there much earlier in the season this time and there is still a long road ahead. But it does give us a chance to show exactly how good we are."<br><br>Dutchman Van Persie, who has recently returned from a long-term knee injury, insists a win for Arsenal is vital if the Gunners are to remain in the hunt for the the title they last won in 2004.<br><br>"We need to win on Sunday. It's not about a draw or anything else. We need to win because we are just one point clear of them. That's why we need to win."<br><br>He added: "In games against teams like Middlesbrough, you can sort of collect bonus points. You need to win those games so you can, in a worse-case scenario, lose a game against Chelsea or Man United."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Gallas - Terry's a good leader*<br><br>William Gallas has praised the leadership qualities of John Terry ahead of Arsenal's Grand Slam Sunday showdown with Chelsea.</strong><br><br>Terry was Gallas' captain at Stamford Bridge before the French defender crossed London to join Arsenal in August 2006.<br><br>He has been appointed Gunners skipper this season after Thierry Henry's departure to Barcelona and has been revelling in the role.<br><br>Gallas admits he picked up some tips from Terry during his time at Chelsea and feels the England captain is a 'good leader'.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examples</span></strong><br><br>"John was a good leader," Gallas told reporters. "When I was there, all the time he put himself in front and that is very important for the team.<br><br>"He made a good job as well with the England team. What is good is that you have to have some examples to try to be a good captain. And before that I think John watched Marcel Desailly.<br><br>"I watched Marcel as well because he was our captain and tried to be the best, and to be a good captain you have to take something from all the others."<br><br><strong>Honest</strong><br><br>Outlining his own captain's qualities, Gallas added: "Sometimes to be captain you have to be honest. That is more important and you have to see when something is wrong and to speak with your team.<br><br>"At the moment we speak very well and when something is not good I speak with them.<br><br>"I just try to do my best on the pitch and outside of the pitch I speak with the young players.<br><br>"It is very important for them. They are still young, but they have some good quality and for that you sometimes have to speak with them to help them.<br><br>"I am the captain and I try to do my best, and I try to show them how they have to play sometimes, and sometimes being angry."</div>
