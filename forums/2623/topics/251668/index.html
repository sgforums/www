We are just going to play the game to win for the fans and as a footballer you always want to win against a big team like Chelsea.<br><br>"There is a big rivalry between Chelsea and Arsenal and it is always a tough game on the pitch.<br><br>"We have already shown we are as good as Chelsea, because the way we play football is amazing.<br><br>"This season we have had a lot of bad luck, but we have learned a lot and now in this big game on Sunday we have to prove to our fans that they can still believe in us for next season.<br><br>"We are doing our job and are progressing in each game. We have to keep on going and give it our best.<br><br>"It is important for us to finish as well as possible and we can still finish third. That is what we are working for."<br><br>Ashley Cole will return to Arsenal for the first time since transferring to Chelsea last summer but Adebayor hopes the response to him will not be too negative.<br><br>"I do not know what happened between Ashley and the club, I just know him as a footballer," he said.<br><br>"Ashley is a good player and a good person. When I first came to the club he helped me a lot.<br><br>"I do not know how the fans are going to treat him next week, but I hope the fans focus on us rather than him." </span></div>
