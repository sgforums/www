              <p>In my opinion, I think we really need 2 talented and capable CB that can deal with high balls. What the hell happened yesterday sia... A F**king long throw that leads to a goal... Oh my god!!!... Both Gallas and Toure are good players but not good enough for arsenal. Gallas is going down hill and Toure hasnt been performing well ever since he came back from the Africa cup thingy last year.</p>
              <p>Almunia was superb in the first few matches and looks capable of taking over the number 1 spot permanently, especially after the fenerbache heroics. However, his confidence now should be severely rocked, after the goals that stupid spurs scored against arsenal. Firstly, he was off his line and  a beautiful lob from 40 yards from a not so beautiful arsenal rebel. Then he couldnt save huddlestone long weak shot and led to a second goal. Arsenal should have won that match hands down... but instead drew 4-4. I think the whole team is greatly affected by that draw with Spurs. In my opinion that derby match, arsenal was the loser.</p>
              <p>Both Sagna and Clichly also hasnt been themselves this season. Clichly is much more vulnerable this season. Attacking wise he is still great. Sagna does not seem as good as he was last season, and after yesterday's tackle, still dont know how long he will be out.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's CB of Gallas, Toure, Silvestre, Song and Djourou, got nothing to say except that maybe Arsene should give Djourou a try. I like him when he played for arsenal as he attacks the long ball. Gallas should definitely be sold away as he is completely useless. Song is just another average CB. Silvestre is still too soon to say anything about him, except great job in scoring an own goal so soon.</p>
              <p>In midfield, nasri looks simply injury prone, denilson is too similar to fabregas, and we have no defensive midfielder. Diaby and Song cant seem to occupy that role of DM as well as rebel Flamini. Fabregas also hasnt been himself as he needs to track back more than last season so as to provide cover for the defense. The only player in midfield that is performing is Walcott... However, Walcott is all about speed and few tricks like push the ball and run kind... Upfront, Arsene sticks with Adebayor way too much.. Ade hasnt been himself this season. His shooting definitely needs to be improve much more. He seems just like an ordinary striker this season, probably because he isnt supplied with so much of the ball as last season when we have fab, hleb and rosicky providing the assists. Van Persie is MAD!!!!!!! All he ever does is POWER!!! every shot he takes is about POWER!!!! And what he does yesterday definitely deserve a red card... that was pure stupidity.. Completely idiotic. Wenger should play more of Vela and Bendtner, they are young and hungry and eager to prove themselves.</p>
              <p>Therefore, to summarise all these frustrations that I have for my team Arsenal, I would just love to see wenger sell away Almunia, Gallas, Eboue and buy 2 CBs and a DM. Fabianski has my vote for the keeper role, he is GOOD!!!!!</p>
              <p>Wenger should also play more of vela, bendtner, ramsey and wilshere. Promote merida and nordveit from the reserve squad into the first team. Barazite and Pedro should also join the first team more.</p>
              <p>Wenger, your time is limited, please what we fans want is not beautiful football, we want arsenal to win games, Winning trophy is more important than playing beautiful football. Do you understand??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh, sorrie for the long "essay"... and if you are thinking why didnt i comment on Eboue, that is because if I ever did comment on him, the length of this post would be lengthen by 5 times... as he simply Sucks to the CORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

              <p>Wenger is THE complete manager... dealing with both the finances and the footballing...</p>
              <p>thing is, he's made some mistakes.. the latest was not dealing with the egos in the locker room..</p>
              <p>another is that he put Gallas as Captain.. that guy is useless as a skipper and once the troops see him cracking, they will too.. notice the great teams never had problems cracking when they had someone who had balls of steel as Captain.. you think people like Tony Adams, Roy Keane and John Terry... and Chilavert of Paraguay</p>
              <p>Gallas is a limp dick and his tantrums, breakdowns and being a nancyboy crying and wanting to walk off during a game would destroy any team... it's actually a wonder Arsenal is still playing..</p>
              <p>but the cracks are showing..</p>
              <p>they need someone who is tough as hell marshalling the players.. but i can't see anyone in the team at the moment who can do that.. they're all not hard enough yet.. brilliant, yes.. but not hard enough..</p>

              <p>looking at the squad right now we can only realise there is no quality back up players.</p>

              <p>of course he needs to buy an experienced proven midfielder... i think the biggest problem over the past few season has been his reluctance to replace the experienced players who left the club adequately.</p>
              <p>just compare the midfield of the arsenal side that last won the league and now, we had vieira gilberto ljungberg and pires all of whom are in their mid 20s to late 20s. now, nasri(21), fab(21), denilson(20) and walcott(19)... knn it gets younger every season</p>
