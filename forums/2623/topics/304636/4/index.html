              <p><strong>Flamini fires Arsenal to top</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mathieu Flamini's stunning strike fired Arsenal back to the top of the Premier League as Newcastle were left with a distinct feeling of déjà vu at Emirates Stadium.</strong></p>
              <p>Flamini unleashed an awesome 25-yard strike into the top corner of Shay Given's goal in the 72nd minute to end any hopes of a Newcastle fightback, just four days after the Gunners had cruised to a 3-0 FA Cup victory over the Magpies. <br><br><br>The midfielder had earlier produced a pin-point cross for the in-form Emmanuel Adebayor, who scored twice at the weekend, to head home from close range five minutes before the break. <br><br><br>Cesc Fabregas added an emphatic third in the 80th minute, firing home after being set up by Nicklas Bendtner's superb control with the Magpies defence appealing in vain for offside. <br><br><br>Nicky Butt rattled the bar with a free-kick in the closing stages, but Kevin Keegan's return to Newcastle is becoming more of a damp squib as the matches go by, with three games played and no goals scored, although two of those fixtures have been away to the Gunners. <br><br><br>Newcastle - with new executive director Dennis Wise watching from the comfort of the Emirates Stadium premier 'Diamond Club' seats - looked to have plenty of ambition going forwards, particularly down the flanks, if without any end product in the early stages. <br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Capitalised</strong></span><br><br><br>But Arsenal soon got into gear and Adebayor almost capitalised on a rash pass from Taylor inside his own penalty area, which Given coolly back-heeled behind as the Togo frontman, with 18 goals already, closed in. <br><br><br>Steve Carr then made a timely block in the six-yard box to clear Bacary Sagna's low cross from the right as Eduardo arrived at the far post. <br><br><br>A lovely interchange between Hleb and Flamini put the Frenchman into the right side of the penalty area. <br><br><br>His chip across goal found Adebayor - but the Togo striker got under the ball and lashed a fierce volley over the crossbar. <br><br><br>However, on 40 minutes, the big African got it right to head Arsenal into the lead. <br><br><br>Flamini was again the provider, this time riding a challenge from Butt and bursting into space before delivering a perfectly-weighted cross towards the far post, where Adebayor made no mistake. <br><br><br>Flamini was then called into action at the other end when he cut out James Milner's pass at the near post. <br><br><br>Newcastle were not about to lie down and continued to take the game to their hosts, making use of all available space on the flanks. <br><br><br>After 56 minutes, Newcastle introduced Joey Barton - to a chorus of boos - as David Rozehnal made way. <br><br><br>Arsenal continued to press as they looked to make sure of a return to the Premier League summit, with current leaders United set to host Portsmouth tomorrow night. <br><br><br><strong>Sneaking</strong><br><br><br>On 67 minutes, Given was called into action again when he got down quickly to dive on Flamini's low 20-yard strike, which looked to be sneaking into the bottom right corner. <br><br><br>Eduardo was replaced for the final 20 minutes by Nicklas Bendtner - paring the young Dane in attack alongside Adebayor since their bust-up in the Carling Cup semi-final defeat at Tottenham. <br><br><br>Moments later it was 2-0. Diaby collected the ball by the right touchline, and fed Fabregas. He in turn played it back to Flamini. The midfielder set himself before unleashing a superb strike into the top right-hand corner from 25 yards. <br><br><br>Any hopes Newcastle had of getting back into the match ended when Fabregas made it 3-0 with 10 minutes left from Bendtner's centre. <br><br><br>Adebayor was given a deserved rest when Walcott came on for the closing stages. <br><br><br>By then, though, the hard work had already been done as the Gunners showed little sign of letting up in their title challenge. <br><br><br>Newcastle, however, almost snatched late consolation goal when Butt's free-kick skipped up off the wall and onto the crossbar</p>
