            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://vnexpress.net/Vietnam/The-thao/Chan-dung/2006/05/3B9E96C0/w.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger has described renewed reports in the Spanish media linking Cesc Fabregas with a return to Barcelona as a Â‘non-storyÂ’.<br><br>The young midfielder took in BarcaÂ’s Champions League win over Rangers on Tuesday night, having been rested for ArsenalÂ’s game against Slavia Prague, and his presence at Camp Nou sparked the Catalan rumour mill into overdrive.<br><br>It has been claimed once more that the Spanish giants have made luring the 10-goal midfielder back to Barca their top priority for the summer transfer market, with Fabregas reputedly a prime target for the club that he left as a 16-year-old in search of greater first team chances in London.<br><br>It was Wenger who convinced Fabregas to escape his home comforts and pursue a career in The Premier League in 2003, and the Frenchman Â– who has dismissed the latest speculation in forceful terms - has no desire to see his young protÃ©gÃ©e return to Spain four years down the line.<br><br>Â“This is no story,Â” said Wenger in a press conference. Â“Fabregas is under contract with us.<br><br>Â“If Barcelona want to buy any player under contract then IÂ’ll give them my phone number. But I think they have it because they just bought Thierry Henry.Â”<br><br>When asked if he would be open to an offer, the Frenchman predictably replied: Â“No chance.Â”<br><br>Hleb accompanied Fabregas on his trip to Spain and Wenger insists he had no qualms with the pair flying to the continent despite being left at home to rest in midweek.<br><br>Â“Part of [omitting them] was just to get them out of football,Â” Wenger added. Â“Sometimes it is better to leave a player out completely rather than putting him on to bench so he gets a mental rest for a couple of days.Â”<br><br>Fabregas and Hleb could both return to the team for MondayÂ’s Setanta live game at Reading, and Wenger has revealed that Kolo Toure and Tomas Rosicky could also be in contention after missing the 0-0 draw with Slavia due to injury.<br><br>Â“I will change things around. I donÂ’t know by how much though. I left out eight players at Slavia and they are all capable to play again.<br><br>Â“We have just [Robin] van Persie injured now. [Philippe] Senderos is back in full training but we will not use him on Monday because he has not played at all. Rosicky is back and Toure is back. They had a good session today.<br><br>Â“Kolo has a small calf problem in midweek but had it been a Champions League final then he would have played.Â”</div>
