              <p>Arsène Wenger is not scared to buy big this summer if he feels he needs to.</p>
              <p>Speaking before the weekend defeat at Old Trafford that saw
              Arsenal's title bid come to an end, the manager said he may only take
              on one experienced player in the close season. However, despite some of
              his previous signings failing to fulfil their potential, he would not
              be afraid to outlay major money.</p>
              <p>For example he was asked if the purchases of Jose Antonio Reyes and
              Francis Jeffers had put him off spending high transfer fees, also
              whether he was 'scared' of bringing in a superstar like Ronaldinho.</p>
              <p>"Scared of what?" he replied. "I would not be scared. We couldn't afford him now so we have to forget it.</p>
              <p>"But the money [we have paid out] is not comparable to what other
              teams have spent on players. For example with Reyes we got a big part
              back and for Jeffers a little part back. If we have the money and I am
              convinced it is worth it, we will do it."</p>

              <p>The 26-year-old is thought to be high on Chelsea manager Avram Grant's
              wishlist, with a bid of around €30m being planned and the UK press
              reporting that an approach by the Blues has already been made. <br><br>Villa
              has hit 63 goals for Valencia over the past three seasons and has been
              one of the few los Che players to perform consistently this year. <br><br><strong>Arsenal Are Terrific</strong><br><br>But
              while he is keen to try his luck in the Premier League, the striker has
              admitted it's Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal he'd really like to join.
              <br><br>“I watch the Premier League a lot and the team I’m most
              attracted to is definitely Arsenal," said Villa. "Their brilliant one
              and two-touch football and the whole style of rapid counter-attack
              which dominates the top level of the Premier League now is the one
              which suits my game best of all. <br><br>"I think I’m made to succeed
              in England but of course it’s one thing saying it and quite another
              getting there and then doing it. The Valencia president always told me
              he wouldn’t sell me until summer 2008," Villa added. "If an offer comes
              in I’m hungry to test myself in England.” <br><br><strong>Liverpool Ahead Of Chelsea</strong><br><br>The
              striker said that if it were to prove impossible to join Arsenal this
              summer then his next preference would be Liverpool, where he could link
              up with international team mate Fernando Torres. “It’s great playing
              alongside Fernando. We understand each other totally and we get on
              brilliantly off the park.”</p>
              <p><em>If wenger dun buy i duno what in the world is wrong with his head! Villa can perfectly replace that misfire-prone Adebayor..he can be arsenal's own Torres from Spain, what more he and Cesc can be perfect partners as supplier and finisher.....</em></p>

              <p>tis guy is no. 1 striker for spain followed by torres. but i afraid price is not going to be cheap n we might not afford him.</p>
              <p>if pool sign him, they will be having two spanish strikers which might spelt threats to all of BPL teams.</p>

              <h3 class="HL">Wenger targets two 'real quality' players in the summer</h3>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/pics/report/bolton29032008_4.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="230"></p>
              <p>Arsène Wenger wants one or two "real quality" additions to his squad over the summer.</p>
              <p>It was evitable that the Arsenal manager would soon be questioned on
              his transfer plans in the wake his side's failure to lift the Champions
              League and Premier League trophies.</p>
              <p>Wenger contends his squad does not need major surgery after reaching
              the Quarter-Finals in Europe and taking their title bid into April
              despite a raft of injuries. However he concedes that a couple of major
              contributors are needed.</p>
              <p>"At the moment, I don't know [how many we need]," he said at Friday's press conference.</p>
              <p>"If you look at the numbers we had Rosicky, Van Persie, Eduardo all
              out for a period when one of them could have produced a goal for us.</p>
              <p>"Van Persie did play at Liverpool but that was a Van Persie of 60 or
              70 per cent. He was out for five months and he is just coming back a
              little bit now. Even Diaby was out for a big part of the season.</p>
              <p>"So if you ask me how many players I want to buy, it is not a
              question of quality, it is a question of one or two quality, real
              quality, players."</p>

              <h3 class="HL">Wenger - I am not in the market for David Villa</h3>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/v/villa_david.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="230"></p>
              <p>Arsène Wenger was pleased to hear David Villa compliment his team but he is not making a move for the Valencia striker.</p>
              <p>This week the 26-year-old was quoted as saying Arsenal's attractive
              style of play made Emirates Stadium his preferred destination. The
              Spaniard is hot property at the moment with a healthy record of 51
              goals in 95 games for his club and 13 in 30 for his country. Despite
              that, Wenger ruled out a move in the summer.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, the Frenchman believes goalscoring has not been a
              problem for his side this term and his improving young strikers need
              room to grow.</p>
              <p>"We are not in the transfer market for David Villa," said Wenger at
              his pre-match press conference. "He has said some very complimentary
              things about us which we take as a big honour. I rate him highly as a
              player but I will not make concrete investigations for anyone at the
              moment."</p>
              <p>The manager went on: "I feel up front I need to give time to Walcott
              and Bendtner because they have made big improvement for me this season.
              Theo is coming on so I need to give them a chance or they will not come
              out."</p>
              <p>In fact, the Arsenal manager argues goal-scoring is not where his
              side need strengthening. It is more the other end of the pitch that has
              been his concern.</p>
              <p>"We were leading at Chelsea, Liverpool and Man United plus we were
              leading at home against Liverpool," he said. "So we can score goals.
              What we could not stop is conceding goals in big games.</p>
              <p>"You know that nine times out of 10 the team that wins the big games
              is the team who scores first. But we lost these games after being in
              front. We suffered more as a team defensively rather than offensively."</p>
