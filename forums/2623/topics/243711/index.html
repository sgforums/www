            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">SAFFC might currently be smacked in one of AsiaÂ’s shopping havens, but three points are all they intend to bring home when they take on Happy Valley of Hong Kong on Tuesday evening.<br><br>The two teams meet at Mongkok Stadium in an AFC Cup 2007 Group E match, while Mahindra United of India host Maldivian side New Radiant in Goa on the same day.<br><br>Victory is vital for the Warriors following their 0-2 home loss to Mahindra two weeks ago, and getting a result against Happy Valley will at least ensure they are on level terms with their hosts, who had overcome New Radiant by the same scoreline.<br><br>Club coach Richard Bok is keeping his eyes firmly on the prize, as he ruled out any chance of distractions being allowed to get in the way of the team achieving its mission.<br><br>Â“We are not going shopping there,Â” he said ahead of the teamÂ’s flight out of Changi Airport on Sunday afternoon.<br><br>Â“It is a big game for us, and we need the three points to boost our hopes of qualification for the knockout stage. We are definitely going there with winning in mind.Â”<br><br>The SAFFC honchoÂ’s sentiments were echoed by his skipper Mohd Noor Ali, who noted that the players have gotten over the losing start to their first AFC Cup campaign.<br><br>Stressing the need to secure victory, he has further thrown down the gauntlet by challenging the team to emerge top of Group E to ensure automatic qualification.<br><br>Â“Morale in the team is good at the moment, so I guess itÂ’s not entirely a negative thing that we lost to Mahindra,Â” said the winger.<br><br>Â“We are mentally prepared to play against the Hong Kong team. We know how important it is for us to get our first three points and keep ourselves alive in the tournament.<br><br>Â“We definitely want to get a win in Hong Kong, because that will open everything up. We want to finish top of the group, and we still have to play Mahindra in India, Happy Valley at home and New Radiant twice, so anything can happen.<br><br>Â“I think expectations are high at the club this year, especially after we have improved the team with a few good signings. Sure, we will take some time to gel, but maybe things will start coming off for us in Hong Kong.Â”<br><br>The Warriors have cause to feel good about this match, considering the fact that Hong Kong is one of their happier hunting grounds in a history of continental disappointment.<br><br>In the clubÂ’s only previous competitive visit to the former British colony ten years ago, they had defeated Instant-Dict 6-3 over two legs in the first round of the now-defunct Asian Cup WinnersÂ’ Cup.<br><br>The S.League championsÂ’ current form book also makes for encouraging reading. They stand unbeaten after two matches in the new season, including a 3-2 victory over Albirex Niigata FC (Singapore) last Wednesday.<br><br>These indicators suggest that the players have shaken off the rust in their system after sitting out the invitational SingTel League Cup in February, leaving Bok confident that the team can claim victory if they keep to their usual style of aggressive, speedy play.<br><br>Â“We lost to Mahindra despite creating many chances to win, but I still think we are better prepared this time than in our past Asian campaigns,Â” he remarked.<br><br>Â“The Albirex game, for example, has been a big morale boost, because they are a very good footballing side. We managed to beat them playing at a high tempo, and we created the chances again and scored this time.<br><br>Â“We created many chances against Albirex and put three in. Hopefully we will create many chances against Happy Valley too and put many of them in.<br><br>Â“I think we can do it without making many adjustments to the team tactics, because we are comfortable with the way we play. Tactically speaking, I believe our formula works.Â”<br><br>The hint of no changes means Bok may not be handing a start to Aidil Sharin, one of only two players in the squad with first-hand experience against the Hong Kong side.<br><br>The 29-year-old had met the 2006 Coolpoint Ventilation First Division champions in 2004 and 2005 while donning the colours of Home United. Long-term injury victim Ali Imran Lomri, who had also played as a substitute against them before, is not travelling this time round.<br><br>Aidil has already been involved in the teamÂ’s preparations for this match, however, having compared notes with Bok on a side which has not reached the AFC Cup knockout stage in three attempts.<br><br>The conclusions indicate little change since 2006, with new coach Jose Ricardo Rambo taking over a side that has seen Brazilian Vandre Monteiro replace Nigerian Colly Ezeh Barnes, who has gained Hong Kong citizenship and moved to local rivals Sun Hei.<br><br>Â“I have discussed with Aidil about how Happy Valley has played, and he has noted how they have not really had many changes in their squad,Â” said Bok of his teamÂ’s opponents.<br><br>Â“I had also watched them last year when they met Tampines Rovers. Both of us thus expect them to play the same way they have played in the past couple of years.<br><br>Â“Aidil gives us experience in certain game situations, and I can deploy him to hold the line just in front of the back four. He also holds the ball and passes it well, so that is valuable experience at this level.<br><br>Â“Whether he will actually feature in this game, though, I still donÂ’t know yet. It all depends on how things go when we get there.Â” </span></div>
