              <p>The pain was etched all over Arsène Wenger's features as he conceded
              that Sir Alex Ferguson, his great rival at Manchester United, was the
              "biggest winner" yesterday. As the Arsenal manager assessed where it
              went wrong for his team here in the helter-skelter final 20 minutes,
              his eyes narrowed and he laid the blame squarely at his defenders for
              their lack of "authority".</p>
              <p>Wenger argued that Arsenal were in control
              and were set fair to add on the counter-attack to Bacary Sagna's first
              goal for the club. But while his purist principles might have been
              offended by Chelsea's route-one approach for their goals, he knew that
              William Gallas and Kolo Touré, in particular, should have stood taller.</p>
              <p>Following the chaos inside the Arsenal penalty area before Didier
              Drogba's first goal, Touré completely lost his Ivory Coast team-mate on
              the second, after Gallas had been outjumped by the substitute Nicolas
              Anelka.</p>
              <p>"It's
              a game we should have won but we have shown some lapses in
              concentration that we have paid for, which is difficult to swallow,"
              said Wenger. "We played quite well and were in control, all that was
              left to Chelsea was to play long ball.</p>
              <p>"I just feel we have some
              defensive problems that we need to sort out. We gave an easy goal away
              against Aston Villa and Middlesbrough and, defensively, we lost control
              of this game.</p>
              <p>"We got caught when Anelka came on and by the long
              balls and the physical battle. We have to be stronger defensively
              because we were suddenly vulnerable on the long balls. It was in our
              hands but we needed more defensive authority. We were not serene enough
              defensively. I don't want to single anyone out. As a unit we need to
              show more authority."</p>
              <p>Wenger complained that three Chelsea
              players were in offside positions on the long ball forward which
              preceded Drogba's first: "We have been very badly done [on decisions]
              recently," he said. But after four successive Premier League draws he
              admitted this loss was a "big setback".</p>
              <p>Wenger's frustration was
              compounded in injury-time when the Chelsea goalkeeping coach,
              Christophe Lollichon, delayed giving Arsenal the ball back for a
              throw-in by the dug-outs. Wenger gestured angrily at him before the
              referee, Mark Clattenburg, sent Lollichon to the stands. At full-time
              Wenger shook Avram Grant's hand and disappeared straight down the
              tunnel. He has repeatedly praised the mental strength of his young
              team, and now they face another test of it.</p>
              <p>"We have to come back
              to win games before we can dream of the title," said Wenger, who
              reported injuries to Sagna (ankle) and Gaël Clichy (hamstring). "We
              need to show our strength and I believe we have it. But we are six
              points back [from United] and we first have to win our next game [at
              Bolton]. I don't believe, though, that we have a confidence problem."</p>
