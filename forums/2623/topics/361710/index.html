              Emmanuel Adebayor believes that manager Arsene Wenger and captain Cesc
              Fabregas will join him in staying at the club. </strong></p>
              <p>A number of reports have suggested Togo international Adebayor could leave in the summer, with AC Milan said to be interested.</p>
              <p>But the powerful striker insisted on Tuesday that he is happy at Emirates Stadium and intends to remain in North London.</p>
              <p>Like
              Adebayor, Wenger and Fabregas have been regularly linked with exits,
              with Spain mooted as a potential destination for the duo now that the
              season has ended.</p>
              <p>However, Adebayor firmly believes that Wenger, a reported target of Real Madrid, remains 100 per cent committed to the Gunners.</p>
              <p>"It's impossible to see Wenger leaving, it would be like a father abandoning his sons," he told Spanish Sports daily <em>Marca</em>.</p>
              <h4>Father</h4>
              <p>"They
              love him at the club, the fans too. He is used to English life, if he
              wins trophies he would stay here for life. The players also want him."</p>
              <p>Of
              Spain midfielder Fabregas, a player continually linked with a return to
              his homeland, Adebayor said: "It's difficult to imagine an Arsenal
              without Cesc.</p>
              <p>"At his age he is already the most loved at the club, he is a model on and off the pitch and we are happy to have him with us.</p>
              <p>"For me it is an honour to play with him, he has quality, personality, he has made Arsenal and Arsenal have made him.</p>
              <h5>One day</h5>
              <p>"I
              think he is happy here, he feels at home. I think he will stay for
              several years more, he is loved, he has everything here, I believe he
              will continue but it is (his) decision."</p>
              <p>Adebayor stressed he is content at Arsenal but conceded he could look for a move to Primera Division in the future.</p>
              <p>He
              added: "I have a contract and I want to win titles in England. In a few
              years I might go to Spain but at the moment I am happy here.</p>
              <p>"One day why not, in two or three years...now I am happy in England."</p>
