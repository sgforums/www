            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41497000/jpg/_41497066_vee_fab.jpg"><br><br>Francesc Fabregas is looking forward to facing former Arsenal skipper Patrick Vieira in the upcoming Emirates Cup game against Inter Milan.<br><br>Patrick Vieira is scheduled to line-up against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium this weekend. It is not the first time since the two have locked horns, having previously met in the Champions League when Vieira was still with Juventus.<br><br>Fabregas scored the first goal in that tie and made the second and thoroughly dominated the whole game. Vieira had a poor game in comparison and received a yellow that suspended him in the second leg in Italy.<br><br>The English media suggested that game was the complete development of Fabregas at Arsenal. It suggested that the student had taken over from the master. However Cesc strongly disagrees.<br><br>He said: "No, never. It would be wrong to think that. It is true I was happy at the end of the game about how it went. But it was only one game. There will be games when you are really satisfied but after many of the games you are angry with yourself.<br><br>"That is football. One day you are up and one day you are down. You just have to keep on the same levels and enjoy football. You just have to enjoy it because it is a sport. Not because you did well against Patrick Vieira or another player."<br><br>"I'll be very pleased to see Patrick at the weekend," continued Fabregas. "He was my team-mate for two years. He was a great player, a good captain and a very nice person. It will be nice to have him back.<br><br>"I feel I learned a lot from him Â— his personality, his technique and particularly how he uses his body. He had some amazing tricks but he also carried the responsibility for the side.<br><br>"He will not be playing for Arsenal of course but I think that people will enjoy seeing him again. I will certainly enjoy playing the game. It is always a big test playing against big players like him. I will see if I can swap shirts with him."<br><br>Another former Arsenal player, Edu, is expected to play in the tournament this weekend, despite Valencia featuring against Arsenal.<br><br>The 20-year-old said: "Edu, he is a nice, nice, nice guy.<br><br>"I still keep in touch with him. He is now in Valencia but I have seen him a few times. I learned a lot from him Â— not only just on the pitch. We got on very, very well so it will be nice to see him again as well."</div>
