              <p>eduardo's goal was pure class even though he look like as if he was offside.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/kiss.png" alt="kiss.png"></p>
              <p>adebayor's third goal was amazing. he was brought down at the middle of the field but recovered quickly by scoring.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/note.png" alt="note.png"></p>
              <p>even though clinchy made a mistake for manc goal, his workrate is amazing which fabregas n guys must learnt from him.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>think waiting for diaby to score a goal. he look like a guy who cant wait to score a long shot goal.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Arsenal emphasised their Barclays Premier League title credentials by becoming the first side to win at Eastlands in the league this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two goals from Emmanuel Adebayor and one from Eduardo da Silva earned them a 3-1 win which keeps the pressure on Manchester United and Chelsea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gelson Fernandes did manage to pull one back for City, but it was in effect a token gesture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal played with a composure that comes with losing only one game in the league and that was to Middlesbrough months ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>City almost took the lead early on when Dietmar Hamann played the ball forward. However, Stephen Ireland failed to read the situation and a grateful Jens Lehmann was able to make the save.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That seemed to act as a wake-up call to Arsene Wenger's side, who took the lead in the ninth minute after Martin Petrov carelessly lost possession.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bacary Sagna took advantage and delivered a cross into Adebayor's path, with the Togo striker bundling home with the aid of a deflection off Micah Richards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sagna was again given room down the right in the 21st minute but put too much weight on the cross and the chance was lost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal extended their lead in the 25th minute when Eduardo scored with a superb overhead kick after a header down from Adebayor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was marvellous effort by the Brazil-born Croatia striker, but City were thrown a lifeline in the 27th minute after Gael Clichy was caught napping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He lost possession on the byline to Vedran Corluka and the Croatian picked out Fernandes. The midfielder calmly slotted his close-range effort beyond Lehmann for his second goal for the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was Arsenal, however, who continued to look the more dangerous of the two teams going forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Adebayor almost extended their lead in the 30th minute when he got on the end of a cross from Sagna, but goalkeeper Joe Hart stood tall and managed to parry the ball to safety.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then William Gallas raced forward and sent a shot wide after Adebayor's effort had only been partially cleared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The home fans were getting frustrated at the lack of devil shown by their side when they did get forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Petrov scuffed a shot wide in stoppage-time after being released by Ireland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gallas then picked out Cesc Fabregas in the 54th minute on the edge of the area. He tried to chip Hart from an acute angle, but his effort cleared the crossbar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>City boss Sven-Goran Eriksson then made a change a minute later as Daniel Sturridge was not getting any change from Gallas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The experienced Darius Vassell came on, but it was Arsenal who continued to dictate the pace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Adebayor set up Fabregas in a good position in the 58th minute, but his effort failed to trouble Hart and went over the crossbar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eriksson, normally so passive, was out of his technical area, trying to urge his team forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And City came close to grabbing the equaliser in the 66th minute when Vassell got on the end of a ball from Hamann, only for Lehmann to kick it clear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Elano, who had been quiet, latched onto the rebound but lofted his effort over the top.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>City had a scare in the 77th minute when Arsenal launched a swift counter-attack. Adebayor picked out Eduardo on the left and he tried to release Fabregas, only for Michael Ball to make a timely interception.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fabregas then chipped the ball into Adebayor, but he was unable to get any power on his header.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Adebayor sealed the victory two minutes from time with his second goal of the game following a neat build-up involving Fabregas.</p>

              <h3 class="HL">'Adebayor is so composed now, he's a complete forward'</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">On the performance...<br></span></strong></span>"Overall
              we controlled the game and scored very good goals. We lost a fraction
              of concentration and it came back to 2-1. From then on it was a case of
              not making a mistake at the back and trying as quickly as possible to
              get the third goal. We got caught in the between the two.</p>
              <p>"But we did not concede a goal and kept good control of the game.
              Manchester City as well wanted to wait until the last 15 minutes to
              bring the strikers on. The game opened up and we naturally got the
              third goal. I believe it is a deserved win."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><span style="color: #dac088;"><strong>On Adebayor not going to the African Nations Cup...<br></strong></span></span>"At the moment I am glad in every match that he stayed at home with us."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><span style="color: #dac088;"><strong>On whether he'd swap him for Ronaldo right now...<br></strong></span></span>"I
              don't consider the problem like that. I have a lot of respect for
              Ronaldo but I am happy with the players I have. They are different
              players. I believe that Ronaldo is more of a winger type and Adebayor
              is a real centre forward. But he has made big improvement this season
              and has been remarkably consistent. I like the fact that he not only
              scores goal but he had a big impact on the two centre backs today.
              Their two good centre backs."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">On where he has improved...<br></span></strong></span>"His
              movement off the ball, his finishing, his calmness. I don't know if
              some people have seen when he first came to us he was not really
              composed in front of goal. Now he looks really composed." </p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">On setting targets for Adebayor...<br></span></strong></span>"On
              the contrary I have said that for me the top scorer in the table is not
              important. I had seasons when we had the best striker in the Premier
              League and we did not win. What is important is that the team wins so I
              asked him to focus on his team performance."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><span style="color: #dac088;"><strong>On Adebayor's character...<br></strong></span></span>"He is a generous type of guy. He has big, big stamina plus great strength and power. He loves to play."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><span style="color: #dac088;"><strong>On his potential...<br></strong></span></span>"When
              you are a long time on the job you don't set any limits on anybody.
              Human beings can always surprise you. You accept that. His form is
              linked with his mental state. He enjoys it all. Above all there is a
              great understanding in the team. That makes people more comfortable and
              confident. That is where you see the best of the team."</p>
