            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill believes John Carew could be the difference for his side against Arsenal on Wednesday night - and feels the giant striker has what it takes to become an all-time Villa great.<br><br>The Norway international, 27, has impressed since arriving from Lyon in a swap deal with Milan Baros, scoring two goals in his four games to date.<br><br>And O'Neill thinks the former Valencia man, who scored the goals that saw Arsenal eliminated from the UEFA Champions League in 2001 and 2003, is primed for another winning performance against The Gunners for Villa.<br><br>"Against Arsenal, our fans will see the best of him so far because he is much fitter now than he was when he made his home debut," he told the Daily Mirror.<br><br>"He has done very well against Arsenal in the past, which is good news, and hopefully that will help them play well against them again."<br><br>O'Neill has been particularly impressed with the way he has adjusted to life in England, and feels there are strong signs that he can become one of the club's best-ever forwards.<br><br>"He has gelled well with the players and become very popular in the dressing room and has performed very well indeed.<br><br>"He is strong and has ability on the ground which belies his height, so there is absolutely no question he can be a top centre-forward for Aston Villa.<br><br>"There have been quite a few brilliant centre-forwards who have played for Villa, but he has the ability to be as good and is definitely a quality forward in the making."<br><br>And while Carew has established a reputation for moving quickly from club to club, O'Neill is confident the player can have a long career at Villa Park.<br><br>"Something has been made of the fact that, despite his quality, he doesn't seem to hang around that long at clubs, but I'm hoping that the Premiership itself - with the possibility of us trying to improve - will be enough incentive for him to hang around and try to see it through.<br><br>"If he is doing well and the club are doing well, there would be no reason for him to move on."</span></div>
