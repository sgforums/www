He just cannot finish well enough and that needs time, besides, he's a winger right now, not a striker and who can be a Henry at such a tender age without any experience? 1 or should i say 3 players don't make a team.

Lukasz Fabianski is damn lousy i will say n remind me of manure keeper taibi. if Lehmann is playing, i dun think we r even punish tis way.

What the fug Bendtner was doing by helping Spurs to score??? N were our defenders sleeping throughout the match?<br><br>Congrats to Spurs for finally get to beat us after twelve long years! This is their happiness day as if they r winning the crown. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Hope they wont get carry away n win the mickey mouse cup n if they play like today, they can get 5th position at the end of season.<br><br>As for Wenger, it's a valuable lesson never to belittle cup competitions. If he continue playing boys in FA cup match against Newcastle, we will get knock out too. Time for Fabregas or Flamini to play more cos they still young n full of energy n there is no reason they get burn out easily. Even for playing this kinda competition, make sure there r some key players like Rosicky in sub bench as without him has proven we r headless bunch. Last n not least, please drop Lukasz Fabianski! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

As for gilberto, He said he will try to fight for a place but these past few performances,he's nt showing tt hunger to fight for the first eleven. Walcott,no comment.

As for gilberto, He said he will try to fight for a place but these past few performances,he's nt showing tt hunger to fight for the first eleven. Walcott,no comment. Its a disgrace to have our players bickering at each other. Spoils the unity in the Arsenal squad.And do u notice whenever gilberto plays,we either lose or draw?</div></blockquote>Well, i see Diaby improving but he cannot defend as well as Gilberto. There's no such thing as Gilberto plays we lose but i admit that Gilberto's recent performance is bad, he needs more match. I'm quite confident that Wenger will do something about the Adebayor-Bendtner thing</div>
