            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Thierry Henry has yet again underlined his commitment to Arsenal after persistent reports linking him with a summer move to Internazionale.</strong><br><br>The French superstar turned down the chance to move to Barcelona last summer and has since insisted he is now content to finish his career in North London.<br><br>However, reports of interest from the continent's best sides refuse to subside and Serie A leaders Inter are the latest giants to be linked with The Gunners' greatest ever goalscorer.<br><br>David Dein's shock exit from the halls of power at Emirates Stadium has also led the English press to speculate that Henry's future could come into question due to his close relationship with the former vice-chairman.<br><br>However, in an interview with the Czech press, Henry has again reiterated that he remains happy with life in London and has no desire to end his association with the club.<br><br>"I have three years left on my contract at Arsenal," Henry told the website. "I love this club.<br><br>"I am happy here and I have no reason to leave. For me, it is important that I feel pride when putting on the Arsenal jersey."<br><br>Henry also played down talk that he can now be considered Arsenal's greatest ever player, despite holding the club's all-time scoring record.<br><br>"Absolutely not. Yes, I am a part of Arsenal's history and I am happy for that, but I am not the best one," said Henry. "I am still trying to play and score as many goals as possible.<br><br>"Now I have given myself another mission: to recover from the injury, to manage the new season and win a big cup again."<br><br>Henry has missed a large part of the current campaign after suffering fitness problems following his World Cup exertions, and in his absence Cristiano Ronaldo has assumed the mantle of the best player in England and perhaps the world.<br><br>However, the Arsenal captain believes his Manchester United rival must excel consistently over a number of years before he can be regarded as the globe's finest.<br><br>"One season is not a measurement for me, let's speak about it after seven, eight, nine seasons.<br><br>"Cristiano has been in fantastic shape this year, he has even surprised me. Just look at how relaxed his play is.<br><br>"Some years ago, I saw an even more talented lad in Portugal - [Ricardo] Quaresma. I was convinced that he would sparkle immediately, but Cristiano is higher now. I am curious how far he will go." </span></div>
