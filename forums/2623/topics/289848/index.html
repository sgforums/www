            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.devilpage.pl/img/news/hargreaves_owen3.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">bollocks.</span><br><br>Arsenal had sprinted to the Premier League's summit this season propelled by a mesmerising brand of attacking football, but Manchester United departed London on Saturday encouraged that they had stamped their own authority on the title race. "I don't think they created a clearcut chance in the first half," said Owen Hargreaves. "So we did a good job controlling their so-called 'beautiful football'."<br><br>The comment revealed the irritation in the United set-up at the plaudits lavished on Arsenal's free-flowing style. United have entranced as thrillingly this season, their attacking thrust more ruthless at times than that of ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's young charges. Indeed, the reigning champions' more streetwise approach, born of their greater experience than the current leaders can boast, could yet prove decisive in determining the destiny of the title.<br><br>"Arsenal had a lot of possession today, but in the first half they never got into a position where they threatened the goal, besides the header from [William] Gallas which was a set piece," said Hargreaves. "They had plenty of possession, but were never threatening and football's about winning games and scoring goals. Both of our goals were beautiful pieces of play, while theirs were a bit scrappy and probably not typical of the way Arsenal play.<br><br>"It's great to keep the ball, like they did, but when you've got a team that are as good defensively as us, you can keep them at bay. The most important thing is that when you win the ball back you attack. We hit the post and had players going forward to catch them out. With the players we've got up front we can score at any time."<br><br>Wenger admitted his side had not played at their best, starting with "the handbrake on", though he gleaned other encouragement from the draw. "You never know what the consequences of a defeat might have been. Resilience isn't the first quality you imagine when you think about [Cesc] FÃ¡bregas, [Mathieu] Flamini, [Thomas] Rosicky or [Alexander] Hleb. They're more team players who you'd expect to be stronger on the technical side, but they have a lot of character. The technical ability and the stamina we have usually makes a difference in the last few minutes."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">another manure's cullion still not happy abt it.</span></div>
