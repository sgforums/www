              <p><strong><span class="main-content">Abou Diaby has agreed a new long-term contract with Arsenal to keep the French midfielder at Emirates Stadium until 2012.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>The 21-year-old made his 55th appearance
              for the Gunners on Tuesday as they returned to the top of the Premier
              League with a 3-0 home win over Newcastle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Diaby - who joined Arsenal from Auxerre in 2006 - has previously spoken of his <a href="http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3088107,00.html">desire to remain with the Gunners</a>, despite suggestions that he could move elsewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Diaby, who has tallied 21 appearances for the Gunners this season, has now been rewarded with a extended deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Unsung hero</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speaking after Arsenal's victory against Newcastle manager Arsene Wenger told the club's <em>official website</em>: "Abou has signed a new deal until 2012."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, fellow midfielder Mathieu Flamini has also pledged his commitment to Arsenal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Flamini, who moved to Arsenal in 2004 from Marseille, has been
              one of Arsenal's unsung heroes in a successful season which also sees
              the Gunners preparing to face Milan in the first knock-out round of the
              UEFA Champions League.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Frenchman's current deal expires at the end of the campaign
              and he could agree a pre-contract agreement with another club during
              the January transfer window, but he insists he will not be leaving
              North London.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Priority</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"My priority is to stay here," Flamini added. "I'm very happy
              here. I'm happy to play in the team and everything is good. My
              representatives are talking with the club and I hope everything will be
              good. I want to play game after game. The rest, we will see later."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Flamini has also admitted the comfort he feels with his
              team-mates, Cesc Fabregas, Tomas Rosicky and Alexander Hleb, in
              Arsenal's midfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We are very close on and off the pitch," Flamini continued. "We
              chill with each other off the pitch. That is important. But when we
              have to speak on the pitch we are doing it and finding a solution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I cover Cesc, Alex and Tomas in the midfield. I'm trying be the
              insurance policy and be a little bit bossy. That's my role. But I'm
              also trying to help the players up front and help Cesc as well because
              he is going forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Sometimes he's tired and I try to help. Sometimes it's him and
              sometimes it's me. But I think we are a very good complement for each
              other."</p>
