However, I'm sorry, I prefer to hear 'Well done, you won' than when someone says 'You were unlucky, you played well'.<br><br>"Winning is everything. You have to win."<br><br>Meanwhile, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger believes the transfer system could be scrapped in the future.<br><br>Wenger fears the new rules regarding transfers where a player over 28 can buy out their contract could spell the end of transfer fees.<br><br>"I don't really know the transfer rules any more," said Wenger.<br><br>"You wonder if the Bosman rule will be extended to any contract.<br><br>"Some rules have not been tested. If someone challenges them, will they work? No one knows."<br><br>Even the players are unhappy.</div>
