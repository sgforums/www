Then, after that, we lacked quality in the final third and that was a collective problem."<br><br>Wenger declared: "I take full responsibility. The crowd were good, we were bad and I include myself in that.<br><br>"That was the poorest game we have played.<br><br>"You can never afford to be poor because that's not your ambition.<br><br>"We tried, but we lacked creativity, incisiveness and sharpness. It can happen.<br><br>"I feel that it is easy to find a rational explanation for days like this - but it is not always the right ones.<br><br>"It is one of the mysteries of football that some players haven't played for 10 days and yet they weren't sharp."<br><br>Wenger added: "In 22 games this season we have played well in 21 of them. Now we want to come back to what we really are."<br><br>Full-back Gael Clichy accepts the team lost focus, and were made to pay a heavy price.<br><br>He said: "The boss told us from half-time to be ready from the first minute of the second half. We did not listen to him and now we have dropped two points."<br><br>The Frenchman, though, insisted the Gunners still have the character to mount a sustained title challenge over the second half of the season.<br><br>"I do not think the mentality is gone," he said. "We know we have the quality to win it.<br><br>"We are still there for the title and we are going to show that against Fulham in the next match.<br><br>"Let's get on with the job. We have to refocus everyone and move forwards."<br><br>Despite his squad now looking somewhat thin, particularly in the centre of defence, Wenger insists he has no intentions of dipping into the transfer market this month.<br><br>Although veteran goalkeeper Jens Lehmann - on the bench against Birmingham - elected against a move to Borussia Dortmund, the future of unsettled midfielder Lassana Diarra remains unclear.<br><br>One of the reasons for a perceived lack of first-team opportunities in his preferred position this season has been the form of compatriot Mathieu Flamini.<br><br>The Frenchman is out of contract at the end of the season, and so is now free to open negotiations with other clubs should he wish.<br><br>Arsenal, though, are continuing their own dialogue with the highly-rated 23--year-old, who nearly left the club during the summer.<br><br>Wenger said: "I am hopeful on it. I am not concerned.<br><br>"Mathieu is free to talk, but the talks [with Arsenal] are ongoing."<br></div>
