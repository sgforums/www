            <div class='col-md body'>I think its just down to him still being very young... At 20, too much is expected of him nowadays. Many 20 yrs old are just starting or not even in the first team at epl level. The problem is Arsenal don't have anyone else more experience to anchor their attack so all these responsibilities are put onto him... The weight i guess is getting to him a little causing inconsistency to his form.<br><br>Unlike at United, Anderson the player closest to him in terms of age, position played and consistency, does not need to carry the team forward... That job is left to the more experience Rooney, Ronaldo and Giggs... He just have to play his football and concentrate on his own game. And he is doing a great job currently with Scholes out 3 months.<br><br>My guess is, Fabregas needs another partner... just like at united, Ron and Roon together they are great but if one is missing, the potency of their attack isn't very good too. Perhaps when Van Persie comes back, the 2 of them will give the gunners a better chance if they manage to form a good partnership. But the problem here is Van Persie seems like a very prone to injuries type of a player...<br><br>The thing about young players are, they cannot give you consistency... That is why experience is so important when it comes to the crunch time... Most young players when put under pressure cannot perform like they normally do until they gain valuable experience themselves.<br><br>To be honest, i wasn't expecting arsenal to lose their top spot until Feb or Mar period cos their Jan matches are way too easy... But i guess they are showing signs earlier than i expected... My take is, right now Chelsea is a more dangerous opponent than the gunners.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And not to mentioned that he might not be fully fit. Maybe his injury isn't fully healed?<br><br>And also the hectic christmas program is quite taxing on young and old players.<br><br>Let him rest more during cup games, and playing once a week only will do him good in time for the crunch UCL matches in feb.</div>

At the start of the season,many said they will step up their game. Its only the media who's been saying fabregas is now the key player.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a Liverpool fan but I have to admit I would love to have Fabregas in my team. He is a really fantastic player and a great talent but like my own team's greatest talent, the excellent and genius Steven Gerrad, they will have their off days and off form. I think they have to be patient with him because at 20, the only way for him to go is UP UP AND UP  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
