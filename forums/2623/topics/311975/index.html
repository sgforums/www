              <p> </p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">IT is probably pushing it a bit too far to say he has formed the Barcelona 
              branch of the Arsenal Supporters Club.</p>
              <p class="article">But it is not far off.</p>
              <p class="article">After eight years in North London, Thierry Henry is adjusting to life in Spain.</p>
              <p class="article">Though finding himself playing on the left side of midfield, he is not 
              complaining about it.</p>
              <p class="article">And when it comes to dealing with his team-mates — and the massed ranks of the 
              Catalan media — that is not a problem either.</p>
              <h4>Henry is still Arsenal fan</h4>
              <p class="article">After just eight months, he speaks fluent Spanish.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet Henry admits part of his heart remains with Arsenal, where he became the 
              club’s top scorer with 226 goals before leaving for Barca last summer.</p>
              <p class="article">While many footballers undergo a memory bypass as soon as they leave a club, 
              Henry openly admits to studying Arsenal’s form, watches their games on TV 
              whenever possible and talks regularly to his old team-mates.</p>
              <p class="article">He may be, ahem, just a little biased but Henry is adamant that the Gunners, 
              inspired by Cesc Fabregas and Emmanuel Adebayor, will win the Premier League 
              title.</p>
              <p class="article">The Frenchman has a crucial match against Valladolid tomorrow. But it is fair 
              to say he will know all the details of Arsenal’s trip to Chelsea not long 
              after his clash at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: I have this feeling Arsenal will win the Premier League. They are 
              playing well against the big four and I do think they play the most 
              attractive football, though Manchester United have also played some good 
              stuff.</p>
              <p class="article">So far, Arsenal have lost only one game and, if they remain unbeaten from now 
              on, it would be very unusual not to win the title.</p>
              <p class="article">Obviously, I love Arsenal. But that’s not the reason why I think they will 
              win the title. I just feel they have the quality.</p>
              <p class="article">I still follow their results, every game. Last Saturday, every five minutes 
              against Middlesbrough, I was texting somebody to find out what was happening.</p>
              <p class="article">I watch them every game possible and I wish them good luck. I still have 
              something in my heart for Arsenal. I speak to Ade, William Gallas, Gael 
              Clichy and Cesc. I have also spoken to Gilberto a couple of times.</p>
              <p class="article">They have played beautiful football this season and deserve to win something. 
              It would be brilliant. No one thought they would drop points against 
              Birmingham, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and Wigan.</p>
              <p class="article">"They have been doing brilliantly against the big teams, so, maybe, it is a 
              good time to play Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">Playing Chelsea was always special for me. No disrespect to any other team 
              but when you play Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United and you are in the 
              final 10 minutes, you somehow find extra power.</p>
              <p class="article">At this stage of the season, I actually think it is better to play the bigger 
              teams.</p>
              <p class="article">It is a big month for Arsenal but I think that they can do it. Henry is 
              delighted at the progress of both Adebayor and Fabregas.</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor, who revealed Henry has inspired him via regular telephone chats, has 
              already scored 23 goals. Fabregas has been outstanding in Arsene Wenger’s 
              midfield.</p>
              <p class="article">Henry added: When Ade arrived at Arsenal, I thought he would be a good 
              signing.</p>
              <p class="article">"Unfortunately, at the beginning, people were giving him stick. Now he is 
              scoring and proving everyone wrong.</p>
              <p class="article">"When I left, I said ‘You are capable of more than 30 goals every season if 
              you want’. Ade is one of the best strikers in Europe.</p>
              <p class="article">As for Cesc, he is playing amazingly well. When he is in tune, like in Milan, 
              Arsenal are in tune. He is the heart of the team.</p>
              <p class="article">Cesc is already up there among the best players in the world.</p>
              <p class="article">Henry’s path and Arsenal’s could cross in the Champions League final. But he 
              admits it would be odd facing the Gunners anywhere.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: It would be strange one day to step out at the Emirates in another 
              shirt.</p>
