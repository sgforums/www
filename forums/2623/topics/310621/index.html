              <p><strong>Tomas Rosicky’s absence from the Arsenal line up has come at
              the most busy time of the season when the run in for the title begins
              to gather pace and the Champions League fixtures reach the knock out
              stages.<br><br>He has been rather injury prone as of late being out of
              first team action since the FA Cup game against Newcastle at the
              Emirates on the 26th January. <br><br>“Of course, it is very annoying to miss these games," he said to Czech television station Nova.<br><br>"The
              injury simply does not want to fade away but now it seems like it has
              been improving a little bit.”I am now training with the ball."<br><br>He
              has blamed his injuries to the very heavy schedule of games in England
              where there is no winter break to give the chance for the body to
              recover. <br><br>“The Bundesliga has a winter break whereas here in England winter is the time when the games are played in quick succession" <br><br>"In
              Germany the players can have a rest and have a winter pre-season, which
              is a big advantage of course. That is not the case here which is a big
              difference," he said.<br><br>Tomas played in Germany for Borussia
              Dortmund before catching Arsene Wenger’s eye earning a transfer to
              North London in May 2006.<br><br>There is doubt however whether Rosicky’s injuries can be blamed just on the idiosyncratic busy English winter schedule. <br><br>According to the Czech team’s doctor Pavel Kolar  "Tomas has an imbalance of his muscle structure," <br><br>Kolar
              is renowned for his work in rehabilitation, in addition to his
              treatment of celebrities in the world of sports, politics and
              entertainment. <br><br>He gained wide recognition for his treatment of former Czech President Vaclav Havel.<br><br>"In
              my opinion, this plays a big role in his injuries. Some of his muscles
              work more and are more developed whereas others are not. <br><br>"The
              problem is in the coordination of muscles which Tomas uses. Muscles on
              the rear side of his thigh are enormously strained, it is a matter from
              his childhood." Kolar told MF Dnes as far back as the middle of last
              October.<br><br>And this assessment seems to hold some truth as Tomas has a string of recurring muscle injuries. <br><br>Have a look at his long list of injuries since he joined the club:<br><br><br>2008 February 1st:      Hamstring Injury <br><br>2007 November 7th:  Groin Strain <br><br>2007 September 20th:  Hamstring Injury <br><br>2007 July 30th:  Hamstring Injury <br><br>2007 April 30th:  Hamstring Injury <br><br>2007 March 1st:  Groin Strain <br><br>2006 November 10th:  Hamstring Injury <br><br>2006 August 18th:  Groin Strain <br><br>2006 May 31st:          Thigh Muscle Strain <br><br><br>He was limited to just 22 appearances last season due to various muscular injuries. <br><br>Kolar insists exercises will cure Rosicky's problems but it will take a long time:<br><br>"It is a task for at least three to five months. But it depends how frequently he turns to the exercises”<br><br>Tomas
              himself has said that he expects to return to action in time for the
              Champions league Quarter Final which will take place on April 1st (on
              fool’s day)! <br><br>He will miss the home game against Middlesbrough next Sunday as well the away games at Chelsea and Bolton Wanderers.<br><br>Let’s
              hope the Arsenal physios and himself address his muscle problems
              properly so that the probability for any more injuries is kept to a
              minimum. </strong></p>
