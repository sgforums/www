              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Theo Walcott is hoping to shake off the Thierry Henry comparisons which follow him around at Arsenal. </strong></p>
              <p>The youngster is keen to prove that he brings his own
              qualities to the Gunners, while accepting that his electric pace and
              ability to cut inside from the flanks are similar to the traits
              perfected by Henry during his time in North London.</p>
              <p>The
              19-year-old realises that making the grade in the Premier League is
              vital to his progress this year, while he is also looking to become an
              established member of the England squad.</p>
              <p>His controversial
              selection for the 2006 World Cup, as an untried 17-year-old, has been
              widely criticised, but he has bounced back in eye-catching style.</p>
              <p>He
              now has two full caps to his name and has been included in Fabio
              Capello's 23-man party for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against
              Andorra and Croatia.</p>
              <p>He has begun the new season in impressive
              fashion, with an Henry-esque finish against FC Twente in a recent UEFA
              Champions League qualifier rekindling memories of the flying Frenchman.</p>
              <h4>Improving</h4>
              <p>"I learnt so much from Thierry, but it was my own finish and I quite like to score goals like that," the Arsenal striker said.</p>
              <p>"People always say it is like Thierry, but I am not bothered.</p>
              <p>"It is nice to be compared to him, of course, but I want to be my own player."</p>
              <p>He went on to add: "It was good to get my first goal early on this season.</p>
              <p>"Last
              year I left it quite late, but then they kept coming, so hopefully I
              can carry on scoring now I have got the first one out of the way.</p>
              <p>"I think my touch has improved this year and my link-up play has definitely improved.</p>
              <p>"I need to just get into the games, keep running at players and to flow nicely."</p>
