Now it is just a matter of revealing the winners. As usual the results of the Arsenal.com Player of the Year poll will be made known over a matter of weeks, in reverse order, with each of the top four receiving a week of dedicated content.<br><br>Arsenal.com editor Richard Clarke kicks off this process with the player who finished fourth with five per cent of the vote.<br><br>For all sorts of reasons, it is a real pleasure to announce that Gael Clichy has finished fourth in the Arsenal.com Player of the Year poll.<br><br>First and foremost, he thoroughly deserves a place in the upper echelons for his quiet consistency last term. It is important to remember he began the season with both injuries and question marks against him. When he played his first game in October the previous 12 months had seen only a handful of appearances, a couple of breaks to his foot and a whole bellyful of frustration. ArsÃ¨ne Wenger later suggested there had even been concern about his career.<br><br>Then there was the little matter of replacing Ashley Cole. The previous Arsenal No 3 had widely been considered to be the best left back in the world and the off-the-field circumstances of his move to Chelsea had done little to change that perception at the tail-end of last summer.<br><br>But then it is easy to forget that, back in September, Arsenal had two full backs embarking on their debut season as a first choice. Like Clichy, Emmanuel Eboue had shown every sign that he could fill the boots of his more experienced forebear. But now - week in, week out - they had to perform.<br><br>Opposition managers noticed the change and there was an obvious pressure exerted down the Arsenal flanks early on in the season. It was no-brainer. You either went that way or attempt tear down ArsenalÂ’s two towers of strength at centre half Â— Kolo Toure and William Gallas.<br><br>Clichy was stretched but never skinned. And, most importantly, he learnt quickly. Natural pace and crisply-timed tackles remained the bedrock of his game but, despite the extra pressure, his temperament remained assured and positive. Two bookings in 25 Premiership games is a testament to that. However just one assist in all competitions is somewhat of a mystery when, in the estimations of Arsenal TVÂ’s Stewart Robson, he is the PremiershipÂ’s most attacking defender.<br><br>It is perhaps true that while offensive players are most remembered for their good games defensive players are remembered for their poor ones. With that in mind, can you recall a below-par display from Gael Clichy? This observer can only recollect unfussy efficiency at the back allied with inquisitive raids down the flank.<br><br>Some would suggest that the best indication of his season is illustrated by the fact that the Â‘Cole holeÂ’ has not been obvious. But then, given the campaign he has just enjoyed, Clichy no longer deserves to be measured against another player. He can now stand-up as a first-choice, first-rate full back in his own right.<br><br><strong>He should have been 3rd. He's been very hardworking,determined! I hope he improves on his crossing. He's a great LB. Good replacement of cashley cunt.</strong></div>
