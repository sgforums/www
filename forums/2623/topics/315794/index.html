              <h1>Arsenal's Flamini set for Milan as Hleb mulls Inter move</h1>
              <p>Mathieu Flamini has dashed Arsenal's faint hopes of keeping him by agreeing to 
                    join Milan, while the Premier League club face a crunch meeting over 
                    Alexander Hleb's future later this week.</p>
              <p>The signs are that Arsene Wenger will be shorn of half his first-choice 
                    midfield - and two of his best performers this season - with Hleb having 
                    been offered a huge four-year contract by Internazionale, Milan's city's 
                    rivals, which he is keen to sign.</p>
              <p>The loss of the pair would be a severe blow to Wenger who has set Flamini a 
                    deadline of the end of this month to decide his future after making what he 
                    described as a "decent" improved offer. The 24-year-old French midfielder's 
                    present contract runs out on 30 June and, despite Arsenal's efforts, he has 
                    been offered far more by Milan and Juventus.</p>
              <p>It had appeared that Juve were the favourites to sign Flamini but they have 
                    been out-bid by Milan who are willing to pay him four million euros a year - 
                    a million more than was an offer from their rivals - which includes a 
                    significant signing-on fee spread over a five-year contract. They have 
                    ear-marked Flamini as the eventual replacement for Gennaro Gattuso - which 
                    is ironic considering the midfielder was nicknamed after the Italian by his 
                    Arsenal team-mates.</p>
              <p>Over the weekend Carlo Ancelotti went public on Milan TV - the club's own 
                    television channel - to speak of his admiration for Flamini, especially 
                    after the way he performed against the European Cup holders in the Champions 
                    League tie earlier this season. Flamini - whose father Roland is Italian and 
                    has relatives in Rome - is free to talk to other clubs because his contract 
                    has almost expired. He has made clear that he wants to accept a more 
                    lucrative offer than has been tabled by Arsenal, especially as Flamini has 
                    felt under-valued at the Emirates for some time. Wenger has urged Flamini 
                    not to leave Arsenal just for a "few bucks" but that kind of comment will 
                    not be well-received by his player.</p>
              <p>Hleb, who is 27 next month, has been offered an impressive four-year deal by 
                    Inter, but will hold talks with Arsenal this week. He is understood to be 
                    concerned that, after so much promise this season, it is now the third 
                    campaign in a row that Arsenal have failed to win a trophy. Much to Wenger's 
                    annoyance, the Italian champions have openly declared their interest in the 
                    Belarussian who joined Arsenal from Stuttgart in July 2005. He has two years 
                    left on his present deal but article 17 of FIFA regulations would allow him 
                    to leave for a fixed fee, likely to be significantly less than the £11.2m 
                    Arsenal paid for him.</p>
              <p>The situation presents Wenger with a major headache. His team face bottom club 
                    Derby County away tonight with Flamini a doubt because he has not fully 
                    recovered from an ankle injury. Wenger may have a league debut to goalkeeper 
                    Lukasz Fabianski who, he said, will vie with Manuel Almunia for the club's 
                    number one slot next season.</p>

              <p>i didn't think he would leave.. if he is leaving just for the money, i would say well eff off then. i wonder what is the real reason for him leaving..</p>
              <p>flamini and hleb were two of our most consistent performing players, i guess having to play with lazy ass ady and eboue was too much to take, i seriously feel for players like fab and flamini, work hard all season, heartbreak at the end due to ady and almunia. well, arsene has to buy some esttablished players now, squad has to few quality backups. hopefully rvp can become the world class striker he shows signs of being soon.</p>
              <p>what is ady doing in the team of the year thing?</p>

              <p>Maybe he feels his ambition is too big for the club . After all , he slogged his guts out for the team the whole season . I prefer to think Adebayor , Diaby , Eboue and sometimes Gallas are crap for letting the more hard-working players' efforts go to waste .</p>

              <p>something bother me... milan is not even in top four position n they might not play for ucl next season, why will flamster be less ambition n go there? n furthermore, milan already got kaka, n few midfielders, plus ronaldino is going there too. going there n play is as though of having no chance in playing.</p>
              <p>55k n 60k is only 5k apart, i hope Arsenal can give Flamini little bit.</p>
