Maybe we can be disappointed because we didn't win."<br><br>Afraid<br><br>He added: "Everybody watched that game in front of their TV and a lot of teams will be afraid of Arsenal.<br><br>"Liverpool were maybe a little bit afraid of us and a lot of top teams will be afraid of us again.<br><br>"We play well, we can score at any time or we can play the physical game as well."<br><br>Difficult<br><br>However, the French defender admits Arsene Wenger's side still have plenty to do before they can win back the Premier League title.<br><br>"For me, it will be very difficult to win the title," he added. "There are three or four teams who can win it.<br><br>"Manchester United will be one of them - but you have another team in Chelsea.
