            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/Images/w/wenger_email.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger believes his Arsenal side have already produced the "complete performance" which sees them on the verge of qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League.<br><br>But he warned Slavia Prague will be out for "revenge" in the Czech Republic on Wednesday night.<br><br>The Gunners maintained a slender advantage at the top of the Premier League by snatching a dramatic late 2-2 draw with Manchester United.<br><br>Their "so-called beautiful football" may have won few plaudits from United midfielder Owen Hargreaves afterwards, but Wenger's emerging squad continue to impress.<br><br>Arsenal's unbeaten run now stands at 25 consecutive matches and stretches back to April last season, a new club record.<br><br>Given the way they set about destroying the Czechs at the Emirates Stadium a fortnight ago, few expect that sequence to come to an end in Prague this week.<br><br>While accepting he had probably witnessed one of the best all-round attacking displays from his team, Wenger knows over-confidence could be the undoing of the Group H leaders, who have a 100% record so far.<br><br>"I felt the 7-0 win against Slavia Prague was a really complete performance at some points," Wenger said.<br><br>"Particularly in the latter stages of the game when the goals came on the floor, and each goal would be bigger, quicker and of a better quality than the last.<br><br>"When we meet Slavia again on Wednesday, they will be full of desire for revenge. We will go into the game with top focus and commitment.<br><br>"We want to qualify for the last 16 in that game, we have a good opportunity and we don't want to neglect that."<br><br>Wenger revealed he could "re-balance" Arsenal's forwards options after again utilising Emmanuel Adebayor in a lone-striker role against United, with Alexander Hleb in support.<br><br>The Togo frontman has six goals this season, but none in the last seven games.<br><br>With Robin van Persie not scheduled to return until the end of the month following a knee injury, Theo Walcott could be handed another start following his impressive brace against Slavia last time out from a central attacking role.<br><br>"We will rotate the squad a bit more going into November and December, we will have had three months of hard competition, often with games every three days," Wenger added.<br><br>The Arsenal boss has plenty of other options with Croatia's Eduardo eager for more action following his double in the Carling Cup win over Sheffield United.<br><br>The 24-year-old said: "I am trying to carve out my space little by little. I may be doing it slowly, but I am doing it all the same.<br><br>"I am getting more and more confident too. If I get five minutes here, then 10 minutes, then full game, then that is the way forward as I get more confidence for the next games.<br><br>"I am adapting at my own pace and I am on track. I am getting my chances and making the most of them. I just need to wait for my opportunities."<br><br>Meanwhile, Arsenal will study CCTV footage and reports from club officials before deciding whether to take further action against a man ejected from the stadium during Saturday's game with United.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson was less than impressed by what he perceived as a hostile reception from home supporters positioned behind the away team, declaring "It is absolutely disgraceful the abuse you and your staff take" and there is "absolute danger here".<br><br>Arsenal maintain they are satisfied with the current overall security arrangements, which also include a metal barrier as well as a row of stewards behind the technical areas.</div>
