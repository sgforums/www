"Chelsea is in a difficult situation.<br><br>"Their situation will depend on the result of Man Utd at Man City. If Man Utd do not lose at Man City, there is little chance of Chelsea winning the title.<br><br>"If Man Utd lose at Man City, there is all still to do for them."<br><br>Wenger feels United and Chelsea are too different to compare, but feels both deserve praise.<br><br>"I think they play two different types of football," added the Frenchman. "Chelsea are efficient and strong, impact players who suck you in slowly.<br><br>"Man Utd are players who are more based on movement and quickness, so it is a different type of game.<br><br>"I feel both teams have done extremely well. Man Utd many times was playing in front of Chelsea and Chelsea came up with the right answer to show the right mentality."<br><br>Looking at the events of the last week, Wenger added: "What has happened to Chelsea can happen to any team.<br><br>"They have had two big blows, they drew with Bolton and lost to Liverpool and it can happen to strong teams."<br><br>Wenger feels slipping out of Europe will be tough to overcome.<br><br>"It is terrible," he added. "We have experienced that and you cannot recover from it.<br><br>"You recover because you want to win the next game, but it takes the feeling of euphoria away from the group and it takes some time to recover.<br><br>"It is a terrible blow to go out of the Champions League.<br><br>"Only two teams can reach the final, but you can look across Europe and see how it has hit Lyon, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, everybody.<br><br>"Everybody suffers terribly and it takes time to recover from that." </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Go Arsenal go</span></div>
