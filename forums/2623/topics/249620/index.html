It's a worrying time.<br><br>"I can totally sympathise with all Arsenal fans because in David Dein, Arsene had a great ally.<br><br>"David was so pro-active in relation to everything to do with the club and I cannot envisage Arsenal going into any new era without David Dein involved. It cannot be good for the club.<br><br>"Whatever differences there may have been with the board if it can end with David Dein leaving the club then it is the wrong move.<br><br>"I know for a fact that with the new stadium, with the young players, with Wenger and what he is doing down there, the feeling has been that there are exciting times ahead.<br><br>"If somebody is coming in and investing X amount of millions this is not the time for David Dein to be leaving." </span></div>
