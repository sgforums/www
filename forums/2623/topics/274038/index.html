            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/pics/report/fulham12082007_8.jpg"><br><br><strong>William Gallas senses a change in Arsenal this season.</strong><br><br>The newly-appointed captain argues that the foundations of SundayÂ’s dramatic comeback against Fulham were laid down on the fields of Austria while the team were at their pre-season training camp. It was there the Frenchman, 30 on Friday, noticed a new strength and solidarity in his side. He believes that was the main reason for ArsÃ¨ne WengerÂ’s side turning defeat into victory in the final seven minutes at Emirates Stadium over the weekend.<br><br>Â“When I came to Arsenal the one thing I wanted to do was win,Â” he said. Â“Last year was not easy because we had too many injuries but this season everything has changed. And I can tell you it changed in pre-season - how the players train, how they fight on the pitch - and when I saw that I said 'we will do something' this season.<br><br>Â“We have shown everybody already we can fight. Maybe something will happen this year, maybe we can win something, I don't know. But the squad is very compact. They want to win and they want to fight.Â”<br><br>The appointment of Gallas as captain has raised a few eyebrows. But Wenger was quick to point out that his most experienced quartet of players Â— Gilberto, Jens Lehmann, Kolo Toure and Gallas Â— all have a role to play this season.<br><br>Â“For me the most important thing is the squad,Â” the former Chelsea player concurred. Â“It is not to be captain.<br><br>Â“I didn't think about it but, trust me, I'm happy. When [the boss] said you will be captain I was very proud and said, 'thank you'.<br><br>Â“I'm 30 years old now and I think I have the experience. I know IÂ’ll have to speak with the young players to give them information and good advice. I won't have to shout because they know what they have to do. I have only to speak with them, that's it. I think it's very good for the squad to speak together.<br><br>Â“I'm very proud to be captain of Arsenal because before me you had players like Patrick Vieira and Tony Adams. Now I just have to try to do the best job I can.Â”</div>
