            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/pics/report/astonvilla19082006_8.jpg"><br><br>There were more questions asked of Gilberto this season than any other in his Arsenal career. The way in which he answered every last one finally brought the praise the tireless Brazilian deserved.<br><br>Shy and reserved off the field, the 30-year-old is the unsung warhorse on it; his contribution to the cause often going unnoticed alongside the flair and effervescence of ArsenalÂ’s attacking players. But with Thierry Henry sidelined for much of the 2006/07 campaign Gilberto captained the side with distinction, contributed a personal best 11 goals, marshalled the midfield and finally won the plaudits he had warranted for years.<br><br>One area in which the Brazil international truly excelled was passing. From his role as the midfield anchor, Gilberto distributed the ball with expert precision, often instigating one of ArsenalÂ’s trademark free-flowing counter-attacks. In the Premiership alone he produced an impressive 302 passes of which 64 per cent found their intended target. Only Cesc Fabregas can boast a better record having contributed a staggering 414 passes.<br><br>Furthermore, he enjoyed his most successful season in front of goal, notching more than heÂ’d managed in his previous four seasons as a Gunner combined. The first of those strikes, a late equaliser, will go down in history as the first ever Premiership goal by an Arsenal player at Emirates Stadium. Another two came on TottenhamÂ’s first visit to our new home, and overall six came in games which Arsenal drew or won by a single-goal margin.<br><br>The midfielderÂ’s 10 Premiership goals came off just 37 shots on goal. In addition to those efforts that beat the keeper another five found the target, one hit the woodwork and seven were blocked en route.<br><br>Defensively his presence was equally valuable. The former Athletic Mineiro man attempted 56 challenges in the league, coming out on top on 32 occasions. Only Fabregas, Toure and Gael Clichy managed more successful challenges. Gilberto also racked up 41 clearances Â— 15 more than any other midfielder - 19 interceptions and five blocks.<br><br>Players of GilbertoÂ’s ilk can easily go unappreciated and never more so than in a title-challenging team. Squad-depleting injuries and a captainÂ’s armband finally put the Brazilian on a platform last season, a platform that brought his true value to the fore.<br><br>With much disruption to what was already a young and inexperienced side ArsÃ¨ne Wenger needed a leader. In Gilberto he found a player who was unfazed by the role and, judging by the statistics, chose to lead by example.</div>
