It is a new experience and I am really enjoying it.<br><br>"Arsenal is such a big club and it is great to be training here every day.<br><br>"There are differences now, because I was also captain at Dynamo, and everybody looked up to me.<br><br>"Here it is different because everybody is a big player.<br><br>"So that is something you have to adapt to."<br><br>Eduardo added: "Goals are always important for a striker, and that first one has lifted a lot of the pressure from me.<br><br>"Hopefully I will be back scoring a lot more for Arsenal very soon."<br><br>Arsenal can retain their position at the top of the Barclays Premier League with victory at West Ham on Saturday.<br><br>The Carling Cup win over Newcastle in midweek - achieved by a young side - was the Gunners' seventh in a row, and came on the back of the club's parent company returning strong financial results.<br><br>Manager Arsene Wenger has urged for a degree of caution, despite the optimistic start to a campaign which had looked so uncertain following Henry's departure to Barcelona.<br><br>Confidence within the squad, though, remains high.<br><br>Eduardo declared: "We can challenge for the title.<br><br>"We have great priority on the league, because being champions has you marked down as the best team.<br><br>"It is also important to do well in Europe, but the league is where it is at for me."<br><br></div>
