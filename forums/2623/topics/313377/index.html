              <p>Wenger not willing to sign expensive defender and striker, instead buy alot of midfielders and convert them into winger and striker. Those recent game expose the team weakness and the strength in depth. Striker and central defence role is lacking in standard compare to Manu and Chelsea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Luck is not on their side, and Wenger must have a backup plan as season run into the final stage. Players will need to concentrate to win game rather than playing team football without thinking of how to put the ball in the net. Wenger is lacking of winning mentality and formula, he is counting on his players and sometime luck. If u look at big team financial backup is still a major factor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Big name is not there for nothing, it make a difference. Wenger need to sign some big star and keep players who r over 30yr old. He need player like Pires to win games for him, they r the players who can turn the game round like the recent pool game. Some of the young player r proven to be incapable in big game, even if they can go all the way to the final this year I doubt they can win it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This group of young players need to lose a few big games to gain some experiance.</p>

              <p>Strikers you guys do not lack, its just that your are unlucky in the sense that you have Eduardo out for a long period and a 1/2 season player like Van Persie.</p>
              <p>Midfield and Defence depth is what you guys really lack, i don't even want to imagine Arsenal without Fabregas, probably your most important player, and your backup defenders are not dependable enough especially the fullbacks.</p>

              <p>Arsenal need to get a few more over 25 to 27 yrs old experience players... The thing i have always mentioned was this Arsenal team is good but it lack experience in the title run-in... Wenger shouldn't have got rid of Henry, Ljungberg and Pires... These are the type of players that can stable the team when the youngsters gets nervous... Diarra also shouldn't have been sold... He should have been given games on and off in the beginning of the season then he wouldn't have left cos he is much better than what they have there at the moment... Gilberto too should have been given more games than he wouldn't have lost his confidence now...</p>
              <p>I think Wenger made lots of mistakes throughout the season... Playing Flamini and Febregas in the middle for the whole season created problems for the team... Other players don't get to play and became either unhappy or lost-form... And those when called upon to play as cover, don't know how to react with the team... Flamini and Febregas became tired and start to show signs of the pressure getting to them...</p>
              <p>I have said all along that this team of youngsters can't take the pressure of the title chase... And its clearly showing for all to see... Febregas was great in the first 4, 5 months of the season... But today he looks like an ordinary player... Even Diarra seems to be doing better than him at Portsmouth. Now its left to Flamini to be the playmaker... and he don't even want to commit his future to the club yet despite the offer on the table...</p>
              <p>If you look at Chelsea and Man utd, they have a set of midfielders and changed them around regularly... Chelsea got... Lampard, Ballack, Makelele, Essien and Mikel for the centre 2 spots... The first 4 are very experienced... They can even afford one Sidwell sitting around... And United have Hargreaves, Carrick, Scholes, Anderson... and Fletcher &amp; O'shea as back-ups... But Arsenal only have Flamini and Febregas playing too often and a World Cup winner in Gilberto who hardly plays...</p>
              <p>To be honest, what Jose Mourinho said about Wenger is quite true... He has no pressure to deliver titles... Whatever he does, even no titles for 3 or 4 yrs... He still gets to keep his job. The directors are only interested on their own profits... The club winning or not isn't as important to them...</p>
              <p>Btw, i have seen Roman watching at Chelsea matches, The Glazer brothers at OT, even Pool's 2 American owners at Anfield afew times But i hardly see Gunners directors at their matches... Only their previous Dein... What about the others?</p>

              <p>No, his pride has to go. That french pride of his is making him oblivious to the obvious. If he still can't see the need to buy good and experienced players, even his own star like Fabregas will get frustrated by playing with sub standard players.</p>
