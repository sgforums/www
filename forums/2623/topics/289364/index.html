            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.sportinglife.com/pictures/general/allsportbryanrobson03.jpg"><br><br>Bryan Robson watched ArsenalÂ’s young guns take apart his Sheffield United side on Wednesday, but believes they will stand no chance in the Premier League shoot-out with his old club Manchester United.<br><br>However, he is confident that come May the battle for honours will be a duel, with Chelsea having to settle for third place Â– their worst finish for three years. The 3-0 win at Bramall Lane, with two goals from Eduardo da Silva, showed Arsenal have plenty of reserves of strength. But it is the mental reserves at Old Trafford which Robson believes will enable Sir Alex FergusonÂ’s side to retain their crown.<br><br>In an echo of Alan HansenÂ’s famous claim that Â“you never win anything with kidsÂ”, Robson said: Â“I am not just being biased, but looking at it constructively: Manchester United will win the title. Even with the way Arsenal are playing at the moment, United have that little bit more experience. They have a bit more toughness in their defending compared to Arsenal.<br><br>Â“When the pressure comes on and it gets edgy at the end of the season, it comes down to temperament and bottle. If the two teams are still close to each other United might just have the edge because of their experience.<br><br>Â“Even at the moment, even without Gary Neville and the fact that Nemanja Vidic has been out, they have been churning the results out. The thing that has impressed me is the 1-0 wins they have had when they have not been playing fluent football.<br><br>Â“Now all of a sudden they have hit the fluent football and Neville is nearly back and they are enjoying the influence of Owen Hargreaves in midfield. They have strengthened a lot more since last year.<br><br>Â“Because of their confidence and the way they have started the season, I see Arsenal pushing them all the way. But it will be Arsenal pushing United this year, not a battle between United and Chelsea.Â”<br><br>Arsenal and United meet at the Emirates Stadium this weekend and Robson knows from the crunch games he was involved in that there will be no quarter given, even though the season is less than a third of the way through.<br><br>Â“Because of the way the two teams have started the season, this is the game everybody wants to see,Â” he said. Â“The players at the two clubs and the two managers will be looking to stamp their authority on this league this year.<br><br>Â“If one wins, it is a big statement even though it is early on in the season. But even if Arsenal win, I see United coming back past them in the long term.Â”<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> Stupid c*nt bag. he's being biased for fork's sake.its so obvious he favours manure </span></div>

The Premier League's top two go head-to-head at the Emirates Stadium tomorrow with the country eager to see how the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Emmanuel Eboue and Emmanuel Adebayor measure up to Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani. While Rooney, and particularly Ronaldo, were the stand-out stars last term, Fabregas is the one excelling this season. The 20-year-old Barcelona graduate has already reached double figures in goals for the campaign and appears to be improving by the week as Arsenal continue their impressive start. But, as Ferguson has always reinforced when asked to assess his own talented youngsters' contribution, youth can bring mistakes. </strong><br><br>It is only with maturity that authority and consistency can be relied upon. And, for the Scot, it is only at the end of an individual's career rather than the start, that their true talent can be assessed. 'Time will tell over Fabregas because he is young,' observed Ferguson. 'It is the same with my players. You have Ronaldo, Rooney, Nani, Anderson and Carlos Tevez who all have their future in front of them. 'In two or three years' time I want to be saying, 'They are the best in the world'. At this moment in time they are showing those signs. 'But it is very important to look back at what they have won. Can they win a European Championship? Are they playing in World Cup finals? These are the periods you have to add up. 'It is what Johan Cruyff, Pele and Maradona had to endure in terms of how highly they were rated.<br><br>'That is the challenge for all these young players and they must always be judged in that way.' Although he found another player of potential at Barcelona in Spain Under-21 international Gerard Pique, Ferguson is honest enough to admit Fabregas had escaped his own radar.<br><br>However, having lured Ronaldo to Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon as a teenager and now done the same with Nani and Anderson, Ferguson is clearly not averse to placing his faith in youth. As with most things though, the Scot feels time must be spent assessing each player's character. 'Judgements are made over a period,' he said. 'There can be no knee-jerk reactions or quick decisions. When you are spending money on a teenager you have to be sure of certain things.<br><br>'Do they have the temperament to handle that fee? Is there more development in the player because some do peak very early?' Ferguson confirmed United were monitoring Nani's progress even when Ronaldo was being signed in 2003 while, with Anderson, who impressed for FC Porto in a pre-season encounter in Amsterdam mainly memorable for the double dismissals of Rooney and Paul Scholes, a risk had to be taken on the 19-year-old's recovery from a broken leg.<br><br>'We did a lot of work on Nani and Ronaldo helped with background information,' revealed Ferguson. 'In the case of Anderson, there was a risk factor because we saw him in pre-season and then he broke his leg. 'There was a decision to be made about whether we should wait for the boy to come back when the whole world could be after him or the fee could be higher, or to do it immediately. We felt the risk was worth it.'</span><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>well, guess we will prove f*cktardson dat we will win countless trophies to shut his mouth off! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
