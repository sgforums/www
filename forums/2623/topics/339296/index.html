              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal striker Robin van Persie does not believe William Gallas was referring to him in his recent criticism of the side. </strong></p>
              <p>Gallas' outburst last month saw him relieved of his
              duty as Gunners captain, while he singled out a player 'six years
              younger' than him.</p>
              <p>It was suggested that 25-year-old Van Persie
              was the team-mate in question but the Dutchman insists there is no
              problem between the duo.</p>
              <p>"Are you suggesting that William was talking about me?" Van Persie said.</p>
              <p>"I
              don't know that, because he never told me anything and I didn't see my
              name in the papers, so I never felt that he was speaking about me. For
              me, there isn't a problem."</p>
              <h4>Adebayor</h4>
              <p>Meanwhile, striker Emmanuel Adebayor has admitted the team must address their inconsistency against the so-called smaller sides.</p>
              <p>The
              Gunners have endured a mixed season, with wins over Manchester United
              and Chelsea, but losses against the likes of Stoke City and Hull City.</p>
              <p>Adebayor said in <em>The Times</em>:
              "Sometimes maybe you have a little bit more concentration against a big
              team, that's one of the things that we're going to work on very hard.</p>
              <h5>Consistency</h5>
              <p>"Those
              are the things we're going to discuss a little bit in the dressing-room
              in the days ahead and see what we can do now against the lower teams.</p>
              <p>"One
              or two days were not very good, but everyone can see that we keep the
              title dreams alive and the most important thing is to keep going.</p>
              <p>"I
              think even if we had lost (to Chelsea), we would never say the title
              race is finished for us. We want to keep going to the end of the
              season. We know we have a good team, a good squad and everyone is ready
              for it."</p>
