            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Geylang United have confirmed the capture of Five Stars Tours Pte Ltd as their main sponsor for the 2007 S.League season.<br><br>The one-year deal with one of SingaporeÂ’s largest tour and travel operators and agencies is worth $300,000.<br><br>Five Stars Tours Â– which also incorporates Gunung Raya Travel - not only provides express coach services to the main cities of Peninsula Malaysia and the southern part of Thailand, but also conducts air package tours to other regional areas in Malaysia, Thailand, Hongkong and Indonesia.<br><br>At the media conference on Tuesday afternoon, sixteen players from GeylangÂ’s S.League squad were present to witnessed the signing of the deal.<br><br>Eagles chairman Patrick Ang said: "We are very pleased to have Five Stars Tours on board with us this season."<br><br>(Five Stars Tours Managing Director) Ken Lim has always been a supporter of the club, even if his busy schedule means he is not always at our matches. He has been supporting our pre-season playing trips to Malaysia for the past few years."<br><br>Patrick also revealed that it took a bit of arm-twisting on his part to convince his good friend of eight years Ken to come on board as the clubÂ’s main sponsor, as the latter had initially wanted to keep any media coverage of the deal low-key.<br><br>"He was going to support us this season anyway, but he didnÂ’t want it to be a big deal. So I told him we wanted to make him the main sponsor as thanks for all his support over the past years," said Patrick.<br><br>"In fact he wasn't even keen on coming down for the press conference today but I told him he had to come!<br><br>"A major component of the deal will be in cash, but there will also be incentives in kind so the fans can look forward to winning tickets and tours sponsored by Five Stars in several lucky draws that weÂ’ll conduct throughout the season."<br><br>Meanwhile, former Bedok resident Ken, 48, revealed that he is only too happy to contribute to his local S.League side.<br><br>"I donÂ’t normally watch a lot of football because I am too busy with work but I have to say that it is truly an honour to be associated with a club like Geylang."<br><br>Both Five Stars Tours and Gunung Raya Travel operate a total of eleven branches island-wide.</span></div>
