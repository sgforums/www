            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Thierry Henry has cast fresh doubt on his Arsenal future after admitting he was "devastated" by vice-chairman David Dein's departure.</strong><br><br>The 29-year-old France star also admits he is flattered by reports of interest from Champions League winners AC Milan.<br><br>He said: "I was devastated when Mr Dein left the club. I don't know what happened and I don't want to know."<br><br>And on possible moves from Milan, Henry added: "That is great to hear. How can it be anything else?"<br><br>Henry added: "As I have said many times, at the moment I am an Arsenal player. But everyone knows that a lot of stuff has happened at the club recently that wasn't supposed to happen.<br><br>"So the only thing I can tell you is right now I am an Arsenal player but I cannot deny it's nice to hear about Milan."<br><br>Henry, whose personal advisor is Dein's son Darren, came out in strong support for the former vice-chairman, who left after "irreconcilable differences" with the Arsenal board.<br><br>Dein was also manager Arsene Wenger's closest confidante, and Henry told ESPN: "The bosses have been unsettled and a lot of players at the club have been unsettled.<br><br>"Although no one is bigger than the club, Arsene Wenger and Mr Dein are really close to being Arsenal.<br><br>"So if you ask me if there was one person on the board I would not like to see leaving, I would have said Mr Dein.<br><br>"Unfortunately it is out of my hands. I don't agree with what has happened but sometimes that's the way things are. We just have to move on."<br></div>
