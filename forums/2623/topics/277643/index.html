He's got talented young players here. They bring these kids in from everywhere.<br><br>"I don't think he needs to spend massive money. Van Persie and Adebayor are two fantastic players. They are a threat to anybody.<br><br>"Then there are also people like Fabregas. Their side is full of quality.<br><br>"When they move the ball and pass it, there is no-one better than Arsenal.<br><br>"They will be right there in the title race. They will be pushing all the way.<br><br>"The two wide players Rosicky and Alexander Hleb are fantastic and their quality on the ball is incredible."<br><br>Wenger revealed Arsenal's third league victory of the season, which lifts them to second in the table, was a joy to watch.<br><br>"We are super ambitious and of course that creates a pressure but we can live with that," he said.<br><br>"This team has been built to have an offensive personality. That means it is very important they express themselves.<br><br>"When you watch a game, you see that. We always try to go forward, even with 10 men and two minutes to go.<br><br>"I personally enjoy watching my team play like that. You don't cheat people.<br><br>"They feel the vibes coming out of the team when they sit in the stands.<br><br>"They sense when there is something positive coming out of the team."</div>
