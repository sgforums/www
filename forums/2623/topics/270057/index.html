All the players from the undefeated team have left. Now me. I stayed as I wanted to be loyal, but I felt it was the right time to go.<br><br>"I'm not getting involved in the business of how Arsenal want to handle their affairs but I felt that we had let a lot of players go.<br><br>"Then when Henry left as well, I thought maybe it was time for me to do some thing different, something challenging.<br><br>"I have always stayed loyal, even when some big clubs have tried to buy me. Of course it was hard to leave. I had been at Arsenal for nine, almost 10 years.<br><br>"When I started playing football, I stayed at one club until I went to Arsenal. So West Ham is my first club other than that and, of course, it is a big thing for me.<br><br>"But at the same time I am happy. I want to go forward and with the people I have around me now I think it will be really good.<br><br>"I had great years at Arsenal and won almost everything. Not the Champions League unfortunately. We were so close, but I look back with great memories."<br><br>The Sweden skipper joined Arsenal for Â£3m from Halmstads in 1998 and scored 72 goals in 325 games but injury restricted him to 26 games last term.<br><br>Now he reckons Eggert Magnusson's Upton Park millions could threaten Arsenal's status.<br><br>He said: "We have a chairman here who is willing to make this club very big.<br><br>"It's already big - but I am talking about being at the top of the table."</div>
