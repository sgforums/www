Today we can notice he has no more gaps in his play.<br><br>"He is awesome in the quality of his passes, in his long passes, in his technical level. He can get out of any situation.<br><br>"I would say now he looks experienced. He really achieved a great last match."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Only thing is he needs to improve on his crossing and he must be brave to shoot from distance</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 thing that compliment clichy will be his tremendous pace and agility.<br><br>when u get that awesome speed, u can outrun ur opponents but ur opponents finds it hard to outrun u, giving u time to play with the ball.<br><br>I believe he must try to attempt to take shots from outside the box like what pires did. His ball distribution into the six yard box must also be improved.<br><br>Judging from his age and his current performance, hes amazing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
