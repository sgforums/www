            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Arsenal legend Tony Adams believes Arsene Wenger will still be at the club for at least another season despite vice-chairman David Dein's departure.</strong><br><br>However, he believes the Frenchman will 'undoubtedly be poorer' without Dein.<br><br>Dein had a strong relationship with Wenger, and his exit has led to rumours that the manager - as well as a number of key players - could quit the club.<br><br>Wenger's current deal expires at the end of next season and negotiations are yet to begin on a new deal, but the Frenchman has vowed to honour the final year of his contract and Adams expects him to fulfil his promise.<br><br>"I expect him to be manager next season," he told The Sun. "And I expect the directors will offer him whatever it takes to stay on - maybe a seat on the board."<br><br>Dein was an important figure at the club, though, and Adams feels his influence will be sorely missed, even if his departure will not prove catastrophic.<br><br>"He took a load off manager Arsene Wenger, but Arsene is his own man. He always has been. He makes his own decisions.<br><br>"My experience of Arsene is that he keeps so much in. He oversees the coaching, the contracts - he likes doing it all. He can do it all and he does.<br><br>"He has a staff around him who are all very able, but he is protective and does it himself.<br><br>"Arsene will undoubtedly be poorer for David's going, but the club won't collapse."<br><br>Meanwhile, Adams feels Arsenal failed to win any silverware this year because the club have failed to retain enough experience.<br><br>"I think they have missed Dennis Bergkamp this year. All the experienced players retired and moved on at the same time - Martin Keown, Sol Campbell, Patrick Vieira.<br><br>"I would have liked a bit more of an evolution.<br><br>"All the young players at Arsenal have fantastic gifts, but no-one to turn around and say, 'This is what we do here'. I was taught by Kenny Sansom and people before me."</span></div>
