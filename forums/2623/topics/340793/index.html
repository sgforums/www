              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Former Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira believes Denilson has what it takes to become one of the best players at the club if he is given time.</span></p>
              <p><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Denilson, a £3.4million signing from Brazilian side Sao Paulo, started to establish himself as a first-team regular for the Gunners last year before having his season cut short by a hamstring injury.</p>
              <p>The departure of Mathieu Flamini to AC Milan this summer has enabled the Brazilian has become an ever-present alongside Cesc Fabregas in the Gunners midfield and he has scored twice in his 24 appearances so far this term.</p>
              <p>Vieira spent nine seasons playing at the heart of the Arsenal midfield and captained the Gunners to Premier League glory in the 2003-04 season, when they went the whole campaign unbeaten.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman, who now plays under Jose Mourinho at Italian club Inter Milan, believes the young Brazilian can fill Flamini's boots and go on to become one of the club's best.</p>
              <p>"He's a wonderful player. It's not going to be easy for him because Flamini was a good player," Vieira said.</p>
              <p>"We need to give him more time to develop as a player but he can be one of the best players at the club. The more he plays the better he will be.</p>
              <p>"He is young and has so many qualities and he's only in his first years of playing in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"He and Fabregas can play together, all the good players can play together."</p>
              <p>Arsenal have started the season poorly and are currently eight points off the top of the league in fifth position.</p>
              <p>Vieira believes they must start picking up points quickly if they are to challenge for the title starting with their match with Liverpool at the Emirates on Sunday.</p>
              <p>"It's a must win game for Arsenal," said Vieira. "They are eight points behind and they must win this game if they are to continue fighting for the title."</p>
              <p>Vieira recalls his time at Arsenal fondly and believes Wenger has been successful because he has encouraged his players to enjoy playing together.</p>
              <p>"I think the main strength of Arsenal over the last few years has been having the pleasure to play together and having the pleasure to train among ourselves," he added.</p>
