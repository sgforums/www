"It's that simple. Middlesbrough were sharper in the fight.<br><br>"We missed the start of the game by giving them too much room and it cost us a penalty.<br><br>"From then on, it was down to us being a little bit jaded physically.<br><br>"It was our fourth away trip on the trot.<br><br>"We gave absolutely everything to come back. We lacked creativity, sharpness in our passing, so therefore we were not dangerous enough to come back into the game.<br><br><strong>Sharp</strong><br><br>"They defended well, Credit to them, they were sharper than us and you could see, once we were 1-0 down, if we did not come back before half-time, it would be difficult.''<br><br>However, Wenger does admit his side may be missing their talismanic midfielder Cesc Fabregas - who was forced to sit out the game because of injury.<br><br>"At the moment we miss many in the same area. Maybe it handicaps a bit our creative potential," Wenger concluded.</div>
