            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Match report : Middlesbrough 2 - 1 Arsenal </strong><br><br><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/dotcomreport.jpg"><br><br>The winter months are already starting to bite and their teeth-marks are visible in ArsenalÂ’s squad.<br><br>ArsÃ¨ne Wenger takes his side to Middlesbrough on Sunday lacking, once again, four international midfielders and striker Robin van Persie. It will be their third away game in the space of eight days and the manager knows he must shuffle his side. Middlesbrough are in the bottom three and form would suggest an away win. But ArsenalÂ’s on-going success this season has created on-going pressure - anything less than three points will be considered a Â‘slip-upÂ’ in the developing title race.<br><br>The manager joked last week that he was losing a player per game. Thankfully that did not happen in the 1-1 draw at Newcastle on Wednesday. But Cesc Fabregas (hamstring), Abou Diaby (back), Mathieu Flamini (thigh) and Alex Hleb (Achilles) are not back and are unlikely to return for the Champions League tie with Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday. That means rotation is neccessary for the return to the North-East.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ll change a little bit,Â” said Wenger at his pre-match press conference. Â“I think IÂ’ll look at one or two to see who is the most physically fatigued and how many games players have played on the trot. I can only make a decision after that.<br><br>Â“Despite that we are confident. Players like Gilberto have a good opportunity to show that they still have an important part in the squad, and we still have Denilson, who did not play the other night.<br><br>Â“Also players like Bendtner and Walcott have come on in recent games and are knocking at the door."<br><br>As for the injured, he said: Â“Van Persie could come back next week into full training, and then I will have to assess him. Diaby will certainly come back into full training next week, but Fabregas certainly not, Hleb no and so there are still a lot of players out.Â”<br><br>Van Persie has not played for Arsenal since October 7 and his absence has meant players previously labelled as midfielders Â— Hleb, Rosicky and Walcott Â— joining the attack at times. But despite that and the fact Bendtner and Eduardo are still finding their feet in the English top-flight, Wenger will not boost his forward line in January.<br><br>"I'm not in the market to buy a striker,Â” he said. Â“I feel Walcott, Bendtner, Eduardo, Van Persie and Adebayor, we will have enough."<br><br>It is pertinent to assess squad strength ahead of this game. Middlesbrough are without a win in 10 Premier League matches and their record in the last 11 games in competition reads: P11 W0 D4 L7.<br><br>Truly they are bang out of form but the flipside of that is, arguably, they will expect little. For their part, Arsenal have injury problems and could be tired from too much time on the road. Scratch away at the surface of this game and you can find a test not far removed from those at Villa and Newcastle. Even Wenger admits MiddlesbroughÂ’s position is worse than their performance.<br><br>Â“Like many of the teams down the bottom of the table they have potential,Â” he said. But they have not responded yet. Still their results have been worse than their displays. They have looked like they have dominated the games but have not been able to take advantage of that. Then they were punished afterwards.Â”<br><br>ArsenalÂ’s punishment has been their schedule. But this is the last of four straight away games. Three of the quartet that follow are at Emirates Stadium. A win on Sunday will ensure a sweet return home.</div>

AW is a genius but sometimes a stubborn old man. this is really dissapointing.</div></blockquote>Yeah i am very happy indeed and honestly, i don't think United can get all 3 points at Anfield. If they can get even 1 point over there i think all united fans should be happy with it.<br><br>About the match today, I always belief the gunners youngsters will get nervous once they start to drop points... They have a good team, but too many youngsters and lack of enough experience head when things isn't going their way.<br><br>I can see very well why Wenger is trying very hard saying all sorts of things to take away the pressure from these youngsters. But its still not enough i guess. Dropping 5 pts in 4 days is really bad and it can get even worse if they don't get all the points next week. Chelsea under Grant is playing really well at the moment i must say. History seem to be repeating itself at Arsenal... 1 point out of a possible 9? Not impossible.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we got four points out of nine actually friend. yeah im very glad to see u admit that man ure wont really beat pool at anfield.<br><br>But if ronaldo is really upbeat for tat match.. i have ntg to say then. pool will cry.<br><br>whatever it is..today's match was based on the players AW picked. he saw gilberto's display at st james's park..why the hell still giving him a chance? his heart is somewhere else already. he and flamini really swap abilities. gilberto is liek Henry last season alr. his heart is nowhere near arsenal fc. I ahve to admit we really need hleb and fabregas..and the tireless flamster back.</div>
