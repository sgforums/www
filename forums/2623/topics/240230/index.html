            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal defender Emmanuel Eboue has been found guilty of violent conduct during Sunday's Carling Cup final and banned for their next three matches.<br><br>Eboue, 23, was found to have hit Chelsea's Wayne Bridge in a fracas at the end of the Gunners' 2-1 defeat.<br><br>Referee Howard Webb missed the incident involving Eboue and Bridge, but the FA used video and documentary evidence to charge and sanction the Ivorian.<br><br>He joins Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor in serving a three-match ban.<br><br>They and Chelsea midfielder Mikel John Obi were all shown red cards during the game.<br><br>On Tuesday, the FA rejected the appeals of Adebayor and Mikel for wrongful dismissal.<br><br>Togo striker Adebayor has also been charged with improper conduct for reacting aggressively to his sending off and failing to leave the field of play.<br><br>He has denied that charge on Wednesday and will have his case heard by a disciplinary commission on Tuesday.<br><br>Both Arsenal and Chelsea have already been charged with misconduct by the FA.<br><br>The clubs have until 14 March to respond, but rival bosses Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho have not been charged, despite coming on to the pitch during the brawl.<br><br>The full FA charge alleges that Chelsea and Arsenal failed to ensure that their "players and/or officials conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from provocative and/or violent behaviour."<br><br>Ivory Coast international Toure said: "I apologise for this moment, and I regret my actions.<br><br>"Chelsea were winning and were starting to waste time, and I was not happy with that, which is why I went to Mikel and had some words with him.<br><br>"Then Lampard came in and maybe made the thing bigger than it was, but that is part of football."<br><br>Gunners striker Adebayor said: "My reaction after the card did not mean I wanted to hit the referee - I just wanted to know why he gave me the red card.<br><br>"I do not think I did anything wrong."<br><br>Mourinho said the incidents were disappointing but understandable.<br><br>"Sometimes mature people lose control of their emotions," he said.<br><br>"You cannot kill a player because something happened. If Mikel did something wrong, it is not my job to kill him, it is my job to educate him."<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Seems like the FA is biased against Arsenal at all costs. Adebayor did nothing wrong throughout the time he was on the field. Either that or the referee's association wants to save their face after making the error of sending off the wrong man.<br><br>Sekali both organisations are in MUFC and CFC pockets. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lampard supports Adebayor denial</strong><br><br>Frank Lampard has confirmed that Emmanuel Adebayor did not punch him during the melee that marred Sunday's Carling Cup final in Cardiff.<br>The player's agent, Steve Kutner, told BBC Sport: "I've spoken to Frank and he told me that he wasn't punched."<br><br>Adebayor was sent off and then charged with reacting aggressively and failing to leave the field of play by the FA.<br><br>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger had urged Lampard to "tell the truth" about the incident to help Adebayor's case.<br><br>Wenger claimed that a linesman had told the FA's compliance unit that Adebayor had punched Lampard during the brawl that resulted in red cards for the Arsenal striker as well as Kolo Toure, his team-mate, and John Obi Mikel, the Chelsea midfielder.<br><br>He said: "I don't agree at all with the match report, with what the linesman said. This is a lie - a complete lie.<br><br>"He comes out now and says Adebayor punched Lampard. I'd like Lampard to come out and say Adebayor punched him."<br><br>The Frenchman was angry that he had been unable to select the Togo striker for the FA Cup replay against Blackburn at Ewood Park on Wednesday, which the Gunners lost 1-0.<br><br>Adebayor failed with his subsequent appeal for wrongful dismissal and has since been further charged with reacting aggressively and failing to leave the field of play immediately after being dismissed.<br><br>The player has requested a personal hearing, to take place next Tuesday, and Wenger has unequivocally backed his striker, claiming he was the victim of mistaken identity.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Frank Lampard must be telling the truth. I see no better reason for Lamps to speak up on behalf of a rival player.</span><br><br></div>
