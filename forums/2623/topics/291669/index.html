            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cesc Fabregas has insisted there is no chance of him leaving Emirates Stadium to return to Spain.</strong><br><br>The midfielder has been strongly linked with both Real Madrid and Barcelona in the past but he maintains that he is proud to be an Arsenal player.<br><br>He enjoys being part of a close-knit squad and is only interested in fulfilling his potential, rather than any financial rewards.<br><br>He said: "I'm not even thinking about returning to Spain. I don't even listen to the offers that come in for me because I don't need anything that I haven't already got at Arsenal.<br><br>"And it's nothing to do with money. If it was I would have gone to Real Madrid last summer.<br><br>"I am not moved by money, I am moved by football.<br><br>"I am playing and I am happy. Being a Gunner is very special, something that I am proud of. This is a small club on the inside, like a family, but it's huge on the outside."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Less hasty</span></strong><br><br>Fabregas has been in sparkling form this season but he feels the only major difference is more composure in his finishing.<br><br>"I think I'm playing the same as ever but the ball is going in for me which makes it look like I am playing better," he explained.<br><br>"I was getting in front of goal and being hasty but one day Wenger told me to relax and now I take my time - you could see that with the goal against Manchester United."<br><br>Fabregas admits the entire team has been forced to step up following the departure of Thierry Henry.<br><br>He commented: "Henry is the best player in Arsenal's history and that's why people panicked when he left. It was like having to mature all of a sudden, a wake-up call.<br><br>"He was like an umbrella that we hid beneath and when he went we were forced to step forward and take responsibility."</div>
