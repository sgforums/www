              <h1>I TACKLED ARSENE ON MY FUTURE</h1>
              <p><strong>THREE weeks into his twentieth year
              and Theo Walcott is staging a valiant but losing battle to grow a
              decent covering of stubble.</strong></p>
              <p>But
              he knows the moment he became a man ... when he took a deep breath,
              marched towards Arsene Wenger and asked him for a quiet word.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes, it's been frustrating," admitted Walcott.</p>
              <p>"There are times when I haven't deserved to play because I wasn't
              playing well enough but there have been times when I have been playing
              well and not been involved and that struck me a bit.</p>
              <p>"So I actually went up to him for the first time and asked him what I had to do to start.</p>
              <p>"I initiated the conversation and walked over to him on the training
              ground. It was a difficult thing to do. I was nervous. But I'm glad I
              did it.</p>
              <p>"And he was fine. In fact, I think he thought it was really big of
              me to go to a top manager when I was 18 and ask what I had to do to
              improve."</p>
              <p>Not quite a showdown, certainly not a practice-pitch bust-up, but a
              definite watershed in Walcott's short but chequered Arsenal career.</p>
              <p>Since that heart-to-heart earlier in the season, Walcott has not exactly established himself as an automatic pick.</p>
              <p>But he has become what Americans would call a 'go-to' player. The
              man the coach relies on to step in and make a difference, to lift a
              performance, to send a current of expectation through the crowd, to
              inject a burst of speed into a one-paced performance.</p>
              <p>But now, that is not enough for Walcott. He said: "Not many 19-year-old players are doing what I'm doing.</p>
              <p>"And it's an honour even to sit on the Arsenal substitutes bench.
              And when I come on, I like to think it lifts the team and lifts the
              supporters.</p>
              <p>"But now I want to push on. I want to be starting and starting regularly."</p>
              <p>But Wenger - for the first time in his life - seems to be playing the long-ball game.</p>
              <p>"He has been bringing me on slowly," said Walcott. "But now I want to be pushing on to the next level."</p>
              <p>And that next level will mean a move to the central striking role vacated by none other than a certain Thierry Henry.</p>
              <p>Whie Emmanuel Adebayor has given Arsenal an added, muscular,
              goalscoring dimension, they have missed the direct speed and electric
              running of Henry.</p>
              <p>But Walcott revealed that Wenger has plans for him to fill those golden boots.</p>
              <p>He said: "When I had the chat to him, he wanted me to be more
              aggressive in my style. Not going around kicking people but aggressive
              in an attacking sense. I think I have done that.</p>
              <p>"I think I will be playing as a striker next season and the boss seems to think that as well.</p>
              <p>"I will play anywhere for the team but as a striker seems to be the future.</p>
              <p>"I would never compare myself to Thierry because he is just an
              unbelievable player - in fact, when I first signed for Arsenal, one of
              the first things I did was to have my picture taken with Thierry.</p>
              <h3>Expensive</h3>
              <p>"But I was star-struck then. Not any more. I feel comfortable now. I
              feel established as a Premier League player and I want to push ahead.</p>
              <p>"The boss is taking a similar route with me as he took with Thierry
              - playing me out wide, protecting me a bit and then going upfront later
              in my career.</p>
              <p>"The boss has told me that is the way he sees it. And I am working
              on a lot of things. I am trying to dictate when I want the ball, always
              trying to be on the front foot. And I am doing extra finishing practice
              after training, working on things like my left foot."</p>
              <p>When Walcott signed for Arsenal from Southampton as the most
              expensive 16-year-old in the history of British football, expectations
              were high.</p>
              <p>When Sven Goran Eriksson took him to World Cup 2006 - before Wenger
              had even selected him for a Premier League game - those expectations
              went into orbit.</p>
              <p>And, according to Walcott, those people who perceive a non-fulfilment are being harsh.</p>
              <p>He explained: "Everyone seems to forget that I didn't play for the first seven months I was here.</p>
              <p>"And even though I didn't play in the World Cup, everyone was expecting big things of me straight away.</p>
              <p>"And then towards the end of last season, I had the shoulder
              problem. When everyone realised it, they just kept battering me on the
              shoulder, knowing it could pop out at any time. It was a nightmare and
              I was in a lot of pain.</p>
              <p>"We knew we had to get something done so we did and it's all sorted now.</p>
              <h3>Parent</h3>
              <p>"So it has been an eventful two years but I think I am so much a better player and a better person."</p>
              <p>During that period, he has had the unstinting support of his family
              with mum and dad, Lynn and Don, moving into his five-bedroomed house in
              North London.</p>
              <p>And repaying his father is one of the driving forces behind his bid to make his name with club and country.</p>
              <p>He recalled: "My dad lost his job for me. When I played for
              Southampton, Harry Redknapp told me before the Leeds game I was going
              to start so I rang my dad.</p>
              <p>"He asked for a day off and his boss wouldn't allow him to have a
              day off. His boss actually said it's either your son or his job.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't a choice and that sort of thing gives me an extra incentive to do well for my father and the whole family."</p>
              <p>Indeed, even though Walcott never tasted a second of action in Germany two summers ago, no parent was prouder than Don.</p>
              <p>And Theo - an unused substitute in the recent friendly in the Stade
              de France - believes the appointment of Fabio Capello can open the
              international door a fraction wider.</p>
              <p>He said: "I was disappointed not to get a run against France but it
              was still a great experience. And he is going to pick you if you are
              playing well.</p>
              <p>"He is picking on form rather than on names, which is good.</p>
              <p>"In the past, some players have been playing really well but because their name was not that big, they might not have got in."</p>
              <p>Arsenal's entire season could, of course, be reduced to rubble in
              the next two games - defeat at Anfield on Thursday and at Old Trafford
              next Sunday would officially end this season's competitive interest.</p>
              <p>But Walcott insists that a trophy-less campaign would not be a disaster.</p>
              <p>He said: "Yes, it would be disappointing. But this is a young,
              developing team and we will improve and be better for the experience.</p>
              <p>"And we still play unbelievable football. The best I've ever seen.
              And to be part of that is a privilege." Only now, Walcott wants that
              part to be bigger. And as they say at The Emirates, Arsene Knows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Damn I feel for theo. Why the fucking hell AW likes to play that Ebuseless.</em></p>
