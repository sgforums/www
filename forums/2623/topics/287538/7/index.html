            <div class='col-md body'>Man! what a great game to watch regardless of who you support. Everyone must have hated that part where we saw Ferguson's face!<br><br>We should have really won it, quite a few chances wasted. The lads really worked their heart out to equalize and Fabregas did it! I'm proud of him and the other Arsenal players.<br><br>I feel that Theo Walcott should have started as his pace could have made the difference, or rather Bendtner should have came on earlier abit. Adebayor was quite quiet in this game and i feel that he didnt do much except that shot on goal saved by Reina.<br><br>The two open goals given to Fabregas and Bendtner was rather disappointing. I can understand Fab's one as the ball was played too fast to him, but Bendtner made alot of it.<br><br>Defence was quite rock solid, breaking up play and holding down the strikers really well(especially Crouch - he's useless anyway). I was disappointed with the free kick as i felt that (i think it was Flamini) he shouldnt have moved and that shot would be blocked eventually.<br><br>In the end, it was 1 - 1. Quite a fair result i would say, but we dont like to drop points!<br><br>My MotM: Almunia - he did really well.<br><br>My Hate MotM: The Ref! - screwed up b!tch</div>

Crouch latched on to a through ball but dragged his low shot across goal.<br><br>Then Arsenal had another scare when John Arne Riise's volley from the edge of the box dipped late but found the roof of the net.<br><br>Fabregas eventually made up for his earlier miss when he got on the end of a Hleb through ball to nudge the ball beyond Reina and ensure Arsenal have scored in every game this season.<br><br>It could have been even better for Fabregas and Arsenal, but the Spaniard saw a late shot come back off the post and Nicklas Bendtner hit his first-time shot over when he had time to take a touch.</div>
