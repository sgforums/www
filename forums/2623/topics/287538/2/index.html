            <div class='col-md body'>ok, both teams r unbeaten so far in BPL, so this match will see which team will be beaten.<br><br>looking at how liverpool perform look to me they r not going to beat us. but we must keep in mind dat they will win at all cost since they want the points badly too.<br><br>Torres might be back but i believe he can be mark without fear. the only player we fear most is Crouch as his height is of threat to us should pool try to play long pass to him. i guess the only tactic is to dominate the midfield totally wif our short pass to ensure dat no liverpool midfielders pass the ball to crouch or torres.<br><br>we will win so my prediction is Liverpool 0 - 2 Arsenal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wenger - Top-four battles are our last test</strong><br><br>It would be wrong to suggest Arsenal have had a simply Â‘good startÂ’. The campaign they have enjoyed has been better than that.<br><br>ArsÃ¨ne WengerÂ’s side have played 15 games in all competitions this season and have won every one apart from the draw at Blackburn on August 19. Given that Arsenal have all-but assured qualification to the Knockout Stages of the Champions League and left pre-season doom-mongerers eating spoonfuls of humble pie, Â‘a startÂ’ does not do credit to their progress. Had the Premier League season still been in its infancy then three managers would not have departed already.<br><br>However even Wenger admits there is still a doubt against his side and he knows it will be answered over the course of the next nine days when Arsenal take on two of their traditional top-four rivals Â— starting with Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday.<br><br>Â“Playing a big side is the last question mark against this side,Â” said Wenger at his pre-match press conference on Friday. Â“ThatÂ’s what people expect from us but IÂ’m very confident. You want to go into the game and perform at the top level against the big sides. You want to make sure you are at your best. All the rest doesnÂ’t concern me too much and I know we have the ability to do it.<br><br>Â“I feel that if we repeat our record against the big teams from last year then we will be very difficult to beat. ThatÂ’s the challenge we face now.Â”</div>

We have two tough league matches coming up and they provide an opportunity to show our strength.<br><br>We will have to give everything to get a good result at Anfield but I trust in<br><br>our team. Our style is very different to LiverpoolÂ’s and theyÂ’re usually excellent games Â— there have been lots of goals in recent matches.

            <div class='col-md body'>The questions that remain whether they can beat the other teams in the 'big four', and also how they will react when they are finally defeated, with the 'Invincibles' of 2004 suffering after Manchester United ended their run of 49 league matches.<br><br>Wenger said: "There is one thing that is different.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ArsÃ¨ne Wenger will ask his side to draw from their new-found reserves of belief when they take to the field at Anfield on Sunday in their toughest Premier League game of the season so far.</strong><br><br>The build-up to this game had been dominated by talk of Â“testsÂ”. ArsenalÂ’s start has been incredible Â— albeit without yet playing a top-four opponent - while LiverpoolÂ’s relatively pedestrian. WengerÂ’s men humbled Slavia Prague 7-0 on Tuesday, the next night Rafa BenitezÂ’s side went down 2-1 in Besiktas.<br><br>Despite all that, most English bookmakers have Liverpool as favourites to win. Those odds are based on the fact that Arsenal have not been stretched too much yet Â— particularly away Â— while Liverpool have drawn too many but, like their opponents, are unbeaten domestically.<br><br>However undoubtedly ArsenalÂ’s lossless run has been more exciting and ruthless. It has built mountains of belief so the old maxim that Â“nothing succeeds like successÂ” will never have been more important than at Anfield on Sunday.<br><br>Â“At the start of the season, our belief was not perhaps strong enough to challenge the big teams,Â” said Wenger. Â“But this season we have built up a good belief. We are hungry and we are in good shape so we are in a good condition to go to Liverpool and show what we can do.Â”<br><br>It could be argued those differing Champions League results will inspire Liverpool and leave Arsenal on such a high that their feet will be firmly OFF the ground come Sunday. But Wenger argues the youth and vitality of his side will counter complacency.<br><br>Â“It is easy to bring them down because we have won nothing,Â” he said. Â“This team has just started. They have gone to the Champions League Final and then they had a frustrating season. We are hungry now I can tell. I have no doubts about that. We have to be faithful to the way we want to play and try to dictate our game.Â”<br><br>Wenger was asked whether he expected to win every time his side go on the pitch these days.<br><br>Â“Yes,Â” was the immediate reply.  Â“But,Â” he added, Â“in fairness that was the same last year and it did not happen.<br><br>Â“What has changed this season is that we are less running after the score because defensively we are more efficient. Last season we were 1-0 down in 22 out of 38 games and chasing the game. If you donÂ’t come back quickly then your risk becomes bigger because you have to counter and push further forward.<br><br>Â“Overall I feel we have dealt with our focus this season. To play at the top level is to know that every game has a different difficulty you have to sort out. What I like about this team is that until now they have found the solutions to the problems within the game. There has been no perfect game until now but we have found those solutions.Â”<br><br>On the injury front, Arsenal are still without Robin van Persie (knee) and Philippe Senderos (back). Manuel Almunia will retain the keeper's gloves and Jens Lehmann is set for a place on the bench.</div>
