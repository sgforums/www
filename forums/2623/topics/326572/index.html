              <p>Arsenal's pre-season preparations continued on Wednesday night as a
              young Gunners outfit came from behind to win thanks to late goals from
              Sanchez Watt and Nacer Barazite.</p>
              <p>The evening formed part of the Terriers centenary celebrations
              and had garnered a lot of interest in the local area with over 16,000
              tickets sold prior to kick-off.</p>
              <p>So why invite Arsenal? The answer is simple. Herbert Chapman,
              the visionary manager of the early 20th Century led both these sides to
              almost unparalleled success in their respective histories. With
              tonight's hosts, Chapman won two First Division titles and an FA Cup in
              just four years before swapping Yorkshire for London. At Arsenal he
              revolutionised the Club, setting up an era of dominance in the 1930s.</p>
              <p>For tonight's game Johan Djourou captained the team from
              centre-half, alongside the Hoyte brothers and Kieran Gibbs. Jack
              Wilshere, fresh from the news he is to wear the No 19 shirt this
              season, roamed the left wing, and Theo Walcott was joined upfront by
              Carlos Vela.</p>
              <p>Much like the Arsenal side on show, Town boasted a smattering
              of Academy talent in their squad, however the starting XI included
              several experienced names with Premier League experience, Danny
              Cadamarteri, Chris Luketti and David Unsworth.</p>
              <p>The last time Arsenal travelled to Huddersfield, they left
              with a 5-0 first leg lead in their 1993 League Cup Second Round. A
              similar scoreline tonight and they might be considered party-poopers.
              And when Randall went close inside a minute, a repeat certainly didn't
              seem out of the realms of possibility. But Fabianski soon became the
              busier of the two stoppers as Luke Beckett and Gary Roberts forced the
              Pole into emergency action at his near post.</p>
              <p>Beckett then had the clearest opportunity of the match just
              after the quarter-hour. The striker raced clear off the right touchline
              with Gavin Hoyte hot on his heels. The tackle from behind, when it came
              inside the box, needed to be impeccable. It was and Arsenal's goal
              remained intact.</p>
              <p>The visitors soon found their groove. The wealth of creative
              talent sitting in behind the pace of Walcott couldn't be shackled all
              night. Sure enough the Englishman, played through by Randall went close
              with a snapshot as the Gunners pressed midway through the half.</p>
              <p>In truth, though, Huddersfield remained on top and went close
              again through Lucketti. The captain was found inexplicably unmarked at
              the back post and somehow planted a header wide off the opposite
              upright.</p>
              <p>But you cant keep a good side down and Arsenal had the final
              act of the half. Walcott's pace again made the difference but twice in
              a matter of seconds he was thwarted by Matt Glennon in the Town goal.</p>
              <p>At the interval the visitors made six changes. Huddersfield
              unleashed an entirely new 11, but the complexion stayed the same with
              chances at both ends. Justin Hoyte came agonisingly close to connecting
              with a lofted through ball, while Phil Jevons bent an effort just wide
              from distance.</p>
              <p>Nacer Barazite and Jay Simpson were now leading the line for
              Arsenal. The pair had hauled the Gunners back from the jaws of defeat
              against Barnet in the pre-season curtain raiser almost a month ago.
              Both looked dangerous again tonight.</p>
              <p>After the hour, and for the first time in the evening the
              tempo slowed right down. With 25 minutes to go Gibbs did his best to
              raise it with a powerful surge to the byline, but his cutback was skied
              by Sanchez Watt.</p>
              <p>Randall's trickery almost opened the door for the Gunners but
              Town remained resolute. Then in the 75th minute a few minutes the hosts
              led. Arsenal's now very young backline failed to deal with a long throw
              into the box and allowed Berrett to slam home with the aid of a wicked
              deflection.</p>
              <p>But as the old saying goes, you are always at your most
              vulnerable shortly after you score. So it proved for Huddersfield.
              Within three minutes Simpson had surged down the right flank, beaten
              his man, rolled the ball into a crowded box allowing Watt to apply the
              finish.</p>
              <p>Now Arsenal seized the initiative. Gibbs flashed wide and
              Barazite had a goal-bound effort charged down. The Dutchman didn't have
              to wait long for his big moment though.</p>
              <p>The 18-year old had scored the winner against Barnet and
              here with three minutes to go he plundered another one. Bursting into
              space on the edge of the area, he pulled the trigger and although the
              'keeper got a hand to it, he could only take out some of the sting
              rather than the direction.</p>
