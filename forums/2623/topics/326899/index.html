              <p>Following Luke Young's sale to Aston Villa, Boro are looking to bring in a new right-back before the start of the season.</p>
              <p>Arsenal youngster Hoyte has been mooted as Boro's top target, with reports claiming a £3million offer has been lodged.</p>
              <p>Southgate
              confirmed his intention to replace Young, but did not want to comment
              on any interest in taking Hoyte to the Riverside.</p>
              <p>"I am not talking about players who belong to other clubs," Southgate told the <em>Evening Gazette</em>.</p>
              <h4>Confident</h4>
              <p>He
              added: "What is clear is there are a lot of right-backs currently
              available. We have had a lot of calls as a result of Luke moving on.</p>
              <p>"We have a good idea of what we would like and we are confident we can do some business before the start of the season."</p>
              <p>Southgate also believes that Boro have secured a good deal for Young, who spent just one season on Teesside.</p>
              <p>"When Luke became aware of Villa's offer, he expressed the wish to move on," said Southgate.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to have to fight to get players to want to play for this club.</p>
              <p>"In any case, this was a fantastic deal for the club for a player of his age.</p>
              <p>"I
              want to thank Luke for what he has done here because he was fantastic
              for us last season, but he was distracted this summer and I feel that
              moving him on was the right thing to do."</p>

              Arsene Wenger has said there have been no firm offers for 23-year-old
              defender Justin Hoyte, despite rumours linking him with several
              Premiership clubs. </strong></p>
              <p>Middlesbrough have been rumoured to be interested in
              signing the full back, and Aston Villa have been considering making a
              bid for Hoyte since last summer.</p>
              <p>But Wenger claims nobody has
              approached Arsenal with an offer, and he said there are no plans for
              Hoyte to leave the Emirates Stadium at the moment.</p>
              <p>However, the
              Gunners boss did say he would be willing to consider loaning Hoyte if
              it meant he could play regular first-team football.</p>
              <p>"At the moment, he is with us and we have no formal offer from anybody," Wenger said.</p>
              <p>"There
              is interest here and there, but nothing concrete. I may let one or two
              go on loan because they need to play, it is part of education.</p>
              <p>"It is not especially to get Premiership experience, but to play in the first team every week with that pressure.</p>
              <p>"Then when we feel they are ready to integrate in the first team, they come back."</p>
              <p>Hoyte, a product of the Arsenal academy, appeared in Arsenal's 1-1 draw against Sevilla in the Amsterdam Tournament on Saturday.</p>

              <p>The Gunners accepted a bid of £3million from Boro
              earlier in the week and Hoyte has now put pen-to-paper on a four-year
              contract.</p>
              <p>Gareth Southgate moved for the 23-year-old after allowing Luke Young to join Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>With
              Bacary Sagna firmly established at right-back at the Emirates Stadium,
              Arsene Wenger was happy to let Hoyte head out for a new challenge.</p>
              <p>The former England Under-21 international has now passed a medical and agreed personal terms.</p>
              <p>He will be presented to the Middlesbrough crowd ahead of their Premier League opener against Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
