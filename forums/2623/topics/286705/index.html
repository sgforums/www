            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Wenger - I'm ready to use Walcott as striker*</strong><br><br>Although ArsÃ¨ne Wenger indicated that Eduardo would cover the absent Robin van Persie against Bolton on Saturday, in future games he may turn to Theo Walcott.<br><br>Ever since he signed from Southampton in January 2006, the Arsenal manager has haboured the ambition of turning the winger into a striker. A little like he did with a certain Thierry Henry in 1999.<br><br>Wenger admitted that Eduardo needed to strengthen himself Â— mentally as much as physically Â— to fill the void left by the in-form Dutchman. But he suggested the England Under-21 international had already made sufficient progress to step in if required.<br><br>Â“At the start of the season Eduardo was very good,Â” he said at FridayÂ’s press conference. Â“Then, later, he was injured a little bit and struggled to find his rhythm back. Now he looks sharp to me again.<br><br>Â“Of course when you arrive from the Croatian League and you come to the English Premier League itÂ’s quite a shock. ItÂ’s like driving on the motorway when youÂ’ve been walking. But I feel he adapts well and with the right commitment he will get through that easy.<br><br>Â“He is certainly intelligent enough to fit into the side, Walcott will too. Walcott will get a chance in this position because I feel now he is ready to play through the middle.<br><br>Â“We are in October and Theo has already played a part. He made a big impact last time he came on and you know things change quickly. In football you have always to be ready, and itÂ’s a good opportunity for him as well, not only for Eduardo. If he is strong, he will play.<br><br>Â“Bendtner will [play] as well, but he is more in AdebayorÂ’s position than someone to play with Adebayor.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my opinion, i reckon walcott was always ready for the team...his pace was there, his dribbling skills were there, is just that his finishing was a little off.  importantly he has the pace, and thats what the opposition can't keep up with.  yes, hopefully with the injury with RvP, he can show who's got the business!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he will, let's hope in the absence of RvP he can show just how great a striker he can be...if he improves his finishing, he'd be lethal!  like titi but much smaller and quicker!!!  crazy stuff!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah i agree, walcott needs to keep composure.  that run from centre pitch to the edge of the penalty box was amazing but the pass was bad.  however having said that,  the pass that led to the second goal couldn't be better.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>his pace is amazing.  in that particular run, he ran pass 2 bolton players and managed to get pass a third!  it was as though the bolton players weren't even there!  he is really pacey!<br><br>he just needs to be a little more relaxed, composed and improve his finishing.  with those in place, man......we have another Thierry.<br><br>Get in lads!
