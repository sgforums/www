            <div class='col-md body'>Tomas Rosicky<br><br>Born: October 4, 1980<br>Birthplace: Prague, Czech Republic<br>Height: 5' 8''<br>Weight: 10.7 Pos: M<br>Age: 26<br>GP 19 | G 1 | A 3 (2006/07 Premiership)<br><br>Arsenal signed this Czech Republic international in May 2006 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of Â£7million.<br>Rosicky, who was a target of Spanish side Atletico Madrid, is an energetic, attacking midfielder with a penchant for the spectacular and an impressive range of passing.<br><br>The midfielder was brought in after Robert Pires left the club at the end of his contract.<br><br>After he bagged a superb brace in the Czech Republic's opening game of the 2006 World Cup against the United States many were hailing the signing as Arsene Wenger's latest transfer coup.<br><br>But Rosicky had been a major name on the continental scene for many years, at one time being the most expensive Bundesliga signing after Borussia Dortmund bought him from Sparta Prague for Â£18million.<br><br>Rosicky made his professional debut for Sparta in 1998 and was an instant success. He earned the nickname 'the Little Mozart' in helping his hometown club win three successive league titles.<br><br>That led to interested from Europe's bigger leagues but it was Dortmund who smashed the German transfer record to complete the signing of one of the hottest young prospects in the game.<br><br>He was handed his international debut as a 19-year-old against the Republic of Ireland in 2000 and soon became an integral part of an exciting side.<br><br>Rosicky was part of a Dortmund team which enjoyed a fine run of success. They won the title in his first season and also reached the final of the UEFA Cup before losing to Feyenoord Rotterdam.<br><br>But Dortmund's fortunes took a downturn when they hit financial problems and they were no longer a force in the race for honours. As such, it came as no real surprise when the club - facing a second successive campaign without European competition - cashed in their chips with the player eager for a new challenge.<br><br>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said: 'We are delighted to welcome Tomas to our squad. He has great technique, skill on the ball and sharp passing.<br><br>'Tomas has good experience at all levels for club and country.'</div>
