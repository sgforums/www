              <p>watch the match tis morning. can say tis match was very very boring. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/sleep.png" alt="sleep.png"></p>
              <p>was surprise dat blackburn players were a bunch of passive players who were not at their present self of playing rough today. all they did were basically camp at their own half n waiting gunners to pass wrongly to them so dat they have a chance to counter attack. bloodly suckers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>but gunners were not stupid either as since they were leading, why bother to challenge these unmotivated guys n get unwanted injuries? may as well as play safe by passing ball here n there. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png" width="33" height="32"> </p>
              <p>wenger today had not use any substitutes at all n i am wondering why play fabregas as right winger instead of his fav position? there were time he was lurking into central while sagna covering the right side... wondering is this one of tactic by wenger to <span style="font-family: MS Song;">å£°ä¸œå‡»è¥¿?</span></p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal 2 - 0 Blackburn : Match Report</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/pics/report/report_blackburn11022008.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="178"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal moved five points clear at the top of the Premier League
              with a fraught and frantic 2-0 win over Blackburn at Emirates Stadium
              on Monday night.</p>
              <p>From the fourth to the 92nd minute, only a Philippe Senderos header divided the sides.</p>
              <p>Arsenal created the better of the chances - most notably when Alex
              Hleb thumped a shot against the base of the post - but they never quite
              killed off a resilient Blackburn side until Emmanuel Adebayor cracked
              home a close-range shot just before the final whistle.</p>
              <p>As Manchester United and Chelsea will testify, title victories are
              build on performances such as this - when, with the pressure mounting,
              you respond in the most positive way.</p>
              <p>Make no mistake, despite Blackburn's endeavour, tonight Arsenal
              fully deserved their three points. It was not comfortable but games
              such as these never are. And, remember, it won't get any easier from
              here on in.</p>
              <p>But this evening Arsenal proved to their fans, the Premier League and themselves that they have the stuff of champions.<br> <br>In
              the build-up to this game, Wenger had suggested he might be without as
              many as 11 first-team players. In the end, Senderos (knee) and Mathieu
              Flamini (hamstring) recovered in time to make it. </p>
              <p>However the absentee list was still lengthy: Emmanuel Eboue, Kolo
              Toure, Alex Song (all international duty), Johan Djourou (groin), Robin
              van Persie (thigh), Abou Diaby (calf), Manuel Almunia (sick), Denilson
              (hamstring) and Tomas Rosicky (hamstring). Yet despite all that, there
              was actually only one change in the starting XI - Gilberto returning in
              place of Diaby.</p>
              <p>This was always going to be one of the toughest of Arsenal's remaining home fixtures. But all of a sudden it had become massive.</p>
              <p>Since Arsenal had won at Eastlands last Saturday lunchtime,
              Manchester United had come within a 94th-minute equaliser of dropping
              six points. In fact they had dropped five. Meanwhile third-place
              Chelsea had let two slip at home to Liverpool on Sunday.</p>
              <p>For the first time since that trip to Newcastle just before
              Christmas, Arsenal had the chance to lead the Premier League table by
              more than a nose.</p>
              <p>And they were certainly the quicker out of the stalls this evening.</p>
              <p>They simply deluged Blackburn in the opening stages. In the second
              minute, Bacary Sagna skipped past a couple of challenges on the right
              and crossed for the unmarked Fabregas, whose chest control let him down
              at the crucial moment.</p>
              <p>Then Eduardo went through only but was clipped just before he
              reached the area and his stumble allowed the Blackburn defence to sweep
              the ball behind for a corner. The Croatian international fired it over
              to the edge of the six-yard box where it was met by a firm header from
              Senderos.</p>
              <p>The Swiss defender was engulfed by his team-mates after the ball
              went in. In the circumstances you sensed it might a crucial goal in the
              season not just the game.</p>
              <p>Arsenal did not sit back and admire their work. They swarmed all
              over the visitors in the minutes that followed. Adebayor and Eduardo
              received the ball in dangerous positions as the Blackburn defence
              creaked under the weight of mounting Arsenal pressure. Steven Reid
              flicked a header wide from Bentley's free-kick but when Flamini skied a
              lay-off from Sagna yards over the bar in the 19th minute it was pretty
              much the first thing the home side had done wrong all evening.</p>
              <p>Midway through the half the French midfielder should have made
              amends when he went raced onto Fabregas' header. However his bobbling
              drive bounced away off Brad Friedel's legs.</p>
              <p>The tempo dropped markedly after that and Blackburn finally emerged
              from their own half and won a couple of corners. However the excellent
              Sagna inspired Arsenal into further forays forward.</p>
              <p>Blackburn gave the home side their first genuine scare in the 36th
              minute when Brett Emerton curled over a cross from the right that Benni
              McCarthy and Roque Santa Cruz got a touch on. Both had too much space
              and had either made a solid connection the scores would have been
              level.</p>
              <p>The Paraguayan nearly slid in a goal late in the half from Andre
              Ooijer's raking cross. Arsenal had been dominant team in the opening
              period but, at the break, the visitors had suggested they would be the
              test many had predicted.</p>
              <p>Bentley nearly proved that in the opening seconds when he bent a low
              free-kick towards the near post and the stooping Lehmann shovelled the
              ball wide.</p>
              <p>But Arsenal might have made the game safe seconds later when Eduardo
              appeared on the right and eschewed his team-mates in the middle to
              drill a pass to Hleb on the far side of the area. The Belarus
              midfielder took a touch and hammered his drive against the base of the
              post.</p>
              <p>To this point Adebayor had being having a quiet game compared to his
              imperious form of late. That changed in the 53rd minute when he
              collected Eduardo's chip forward, cruised past his marker and thumped
              an angled shot against the legs of Friedel.</p>
              <p>The game was opening up now. Arsenal looked the team more likely to
              score but Blackburn were having an ominous amount of pressure. Emirates
              Stadium was as nervy as it was passionate.</p>
              <p>The greatest soothing influence from a home perspective was now
              Adebayor. Fifteen minutes from time, he tricked his way past a couple
              of defenders in the area and fired low at Friedel. The American
              half-saved it and the ball was cleared. The Togolese striker did
              something similar a couple of minutes later but this time the ball went
              out for a corner.</p>
              <p>Hleb stung Friedel's hands with 10 minutes left as Arsenal began to
              look like the end of the game would see them as dominant as the start.</p>
              <p>Fabregas had a couple of efforts in the dying minutes. The better of them was a flashing shot just wide.</p>
              <p>Two minutes into added time, the second finally arrived. Hleb
              waltzed into space inside the area and squared to Adebayor who slammed
              home his shot from the edge of the six-yard box.</p>
              <p>Arsenal had taken full advantage of their rivals' faltering form.</p>

              <p><br>well as the matter of fact, blackburn have no winning desire n mark hughe is treating blackburn as if it is mini manu squad. he should be concerning of blackburn's position than to help ferguson. gone were the days when Blackburn is strong rival wif Man U. i suppose u do not know the history either.</p>
              <p>no wonder fabregas had questioned mark hughe's past career when he was barca player.</p>
              <p>a team dat play defensive n rough football is really killing football in the league.</p>

              <p>watch the match tis morning. can say tis match was very very
              boring. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/sleep.png" alt="sleep.png"></p>
              <p>was surprise dat blackburn players were a bunch of passive
              players who were not at their present self of playing rough today.
              all they did were basically camp at their own half n waiting
              gunners to pass wrongly to them so dat they have a chance to
              counter attack. bloodly suckers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>but gunners were not stupid either as since they were leading,
              why bother to challenge these unmotivated guys n get unwanted
              injuries? may as well as play safe by passing ball here n there.

              <p>wenger today had not use any substitutes at all n i am wondering
              why play fabregas as right winger instead of his fav position?
              there were time he was lurking into central while sagna covering
              the right side... wondering is this one of tactic by wenger to
              <span style="font-family: MS Song;">å£°ä¸œå‡»è¥¿?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: MS Song;">a good result for gunners as

              <p>I still can't get used to this format, especially being busy and not coming sgforums lately. Anyway, Blackburn has not been known to play fantastic or fanciful football. I've previously commented that I think last season. And they do play a little on the rough side to put opponents off their stride.</p>
              <p>But to say Mark Hughes is trying to help Ferguson is taking a bit far. If I remember correctly, Quezeiro (spelling might be wrong) had a sideline spat with Blackburn bench last season, and I'm rather certain he was saying something like ,'It's a f***ing shame.' I get the feeling it was directed at Hughes.</p>
              <p>I've seen Blackburn play like that too against Chelsea and Man U as well. Can't recall watching any Liverpool vs Blackburn matches in recent seasons.</p>
