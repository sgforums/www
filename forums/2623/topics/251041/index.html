As long as he is here then I will be here - it's just as simple as that," he said.<br><br>Arsenal sit fourth in the Premiership behind Liverpool but are out of contention in all competitions this term.<br><br>Henry blames the lack of concentration and experience on such a poor season by Arsenal's standards as they look set to end the season trophy-less.<br><br>"I think perhaps we lose our concentration," said Henry. "We don't do this on purpose.<br><br>"We have ended up losing so many points against teams we should have beaten."<br><br>Reflecting on injury-plagued season, Henry added: "The talent is there but you need to put the ball in the back of the net, and I wasn't fresh enough, or there enough, to do that for the team this season.<br><br>"We have a lot of amazing youngsters at the club, but you need experience too," he added.<br><br>"We'd be in a much better position if we had taken our chances.<br><br>"We do have something to build on, but we need to kill teams off. That's all that let us down this year."</span></div>
