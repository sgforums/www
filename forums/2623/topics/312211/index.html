                  he was booed by Chelsea fans on Sunday because the supporters do not
                  know the truth behind his exit from Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>The French defender left Chelsea for Arsenal in
                  August 2006 amid claims that he had threatened to score an own goal, if
                  his contract demands were not met by the Blues.</p>
              <p>Gallas has rejected those accusations and insists he always gave his all during his five years with the West London club.</p>
              <p>But, on his first return to Stamford Bridge since leaving, he was roundly jeered by Chelsea fans during Arsenal's 2-1 defeat on <em>Grand Slam Sunday</em>.</p>
              <p>The Gunners captain shrugged off the criticism and believes he
                  was only booed because the supporters are not aware of the facts behind
                  his departure.</p>
              <h4>Respect</h4>
              <p>"I think the fans boo me because they did not know the truth about why I left Chelsea," Gallas told <em>Sky Sports</em>.</p>
              <p>"Maybe I have to say the truth and maybe they will respect me.</p>
              <p>"It's true I spent five years there and I gave the maximum. What the Chelsea club said about me, it was not true."</p>
              <p>Chelsea striker Didier Drogba also feels that Gallas deserves respect for his achievements during his time with the club.</p>
              <p>Drogba said: "William Gallas gave a lot to Chelsea and the
                  minimum the fans can give him is a little bit more respect because he
                  gave us two titles and I wish him all the best."</p>

              <p>there r two side of coin. if u walk off to another club who happen to be rival, prepare to get flame by the club once u joined.</p>
              <p>just look at sol campbell, he contributed for spurs n was captain for them, but he chose his path by transferring to Arsenal, who were hatred by the scums. look at how he was condemned after so many years by the spurs even though he's no longer gunners.</p>
              <p>Gallas should not look back n focus his attention of leading Arsenal morale.</p>
