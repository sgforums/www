Life goes on and I will get on with my job like I always have.<br><br>"But I was surprised he didn't speak to me about his decision. He had the time to do it because I was at the training ground before it was made public.<br><br>"He didn't say anything to me and I just found out about it that evening when I saw it on the Arsenal website.<br><br>"I wasn't upset about not being captain, but I was about the way I learnt about it."<br><br>He added: "I will give the same commitment to the club that I always have. This is an important season."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> I knew this would happen one day. i sympathize with gilberto. even though he dont scream much,i think he led a good example to his teammates.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>somehow i think gallas can give us more offense than gilberto...gilberto is a very defensive player and he is prob more inclined to lead the team to defending. With gallas as captain, we might be able to at least try to solve the problem of insufficient goals <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Firstly, Senderos does not have enough first team experience. Secondly, Senderos is quite complacent at times. Thirdly, Gallas is much faster than Senderos. And lastly, Gallas can clear and head the ball better than Senderos.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>but the thing is senderos is younger than gallas, he can learn and grow, giving the armband to someone who had came to arsenal for only 1 year aint a wise choice</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's because Gallas is a important part of the team right now as Senderos is still not ready and Arsenal cannot afford to lose both Gallas and Henry at the same time so Wenger handed him the armband to make him stay. Maybe Wenger know that both Gilberto Silva and Toure will understand him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
