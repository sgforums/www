I can't imagine he will handle this."<br><br>But Almunia, who has tightened his grip on the number one jersey with a run of six clean sheets in the last seven matches, has taken the outburst in his stride.<br><br>"I'm not worried about that (Lehmann's comments). Nothing can disturb me and nothing can turn my mind on to other things," said the 30-year-old.<br><br>"I don't want turn my mind to other things. I only want to win games for Arsenal. I don't care about any other aspect.<br><br>"I will stay positive. The goalkeeping position is a difficult position.<br><br>"I've been here almost three years without playing in the league. It's normal for people to assess the situation.<br><br>"I forget the past now I'm playing. It's not a problem. I don't care about pressure. I only want to play well.<br><br>"If I read the papers and listen to what other people say about me and all these things, then I'd will turn crazy. I don't want that.<br><br>"When I'm playing well I honestly don't mind other things that are happening.<br><br>"Maybe if I was playing badly I would be more worried. But now for me life is fantastic and I want to take my chance."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah good luck to him. Somehow the whole team makes him look good...his test will come in the next few days. Remember he made a few mistakes as well but was bailed out by the defence. Of course he made a few good saves as well.</div>
