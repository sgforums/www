              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal bounced back from defeat at Fulham last week to seal a comfortable 3-0 win over Newcastle at Emirates Stadium. </strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners were rarely troubled by the visting
              Magpies and went ahead just 18 minutes in as Robin van Persie slammed
              home a penalty.</p>
              <p>The Ducthman added a second just before the break to make it 2-0 at the interval.</p>
              <p>The
              second-half saw Denilson fire home after a well-worked move and that
              sealed The Gunners' second win of the season which takes them into
              second, albeit with Chelsea and Liverpool still to play on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Arsenal had started in determined fashion and had a great chance to take the lead inside three minutes.</p>
              <p>A
              corner from the right was flicked on by Bacary Sagna at the near post,
              and the ball fell at the feet of William Gallas. However, the Gunners
              captain - who has netted twice already this season - somehow blazed his
              shot over the bar from no more than a yard out.</p>
              <p>Kolo Toure then came forwards and flashed in a low drive from 25 yards, which Shay Given turned behind at full stretch.</p>
              <p>Then just after Newcastle looked to have got a themselves a foothold in the</p>
              <p>match,
              they conceded a penalty. Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor dashed past his
              marker and into the right side of the box, before cutting the ball back
              across goal, where it hit N'Zogbia on his trailing arm.</p>
              <p>Van
              Persie stepped up to take the resulting spot-kick, which was coolly
              dispatched low into the bottom right corner past the dive of the
              Newcastle keeper.</p>
              <p>With the cushion of an early lead, Arsenal started to showboat, passing the ball around with consummate ease.</p>
              <p>Cesc Fabregas - in his 200th appearance for the Gunners - tried his luck with a speculative 25-yard effort, which flew over.</p>
              <p>Samir
              Nasri got away down the left, before floating over a cross with the
              outside of his boot - and only a deft touch from the fast-retreating
              Fabricio Coloccini denied an on-rushing Adebayor a tap in.</p>
              <p>After
              31 minutes, van Persie curled a 20-yard free-kick up towards the
              top-left corner, but Given was at his acrobatic best to make a flying
              save.</p>
              <p>Newcastle finally created a decent opening after 37 minutes
              when Jonas Gutierrez, the Argentina international midfielder, got clear
              down the left and cut a low centre back across goal.</p>
              <p>Michael Owen
              was lurking at the far post, but just as he shot, team-mate Shola
              Ameobi got in the way and deflected the ball off target.</p>
              <p>Arsenal
              went up the other end and carved open the visitors' defence again with
              van Persie feeding Adebayor. However, the big Togo frontman, under
              pressure from two defenders and the advancing keeper, could only slot
              the ball wide.</p>
              <h4>Van Persie double</h4>
              <p>It was, though, soon
              2-0 with four minutes to go to half-time. Emmanuel Eboue played
              Adebayor in down the right, and continued his run into the penalty area
              to collect the return pass.</p>
              <p>The much-maligned Ivory Coast
              midfielder then produced a clever back-heel, which rolled into the path
              of van Persie - who smashed the ball into the roof of the net.</p>
              <p>Newcastle
              were positive following the restart and only the woodwork denied Kevin
              Keegan's men a way back into the match after 56 minutes when Nicky
              Butt's flicked header from a left-wing corner dropped onto the crossbar.</p>
              <p>It
              was just one of those days for the visitors as Arsenal wrapped up the
              match with another superbly-crafted goal in the 59th minute.</p>
              <p>Nasri
              worked himself space in the box, before tapping the ball back to
              Adebayor. The Togo frontman simply laid it off sideways, where Denilson
              was on hand to slip the ball back past the oncoming defender and a
              wrong-footed Given.</p>
              <p>Arsenal could have further extended their lead before the final whistle.</p>
              <p>Van
              Persie smashed in an angled drive from almost on the goal-line, which
              ricocheted off the underside of the bar at the near post.</p>
              <p>Given
              then produced a fine reaction save at point-blank range to keep out
              Toure's header and also was at full stretch to turn away Nasri's
              curling free-kick before substitute Theo Walcott pulled an angled drive
              wide after another swift counter-attack.</p>
              <p>Newcastle midfielder
              Joey Barton, recently released from jail and facing a violent conduct
              charge from the Football Association, came on for the closing two
              minutes - to resounding jeers from the home crowd.</p>
