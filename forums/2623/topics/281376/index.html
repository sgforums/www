In three of the last four seasons his side have reached the Semi-Final and, of course, last season they were just pipped to the trophy by a full-strength Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium.<br><br>Â“You will see Bendtner, Diarra and Denilson,Â” Wenger told Arsenal TV Online when asked about the make-up of the squad. Â“Maybe Eboue (ankle) will be coming back as well.<br><br>Â“YouÂ’ll see Justin Hoyte and Alex Song maybe Eduardo and Diaby. Then there is Armand Traore and Lukasz Fabianski who we have not seen a lot of so far. We have sold out and we will put out a good team. We want to give the opportunity to our fans to see some unfamiliar faces.Â”<br><br>If they play this would be the first start for Diarra and Bendtner while Fabianski would be making his debut.<br><br>Arsenal.com will announce the full squad on Tuesday (later on).</div>
