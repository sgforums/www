Walcott had been troubled  by a shoulder injury for the second half of last season and he even missed the final few games of the campaign to get surgery out of the way.<br><br>He returned to pre-season training early but progress is slow with this sort of injury and Wenger has only just seen the benefits of his treatment Â— surprisingly in the speed tests.<br><br>Â“It has taken him some time but now in the last week I can see he is really coming back,Â” said Wenger.<br><br>Â“I had the same experience with Philippe Senderos when he had an operation on his shoulder. It takes you much longer than you expected. When you fall down and your shoulder pops out, you cannot be the same player.<br><br>Â“Even when they are back for four or five weeks, when you test them in normal training they have not recovered their speed. It is because of your co-ordination. Only then do you discover how much a player needs his arms and shoulders to play football. It is unbelievable.Â”<br><br>Wenger found it strange that Walcott was not even discussed for full England duty when Steve McClaren was struggling for forwards against Germany this week.<br><br>Â“I was surprised last week when people were talking about a striking crisis in England and nobody mentioned Walcott,Â” he commented.<br><br>That said the Arsenal manager has still not decided on the former Southampton playerÂ’s best position.<br><br>Â“I am not completely sure yet,Â”  Wenger admitted. Â“At the moment I feel he is a bit more of a wide player but because he makes good runs he would be good in the centre as well.<br><br>Â“But you then have to find the right partner for him. He is a runner so you need someone who keeps the ball next to him. It is difficult for him and that is why I am using him more wide.Â”</div>
