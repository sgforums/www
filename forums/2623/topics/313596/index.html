              <p>Cesc Fabregas is confident that Mathieu Flamini will pen a new deal with Arsenal.<br> <br>The
              duo have forged a mighty partnership in the heart of the Gunners
              midfield this season. In fact in the Premier League they have missed
              just four games as a pair. However the Frenchman’s current deal runs
              out in the summer, at which point he can leave the Club for nothing.
              Europe’s elite are watching on intently for any developments, or lack
              of them.<br> <br>Should Flamini, who also recieved his first
              international cap this term, agree on a new contract he would become
              the third player in a short of space of time to commit to the future of
              Arsenal. He would join Manuel Almunia and youngster Fran Merida - a
              real testament to the direction the Club is going.<br> <br>Fabregas
              enjoys a good relationship with Flamini both on and off the field. He
              believes that despite the reported, and fully justified, interest from
              elsewhere, his friend’s commitment and desire to be a winner with
              Arsenal is evident everyday.<br> <br>“He [Flamini] is concentrating on
              the football at the moment,” Fabregas told the matchday programme. “We
              are still going for two titles so right now everything else is not as
              important.<br> <br>“Of course he wants to know where he will be next season but we all hope he will be with us.<br> <br>“He
              is working really hard, he is a nice guy, he wants the best for Arsenal
              and I know he wants to stay. He has a lot of options because he is
              playing amazing football, but I know he really wants to stay here and
              that’s the most important thing.”<br> <br>Fabregas even admits to
              giving Flamini a little nudge in the right direction: “Yes I must say I
              have. I keep telling him to do it quick because we need him.”</p>

              <p>flamini had done before playing his former club out when his contact run out. if arsenal ended up the season trophy-less, i wont be surprise flamini left the club.</p>
              <p>if he really leave, i hope he wont join any english club.</p>
              <p>n it doesnt matter to arsenal cos getting a defensive/attacking midfielder is easy comparing to wingers.</p>

              <h3 class="HL">Wenger - End of April is deadline for Flamini</h3>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/Images/f/flamini_0708newcastle.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="230"></p>
              <p>Arsène Wenger admits that the clock is ticking on his contract negotiations with Mathieu Flamini but he remains confident the French midfielder will sign a new deal.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old is out of contract in the summer and has been able
              to speak to other clubs since January. Newspapers have linked him to a
              couple of the major Italian sides.</p>
              <p>Flamini and Wenger have been talking for some time but the manager
              has set a deadline for the end of this month. Both sides know that is
              approaching fast.</p>
              <p>"We are getting close to yes or no," said Wenger at his pre-match press conference on Friday.</p>
              <p>"He says he wants to stay and I believe him. But as long as he has
              not signed, for me, he is free to sign where he wants. We have set
              ourselves a target until the end of the month of April to finalise the
              situation, one way or the other.</p>
              <p>"That's an absolute deadline because afterwards we have to make
              decisions about whether you have to move on the market because you
              don't have much time left."</p>
              <p>At the start of every summer, Wenger is asked about his transfer
              plans. Every summer he replies by emphasising the importance of
              stability and continuity. Nothing will change in his attitude this
              season but a new ruling has complicated his plans.</p>
              <p>"My first target is to keep the team together," said the
              58-year-old. "Of course, that's a situation I do not master completely.
              But we want to continue to respect our wage structure because I feel
              that is very important.</p>
              <p>"The situation at the moment has become much more unstable with the
              Webster clause. Every new rule provokes a little bit more inflation and
              instability because the players can always move out earlier and
              quicker.</p>
              <p>"[The limit] was 28-years-old but I'm not convinced that that rule
              will resist for a long time. One day, a 26-year-old will go to court
              and say it's age discrimination. Why can you move out at 28 and not 26
              after two years? So [that rule] will grow again. The stability inside a
              club will be a big problem because that can be a huge inflation factor."</p>
              <p>* The 'Webster Clause' refers to Andrew Webster of Hearts who wished
              to move to Wigan in 2006. The case went to the Court of Arbitration for
              Sport in Lausanne, they made their ruling earlier this season.</p>
              <p>As a result, "the 'Webster Case' will allow players to leave a club
              after three years of a longer fixed-term contract, or just two years if
              they are aged over 28. There are two stipulations: the player must hand
              in his notice in the 15 days following his club's last official match
              of the third season, and he may not move to a club in the same country."</p>
