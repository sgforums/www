            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">France coach Raymond Domenech has again defended himself after Gerard Houllier joined Arsene Wenger in criticising the actions of the national team.<br><br>The row began when Wenger accused Domenech of 'badly managing' Thierry Henry after the striker was ruled out for the rest of the season with injury.<br><br>Wenger suggested that the overuse of the player in international friendlies had prevented his full recovery after last year's World Cup, causing Domenech to claim he was 'seriously tired out' with Wenger's constant accusations.<br><br>However, Wenger again spoke out, claiming the France coach was the only international boss who would not communicate with him.<br><br>And Lyon boss Houllier has since come out in support of Wenger's remarks, saying 'Raymond does what he wants'.<br><br>But Domenech believes he is being victimised in the row, and claims he has done nothing wrong.<br><br>"I believe it is unbearable to be considered the perpetrator of those controversies," he told L'Equipe. "I am shocked and surprised to be seen as the one who attacks. It is not the case.<br><br>"I can't let everything be said without replying, particularly when the Arsenal manager slammed the staff of the France team about the management of Henry.<br><br>"When I was France Under 21 coach, I called the club's coaches all the time and that was logical. But now my main communicators are the key players of French teams. That is the usual situation with Les Bleus."<br><br>Domenech now wants an end to the war of words to allow him to get on with his job.<br><br>"Now it is over. I won't say anything more. I replied in the newspapers, where I have been attacked. Once again, I just replied to the attacks.<br><br>"Now the only thing that matters is preparing well for the match against Lithuania."</span></div>
