            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Diaby strike sinks Villa</strong><br><br>Aston Villa's woeful recent record against Arsenal continued after going down to a 1-0 defeat at Villa Park thanks to Abou Diaby's fortunate goal.<br><br>Julio Baptista's harmless shot was troubling no-one until it struck Diaby and nestled its way into the net, giving The Gunners a lead they would not lose.<br><br>The win moves Arsenal ahead of Liverpool into third in the Premiership while Villa's dismal run against the North Londoners now stretches to 17 games without a win.<br><br>There was little to separate the sides in the early exchanges before Arsenal opened the scoring from their first meaningful attack of the game.<br><br>Baptista's speculative shot appeared non-threatening for Villa, although it struck Diaby who inadvertently diverted the ball around Thomas Sorensen after just 10 minutes.<br><br>Villa tried to hit back but Gareth Barry's free-kick was comfortable for Jens Lehmann while Arsenal came within a whisker of doubling their advantage.<br><br>Freddie Ljungberg's pin-point through-ball sent Jeremie Aliadiere away and only a fine last-gasp save from Sorensen denied the French striker getting his name on the scoresheet.<br><br>Aliadiere's pace was causing the home side all sorts of problems and only pressure from Olof Mellberg following Denilson's neat pass denied the striker a clean shot on goal.<br><br>Villa thought they had won a penalty when Johan Djourou brought down John Carew, but referee Martin Atkinson deemed the contact outside the box.<br><br>Carew tried his luck from the set-piece but could only find the wall, although, from the rebound Mellberg saw his rasping shot deflected out for a corner.<br><br>Villa should have been level on 39 minutes through Ashley Young from Barry's square-ball, but his side-footed effort was under-hit and saved by Lehmann.<br><br>Arsenal nearly made the home side pay with Aliadiere amazingly seeing his downward header bounce over bar from point-blank range following Ljungberg's cross just before the interval.<br><br>Villa made a bright start to the second half with Carew forcing Lehmann off his line smartly again before Gabriel Agbonlahor's header from Young's dangerous cross was well saved.<br><br>The lively Aliadiere had a chance at the other end, but seemed to snatch at his chance and ended up dragging his left-footed shot wide of Sorenson's near post.<br><br>Diaby proved luck was on his side on the night when a cross struck his thigh and only superb positioning from Ljungberg on the line prevented the midfielder scoring at both ends.<br><br>Arsene Wenger opted to freshen things up after the chances dried up, bringing on Mathieu Flamini and Tomas Rosicky for goal-scorer Diaby and Baptista.<br><br>The introduction of Patrik Berger gave Villa impetus although it was Sorensen who had to be on guard to block Rosicky's left-footed shot from outside the area.<br><br>Despite having the better of the second half, Martin O'Neill's charges failed to make the all-important breakthrough and slipped to their 10th league defeat of the season. </span></div>
