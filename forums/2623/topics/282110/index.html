We have to show we are consistent throughout the whole season.<br><br>"What is a big strength of my squad at the moment is good togetherness, good camaraderie and that everybody is on the same wavelength.<br><br>"We just want to stay where we are. We have had a good start and want to continue."<br><br>Wenger believes he has a crop of young players who can fit into his first team whenever he decides he needs them to.<br><br>"The game was of the same level we played recently with the players who did not feature, and with a style of play with a continuity," he said.<br><br>"We have wave after wave of generation of young players. We have a small group of good quality, and very young.<br><br>"For me, all of them can play on a regular basis in the first team. We have shown technical maturity and looked strong in every department.<br><br>"With this team, we can have a chance against anybody."<br><br>Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce lamented the fact his team had to play again so quickly, having been in Premier League action on Sunday.<br><br>The visitors - who had five players starting from the team which lined up for the win over West Ham on Sunday and were again without injured England striker Michael Owen - had a small collection of decent chances, falling mainly to Obafemi Martins.<br><br>Philippe Senderos, Arsenal captain for the night, had to clear off the line after the Newcastle striker had rounded the goalkeeper - before Denilson's effort made sure of the win.<br><br>"What we got in the end was a fatigued set of players who could not run any more, and Arsenal capitalised on that," said Allardyce.<br><br>"We are told to play and have to play. It is sad, but we had to try to deal with it.<br><br>The Newcastle boss noted an unfortunate end to a competition he had hoped his team could progress in.<br><br>"For Arsenal, this competition is fourth in the list. For us, it is a high priority - to get as far as we can in the cup competitions.<br><br>"Drawing Arsenal away with the mood they are in at the moment was difficult enough, but to do it in these circumstances has contributed towards our defeat."</div>
