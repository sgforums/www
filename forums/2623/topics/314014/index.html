              <p>Real Madrid superstar Robinho may be making his way to the Premier
              League next season, with Arsenal and Tottenham leading the chase for
              his signature, <em>writes Alex Sexton</em>.</p>
              <p>There have been rumours of a deal going through since the start of last
              summer but it now seems that the diminutive Brazilian is finally
              contemplating leaving the Spanish capital after falling out with boss
              Bernd Schuster.</p>
              <p>Well known for his disciplinarian stance, Schuster has tried to hold
              clear-the-air talks with the winger but it could be a case of too
              little too late.</p>
              <p>Spurs chief Damien Comolli is a well publicised admirer of Robinho
              and if he does become available then Tottenham are expected to make a
              move.</p>
              <p>Arsenal are also reported to be interested as they look to
              strengthen a squad that has run out of the steam towards the end of the
              season. Wenger could see the 24-year-old as a perfect partner for the
              towering figure of Emmanuel Adebayor.</p>
              <p>If the temperamental Robinho becomes further unsettled, the La Liga
              club may cut their losses and listen to offers in the region of £20
              million. The Brazilian has scored 14 goals in 28 matches this season
              and could finally make a switch to north London.</p>

              <p>This fellow seem like a problem player... He had trouble with their previous manager... and now the present one too... hope he won't come in and disrupt the team... Anyway if wenger really want to pay $20m for him, he would have been better off paying $17m for Ribery...</p>

              <p><br>Yeah they did... Their first offer of $30 million euros was rejected by Santos... Therefore i think he went for something like $40m euros to Real in the end... Maybe something like close to $30m pounds?</p>
              <p>Thats why they said the La Liga club may cut their losses and listen to offers in the region of £20 million.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Butragueno did not disclose the cost of the Robinho signing, but Santos refused to accept the $30 million Real offered to buy the striker out of his contract.</em></p>
              <p><em>Santos president Marcelo Teixeira accused the Spanish giants of approaching the player without his club's permission and appeared to be determined to resist Real's pressure.</em></p>
              <p><em>The Brazilian Football Confederation added weight to his argument that Real had to pay the full $50 million penalty clause stipulated in Robinho's contract when refusing to hand over the player's International Transfer Certificate to their Spanish counterparts.</em></p>
              <p><em>However, Teixeira appears to have finally relented with his decision paving the way for Robinho to realise a lifelong dream of playing in Europe.</em></p>
