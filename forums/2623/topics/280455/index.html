At his age you have to let him play.<br><br>"I am not surprised that we have started well - but they have confirmed my hopes.<br><br>"They have strengthened my belief that this team can do well, but you have to show it on the pitch."<br><br>Wenger added: "Many times Michel Platini told me when I went to watch him for French national teams, 'They give me the ball when we lead 3-0' so it is natural when a player of the calibre of Thierry, they look for him first to do something, and when he is not there somebody else, it is a bit more shared."<br><br>The Arsenal manager knows the visit of Spanish side Sevilla - coached by Juande Ramos, who was targeted by Tottenham as a replacement for beleaguered boss Martin Jol - will provide a stern test of their European credentials.<br><br>He said: "My players must show the same belief, drive and consistency they have shown in the Premier League so far.<br><br>"There is a hunger in every game to play, and we just want to continue that. It is a different kind of football."<br><br>Wenger added: "It will be between two teams who try to play and go forward so it should be a good game.<br><br>"Maybe they can think as well that if they get a draw at Arsenal they are in a strong position in the group, so maybe they will change their philosophy, but usually they go forward."<br><br>Defender Kolo Toure, 26, is one of the players whose influence in the side has increased this season.<br><br>However, the Ivory Coast defender knows there is no one single man able to fill the considerable boots of Henry.<br><br>Toure said: "Thierry Henry has been a great player for us, but you cannot demand another player to do the same as him.<br><br>"You can see that everyone is taking their own responsibility.<br><br>"At the moment, we can see that we can score goals from everywhere, and for a team to stop us scoring is really difficult now because Cesc (Fabregas) can score, (Alexander) Hleb, (Robin) van Persie, (Tomas) Rosicky, Adebayor - the dangers can come from everywhere. That is the difference for this season."</div>
