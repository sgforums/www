I will try to be even better than Ashley as it is one of my objectives to be remembered as one of the great Arsenal left backs.Â”<br><br>The Gunners defender also believes that Cole will have a tough afternoon at Emirates Stadium when Arsenal lock horns with Chelsea.<br><br>Â“Ashley was a symbol of Arsenal, being a London boy and someone who came through the academy, and that is why fans will find it difficult to welcome him back.<br><br>"If they decide to boo him then I will understand that. I hope he will handle it because he is a good guy.Â”<br><br>Clichy will be hoping the Gunners faithful will rise to the occasion on Sunday afternoon and help his side prevent The Blues from taking anything away with them from Emirates Stadium.<br><br>Â“I just want the fans to help the team get the three points. It is going to be difficult and we will need them.Â”<br><br>The French defender admits his side are good enough to win the league this season, something they have not managed since their Â‘invincible' run three years ago.<br><br>Â“I cannot explain the emotion when we won the title but it was something deep inside your stomach and it was just unbelievable.<br><br>"I really want everyone in this team to experience that feeling. We have the quality and the desire and everything is possible this season.Â”</div>
