How much? Frankly at the moment I do not know. We have to see," said Wenger.<br><br>"It is linked as well with who goes out, who comes in. You can create money. That is what we always try to do - but how much I do not know.<br><br>"I will be meeting the board at some point next week to discuss the budget."<br><br>Wenger is also aware that he cannot replace the vast wealth of experience The Gunners have lost in recent years over the course of one pre-season.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>"You look in the last two years - we have lost Robert Pires, Dennis Bergkamp, Sylvain Wiltord, Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole, Patrick Vieira, Edu, Kanu, Martin Keown.</strong></span><br><br>"It is a capital of experience you lose and you do not replace that from one second to the next. We have potential, but at the moment we are a bit short."<br><br>Wenger would previously have relied on David Dein to help implement his transfer policy, but the former vice-chairman has still not been replaced since his shock departure last month.<br><br>Dein has been linked with a possible return to the club as part of any takeover from Stan Kroenke, but Wenger is not anticipating seeing his friend in the halls of Emirates Stadium any time soon.<br><br>"At the moment there is no possibility he will come back," Wenger added.<br><br>"I feel David is needed in football, because this guy has revolutionised this club and English football.<br><br>"Will he stay in football, I would say yes. Will he come back to Arsenal? I do not know. At the moment, it is unlikely." </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Indeed..</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
