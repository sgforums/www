              <p>Arsène Wenger last night condemned David Bentley's advice that Theo
              Walcott should follow his lead and leave Arsenal in order to further
              his career. Wenger insisted that despite being limited to mainly
              substitute appearances since joining the club, Walcott has a bright
              future and suggested the reason Bentley did not make the grade there
              was because he lacked the character to fight for a place in the side.</p>
              <p>"Bentley
              is entitled to his opinions but it doesn't mean he's right," Wenger
              said. "I don't know why one player should incite another to leave his
              club. It's not his job. When you are at one of the biggest clubs in the
              world you have to accept competition. If you accept it, competition
              makes you better. If you do not then you have to move down and accept
              no longer being at the top. Theo will establish himself here. People
              forget he is still very young."</p>
              <p>Bentley joined Arsenal as a trainee in
              2001 but left after five years in which he made only one Premier League
              appearance for the club. The 23-year-old's career has flourished since
              he signed for Blackburn in January 2006, the same month Walcott arrived
              at Arsenal from Southampton. Bentley has become a regular for Mark
              Hughes' side and made an impressive first start for England in the
              victory over Switzerland last month.</p>
              <p>"If
              he is not getting the minutes at Arsenal, he's going to have to look
              elsewhere. Your career doesn't start and end at Arsenal. It can
              flourish somewhere else," Bentley said yesterday. "At the end of the
              day you want to make a career for yourself. You want to play football
              and you want to make money as well. You can't afford to stay at a club
              where you might be 24 or 25 with 30 games under your belt."</p>
              <p>Walcott
              has made 28 appearances for Arsenal this season but 13 of those have
              been as a substitute. The 18-year-old's latest appearance came at San
              Siro on Tuesday when he set up Emmanuel Adebayor for Arsenal's second
              goal in their 2-0 win over Milan but he will not be able to build on
              that cameo at Wigan on Sunday after he injured his thigh in training
              yesterday.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's striker Eduardo da Silva has told the
              Croatian newspaper Jutarnji that he fears being sidelined for up to 15
              months after his leg was broken by Birmingham City's Martin Taylor last
              month. Eduardo said: "Some people tell me that my rehabilitation will
              take six months, others say nine months, while there are some who still
              talk to me about 15 months."</p>
