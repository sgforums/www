If I find two, I will do it.<br><br>"But it is not compulsory. If we do not get them, we do not get them. We have enough quality.<br><br>"That will not be an excuse if I do not get a player, not to compete."<br><br>Speculation has seen Arsenal again strongly linked with a move for Anelka, but Wenger insists no offer has been made for the Bolton man.<br><br>"At the moment I have not made any offer for Anelka," he said.<br><br>"I felt we had the strikers we needed, and also I wanted a player like Eduardo, who can play on the flanks and with (Emmanuel) Adebayor, or with (Robin) van Persie.<br><br>"That is why we have gone for Eduardo, and it was more a question of choice rather than the quality of Anelka, because I rate him very highly.<br><br>"It was just we have others who play in the same position."<br><br>Wenger also paid tribute to Danish youngster Nicklas Bendtner, who scored and created the other goal during Arsenal's 2-0 Emirates Cup win over Paris Saint Germain.<br><br>"I felt he of course lacks some experience but we have seen ingredients and think that there is a special talent," Wenger told the website.<br><br>"We have to give him some time and I believe what he has shown is encouraging.<br><br>"Every day a guy like that at 18 becomes quicker, stronger and more experienced, so the improvement is very quick.<br><br>"He is quick, much quicker than people think and there is a lot to work on and I feel there is good potential."</div>
