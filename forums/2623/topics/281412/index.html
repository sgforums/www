            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/Images/w/wenger_0708lazio.jpg"><br><br><strong>On another positive result...</strong><br>"I feel we had a difficult Champions League game and we kept good focus today. Even when the game looked to become easy we kept good concentration on the quality of our game. I feel that's really enjoyable to watch because players do not think 'OK, it's easy now', and start to become more individualistic. They play a good collective game, the team means business, you know? They are not there to be show-offs, they want to achieve something together."<br><br><strong>On hat-trick man Adebayor...</strong><br>"I feel physically he looks stronger, you see that in many challenges when he gets his body in. He is really a lion. He has a huge force coming out of him, basically he had that already before but he looks calmer in his finishing."<br><br><strong>On bringing Cesc off...</strong><br>"He had a little calf problem at half-time. The game was over and I wanted to take him off, but he saw I wanted to take him off and quickly took advantage to score a goal. That is amazing because it tells you how much the psychological boost comes from the confidence you get from the goals you scored before, because if you had not scored the other six he would not even try to shoot today."<br><br><strong>On extending their lead in the Premiership...</strong><br>"Yes of course, the bigger the difference is with the second the better it is, but we played six times with four at home. So we are conscious that next week will be another test. We go to West Ham I think, so we just go game-to-game and try to improve. We won in a convincing way at Tottenham, we could have won at Blackburn so it's just, let's keep it going and see where we are."<br><br><strong>On Walcott's performance...</strong><br>"I feel he had the type of defender who didn't give him any room, in the first half he struggled a little bit to find any space. In the second half he looked more himself because I asked him to come more inside to get the ball. When he stayed out as a winger, Griffin, who has a lot of experience, didn't give him any room. But he has not played for a while. For example you see Diaby came on the other night and had a difficult game - today it was completely different. I link that more with the fact that he has not played recently."<br><br><strong>On Derby County...</strong><br>"They played a real cup game against Newcastle at home so I think mentally that has cost them a lot of energy, maybe you are a bit flat in the game after. They will stay in the league with their home form. Of course, they must nick a few points away from home but basically they have to focus on their home form if they want to stay in the league."</div>
