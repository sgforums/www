              <p>Arsène Wenger has re-iterated his belief in the "outstanding leadership qualities" of <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/player.asp?thisNav=first+team&amp;plid=66633&amp;clid=4421&amp;cpid=703">William Gallas</a>.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal captain is under the spotlight after last week's game at
              Birmingham when he watched the home side convert their controversial
              injury-time penalty from the other end of the pitch.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old was perhaps a surprise choice to take the armband at
              the start of the season but, according to Wenger, has responded to the
              responsibility manfully. Though he did not endorse the actions of
              Gallas at St Andrews, the manager give his compatriot full support.</p>
              <p>"Ideally he should not have responded like that," admitted Wenger at
              his Friday press conference. "But it was not to blame anybody.</p>
              <p>"He is a guy who is highly committed and sometimes when he goes
              overboard he can respond like that. He's an explosive one [and] when he
              is fed up, he is fed up.</p>
              <p>"We'll keep all [discussions about that] internal. We are a team who
              is the most consistent in the League and, as well, we are a team,
              because we are young, we don't know exactly how to behave to look
              really good. However we are, as well, maybe more genuine. I know
              William is not young but he has the commitment of a very young boy,
              believe me!</p>
              <p>"His leadership qualities for me are outstanding, even if on that
              occasion he used his commitment in the wrong way. You want people in
              this job who care.</p>
              <p>"What I hate the most in this job are people who are always nicey
              nice and behave well. But at the end of the day they cheat a little bit
              with their commitment. I prefer sometimes a guy who goes overboard
              without hurting anybody who cares about winning. That is William, he
              cares about winning."</p>

              <p>Manager Arsène Wenger has come out and defended captain William Gallas after the Frenchman's reaction to the draw against Birmingham City.</p>
              <p>Gallas staged a single protest in the centre circle after the final whistle, refusing to walk off with his team mates into the dressing rooms.</p>
              <p>Wenger explained: "Ideally he should not have responded like that but he was not blaming anybody.</p>
              <p>"He is a guy who is highly committed and sometimes when he goes overboard he can respond like that. He's an explosive one.</p>

              <p>Gallas kinda reminded me of Patrick Vieira. I feel he is passionate about the club n the reason why he is upset.</p>
