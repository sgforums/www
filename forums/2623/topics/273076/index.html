            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reason for optimism</span></strong><br><br>The capture of Eduardo da Silva may have raised a few eyebrows but Wenger has an excellent record of unearthing gems.<br><br>The Brazilian-born Croatian has plundered goals for Dinamo Zagreb over the last couple of seasons and, though the Premier League is a huge step-up, his finishing ability could prove invaluable to a side that has struggled to put away chances.<br><br>With Henry and Robin van Persie injured last season Arsenal were lacking a bona fide predator up front, but da Silva could still struggle to get in Wenger's first-choice XI.<br><br>Emmanuel Adebayor showed last season that while he may lack consistency he can be inspirational as well as frustrating, and the Togo international is likely to play a major role.<br><br>However, leading the Arsenal line will be Van Persie, a player who few in the Premier League can rival in terms of skill and whose performances in pre-season suggest is better than ever.<br><br>At the other end of the pitch Arsenal have been more suspect than spectacular in recent years, but the arrival of Bakari Sagna from Auxerre gives the defence a more solid look.<br><br>With Sagna at right-back, William Gallas and Kolo Toure in the centre and the exciting Gael Clichy on the left, the back-line also has the right mix of athleticism and power.<br><br>Barring injuries, Emmanuel Eboue may find himself playing on the right wing more often than in defence, but competition for places in midfield will be equally intense.<br><br>Cesc Fabregas and Gilberto are certain starters in the centre and Alexander Hleb and Tomas Rosicky have also slotted seamlessly into the Arsenal side.<br><br>However, Wenger must find a way to get more goals from his midfield, a puzzle he has struggled to solve since Ljungberg and Robert Pires were firing on all cylinders during the days of 'the invincibles'.<br><br>Wenger has a collection of young players at his disposal who remain unproven but are full of promise, such as Abou Diaby, Denilson, Armand Traore and Nicklas Bendtner.<br><br>Theo Walcott is bound to attract more attention than any of the other youngsters and his pace will prove a useful weapon in the latter stages of matches, even if he is not likely to start regularly in the Premier League.<br><br><strong>Ready to upset the odds</strong><br><br>Arsenal may lack the experience to quite last the course in the title race, but Wenger will be hoping his side can spring one or two surprises.<br><br>The Gunners have dropped points in recent years because they have been unable to break down the stubborn resistance of so-called weaker sides who only set their stall out to defend.<br><br>Opponents will no longer fear Arsenal quite as much without Henry, which could turn out to be a positive if they are given the freedom to play their passing game.<br><br>Wenger would also have the option of adding to his squad in the January transfer window to propel Arsenal to a top four finish.<br><br>So although Henry has departed, Arsenal are still firm favourites to qualify for the UEFA Champions League once again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Predicted position:</strong> 4th<br><br><strong>Star man:</strong> Cesc Fabregas - Keeping hold of the young Spaniard this summer even though he had talks with Real Madrid was crucial. He is improving every year and has the quality to inspire Arsenal's young guns to a greater level.<br><br><strong>One to watch:</strong> Abou Diaby: Wenger has been looking for the next Patrick Vieira for years and Diaby may be ready to take up the mantle. Strong, dynamic and comfortable on the ball, the Frenchman is likely to be one of the best young midfielders in the league this season.<br><br><strong>Manager:</strong> Arsene Wenger: Rumours abound about Wenger's future but he will be hoping to mould at least one more great Arsenal team before moving on.<br><br><strong>Ins:</strong> Eduardo da Silva (Dinamo Zagreb), Lukasz Fabianski (Legia Warsaw), Havard Nordveit (Haugesund), Bakari Sagna (Auxerre)<br><br><strong>Outs:</strong> Jeremie Aliadiere (Middlesbrough), Thierry Henry (Barcelona), Mart Poom (Watford), Arturo Lupoli (Fiorentina), Fabrice Muamba (Birmingham), Freddie Ljungberg (West Ham), Jose Antonio Reyes (Atletico Madrid)<br><br><strong>Best signing:</strong> Eduardo da Silva<br><br><strong>Likely top scorer:</strong> Robin van Persie<br><br><strong>Possible best XI</strong> (Lehmann, Sagna, Toure, Gallas, Clichy, Hleb, Fabregas, Gilberto, Rosicky, Adebayor, van Persie)</div>
