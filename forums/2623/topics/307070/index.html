              <p>Arsène Wenger is open-minded about the idea of Premier League clubs
              playing a competitive game overseas in the future - as long as it is
              for the good of the game and not just for money.</p>
              <p>The idea was first mooted on Thursday and immediately brought
              condemnation from various sections of the football fraternity. The
              Arsenal manager wants to know much more detail about the proposals
              before he comes down for or against. However, speaking at his press
              conference on Friday, he refused to dismiss the notion without further
              examination.</p>
              <p>"By principle, I am not against innovation," he said. "And I like
              that somebody is thinking 'how can we promote the League and promote
              English football?'</p>
              <p>"But you have to respect basic criteria - the competitiveness of our
              League, the fairness of our League, and, as well make sure that it is a
              promotion for our football.</p>
              <p>"If it's just to make £5m or £6m more then it's not worth doing. We
              have to check that it is really to give something competitive to the
              rest of the world, not just a chance to make a few more millions
              because that will go into the wages straight away and it will all be
              equal again. It's not worth doing it only for money.</p>
              <p>"Having said that, it deserves a deeper look into because it's not a
              decision, and you have to think forward always. We are, at the moment,
              certainly creating a new fan-base. <br> <br>"What you can say at the
              moment is that 10 per cent of our fans have access to our competitive
              games, and 90 per cent have no access at all to competitive games.<br> <br>"Do
              you want to give them something? I can agree with that idea. But is
              this the best way to do it? That has to be checked because I am not
              completely sure."</p>
