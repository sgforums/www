I am happy that people think we can win it but thinking is different from doing it Â— and I know we can do it.<br><br>Â“It will be very difficult because there are other teams like Chelsea, Man United and Liverpool who have all got good chances of winning the title.<br><br>Â“So we have to fight as we have done from the start of the season and then if we concentrate and listen to our great manager we are sure we can do it.<br><br>Â“All credit must go to the boss Arsene Wenger. I must say that even the players thought the season would be difficult for us because Thierry Henry was the key player who motivated us and gave us encouragement.<br><br>Â“Wenger advised us to just enjoy ourselves on the pitch and do a good job to prove to people that we can stand on our own without Henry.<br><br>Â“This idea and mentality is what has carried us through this season so far.<br><br>Â“We share the responsibility of HenryÂ’s absence on each and every playerÂ’s head as we advise each other and encourage each other.<br><br>Â“We miss Henry and regardless of what happened he is a big player and a big brother to us.Â”</div>
