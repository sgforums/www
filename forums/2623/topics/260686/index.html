            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">ArsÃ¨ne Wenger is confident his young side will deliver on their potential next season.<br><br>Arsenal endured a difficult campaign last term. Although they safely secured a Champions League place, WengerÂ’s men were never truly in the hunt for the top two trophies.<br><br>The nearest they came to silverware was the Carling Cup when a youthful side took the lead against Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium before being overhauled late on.<br><br>The tournament was widely seen as a success for WengerÂ’s fledglings and the Frenchman is backing those youngsters to deliver in the major competitions next season.<br><br>Speaking on ArsenalÂ’s season review DVD, out today, the manager said: Â“The potential [of these players is] as good as any weÂ’ve had until now. And those players have made big history here.<br><br>Â“But you know that potential is one thing, to transform that into a big career means as well being able to improve and focus every day. ThatÂ’s the target of this young squad; not only to promise but deliver, and IÂ’m confident they will. IÂ’m 100 per cent behind this team and I believe they can deliver next season.Â”<br><br>The 2006/07 campaign was dominated by the switch to Emirates Stadium. A trophy-laden 93 years at Highbury is hard to forget but, according to Wenger, the move has been as smooth as it was necessary.<br><br>Â“Anybody who came to Highbury said to me after the game, Â‘thank you very much for the invitation we had a marvellous dayÂ’,Â” he commented. Â“It goes on again now with the Emirates in a different style because it is, of course, massive and thereÂ’s more comfort.<br><br>"You lose a little bit that kind of compact atmosphere that you get still at Anfield when you look at Liverpool versus Chelsea but on the other hand it has such a huge potential for the Club to develop to a top level that is needed. It was needed and itÂ’s fantastic.Â”</span></div>
