              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Roma's Max Tonetto has apologised after his missed penalty sent Arsenal into the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League. </strong></p>
              <p>The Italian side forced a shoot-out in the second leg
              of their tie after Juan's early goal earned them a 1-0 victory on the
              night and a 1-1 draw on aggregate.</p>
              <p>Eduardo and Mirko Vucinic both
              had penalties saved before Arsenal won in sudden death as Tonetto
              blazed his effort over the crossbar.</p>
              <p>Tonetto feels Roma were unlucky to be eliminated from the competition and has said sorry to the fans for his crucial mistake.</p>
              <p>"I'm really gutted that I missed the penalty but penalties are always a lottery and that's how it goes," he said.</p>
              <p>"I
              want to apologise to everyone because we really wanted to progress. In
              the opening leg, Arsenal deserved the win but tonight, we deserved to
              go through.</p>
              <p>"It's very painful, this defeat, especially when it comes to penalties.</p>
              <p>"Now we just have to focus on the domestic competition and hope to return to the Champions League next season."</p>
              <p>Roma
              face a battle to qualify for next season's Champions League as they are
              currently one point behind fourth-placed Fiorentina in Serie A.</p>

              is believed to have been stabbed after his minibus was attacked by Roma
              fans before Wednesday's UEFA Champions League tie. </strong></p>
              <p>The minibus in which the fan was travelling is
              understood to have lost its way en route to the Stadio Olimpico for the
              second leg encounter.</p>
              <p>Roma fans started to attack the vehicle before one is alleged to have got on to the bus when the situation escalated.</p>
              <p>The victim was able to watch the game, which Arsenal won in a dramatic penalty shoot-out, after receiving medical care.</p>
              <h4>Fight</h4>
              <p>A British Embassy spokesman said: "One managed to get on to the bus and there was a fight.</p>
              <p>"The driver managed to get away when the Roma fan was pushed out of the bus."</p>
              <p>He added: "We don't know if it was a stabbing or glass from a smashed window."</p>
              <p>An Arsenal spokeswoman said: "A male Arsenal fan was believed to be stabbed outside the stadium.</p>
              <p>"Roma fans threw stones at a bus, smashing windows, and an individual allegedly entered the bus and stabbed a fan."</p>
              <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are aware of the incident that happened in Italy and we are providing consular assistance."</p>
              <p>The
              incident could again raise questions over Rome's ability to stage this
              season's Champions League final in May at the Stadio Olimpico.</p>

              <h1>Arsenal's Theo Walcott Reveals Penalty Education</h1>
              <p>Two legs and extra-time was not enough to separate the fifth-placed
              Premier League side from the sixth-placed Serie A team, but Arsenal
              eventually edged Roma after eight rounds of penalties.<br><br>One of
              Arsenal's converters, Theo Walcott, has today revealed that he took
              inspiration from a former team-mate at Southampton, as mind-games can
              play a key part in the outcome of a spot-kick, so Walcott refused to
              eye-ball opposition glovesman, Doni.<br><br>"I had a dry throat going
              towards the goal but I didn't look at the goalkeeper once," Walcott is
              quoted by the club's official website as saying. "I learned that from
              James Beattie. <br><br>"He's probably one of the best penalty takers I
              have seen. I have watched him over the years and mine wasn't as good a
              penalty as his but they all count. <br><br>"I didn't want the
              goalkeeper to make eye contact with me because sometimes they might put
              you off a little bit. Plus he was a big lad. It's all about positive
              thinking and it counted in the end.<br><br>"To be fair, it was a really good experience for me. It was the first penalty shoot-out I have ever done."<br><br>The
              England international - who scored a famous hat-trick against Croatia
              towards the end of last year - also added that the Arsenal camp had not
              been practicing penalties prior to the knock-out clash.<br><br>"To do
              it on penalties for such a young team who haven't experienced that, it
              just shows the character we have got in the whole side.<br><br>"I
              didn't expect to take the third penalty but the boss has faith in all
              of us. That definitely showed in the penalty takers tonight. He told me
              I was third and I am not going to say no. I just wanted to get up there
              and see what would happen.<br><br>"We didn't practice them at all - we
              thought we could get the result. But it doesn't matter how they go in
              and it was like we had just won the World Cup Final in the dressing
              room after the game.<br><br>"The atmosphere was brilliant," he added.
              "Even though there are all sorts of nationalities in there, we all get
              along and we are like a family in there. <br><br>"It's just a brilliant bunch of lads to play with," he concluded.</p>
