              <h1>Player Ratings: Arsenal 1-0 West Bromwich Albion</h1>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>Arsenal</em></strong></span><br><strong><br>Almunia - 7:</strong> Relatively untested, but looked solid whenever called into action and his kicking was accurate.<br><strong><br>Sagna - 7:</strong> Started this season where he left off the last. Rock solid in defence
              and always a decent outlet going forward. Could have perhaps slightly
              improved his crossing.<br><strong><br>Djourou - 6.5:</strong> Deputised well
              enough for Kolo Toure, though he was caught napping and almost allowed
              Ishmael Miller to equalise in the second half, only to immediately make
              amends by making a goal line clearance from Do-Heon Kim.<br><strong><br>Gallas - 7:</strong> The captain fared well in what was a reasonably comfortable outing.
              Looked assured in defence, though not quite as sharp as he would have
              liked. Crashed an incredible effort off the post from almost 40 yards
              early on.<br><strong><br>Clichy - 8.5:</strong> Man of the Match. Tireless down
              the left hand side, unbeatable at the back and provided endless
              goal-scoring opportunities when going forward.<br><strong><br>Walcott - 6.5:</strong> Was kept fairly quiet for large parts of the game as Arsenal generally
              preferred to attack down their left hand side. Did not manage to hit
              anything resembling top gear as he occasionally did in pre-season.<br><strong><br>Eboue - 5:</strong> No matter where he is played these days, the Cote d'Ivoire
              international cannot make it happen for the Gunners. Had a fairly
              simple job of protecting the back four in midfield, which he did to
              decent effect, but was very wasteful in possession.<br><strong><br>Denilson - 7.5:</strong> Had a marvellous first half and was central to all the Gunners' quality
              offensive play. It was when the hosts were at their best and the
              Brazilian deputised admirably for Cesc Fabregas.<br><strong><br>Nasri - 8:</strong> A goal on competitive debut - can you ask for much more? He looked very
              lively all afternoon. Defied his critics as he had the physical fight
              in him to stand his ground and even tracking back to retrieve
              possession. Took his goal well, slotted seamlessly into the Wenger
              philosophy of football and enjoyed a somewhat free roaming position in
              left wing. No Hleb, no problem.<br><strong><br>Bendtner: 6.5:</strong> Like
              Walcott, was by and large bypassed for much of Arsenal's best moves and
              somewhat isolated at times. Put in a neat and tidy performance, but did
              not impose himself on the game as he has in pre-season.<br><strong><br>Adebayor - 7.5:</strong> A relentless performance. Acted as a creator far more than he did a
              scorer this afternoon, hovering on the left hand side and constantly
              looking to power past his man and put balls into the box. Cannot be
              faulted for his work rate or creativity, but could have perhaps gotten
              himself into better goal-scoring positions more often, considering
              Arsenal's dominance.<br><br>Substitutes:<br><br>Van Persie - 5: Very wasteful during his brief showing as a substitute. Wayward shooting and inaccurate passing.<br><br>Toure - 6: Made a fleeting appearance and looked full of energy playing in an advanced role on the right hand side.</p>
