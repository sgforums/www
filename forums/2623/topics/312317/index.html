              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">ARSENAL players are angry with skipper William Gallas for his criticism of 
              Theo Walcott and his Birmingham sit-in.</p>
              <p class="article">And some believe it has contributed to the Gunners’ slide in the Premier 
              League title challenge.</p>
              <p class="article">SunSport revealed how Gallas attacked winger Walcott, 19, for being “too 
              predictable”.</p>
              <p class="article">His criticism came on the back of his bizarre tantrum at St Andrew’s, where he 
              sat crying in the opposition half after the final whistle, following a late 
              Brum penalty which cost his side two points.</p>
              <p class="article">A further three draws and a defeat at Chelsea have followed — leaving Arsene 
              Wenger’s men in third, six points adrift of Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="article">One Arsenal star’s representative said: “William has not behaved the way a 
              captain should and has lost respect among some of the players.</p>
              <p class="article">“He went round all of them in front of the cameras before the Chelsea game 
              trying to gee them up but some think it was a bit phoney.”</p>
              <p class="article">Gallas, 30, is refusing to throw in the towel as far as the title race is 
              concerned. The French defender said: “It will be difficult for us to come 
              back — but we have to.</p>
              <p class="article">“We must play until the end of the season and then see.</p>
              <p class="article">“Maybe United can drop some points because of the Champions League.</p>
              <p class="article">“They can be tired, Chelsea too.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have to give everything until the end.</p>
              <p class="article">“Why do we have to be down? Football is like this. Sometimes you are angry, 
              sometimes you are not angry.</p>
              <p class="article">“You never know, you can be back. They can lose some points.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have to be ready for the next game and do not give up.</p>
              <p class="article">“We can still win it. It is not finished yet so we have to believe.”</p>

              <p>Read somewhere that Flamini may most likely leave and join AC Milan as a free agent when his contract runs out in June cos Arsenal's offer will not exceed £50,000 a week and Milan are understood to be willing to offer more and a substantial signing-on fee.</p>
              <p>Wenger says he is confident that Flamini will stay. But the much-improved midfielder look increasingly likely to leave...</p>

              <p>Its because he wanted to make Gallas happy and also because Wenger didn't have any more plans for Gilberto after this season as he already had Flamini, Diaby and back then Diarra in the position, so i guess he wanted continuity rather then to keep changing captains and thought that Gallas with all his experience would be a good choice since he was 2nd vice captain back in Chelsea.</p>

              <p>And after he left Chelsea, nobody will know whether he threatened to score own goals or get himself sent off, sure he was angry with the management but when he went to Arsenal, he immediately gave disrespect to the Chelsea fans who supported him throughout his time.</p>
              <p>He could have left it at the management level, but no, he even brought it down to the fans. If he had followed Gujohnson who came back to a standing ovation and even got applause when he scored against us then fine, but he chose to be a Judas.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="http://arsenal-mania.com/articles/3105232/Wenger-William-has-my-full-support.html">Wenger: William has my full support</a></strong></p>
              <p>Manager Arsène Wenger has defended captain William Gallas and his style of leadership on and off the pitch.</p>
              <p>The former Chelsea defender was a surprise choice for many when he was chosen to be made captain at the start of the season, and has come under fire for a public display of emotion in recent games.</p>
              <p>Gallas has also come under fire in the English press for apparently criticising Theo Walcott, and saying that he has no friends at Arsenal, comments which obviously have been misconstrued.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: "I believe he had not the best of performances on Sunday, and he would be the first to agree with that, but I don't question his leadership nor his position in the team.</p>
              <p>"You have the same William Gallas - and the same people said it was a good choice to make him captain when we were five points ahead, and you have not to go too much overboard.</p>
              <p>"He said Walcott could be the next Wayne Rooney, but he has to work. What is wrong with that? You want at 18 years of age to not work? It's unbelievable.</p>
              <p>"I read it really carefully, it didn't say anything wrong on that. After the way it has been turned, yes.</p>
              <p>"If you want to win the World Cup you have to accept that your players are highly exposed, you have to accept that you have to work.</p>
              <p>"Is it an insult to say somebody has to work? I don't know, I don't think so.</p>
              <p>"I believe at the moment when you don't go well, everybody is analysed a little bit more, with scrutiny.</p>
              <p>"But what we want to do is perform well as a team again and we know we can do that.</p>
              <p>"And on Sunday, for example, we played okay, but we have to improve. Recently what punished us a lot is that defensively we have made big mistakes.</p>
              <p>"William has my full support and my full backing and I am completely behind him, and behind the team as well.</p>
              <p>"We are going through a bad patch, I agree with you, but we want to come back and win the games again that we can win."</p>
