              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger admits he is surprised
              that his side have a five-point cushion at the top of the Premier
              League table.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Gunners beat Blackburn 2-0 on Monday to extend their lead but Wenger said: "There is still a long way to go. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"We didn't expect to be where we are after this weekend. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"But it is important to keep some humility. This league
              is very tight - on the day you are not at your best, you can lose to
              anybody."
               </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Manchester United's shock defeat by neighbours
              Manchester City on Sunday was a boost to Arsenal's title hopes, which
              were also helped by Chelsea being held by Liverpool. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Gunners were not at their best for long periods against Rovers but still triumphed and Wenger was happy with the outcome. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"It was a very good weekend for us," Wenger added. "But
              we were a bit under pressure to take advantage of the situation after
              what happened on Sunday." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"We had a great start and for the first 20 minutes we were outstanding. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"When we dropped the pace a little, Blackburn came into
              it. But we produced a good defensive performance and they did not
              create many chances." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It leaves Arsenal in pole position with 12 games to go as they look to secure their first title since 2004. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And Wenger is determined not to let that advantage slip away. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"We are in a good position," he explained. "We believe
              we can do it - we always had the belief from the first day," Wenger
              added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"It's far from being over. We'll have to fight until the
              last minute of the championship. We still have a hard games ahead of
              us." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rovers boss Mark Hughes felt his side acquitted themselves well against the leaders, despite their defeat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> "I was really pleased with how we went about our job," Hughes said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"Not many teams can come to the Emirates and take Arsenal on in a passing game and we certainly did that. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"I certainly don't think we deserved a two-goal difference. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"We tried to ask questions of a very good side and, on
              another night, one of the number of opportunities we created in that
              first half might have been converted." </span></p>

              <p><br>i think it's bolton. we will not face blackburn anymore. these 4 teams r the tougher of 12 matches.</p>
              <p>n let's not forget what happen if we win manu tonite plus winning milan for the coming ucl matches. who our opponents might be r also a factor for title challenge. my only hope we will not pick those toughest teams like chelsea or liverpool.</p>
