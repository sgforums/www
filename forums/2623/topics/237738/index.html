Arsenal won that game at the Millennium Stadium 3-0 with goals from Robert Pires and a brace from Robin van Persie </blockquote><blockquote>Arsenal have never lost a home game to Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup. Arsenal have won on each of the three previous occasions. </blockquote><blockquote>Arsenal have won the FA Cup 10 times to Blackburn Rovers' six. Rovers last FA Cup win came way back in 1928 when they defeated Arsenal in the Semi Final.  </blockquote><blockquote>Blackburn will be the third top-flight team that Arsenal have drawn in this season's competition.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wenger vows to rotate his side for Blackburn Cup tie</strong><br><br>Arsene Wenger has vowed to rotate his side Â“as much he canÂ” for the visit of Blackburn in the FA Cup Fifth Round on Saturday.<br><br>The Arsenal manager omitted Jens Lehmann, Thierry Henry and Cesc Fabregas for the Fourth Round replay at Bolton on Wednesday night yet still went through with a wonderful 3-1 win after extra time.<br><br>Next week, the Frenchman takes his team back into European competition and to Cardiff for the Carling Cup Final. Therefore it is no surprise to see him shuffling his pack on Saturday.<br><br>Â“I will rotate as much as I can,Â” Wenger told Arsenal TV Online on Thursday. Â“I rested a few players at Bolton and some of them will come in.<br><br>Â“I am rotating for two reasons. Firstly we played extra time up there and the space is very short between Wednesday night and Saturday morning. Secondly we have a massive game on Tuesday night [at PSV].<br><br>Â“But what the Carling Cup has taught us is that we can rotate now. They are all up to the level and that is fantastic information for the Club.Â”<br><br>Johan Djourou picked up a knee injury at Bolton and will be out in the short-term. Alex Hleb has a hamstring niggle but Philippe Senderos will be available after suspension.<br><br>Â“Djourou will be out,Â” said Wenger. Â“He has a knee problem. But he will not be out for a longer period maybe only two or three days.<br><br>Â“Alex Hleb has a tight hamstring. I played him for longer than I wanted to last night. He may need a little rest but it should not be a problem for TuesdayÂ’s game. I will decide about that on Friday.Â”<br><br>Arsenal TV Online will have the full interview with ArsÃ¨ne Wenger on Friday morning. In it the Frenchman discusses: the win at Bolton, the emergence of Denilson, finally winning at Bolton, the 6-2 win over Blackburn in December and the new faces in the Rovers side.<br><br></div>
