            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia has denied telling Fabio Capello he wants to play for England, but admitted he might be interested in switching international allegiance.</strong><br><br>Reports in Italian daily La Gazzetta dello Sport claimed Spaniard Almunia had informed England manager Capello that he is ready to take up British citizenship immediately in a bid to be eligible for selection.<br><br>However, Almunia, who will qualify for a British passport at the end of the year, believes talk of him representing England is still premature.<br><br>"There's a lot lacking for this to happen," he told AS.<br><br>"You need to have been here five years, and I've spent four here. I will think about it if it happens.<br><br>"They've said that I have publicly commented that I was going to start the process of becoming an England national, but I never said anything about that and neither have I announced anything to the Italian media.<br><br>"[The media] talk about me being called up a lot because England didn't reach the European Championships, but I haven't heard anything."<br><br>Almunia still hopes to turn out for the country of his birth but accepts that he owes a lot to England and could be tempted to switch allegiance in a bid to play at the 2010 World Cup.<br><br>"I would prefer to hear the Spanish anthem than the England one," he admitted.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patriotism out of fashion</span></strong><br><br>"But it's also true that the time of patriotism and really feeling a national anthem has somewhat gone out of fashion.<br><br>"It matters more what you owe a country or the people of that country.<br><br>"I owe everything to Spain on a personal level but professionally I can't put a price on what has happened to me in England.<br><br>"Moreover, there is little possibility of playing for Spain. So although I would love to put on the Spanish shirt, I feel the same about playing in the World Cup."<br><br>Paul Robinson and Scott Carson both made costly mistakes during England's Euro 2008 qualifying campaign but Almunia does not believe he would be an automatic choice for Capello's squad.<br><br>"The level of goalkeepers isn't bad," he said. "Perhaps there are more mistakes and it's true that they work less on their technique than in Spain.<br><br>"But the pressure for a goalkeeper here is enormous because [the media] talk a lot about any errors."</div>
