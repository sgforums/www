            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"> Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has hit out at France's national side after confirming earlier on Tuesday that star striker Thierry Henry's season was over.<br><br>Henry emerged off the bench in The Gunners' recent UEFA Champions League clash with PSV Eindhoven, but finished the game with groin and stomach injuries.<br><br>Wenger believes France rushed Henry into action too quickly following his exploits in last summer's World Cup finals in Germany.<br><br>"He is paying the price of success," said Wenger. "I feel he has been badly managed after the World Cup by the French football team.<br><br>"I take responsibility for all the rest, but not for what I have not done. After the World Cup final on July 9, I gave him a holiday until August 4.<br><br>"Then he came back, we prepared him, I left him out of the Champions League qualifier in Zagreb, they called him up for the game on August 16 - less than 14 days after he came back - and they played him in the whole game against Bosnia. It was a friendly.<br><br>"After he had played in the World Cup final - why do they need to play him in the whole game?"<br><br>Meanwhile, Wenger has lamented Arsenal's below-par season and is unhappy the North Londoners have failed to win silverware in their first year at the Emirates.<br><br>"You will look back and think you cannot be completely happy because you do not win everything," said Wenger.<br><br>"Maybe in the future we will look back at this season and think that is where we built a real team for the future. That is what I hope.<br><br>"I also believe that we have never produced so many consistent performances over a season.<br><br>"But I feel in the end it is difficult to take because we have played 17 games over December and January, which caught up with us a bit physically in February - especially the two FA Cup replays.<br><br>"They killed us a bit for the Champions League, combined with the fact that we had so many players out. It was all a bit too much."</span></div>
