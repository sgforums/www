              <p>To be honest this season we were so close to almost everythin. League cup,Epl and CL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>League cup? AW fielded an inexperience team against sp*rs which got us trashed by them.He should have mix it around with some senior players. Sp*rs are absolute rubbish but they do need something to prove this season.</p>
              <p>FA cup,tbh we gave no passion to this cup.It was embarassing actually.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EPL. We were so close to winning it. We were robbed by injuries and to be honest,some clear penalty decisions but the refs rule it out and also our end product was average. We cant keep playing in the centre. We should try to play on the wings to at times if a team begins to "park bus".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>UCL. We were seriously robbed. We were so close to go through to the semi but babel must have wank before entering the pitch that was why he fell down so easily while a strong challenge on hleb on the first leg was "nothing".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sadly,for 3 seasons in a row,we've won nothing. Luck plays apart sometimes imo.Our players do have the quality,but we need at least one or two more quality players in the position we needed like the left wing position.. We don't need superstars like Ribery or trezeguet or quaresma.Look at eduardo and sagna for instance. Who the fuck were they when they first joined Arsenal? But look,they all showed signs of quality players.</p>
              <p>And lastly,I hope AW don't field out the wrong people.For instance Eboue instead of walcott. But who knows Eboue might impress us next season just like how fla-money did this season.</p>

              <p>how many of our players still baby? bendtner 20, traore 19, walcot 19. below adult age of 21. the rest? all above 21 years right? so what does it mean? adult age already right, cock got hair right? and wenger still using young as excuse for failure to win trophies?</p>

              <p><br>League cup is not meant for a club like arsenal. but if we cant win the champions league or epl, win league cup or carling cup better than nothing. but in the end, wenger put out a pussy team and expect to rape spurs?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EPL, dont blame dudu. nobody wanted this incident to happen. blame complacency. trying to create a miracle winning the league with "youngsters", create news like our 49match unbeaten and winning the epl. thats why no back up transfers in the summer.  n on a neutral point of view, our 49match unbeaten streak had dubious ref decisions that favored us in certain matches i believe.</p>
              <p>champions league, yes we were robbed. but blame ourselves for failing to convert the chances at emirates. bendtner blocking the goal for example. refs r not perfect they will make mistakes. if lets say arsenal and liverpool reverse roles, you think we will say that liverpool unlucky, blame ref, blame youth, blame inexperience, blame injuries?</p>

              <p>as such the definition of young cant be used as an excuse anymore. if 3 seasons ago, young i can agree. now fast forward 3 seasons, cock and armpit more hair and still young?</p>

              <p><em>To be honest this season we were so close to almost everythin. League cup,Epl and CL.</em></p>
              <p><em>League cup? AW fielded an inexperience team against sp*rs which got us trashed by them.He should have mix it around with some senior players. Sp*rs are absolute rubbish but they do need something to prove this season.</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Actually no use win league cup.... wenger used it for youth squad to gain experience so its ok to field reserves n lose...</span></p>
              <p><em>FA cup,tbh we gave no passion to this cup.It was embarassing actually</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">fa cup is another time to field reserves in early stage... ok not to win la...</span></p>
              <p><em>EPL. We were so close to winning it. We were robbed by injuries and to be honest,some clear penalty decisions but the refs rule it out and also our end product was average. We cant keep playing in the centre. We should try to play on the wings to at times if a team begins to "park bus".</em></p>
              <p><em>UCL. We were seriously robbed. We were so close to go through to the semi but babel must have wank before entering the pitch that was why he fell down so easily while a strong challenge on hleb on the first leg was "nothing".</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">epl- alot of factor... luck, ref, wenger, the team... many times ref is against gunners... y? duno..... wenger must oso take the blame cos he was the one who fielded ppl like diaby n eboue in the wings when they clearly not suited there... then not bringing in help when they should've brought in... tactics too... 4-5-1 is definitely not a gd formation to play all season if u got a f-up striker... he could've played 2man attack in games and score early to avoid all the last minute rush which ended in draws... tat caused alot of points... during x'mas period lots of points were dropped and this could've helped in securing the title early... of course the team oso should take the responsibility... many games concentration were not 100% n were made to pay... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">ucl- ref caused the team ucl semi spot.... all can say is pure kelong in the pool match...  but anyway got feeling when comes semi we might lose to chelsea too cos chelsea is ahead in terms of quality n depth in squad... </span></p>
              <p><em>Sadly,for 3 seasons in a row,we've won nothing. Luck plays apart sometimes imo.Our players do have the quality,but we need at least one or two more quality players in the position we needed like the left wing position.. We don't need superstars like Ribery or trezeguet or quaresma.Look at eduardo and sagna for instance. Who the fuck were they when they first joined Arsenal? But look,they all showed signs of quality players.</em></p>
              <p><em>And lastly,I hope AW don't field out the wrong people.For instance Eboue instead of walcott. But who knows Eboue might impress us next season just like how fla-money did this season.</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">yes 3 season nothing is sad... and hope wenger dun disappoint fans for another season... i will prefer a star player comes as this is to give the players more confidence and settle players like fabregas n walcott...  jz hope he stop playing wacko jacko n hv more ambition... if he win ucl he field all the youngsters if he wan but not when he hvnt achieve the top yet... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">nah eboue cmi as a attacker... him holding onto the ball only scares his own fans... he oso cannot shoot properly... no attacking flair oso... so hope wenger will jz return him to rightback or support sagna at bench... </span></p>

              <p><br>League cup is not meant for a club like arsenal. but if we cant win the champions league or epl, win league cup or carling cup better than nothing. but in the end, wenger put out a pussy team and expect to rape spurs?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EPL, dont blame dudu. nobody wanted this incident to happen. blame complacency. trying to create a miracle winning the league with "youngsters", create news like our 49match unbeaten and winning the epl. thats why no back up transfers in the summer.  n on a neutral point of view, our 49match unbeaten streak had dubious ref decisions that favored us in certain matches i believe.</p>
              <p>champions league, yes we were robbed. but blame ourselves for failing to convert the chances at emirates. bendtner blocking the goal for example. refs r not perfect they will make mistakes. if lets say arsenal and liverpool reverse roles, you think we will say that liverpool unlucky, blame ref, blame youth, blame inexperience, blame injuries?</p>

              <p><br>faggotson always ensure referee is at his corner. how many time he complain about official n get let off easily? n some referee got punish just becos they were against manure decision.</p>
              <p>it is very seldom wenger will complain bout referee cos almost every small teams like wigan, west ham, aston villa, blackburn r against us. when we complain, chance is pple will label us as sore losers or disrespect to referee.</p>
              <p>no choice, we r make of foreigners n dat damn good! n not forget eduardo destroy england chance of getting in euro campaign.</p>

              <p>I wouldnt say our team is young. Lacks experience.They need a reliable captain also. Gallas is only "a good encourager" infront of the cameras if you noticed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believed this season we improved much better than last two seasons. I still stand my firm that luck plays apart in this season.We were seriously unlucky. I think complacency too destroyed us. How many times did we need to find a goal or more in the last few mins? The players now need to take advantage to what is given to them.</p>
