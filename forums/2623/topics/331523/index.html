                                  Wenger admits he is stunned by Uefa president Michel Platini's attack
                                  on him in an interview with a French newspaper. </strong></p>
              <p>Platini, the head of European football's governing
                                  body, fired a couple of broadsides at the Arsenal manager during a
                                  frank interview with Grenoble daily Dauphine Libere.</p>
              <p>The former France international slammed Wenger for having a business mentality rather than a football one.</p>
              <p>And
                                  he also tore into the Gunners boss for calling for the introduction of
                                  video replays to rule on questionable refereeing decisions.</p>
              <p>Wenger has been taken aback by Platini's criticisms.</p>
              <h4>Stunned</h4>
              "I am stunned by the aggressive content of Platini's words," Wenger told <em>L'Equipe.</em>"I
                                  am effectively a supporter of video assistance for referees, like all
                                  coaches, and I believe Uefa have an important role to play in this.
              <p>"I am for sporting justice and Uefa must be the guarantor of it."</p>
              <p>Wenger added: "I am a supporter of good management of clubs, for financial equilibrium.</p>
              <p>"And Uefa must equally support this idea. I am fighting for the future of the game and of football.</p>
              <p>"I don't see why Uefa should take umbrage at ideas that are different from their own."</p>
              <p>In
                                  Platini's interview with Dauphine Libere, Wenger's name was raised
                                  during a question about the introduction of video technology.</p>
              <h5>Blast</h5>
              Platini replied: "I like to talk about football, him (Wenger) about business. We must stop with Wenger and all that."
              <p>Platini
                                  then said he hoped video assistance would never come into football,
                                  adding: "It would make me happy that Arsene Wenger never sees it."</p>
              <p>Later
                                  in the interview, Platini again targeted Wenger when asked about his
                                  thoughts on Romanian side CFR Cluj's unexpected victory over Roma in
                                  the UEFA Champions League last week.</p>
              <p>"That is what makes football
                                  so great," Platini said. "It is what people like Wenger do not want,
                                  little clubs beating the big clubs, because they want their business."</p>

              <p>The League Managers' Association have jumped to the defence of Arsene Wenger in the wake of UEFA president Michel Platini's recent criticism of the Arsenal boss.</p>
              <p>Platini, in an interview with Grenoble newspaper Dauphine Libere, accused the Wenger of putting business ahead of football and admonished the Gunners boss for calling for video replays to be introduced to help referees on questionable decisions.</p>
              <p>Wenger responded yesterday, expressing shock at the ''aggressive content'' of Platini's comments and defending his own footballing views.</p>
              <p>And the LMA are firmly behind him.</p>
              <p>In a statement reacting to the row, the LMA said they were ''astonished and dismayed at the personal attack'' while their chairman, Howard Wilkinson insisted Platini's views, regardless of their content, were not expressed in the appropriate manner.</p>
              <p>''Platini has made serious and personal comments about one of football's greatest ever managers, who is also counted among our most respected members,'' said Wilkinson.</p>
              <p>''If Platini wishes to address certain issues with Arsene Wenger this would better be done privately and not in the public domain.</p>
              <p>''I believe Arsene has always acted in the best interests of the game.''</p>
              <p>LMA chief executive, Richard Bevan, added: ''There is an overwhelming majority in favour of goal-line technology among our members.</p>
              <p>''It is important that Platini does not lose touch with the current views and opinions held on technical matters within bodies such as the League Managers Association.</p>
