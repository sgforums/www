            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://d.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/ng/sp/empics/4140979"><br><br>Kolo Toure believes the feeling of 'togetherness' within the squad under "maestro" captain William Gallas can make a crucial difference in Arsenal's title challenge this season.<br><br>The Gunners opened up a four-point advantage at the top of the Barclays Premier League following Wednesday night's 1-1 draw at Newcastle, where they came under severe pressure for long spells.<br><br>Manager Arsene Wenger accepted his side - who took an early lead through Emmanuel Adebayor - did not find their "usual game" as the hosts rallied in the second half.<br><br>However, it was still a determined performance from Arsenal, who remain unbeaten in the Premier League this season.<br><br>Wenger takes his men back to the north east on Sunday against Middlesbrough, where injured quartet Mathieu Flamini, Alex Hleb, Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie are still not expected to feature.<br><br>Even with something of a make-shift starting XI, Toure believes the sense of unity under former Chelsea defender Gallas means Arsenal can cope with whatever is thrown at them.<br><br>"We are defending a lot better together than last season. That's the key," declared the Ivory Coast centre-half.<br><br>"It is a collective thing. In any team you have a maestro and at the moment William is doing that job. He is the captain and is leading us really well.<br><br>"With all the experience he has got, we try to listen to him. He is 30, has played a lot of games and has won a lot of trophies as well - but the main thing is that we work together. We all try to help each other."<br><br>Toure added: "In a game when you are a little bit tired or a little bit weak, you have your friend to help you or say to you, 'come on you can make it'. We all say that to each other.<br><br>"As a person it gives you focus from one minute in the game. When you have your friend saying, 'come back on your game, give your best, refocus', that gives you strength.<br><br>"At the moment we are doing that all together, from the keeper to the striker. That makes a big difference."<br><br>Toure, 26, feels the enforced absence of some of Wenger's key men could actually work in Arsenal's favour once they all return to fitness just in time for the hectic festive schedule.<br><br>He said: "It is good for them to rest a little bit because when they recover, they will be better for us.<br><br>"Even without Cesc and the other players we managed to get a point and that shows our team is really strong.<br><br>"We are going to need the whole squad. We all know that Christmas is really important."<br></div>
