            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/07/04/240/Lehmann1_218824.jpg"><br><br>Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff believes that Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann will soon win his battle for the number one jersey at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>Lehmann has lost his place with the Gunners after poor early season form and then Achilles and elbow injuries.<br><br>But he will be in goal for Germany today for their Euro 2008 qualifier with Wales in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.<br><br>And Bierhoff has no doubts about seeing Lehmann as Germany's last line of defence in the Welsh capital.<br><br>He said: "No coach in his right mind would leave him out. And I know he will overcome his Arsenal crisis, if you can even put it like that.<br><br>"He has been at the very top for so long, a great goalkeeper who will win his first-team place back at Arsenal.<br><br>"He has been a little tense this week because of the ongoing problem at Arsenal, but if he is nervous maybe he will use that energy to play well against Wales."<br><br>And Bierhoff was also dismissive of any problems Michael Ballack may be having at Chelsea, who have left him out of their Champions League squad for the group stages.<br><br>A Chelsea statement insisted that the decision was taken purely on fitness grounds.<br><br>Bierhoff said: "It is difficult for us to judge what is happening at Chelsea, we have obviously not had anything official from them.<br><br>"But this is a matter for the club and player only, it is not for us to get involved and I think the first thing he must do is to concentrate on getting himself fit and then he will be able to play his best football again."<br><br>Germany are expected to win in Cardiff and virtually secure their place in next summer's finals in Switzerland and Austria, but Real Madrid defender Christoph Metzelder insists that they will have to be wary of Wales skipper Craig Bellamy.<br><br>He said: "All I can remember of the last time I placed against Wales is John Hartson. He is tough. All I can say is that we both hurt a lot after that match.<br><br>"(But) I know all about Bellamy from watching him in European games and with Liverpool.<br><br>"He is not tall or physical, but he is very quick off the mark. We must be on the look-out for him all the time.<br><br>"We will have to take him out of the game if we want to reduce the danger that Wales can offer.<br><br>"Bellamy is Wales' most formidable asset and we know what he is capable of doing if we give him the chance."</div>
