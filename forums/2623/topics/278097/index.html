However, the young midfielder went on to say that he did not give the Merengues his word, instead opting to stay with Arsenal...<br><br>Arsenal midfielder Francesc Fabregas today confirmed that, over the summer, he had entertained the possibility of joining Real Madrid.<br><br>Indeed, he went so far as to take meetings with members of the Bernabeu hierarchy.<br><br>'Cesc' met with Pedrag Mijatovic, sporting director, and Ramon Calderon, club president, in July:<br><br>"We were speaking for a while, and it was going very well," said the 20 year old.<br><br>"They seem to be to be two very good, very sincere people. In truth, I'll always thank them for everything.<br><br>"They said what they needed to and, for better or for worse, I decided to stay with Arsenal."<br><br>Cesc realises that nothing is certain in football, but is so far pleased with the course that he has taken.<br><br>"We'll see how things are in the future, but for now I am one hundred percent happy with the decision that I made," he added.<br><br>Indeed, he went on to add that sometimes, these decisions cannot be taken lightly - and that lightning can sometimes strike twice.<br><br>He said, "I believe that there are certain opportunities in life, and sometimes it's necessary to grab them.<br><br>"But there are always possibilities. I'm still young. If I keep working hard - and have good luck with injuries - I have many years left.<br><br>"If I give my utmost, and continue to work, then these opportunities to come around once more."<br><br>Cesc, capped 17 times for Spain, closed by justifying his decision to stay, albeit not in the most explanatory of fashions.<br><br>"I decided to stay for my own reasons, and my family and I will live for the rest of our lives with the decision that I took. I don't know what will happen in the future.<br><br>"But I'm very happy with my decision. I don't feel I need to go back to it again after all that's happened, as we've all said what there is to say."<br><br>Cesc has been at Arsenal since 2003, when he signed on as a sixteen year old. He made his first team debut not long afterwards.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> I suspect he'll leave arsenal if arsenal nvr lift any trophy again. how sad..</span></div>
