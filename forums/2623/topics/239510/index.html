It is not a big operation but it looked to me like he can play with it."<br><br>Wenger was delighted with the 17-year-old, as he added: "It was important for Theo to produce a good performance.<br><br>"You can score a goal and not play well sometimes, but, in my opinion, he had a very good performance and scored a great goal.<br><br>"That is good for us and good news for England."</span></div>
