The goalkeeper aggravated a chronic injury during Germany's 2-1 win over England at Wembley on Wednesday, Wenger told a news conference.</strong><br><br>Wenger said: 'Jens is out and he will miss two weeks, I think. Maybe more. I don't know. He is going to see a specialist in Germany tomorrow. He had this injury before but it has got much worse.'<br><br>Wenger said Lehmann joined an injury list that included captain Frenchman William Gallas, with a groin injury, and Brazilian midfielder Emmanuel Eboue, who has an ankle injury. Wenger said Spaniard Manuel Almunia would replace Lehmann on Saturday for a fixture in which he hopes Arsenal will end City's unbeaten start to the season.<br><br>Looking ahead to City's visit to the Emirates Stadium, their first with former England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson in charge, Wenger said it was too early to say if City would be able to maintain a challenge at the top. 'It can last but we will know more after 15 games, then we will have a better idea,' he said. 'I think we have to be patient a little bit.'<br><br>He agreed that he was surprised at their confident start to the season and three straight wins. 'When you sign a lot of players, more than three or many more, then it usually takes time for them to click. But they have super-clicked and done so super-quickly as well.'</div>

Â“It was very reassuring.<br><br>Â“He is mature, he has all the attributes you need to be successful. It was a close decision about who was my No 1 keeper because of his performances last season.<br><br>Â“But Jens had the advantage of experience of having played without disappointing. He had an immaculate pre-season.Â”</div>
