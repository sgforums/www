I thought straight away I'd broken something."<br><br>But Wenger is adamant that Terry should already have been sent off himself following his wild lunge on Cesc Fabregas.<br><br>Wenger said: "I don't think he (Eboue) wanted to 'do' John Terry. He has touched him and I am really sorry that John Terry is injured but I think Terry should have been off already for that tackle (on Fabregas)."<br><br>Wenger is expecting no repeat of such scenes against neighbours Tottenham at The Emirates today, despite the clubs' bitter rivalry.<br><br>Praising Spurs's style under new manager Juande Ramos, Wenger said: "I have no suspicion that it will be bad tempered because I think Tottenham are a team like us who are at their best when they play football, not when they play on aggression."<br><br>Spurs will need to be at their best if they are to bring to an end an eightyear winless run against their oldest foes.<br><br>Indeed, in 26 derbies in which Wenger has taken charge of Arsenal, Spurs have won just once.<br><br>But, despite the odds being stacked in Arsenal's favour, Wenger concedes that, with Ramos at the Spurs helm, he faces one of his sternest derby tests to date.<br><br>Wenger said: "It looks like they have gained confidence. Playing good football is linked with confidence and the fact that they have got a new manager looks to have relieved a little bit of pressure on the players.<br><br>"They have had a good few results and that helps."<br><br>Wenger also predicted that Ramos has the ability to bring the kind of success to White Hart Lane that so many of his predecessors have failed to achieve.<br><br>He said: "They look like they have plenty of resources and Ramos has the experience and pedigree as a coach to do a good job there."</div>
