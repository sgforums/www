            <div class='col-md body'>I think the problem with Arsenal is, they rely on too many youngsters in the team... With skilful youngsters, they are great on most days but when it come to the big moments... they are still lacking in experience.<br><br>Unless Arsenal gets some fresh funding, i don't think they will be a serious title contender for the next 2 years even with the present talented youngsters they have... Cos it will still take sometime for these players to gain valuable experience.<br><br>This past 2, 3 weeks have shown that the gunners, tho play nice football... Still need experience players to get them through when the pressure is on.<br><br>If you look at chelsea, their combine midfield four Essien, Makelele, Lampard and Ballack... probably makes about $400,000 pounds put together, Arsenal's Hleb, Fabregas, Ljungberg, Denilson probably makes less than half of that...<br><br>How to compete?<br><br></div>

The gunners are a young bunch of talented footballer who will gradually rise in the next few seasons.<br><br>Also, Baptista is like Rooney. He drops deep into midfield and bulldoze his way past defenders. Adebayor is like Kanu. he holds up ball, makes smart runs into the box to get a shot. Playing these 2 players together is asking for trouble becos you have no natural finisher. You'll need Henry who can finish the job for you.<br><br>I think Wenger should think about signing a new striker. van Persie is injury-prone and you cant expect Henry to be fit all the time.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Gunners bow out in Alex show</strong><br><br>Arsenal's inability to convert chances, allied to a capacity to shoot themselves in the foot defensively, ended their European dream for another season, as a 1-1 draw with PSV Eindhoven saw them crash out of the UEFA Champions League 2-1 on aggregate.<br><br>A hugely frustrating night in the capital was dominated by PSV defender Alex who scored both goals in a contest that, just like the first leg, was dictated by an Arsenal side that has all the promise in the world but precious little of the killer instinct that separates good sides from the great.<br><br>When Alex put through his own goal in the 58th minute it looked as though Arsenal's superiority was to be rewarded but with seven minutes remaining, Arsene Wenger's side went to sleep at a free-kick and the big Brazilian was able to atone for his earlier error by heading past Jens Lehmann to send his side through.<br><br>PSV started brightly and Arsenal momentarily seemed caught off guard by their visitors' positive approach given the lack of ambition demonstrated on home soil in the first leg.<br><br>The ascendancy of Ronald Koeman's side would, though, prove short lived for when Cesc Fabregas and his teenage accomplice Denilson shrugged off the shackles of early nerves to dictate from the centre of the field, the game quickly switched to one-way traffic.<br><br>Arsenal's archetypal slick passing began to cause consternation to PSV's backline as Kolo Toure, a surprise choice at right-back, doubled up as an extra winger and began to make inroads on the overlap. It was the powerful Ivorian who had the first genuine sight of goal when after shrugging off compatriot Arouna Kone, he made strides into the area but suffered a defender's nosebleed in foreign territory, as he scooped wide of the near post.<br><br>As PSV reverted to type and began to sit back in order to counter-attack, Arsenal, as is their own wont, created a plethora of chances that all went unconverted. A heavy touch from Emmanuel Adebayor meant Fabregas' sumptuous pass did not receive the finish it deserved, while a buccaneering Toure forced Heurelho in PSV's goal to spill dangerously with a raking daisycutter from distance.<br><br>It would be an overstatement though to suggest this was vintage Arsenal, for at the back, Gilberto looked uncomfortable in an unfamiliar role and was fortunate overplaying on the edge of his own area went unpunished.<br><br>At one point in the half William Gallas had to return to the dressing room to replace a stray contact lens but perfect vision was not required to realise Arsenal were playing a dangerous game when Phillip Cocu wandered forward unattended to waste a glorious chance in heading wide.<br><br>Adebayor too headed wide as Arsenal turned the screw and as Baptista twice went close with searing volleys, the second a brilliant overhead effort, the frustration in North London was palpable. It would get worse.<br><br>After the interval PSV set out to disrupt the rhythm of the game and for more than ten minutes they were successful in their stifling, as Arsenal laboured in their exertions as they struggled for fresh impetus.<br><br>It was somewhat ironic then that the opening goal arrived in a period of frustration and even more so that it was a set-piece that proved PSV's undoing. A corner from Arsenal's right saw Adebayor get the merest of glances in front of a flapping Heurelho, leaving the otherwise imperious Alex to put through his own goal from close range.<br><br>The goal had a galvanising effect on both the players and supporters and within minutes Arsenal should have taken the lead first when Adebayor, through on goal, could only fire at an onrushing Heurelho and then when Fabregas hooked over after a slalom run from Alexander Hleb, concluded with a perfect pass into the path of his team-mate.<br><br>As Arsenal went in search of a winner inevitable gaps began to emerge behind their own back four and on a break away, Denilson was fortunate not to concede a penalty when Jefferson Farfan showed both power and pace in shrugging off Gallas before being impeded by the Brazilian.<br><br>With Arsenal battering at PSV's door almost incessantly Thierry Henry was summoned from the bench and while he did not look fully fit, he did manage to force Heurelho into a decent stop with a dipping free-kick.<br><br>His efforts were, though, to prove entirely in vain when after Hleb had needlessly conceded a free-kick next to the corner flag, Edison Mendez whipped the ball in and Alex stole in front of his marker to conclude a miserable few weeks that has seen Arsenal fall short in three major competitions. </span></div>
