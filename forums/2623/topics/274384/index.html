We know we have to keep on our toes.<br><br>"But the second goal was certainly a mental blow for them."<br><br>Sparta certainly did not stand off the English side, weighing in with plenty of strong challenges.<br><br>Former West Ham defender Tomas Repka was involved in most of the early exchanges, clattering into Robin van Persie after just two minutes before eventually having to be replaced before half-time when he was injured after a clash with Fabregas.<br><br>Wenger felt his side dealt with what was thrown at them with great composure.<br><br>"It was a very physical game. Sparta played with a total commitment in the first half and stopped us from playing," he said.<br><br>"We needed to be patient and not make a mistake.<br><br>"At one stage we were lucky as well, because they hit the post.<br><br>"We needed to play with more purpose in going forwards and did that more in the second half. Then we were more dangerous."<br><br>Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann - guilty of a terrible blunder against Fulham on Sunday - produced some fine saves and it was his quick throw which set full-back Bacary Sagna away for the injury-time goal.<br><br>Wenger said: "I feel against Fulham, he made a big mistake in first minute after he had a good performance and showed mental strength.<br><br>"Against Sparta, he had great saves and was very influential on the second goal we scored as well."<br><br>Sparta coach Michal Bilek felt his side had deserved more.<br><br>He said: "Overall, although it was a great performance, we were disappointed with the result."<br><br>"There is still the game at the Emirates Stadium, and we will try to put on a good performance - but getting through would really be a great surprise."</div>
