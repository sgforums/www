            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/images/pics/report/genclerbiligi19072007_6.jpg"><br><br>With 21 minutes to go in last nightÂ’s match against Genclerbirligi, the diminutive figure of Eduardo jogged on to the pitch at the tiny Bad Waltersdorf Stadion.<br><br>It was about as low-key an entrance as you can get. Only the roar from the watching Arsenal fans would have given you any clue about the importance of this otherwise insignificant substitution.<br><br>His first contribution was a testing cross to the far post that forced the Turkish sideÂ’s defender to turn the ball aside. His next consisted of a couple of stepovers on the right side and then a pin-point ball on to the head of the Freddie Ljungberg, who steered the effort narrowly wide.<br><br>They were only glimpses of potential but enough to make you believe ArsÃ¨ne Wenger has plucked another rough diamond from footballÂ’s hinterland. However the player himself admits heÂ’ll need to polish his skills for the transition to the English game.<br><br>Â“I am very happy for this first match,Â” he said afterwards. Â“But I know I have a lot more to do to prove myself. The rest of the squad is very good. Robin van Persie particularly impressed me tonight. But in my opinion, it is just important to be here with them and stay away from injuries.<br><br>Â“So far the training out here has not been difficult because we are using the ball more than we did when I was at Dinamo Zagreb.<br><br>Â“On the face of it, I feel there is no big difference between English and Croatian football. It is just that in English football there are a lot less mistakes and the players are physically stronger than in Croatia. I am still adjusting to my new club but it is good.Â”<br><br>Eduardo also revealed he had forged friendships with Emmanuel Eboue, Denilson, Philippe Senderos and Alex Hleb since arriving at the Club.<br><br>On the strength of his cameo last night, he will be making a few more in the stands during the coming season.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you look in the record books it will say Eduardo started his Arsenal career on July 3, 2007. In fact it began yesterday.<br><br>ArsÃ¨ne Wenger was at Soho Square in the afternoon putting forward the CroatianÂ’s case over his work permit application. The Arsenal manager then flew to the Netherlands to guide his team through their opening game of the Amsterdam Tournament.<br><br>An hour or so before kick-off news filtered through that Eduardo had been granted his papers. An hour or so after kick-off the 24-year-old nodded home his first strike for his new club.<br><br>Â“Yes, Eduardo got his work permit today and celebrated with his first goal,Â” said Wenger after the 2-1 win over Lazio.<br><br>Â“When we got the news you could see it was important to him because there was relief on his face.<br><br>Â“He could have scored two or three in the game tonight. He is good in the air for a small guy and could have got another header too.<br><br>Â“I am pleased because it is always good that this period [without a goal] does not last too long. Otherwise people start to question your capability to score.Â”<br><br></div>
