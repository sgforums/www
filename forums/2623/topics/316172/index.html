              <h1>Edelman makes shock Arsenal exit</h1>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44617000/jpg/_44617097_edelman_226.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="282"></p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal managing director Keith Edelman will leave the club "to seek pastures new and embark upon fresh challenges".</strong></p>
              <p>Edelman departs after eight years at Arsenal in which he played a key role in their move to the Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>He was responsible for commercial and administrative activities and oversaw Arsenal's turnover breaking £200m.</p>
              <p>"Under Keith's stewardship the Club has achieved record profits and
              the Board owes him a debt of gratitude," said Gunners chairman Peter
              Hill-Wood.</p>
              <p>"Keith has played a major role in the growth of the club since he joined in 2000.</p>
              <p>"In that time we have successfully implemented the move from
              Highbury to Emirates Stadium that has underpinned the future of the
              business and confirmed our position as one of Europe's leading clubs."</p>
              <p>Edelman has fiercely and repeatedly rejected claims that
              Arsenal require outside investment to compete with Manchester United,
              Chelsea and Liverpool - their closest Premier League rivals who are all
              foreign-owned.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have been subject to takeover rumours with Red and White
              Holdings Limited, which is jointly owned by Russian billionaire Alisher
              Usmanov and London-based Farhad Moshiri, upping its stake in the club
              to 24% to become the largest shareholder ahead of director Danny
              Fiszman.</p>
              <p>American billionaire investor Stan Kroenke, meanwhile, holds a 12% stake.</p>
              <p>Edelman is reported to hold only a nominal number of shares but his exit could spark fears of a fresh takeover bid.</p>
              <p>"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Arsenal," said Edelman.</p>
              <p>"It has been a very exciting period for the business and I am
              proud to have contributed to the club's many off-field achievements
              over the past eight years, not least the Emirates Stadium project.</p>
              <p>"Now that we have completed our second season at Emirates, I
              believe it is the right time to seek pastures new and embark upon fresh
              challenges."</p>
              <p>After his arrival at the north London club, Edelman completed
              the first strategic partnership Arsenal had entered into since forming
              when a 10% stake was sold to Granada Media for £77 million.</p>
              <p>He oversaw Arsenal's re-branding and crest redesign and was later
              engineered a new sponsorship deal with Nike, valued at £130 million
              over 10 years.</p>
              <p>With the stadium nearing completion, Edelman completed one of
              the largest football sponsorship deals, with Emirates Airlines for over
              £100 million, including naming rights to the ground.</p>
              <p>"The board has already initiated the search for a new managing
              director and will update shareholders and stakeholders when
              appropriate," read a statement from Arsenal Holdings PLC.</p>
              <p>"In the meantime, director Ken Friar, who has a wealth of
              football-based experience and business acumen having previously
              occupied the role of managing director (1982-2000), will assume the
              position of acting managing director."</p>
