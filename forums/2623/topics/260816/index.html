            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.triera.net/upload/sport/nogomet/rosicky_6_show.jpg"><br><br>Tomas Rosicky has backed Thierry Henry to return from injury and have a "great season" with Arsenal - but admits the thought of their talisman captain leaving the Emirates Stadium is "not good".<br><br>The Gunners have once again had to deal with continued speculation their most influential player is set to leave, with both Barcelona and AC Milan said to be leading the chasing pack.<br><br>Henry continues to insist he remains "for the moment" very much an Arsenal player - and even moved to dismiss a report originating in France that a deal had already been done to take him to the Nou Camp by declaring "my name is not up on the departures board".<br><br>However, there is no doubt Henry's future now does not look as certain as it did just over a year ago when he looked to have pledged the remainder of his career to the Gunners in a new, lucrative deal.<br><br>A series of niggling injuries robbed Arsenal of their key man for large spells of the last campaign, as fatigue finally got the better of Henry following a gruelling year with club and country in 2006.<br><br>Although the Gunners proved they can win without their talisman, there is no doubt a fit Henry would once again inspire Arsene Wenger's side for the battle to force themselves back into contention for honours.<br><br>Czech winger Rosicky - who arrived last summer in a Â£7million deal from Borussia Dortmund - knows full well the influence Henry has at Emirates Stadium.<br><br>"He is captain and the most outstanding personality, it would not be good," Rosicky said when questioned on the reports surrounding the Arsenal captain's future by the Czech newspaper Sport.<br><br>"Thierry was not playing for a long time due to injury and now he will come back. He rested and will have a great season.<br><br>"The same may be said about (Robin) van Persie. They both know how to score goals and I think they might be stars of the entire season."<br><br>The future of manager Wenger - who has just a year left to run on his contract - has also been called into question.<br><br>The French coach, 57, however, has reiterated he has no intention of walking away from the club just yet in the wake of the shock departure of former vice-chairman and close friend David Dein.<br><br>"The manager told us when we were leaving that he has a contract for another year and that he will fulfil it and will continue in the next season," said Rosicky, 26.<br><br>"This is all and I hope that it will remain the same."<br><br>Rosicky added: "We have an entire season in front of us, I believe we will be successful and he will stay. I believe in it."<br><br>As speculation continues over the involvement of American billionaire Stan Kroenke - who bought a 12% holding in the club - Wenger will aim to focus the players on the task in hand when they return for pre-season training next month.<br><br>Despite reaching the Carling Cup final with a youthful side, there is no doubt 2007 failed to live up to expectations.<br><br>"As regards Arsenal, everybody has to classify the season as unsuccessful, because we were eliminated from everything," said Rosicky.<br><br>"However, we do not have to be ashamed for the football we played.<br><br>"It is strange if you beat those who play for the title - we defeated Manchester twice, we won three times out of four games against Liverpool and drew twice with Chelsea - and then we failed in matches against teams below us or playing to avoid relegation.<br><br>"This is very frustrating. Of course we have a very young team, we were better in many games we lost.<br><br>"We conceded stupid goals after corners or after free-kicks.<br><br>"These are things we have to improve. When we do, we will play for the title."<br><br>Rosicky made a total of 37 appearances last season for the Gunners, scoring six goals.<br><br>The Czech midfielder had, though, been linked with a move away, to Atletico Madrid, after just one season in England.<br><br>Suggestions Arsenal are linking up a Â£6million move for Ajax winger Ryan Babel will do little to quell speculation.<br><br>Rosicky, however, dismissed reports he was set for a change - and insisted he was enjoying life in London.<br><br>"I was told it was published in newspapers. Nobody spoke about it with me directly," the 26-year-old said.<br><br>"I am happy in Arsenal and this is the end of this story for me.<br><br>"I have no reason to change anything. I want to stay in Arsenal."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wow,i hope he stays with arsenal till he retires!</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rosicky sees plenty of positives<br><br>Tomas Rosicky is confident Arsenal can be challenging for the title if everyone is fit next season.</strong><br><br>The Gunners finished a disappointing fourth last season but Arsene Wenger was without the services of captain Thierry Henry for much of the campaign.<br><br>Rosicky was able to take many positives out of last season, his first in the Premiership, and sees further improvements next term.<br><br>The midfielder is tipping Arsenal to be in the title hunt in the coming season and expects the club's younger players to have learnt from past experiences.<br><br>"We do not have to be ashamed of the football we showed in the previous season," Rosicky said in Sport.<br><br>"We were playing a major part of the season without the injured Thierry Henry and Robin van Persie. There were even more injuries too.<br><br>"But those who played instead of them did not fail.<br><br>"It is strange, you beat the title contenders and then you fail to beat teams that are in the bottom half of the table or below us. It is extremely frustrating.<br><br>"Even in the games which we lost, we were clearly the better side. We were conceding silly goals. In general we conceded way too many goals from set-pieces.<br><br>"These are things we can improve in the future. If we remove these mistakes, then we will be fighting for the title."<br><br>The Czech Republic international joined Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund last summer and feels he had a satisfactory first year in England.<br><br>Injuries kept Rosicky out of action at times during the season but on the whole he was happy with his impact for The Gunners.<br><br>"I take it as I was a newcomer and I have gained ground well. I was however slowed down by the injuries," he said.</div>
