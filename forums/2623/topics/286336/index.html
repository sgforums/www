This makes him the pivot of attack. hes creative n able to feed through balls to the attackers.<br><br>he still can drop back to support defense.<br><br>But in RM, u have guti, robinho, emerson, etc. would fab be given de freedom to roam? dun think so.<br><br>he may be like gerrard, being forced to play on de right.</div>
