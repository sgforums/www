              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Cesc Fabregas has admitted he would love Arsenal to sign Xabi Alonso from Liverpool. </strong></p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger is understood to be interested in the
              midfielder and Fabregas is keen to play alongside his Spanish
              compatriot at club level.</p>
              <p>"Xabi is my friend of course, but apart from that he is a great player," Fabregas said in <em>The People</em>.</p>
              <p>"He has won the Champions League and won a European Championship - and he is only 26."</p>
              <h4>Superstar</h4>
              <p>Fabregas
              has also reiterated that he has no plans to move on from Arsenal as he
              does not believe many players have been successful after leaving the
              club.</p>
              <p>Alexander Hleb joined Barcelona over the summer while Mathieu Flamini clinched a transfer to AC Milan.</p>
              <p>Both
              players had built up their reputations at Arsenal and Fabregas hopes
              they do well for their new teams, but he feels history is against them.</p>
              <p>"I cannot remember any player who has left Arsenal and been a superstar," Fabregas added in the <em>News of the World</em>.</p>
              <p>"Don't
              get me wrong, Alex Hleb and Mathieu Flamini are probably two of my best
              friends in football. I wish them all the best and I speak to them every
              week."</p>
              <h5>Special</h5>
              <p>Fabregas, who has been linked with
              some of Europe's top sides, has every faith in Arsene Wenger's transfer
              policy and insists he is happy with life at Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>"We
              have to accept we have lost some big players who are difficult to
              replace but the boss knows what he's doing," the midfielder commented.</p>
              <p>"For me, Arsenal is Arsenal and this club has something special that no others have.</p>
              <p>"We have to take care of it, that's why you have to be intelligent in your decisions.</p>
              <p>"I
              have friends in Spain and Italy and they speak to me about other clubs
              and I know I'm privileged to be where I am and I don't want to lose it.</p>
              <p>"You see very few teams that play the way we do.</p>
              <p>"I enjoy the way we play. I came here when I was 16 and I feel it's my home."</p>
