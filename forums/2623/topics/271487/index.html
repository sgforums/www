            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics07_08/Premiership/Arsenal/van.jpg"><br><br><strong>Robin van Persie believes Arsenal's band of starlets can belie their tender years this season and be fully involved in the race for the title.</strong><br><br>Thierry Henry's departure to Barcelona has cast a cloud of doubt over Emirates Stadium and with North London rivals Tottenham investing heavily in the pre-season, there has been talk of usurpation in the capital.<br><br>Van Persie is not, though, amongst the doom merchants and instead, very much to the contrary, is confident Arsene Wenger's side will show there is life beyond their departed talisman.<br><br>In a series of close-season friendlies, Arsenal - despite being shorn of several of their top names through injury - have played some impressive football and the manner in which they dominated Internazionale on Sunday bodes well for the future.<br><br>"Football is not about age. It is not about money," said Van Persie.<br><br>"It is not about those things. Football is about if you want to run for each other, if you want to fight for each other, if you want to really play some ball.<br><br>"Chelsea and Manchester did a great job last year. It is hard to fight with them, but I know we can do it.<br><br>"Liverpool have spent lots of money, Chelsea have been doing that the last few years. I respect that. This is their way of winning things - but we can win things as well.<br><br>"We are young. So what? Age does not matter. It is about the way we play football and the way we like to play together."<br><br>While the bookies will install Arsenal way behind the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and even Liverpool in the race for the title, Van Persie is convinced top spot is not beyond them.<br><br>"If you win the title with this team it would be great. I really believe we can do that. I really believe that in my heart. I think the manager is thinking the same.<br><br>"I started pre-season training on June 18 and I am with these boys every day, I see their ability.<br><br>"Yes they are young and young people make mistakes, but that does not really matter - like in love, age does not matter.<br><br>"Everyone was really happy to play in this game against Inter. If we play the same way or even less, we will have a big chance to at least fight for the title."</div>
