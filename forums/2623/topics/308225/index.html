              <h2>Arsenal's tireless midfielder Mathieu Flamini has played down the
              comparisons with Milan's Gennaro Ivan Gattuso ahead of the two sides'
              meeting at the Emirates' Stadium on Wednesday. He has also explained
              his role in the team and the overall strength of the new look Arsenal
              side...</h2>
              <p>The Frenchman has won over the fans and management this season with
              some fantastic workman-like performances in the centre of midfield,
              keeping Brasilian international Gilberto Silva and French international
              Lassana Diarra on the sidelines.<br><br>The performances have earned
              him the nickname 'Gattuso', in honour of Milan's world class midfield
              pitbull; Flamini has shrugged aside the comparisons.<br><br>"It was the African players who started it because, you know, I never give up," he explained.<br><br>"I
              don't think [it's a fair reflection]. It's true they call me it and
              he's a great player. I don't want sound disrespectful to the guy
              because he's amazing but I think I'm a different player to him. I'm
              more attacking. We try and play a little more football. And, anyway, I
              want to make my own name in the football world." <br><br>Two players he felt he was more in the mould of, however, were Premier League stars themselves.<br><br>"Patrick
              Vieira and Roy Keane," he declared. "Amazing. They did so well in this
              league. I want to become a player like they were. They were fighters,
              they were great footballers, they made the difference at their clubs,
              they had great spirit, great experience - and they led their teams." <br><br>Flamini has also explained he sees himself as a vocal presence on the field, as well as the physical.<br><br>"I
              like to speak on the pitch," he explained. "What is good in our team is
              that we have really good communication. Everyone is taking
              responsibility and talking to each other, making things better.<br><br>"I'm
              trying to give a little bit more physical presence in midfield. Cesc
              (Fabregas) is a little bit more offensive so I have to police the
              midfield. I have to protect my defence, stay in the middle and focus on
              stopping their attacks. It's very important because the midfield is the
              heart of the team.<br><br>"In England, every week, every team is
              fighting. It's important to win the fight first and then after that to
              play. Because if you don't win the fight you cannot play. The team
              understands that. Everyone knows the fight comes first and then we
              play. <br><br>"When you are playing a team like Blackburn, from the
              start they want a physical game. You need to react. What is most
              important is that we are playing for Arsenal. We all want to play
              football. It's a pleasure to play the way we play. But we have to be at
              the front of the physical battle because we have proved from the start
              of the season that if we have to fight, we fight."</p>
