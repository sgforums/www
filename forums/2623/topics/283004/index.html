            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DAVID DEIN probably doesnÂ’t know whether to laugh or cry at the moment.</strong><br><br>There are Arsenal, top of the Premier League, with a seemingly never-ending production line of kids coming through. And he is on the outside looking in.<br><br>No wonder David and his backers are so desperate to buy the club.<br><br>Whatever David may say, I bet part of him is cursing about how well Arsenal are doing.<br><br>Had the Gunners been struggling, as some people thought they might this season, the fans would have been outside the ground clamouring for his return.<br><br>Instead there has barely been a murmur and the current board must be sitting quite comfortably.<br><br>When you are mounting a campaign like DavidÂ’s, you need every advantage you can get. And the way Arsenal are playing isnÂ’t helping his cause.<br><br>Getting the football and the finances right is a tricky business and Arsenal are pulling it off.<br><br>David is not daft. He may have been talking about the club needing new investment but he also knows how good his friend Arsene Wenger is at finding new talent at bargain prices Â— and that there was a wealth of quality already coming through.<br><br>He realises Arsenal will not drain a new ownerÂ’s resources because a man like Wenger would not allow it.<br><br>Even when Arsenal went through a relatively quiet period over the last couple of years, Dein knew the Frenchman was well capable of taking them back to the top again.<br><br>It says everything about Arsenal that there was no panic when they stuttered after winning the title without losing a game in the 2003-04 season.<br><br>They played some beautiful football over the last few years without scoring the goals.<br><br>But now they have sold Thierry Henry Â— and ended up with a better team. They have found that cutting edge again and it is fantastic to watch.<br><br>They are even packing out their Carling Cup games because the fans all want to watch the next generation.<br><br>That competition went through a period when it was basically being seen as a reserve-team cup that nobody cared about.<br><br>But now, at places like Arsenal, it is being revitalised because it is a chance to see exciting kids.<br><br>It might not have worked at Manchester United this week Â— but it did in North London<br><br>And think of the way Arsenal destroyed LiverpoolÂ’s second string last season.<br><br>I realise Julio Baptista scored four goals but the kids made it work and it is a game which is still talked about.<br><br>Strangely, it all reminds me of years gone by when we used to play pre-season games between two sides from the same club.<br><br>At Chelsea, I think it was free for the fans to get in and we used to stage matches like the possibles v the probables or sometimes mix the two sides up.<br><br>The fans loved it because it gave them a chance to see the new buys or any of the youngsters who were coming through.<br><br>IÂ’d like to see that come back. The TV companies would fancy it, as well. Arsenal v Arsenal would be the best game of the season.<br><br>Having already lost Emile Heskey from our next two Euro 2008 qualifiers against Estonia and Russia Â— we now have to face up to the prospect of being without our top goalscorer Michael Owen.<br><br>They were as good as it gets against Israel and Russia. But, as I said a couple of weeks ago, there was no point getting into a debate about whether we should keep the partnership because injuries can always scupper your plans.<br><br>While it is bad luck to lose one of them, somebody up there must have it in for us to take away both. WeÂ’ve just got to get on with it though.<br><br>WeÂ’ve proved the strength in depth is there so there is no reason why we cannot deal with this setback as well.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All written by Terry Venables...</span></div>
