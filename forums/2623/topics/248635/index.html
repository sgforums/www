            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Goals at the tail end of both halves were enough for SAFFC to open up a six point lead at the top after a 2-0 win over Geylang United.<br><br>After the Eagles had fallen behind to Jonathan Xu's own goal just before half-time, S.League topscorer Aleksandar Duric wrapped up the tie five minutes from the end with his ninth of the season.<br><br>The Warriors had to endure a series of gilt-edged chances spurned by Geylang though, who suffered from a lack of the sort of firepower offered by their former striker Duric.<br><br>"Although we won, it was a hard game. Geylang were tough opponents as we expected and I am sure they will come back from this defeat," said SAFFC coach Richard Bok.<br><br>"They are a good and young team, but the talent and quality they have is there to see.Â”<br><br>His Warriors side had the first opportunity to go ahead in the 12th minute - three of them which came in consecutive fashion in fact.<br><br>First Eagles keeper Hassan Sunny was at full-stretch to deny SAFFC fullback Shaiful Esah his second goal of the season from a freekick.<br><br>From the resulting corner, Hassan again had to tip away, this time from Therdsak Chaiman's chip.<br><br>Then the Warriors played what is becoming a familiar set-piece routine, with John Wilkinson ever ready to utilise his lethal shooting from range. But he found Hassan a stumbling block this time around.<br><br>The home side had their share of chances. Ghanian striker Kim Grant muscled past Kenji Arai and Daniel Bennett and his shot from a tight angle beat keeper Shahril Jantan, but not the post.<br><br>Korean midfielder Bae Jin Soo then wasted a decent chance by dwelling on his shot before SAFFC made them pay just before the break.<br><br>The damage was done by winger Jamil Ali, who moved to SAFFC from Geylang this season. His cross from the right deflected in past a stranded Hassan via the despairing, lunging boot of Eagles defender Jonathan Xu.<br><br>Geylang are made of sterner stuff these days though and they came out after the break hunting for a equaliser.<br><br>In the 52nd minute, Fadzuhasny Juraimi's fierce drive was tipped over by Warriors keeper Shahril, while seven minutes later Grant's freekick went over.<br><br>Substitute Hafiz Rahim had perhaps the best chance of an equaliser which would have cheered the hearts of most at Bedok Stadium.<br><br>But his connection in the 69th minute with a cross from another substitute Rangsan Vivatchaichok was poor and the ball trickled wide of the goal guarded only by Shahril.<br><br>The missed chances were beginning to take a mental toll on Geylang and you could sense the desperation around the stadium when big striker Grant fired over the bar after being left unmarked in the 84th minute.<br><br>As in the first half, SAFFC took advantage of the Eagles' profligacy as Duric sealed the win for his side five minutes from the end.<br><br>Receiving a pass from the tireless Therdsak, the big man side-stepped his marker with a delicate shimmy and from seven metres out placed it beyond Geylang custodian Hassan.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m pleased and had a warm feeling after scoring the goal, especially when it came in the final minutes and tiredness and fatigue had crept in,Â” said the veteran forward.<br><br>On the night that was the difference between two teams who fought tooth and nail for the goals and the eventual victory - SAFFC made its chances and took them while Geylang had the chances but spurned them.</span></div>
