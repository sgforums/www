            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://soccerword.com/media/Alex%20Arsenal.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger insists the bitter taste of their Champions League exit against PSV last year will ensure Arsenal do not make the same mistake this season.<br><br>The Gunners are currently one of the form sides of Europe, and will be looking to extend their 100% Group H record when they host Slavia Prague on Tuesday night.<br><br>Wenger's men more than impressed with their superb 3-0 victory over Sevilla at Emirates Stadium and picked up another positive return from what could have proved a tricky trip to Steaua Bucharest.<br><br>Yet the Arsenal manager is all too aware of the danger of complacency, his side having crashed out in the first knock-out round to then unfancied Dutch side 2-1 on aggregate.<br><br>"The big frustration in our throats is how we went out last year against PSV Eindhoven. That frustration is still very lively," said Wenger, who lead Arsenal to the Champions League final in 2006.<br><br>"To get that out, I do not think we will have any chance to relax against teams like Slavia Prague because we have been knocked out last season by PSV."<br><br>Wenger insisted: "We have a year's more experience now and have a squad which is really of a very good level, where everybody can play.<br><br>"I believe the strength of this group is that despite their youth they can handle that - they lack fear because they can play.<br><br>"Confidence is a very important factor in our game.<br><br>"When you do not start well, you have to be even stronger to get back and you need even more experience.<br><br>"So with a young squad like we had it was important, especially with the season we had where belief was a bit down, to start well early and we have done that.<br><br>"The players will be up for it. Can we sustain our pace at the moment? That is a question I understand, but why not?<br><br>"On the performance we have shown until now, it is not only that we can win the games, but also that we have quality."<br><br>Slavia knocked Dutch giants Ajax out of the qualifiers to make their first foray into Europe's elite club competition. Ironically, the Gunners came through their clash with city rivals Sparta to make the group stages.<br><br>The Czechs - who have former Liverpool midfielder Vladimir Smicer in their squad - beat Steaua Bucharest, but then lost 4-2 against Sevilla in Spain.<br><br>Wenger has been impressed by the improvement of sides from central and eastern Europe in the Champions League.<br><br>"It looks like the Eastern Bloc is coming back," he said.<br><br>"Why? Because more and more people have money and at the start they wanted to invest it in western football, but now they want to invest that in their own country."<br><br>Wenger, meanwhile, feels it is now high time he no longer had to address questions on the "political issues" behind the scenes at Arsenal.<br><br>The board announced at Thursday's annual general meeting they have entered a new lock-down agreement not to sell any more shares.<br><br>Managing director Keith Edelman revealed American investor Stan Kroenke - who holds around a 12% stake - is keen to "form a closer relationship with the club", which may yet include also signing up to the board's initiative.<br><br>Arsenal already have a marketing alliance with Colorado Rapids who play in the United States Major Soccer League.<br><br>However, suggestions the Gunners could follow the likes of Chelsea on an American tour where quickly rebuffed.<br><br>Wenger said: "I am not a big fan of that.<br><br>"You travel a lot, you do not prepare properly and do not promote your brand a lot more, but you make some money. That is the only advantage."<br><br></div>
