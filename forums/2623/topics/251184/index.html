            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Arsene Wenger will be sorting out of the futures of both Julio Baptista and Jose Antonio Reyes in the near future.</strong><br><br>Baptista and Reyes are both nearing the end of season-long loans at Arsenal and Real Madrid respectively, after they swapped clubs last August.<br><br>On Baptista, Wenger would not reveal whether he had decided to keep the Brazilian or not.<br><br>"I will meet his agents next week and Real Madrid a bit later," he said.<br><br>"I can talk to the player. Whether he stays or goes, I still need to talk to the agent.<br><br>"If he stays, what price? If he goes, how do we do it?<br><br>"What can we do about it? You always need some service."<br><br>Wenger did admit that Reyes was unlikely to play for The Gunners again - even though he would not rule it out.<br><br>"Reyes coming back can happen," he said.<br><br>"I have nothing against that - but Reyes does not want to come back to English football, he prefers to stay in Spain.<br><br>"It looks at the moment that the situation with Real Madrid is a bit confused about Reyes. We have no clear vibes coming out."<br><br>Meanwhile, Wenger has insisted that the club's new director of football would not necessarily be a close friend of his - after Henri Biancheri, who he worked with at Monaco, was linked with the role.<br><br>"He will be appointed by me, but it will not necessarily be a friend of mine," said Wenger.<br><br>"It will be somebody who will do the job well because if I go after one day the guy still has to work here.<br><br>"I am looking for somebody who has experience of negotiating a little bit, somebody I can leave alone because sometimes I cannot be there.<br><br>"It will have to be somebody who understands football and knows the football world as well and somebody who has the values and agrees with the values we want to hold at the club." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>baptista is such a big headache. He looks physically impressive and he shows occasionally glimpses of technique. But he just isn't adapting well. If MAdrid are willing to release him for 6 or 7 mil pounds, it might be worth considering. He certainly doesn't command the 10 million pounds that arsene wenger was willing to fork out 2 seasons back.<br><br>Reyes, well, we certainly missed him after we lost henry and RVP. Our tongo striker dances pretty well with Henry, but beyond that, i am not impressed.<br><br>Ribery is up for sale! i like Rosicky. Hleb, i am undecided. Too inconsistent.<br><br>If only we'd managed to snitch woodgate!

Mybe next season we can loan robinho over  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  since madrid snatched him from us 2 seasons back. How has Robinho been performing? I havent got time to follow la liga these days</div>
