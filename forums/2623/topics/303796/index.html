You want to give him those games as soon as possible.<br><br>"At the end of the day, I do not feel we made the right decision to play him on the night."<br><br>The Arsenal boss has sanctioned a trip back to Holland as part of Van Persie's "treatment and rehabilitation".<br><br>Wenger said: "A football club is not a hospital. It is made for players who play, not for those who cannot play or are sick.<br><br>"It is very depressing for them to come in every day and see their partners going out and playing, when he cannot.<br><br>"Sometimes it is better to get them away for 10 days where they have a completely different environment. It makes them feel better."</div>
