              <p class="first"><strong>Former England and Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour says it looks like his football career is coming to an end.</strong></p>
              <p>His last professional game was at Hull in the 2006/07 season and
              despite training with Barnet last term, a knee injury thwarted his
              hopes of a deal.</p>
              <p>Parlour, 35, told BBC London 94.9: "You do miss it. Especially the day-to-day banter and playing games on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"Your bonus is the Saturday, walking around the stadium with the crowd and the atmosphere."
              </p>
              <p>And Parlour added: "You do miss it, it's impossible not to."</p>
              <p>Parlour made nearly 400 appearances for Arsenal and played 10 times for England.</p>
              <p>During his Arsenal career Parlour won three FA Premier League
              titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup and one European Cup Winners' Cup
              medal.</p>
              <p>Despite the knee injury he suffered last season, Parlour had hoped to
              return to the game but when asked whether or not he has officially
              retired the Romford-born player conceded that his playing days now look
              to be over.</p>
              <p>He said: "It looks like it is going that way."</p>
              <p>Parlour, who also played for Middlesbrough, would still like to keep himself busy by maintaining his involvement in football.</p>
              <p>He stated: "I don't know if I'm going to do my coaching badges
              yet. I probably will do, so I'm looking that way as well so we'll soon
              see what happens."</p>
              <p>Parlour says he still enjoys following Arsenal because he has so many fond memories of the club.</p>
              <p>"I'm very privileged to have played at Arsenal during my career and I enjoyed every minute of it and I do miss it," he said.</p>
              <p>"I follow Arsenal quite a lot and I go over to the training ground
              quite a bit still and watch the games. I like to keep involved with
              Arsenal because it is such a great club.</p>
              <p>"I was there many years, I signed as a 12-year-old and left at
              32. So 20 years of your life is a long time. I'll always have Arsenal
              in my heart."</p>
