            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics06_07/Managers/Premiership/wenger_gilberto.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger has denied reports that he had a bust-up with Brazilian midfielder Gilberto. The World Cup winner has struggled to force his way into the starting XI this season with Cesc Fabregas and Mathieu Flamini forming an impressive central midfield partnership.<br><br>Gilberto was asked to fill in at centre-half against the Swampies earlier in the season and could be set for a similar role in the Carling Cup against Sheffield United.<br><br>But there were suggestions that the 31-year-old could miss the game as he was unimpressed to not be used in his favoured midfield role, fuelling speculation he could be on his way out of Emirates Stadium in January.<br><br>Wenger says: "I deny that categorically.<br><br>"I find this assessment disrespectful to a great professional like Gilberto. He is 100 per cent professional and is in the squad. He will play."<br><br>Wenger continued: "I believe that as a manager and as a player you always have one thing in your mind and that is what is good for the club and the team and I cannot fault Gilberto on that since he arrived here.<br><br>"Recently he has played less, but his mentality has been superb.<br><br>"It is important to win every single competition and in this one I use younger players because traditionally it has always been like that and it has helped us a lot to develop the players."<br><br>Wenger will again give the fringe players a chance to impress against the Blades.<br><br>"You could see Justin Hoyte and Alex Song, Walcott and Eduardo, so we will have a strong squad there,"<br><br>"Eduardo needs a run and he needs some confidence but I see the first six months as an adaptation period for anybody, and that is what he is going through at the moment."<br></div>
