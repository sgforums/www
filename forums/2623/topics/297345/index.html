The left-back is set to play his first game at Emirates Stadium since he left for Chelsea in August 2006 but said he is "not scared".</strong><br><br>Cole has never been forgiven for demanding a transfer after complaining a contract offer of Â£55,000-a-week was too small. He then secretly met with Chelsea in the 'tapping-up' scandal. Arsenal fans waved fake banknotes at Cole at Stamford Bridge last season and accused him of being too afraid to face them when he pulled out of the return in May.<br><br>Cole said: "What do people think I'm scared of? Fans booing me? I had it all last season and nearly all my life. It's stupid but I can't stop what people think. I will go there and prove that I'm not scared. "I was gutted when I couldn't play at Arsenal last season, but there was nothing I could do. "I'd had a bad ankle all season and the manager felt it was the right time to get it fixed so I could be fit for the FA Cup Final. There were a lot of people saying I was scared and too afraid to play, but that was and never will be the case."<br><br>Chelsea boss Avram Grant has backed Cole to weather the storm. He said: "I have no fears about him dealing with the atmosphere on Sunday. He will be okay. He is a professional and he is in good shape lately. "Each game he has played has been better than the one before and that is more important than whether the crowd boo him or not. It is not a problem for him. He has a good, strong character."<br><br>Chelsea know a win will take them level with Arsenal, who have led the Premier League for most of the season. Cole added: "We showed a lot of spirit at Arsenal last season and proved how determined we were to win the championship, but it wasn't enough and it was very disappointing. "Arsenal are the team to beat in the Premier League at the moment and hopefully we can do just that."<br><br></div>
