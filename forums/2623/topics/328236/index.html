              <p>Adebayor was wanted by AC Milan and Barcelona before signing a new long-term contract at Emirates Stadium earlier this month.</p>
              <p>The Togo international is still to win over some of the Arsenal fans following the speculation surrounding his future.</p>
              <p>However,
              with a new deal now signed, Gunners boss Wenger sees no reason why
              Adebayor should face any hostility and feels the striker has been
              unfairly treated.</p>
              <h4>Convinced</h4>
              <p>"I believe that Emmanuel has
              been unfairly treated, because he had a lot of interest from many big
              clubs and he always told me one-to-one his preference was to stay. In
              the end he stayed," Wenger explained.</p>
              <p>"That story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him.</p>
              <p>"He
              made a press conference in Austria where people interpreted his
              statements a bit differently, but I know what he told me, and I know he
              made sacrifices to stay.</p>
              <p>"I was convinced he wanted to stay, but I was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that.</p>
              <p>"People have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do, we have to accept that."</p>
