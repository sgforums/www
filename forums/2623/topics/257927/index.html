            <div class='col-md body'>what arsene needs is a wide midfielder who is able to run into the box to cross/finish. the midfielders he have currently are playing very centralised and goes wide very rarely.<br><br>Defence is good wif de introduction of gallas, but still need solidifying, gallas is his prime now, hope he gets into a good partnership is toure.<br><br>Even they go to the wide areas, they do not provide quality passes into vital areas nor do they run into the box to finish.<br><br>Most of the attacks frm wide areas are from clichy n eboue, but u will see fabregas,helb,rosicky mostly outside de penalty box.<br><br>Strikers who are able to finish are still not there yet. van persie is injury prone, adebayor according to his current statistics of total shot/goals is still far far on par wif a good striker. If he have de extra cash(which is hard) i hope he go for a finisher.<br><br></div>
