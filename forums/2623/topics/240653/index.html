            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Duric brace sends Warriors top</strong><br><br>If SAFFC were at all fatigued from Wednesday's AFC Cup match against Mahindra United in Goa, little of that was on display in a 3-1 win over the Young Lions last night.<br><br>Aleksandar Duric made it one-nil to the hosts in the seventh, with Masrezwan Masturi doubling their lead just after the half hour mark.<br><br>The Young Lions showed signs of revival after Hariss Harun scored in the 60th minute but had their faint hopes dashed after Duric dealt the killer blow just three minutes after.<br><br>Their midweek exertions notwithstanding, SAFFC were also under pressure to regain top spot especially after Home United had beaten Balestier Khalsa on Thursday.<br><br>Richard Bok had to make do without his first choice keeper Shahril Jantan and defender Kenji Arai due to injury and illness respectively.<br><br>But the two mainstays were hardly missed.<br><br>The Warriors started the match well, with Duric's header in the third minute disallowed for offside.<br><br>And rather than let that upset him too much, the big Australian responded in style by opening his accounts for the evening four minutes later.<br><br>Finding Masrezwan MasturiÂ’s pass from the side of the penalty-box, Duric unleashed a powerful strike that left goalkeeper Jasper Chan helpless.<br><br>Chan was beaten again in the 31st minute after a defensive error handed SAFFC a corner.<br><br>Therdsak Chaiman's corner found the head of Masrezwan, who easily brushed aside a challenge to nod home - an unforgivable piece of defending - considering that the 26-year-old forward is hardly the most physically imposing of players.<br><br>Two down in half an hour, Young Lions coach V Sundramoorthy shuffled his pack by taking off defender Baihakki Khaizan and bringing on forward Fazrul Nawaz.<br><br>The start of the second half saw the Young Lions step up, as they managed to snag a larger share of the possession.<br><br>A telling pass from Modourou Moise found Khairul Amri in the box and the forward had the presence of mind to pick out an onrushing Hariss Harun at the far post.<br><br>The 16-year-old midfielder calmly headed past Toh Guo'An, and it looked like game on.<br><br>Hariss's header gave the demoralised Young Lions hope as they quickly poured forward in search of an equaliser.<br><br>However, their hopes were dashed just three minutes later as yet another defensive error resulted in a goal for the Warriors.<br><br>It was another corner from Thai midfielder Therdsak that did the damage. He found Duric at the near post and the latter had plenty of time to head his second of the night.<br><br>"We were playing with SAFFC and they have very seasoned players," said Young Lions coach V Sundramoorthy.<br><br>"They know exactly what to do with the ball.<br><br>"My boys are young players. Let them play and learn," he added.<br><br>"The game was a good learning experience for them. The boys will learn a lot because they are playing with much better opponents.<br><br>"ItÂ’s a challenge and weÂ’ll see the benefits later in the season. Come June or July and youÂ’ll see a different and better team," said Sundram.<br><br>Meanwhile his opposite number said: "It was definitely not an easy game. We just came back from India and we were tired and suffered from cramps due to the heat.<br><br>"But IÂ’m happy that we did our job well tonight."</div>
