              <p><strong><span class="main-content">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has warned fans not to expect too much too soon of winger Theo Walcott. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>Walcott, who turns 20 next month, is set
              to feature against Burnley in the FA Cup on Sunday after injuring his
              shoulder on international duty in November.</p>
              <p>The former
              Southampton youngster required surgery but has recovered well and is
              now ready to make his comeback on Sunday at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>The
              Gunners have struggled without the lightning quick youngster and ended
              a run of four successive league games without scoring a goal when they
              beat West Brom 3-1 on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>But Wenger is adamant that fans should not pin all their hopes on the England international.</p>
              <p>"It is very important to see how he will respond with his shoulder and I think he looks to be nearly there," he said.</p>
              <p>"To have him back is great and he can be very good for us.</p>
              <p>"However
              the difference between training and competition is different. Theo is
              very fit, but after that you have to get used to tackles and go into
              the challenges.</p>
              <p>"You have to use your arms and shoulders to resist."</p>
              <h4>Comeback</h4>
              <p>Walcott's return is a timely one with the UEFA Champions League last-16 second leg at Roma coming up on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Wenger
              has also confirmed that influential midfielder Cesc Fabregas is set to
              return at the start of next month as Arsenal look to close the gap on
              Aston Villa and ultimately secure qualification for next season's
              Champions League.</p>
              <p>But the Gunners boss insists he is only
              concentrating on the visit of Burnley in the delayed FA Cup fifth round
              tie with the winner facing Hull City in the quarter-finals.</p>
              <p>The
              North Londoners know all about their Championship opponents after being
              dumped out of the Carling Cup at the hands of the Clarets earlier in
              the season.</p>
              <p>"It is an important game and not one we will treat lightly. We treat it with respect and focus," he added.</p>
              <p>"We know Burnley well and that they are a good side. The Championship teams are now a serious candidate in every game.</p>
              <p>"They have shown that recently, and we have the experience of playing Championship teams.</p>
              <p>"The
              gap has been reduced between the Championship teams and the Premier
              League, you see that in the results of the FA Cup and Carling Cup."</p>
