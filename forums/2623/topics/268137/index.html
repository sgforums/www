            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsene Wenger has admitted he does not want to keep Jose Antonio Reyes if he is unhappy at Arsenal.</strong><br><br>Reyes spent last season on loan at Real Madrid and is keen to secure a permanent move away from Arsenal, citing the rainy climate in England as one reason for his decision.<br><br>Wenger told Sky Sports News: "I think he will go. There is no way to have an unhappy player.<br><br>"Despite the global warming England is still not warm enough for him."<br><br>Regarding his own future, Wenger added: "I have shown my commitment in the past and have never cared too much about the weather."<br><br>Arsenal started their post-Thierry Henry era with a 2-0 victory over Barnet and Wenger was happy with the run-out, even if his players were not at their best.<br><br>"You could see we were not yet ready physically but it is our traditional start to the season and the target is to improve," he explained.<br><br>"We wanted to improve our combination play and not get injured, and sharpen up physically, and that is what we managed to do."<br><br>Denilson had to leave the pitch with an injury but Wenger insisted: "(He is) not bad. In a couple of days he should be ok."<br><br>Wenger is also looking ahead to the new season with confidence despite the departure of the talismanic Henry.<br><br>He said: "I feel we have a good potential to do it (cope without Henry).<br><br>"Of course we will focus more on sharing the responsibilities, and we can do that by not relying too much on one individual.<br><br>"And there are players that will take responsibilities, like (Robin) van Persie, (Emmanuel) Adebayor, (Theo) Walcott, Eduardo (da Silva) who has just come in, and young (Nicklas) Bendtner as well.<br><br>"Some players always raise their game when there is a departure like that."</div>
