            <div class='col-md body'>From teamtalk.com<br><a href="http://www.teamtalk.com/football/yoursay/0,19082,1766,00.html#825385" rel="nofollow">http://www.teamtalk.com/football/yoursay/0,19082,1766,00.html#825385</a><br><br>Ok so we slipped up. As many have said, rather Sevilla away when we have already qualified than a league game which is far more important. I am quite glad we got a poor performance and our first defeat out of the way.<br><br>Let's take the positives then: Bendtner was absolutely oustanding in a game where we underperformed and I think he warrants a regular start now. I'm sure Wenger can see this. His hold up play and passing is superb, he just needs to work on his touch.<br><br>I think Denilson was chosen in midfield because he is more technical than Diarra, who I think Wenger sees as a player for the English games. What I like about Denilson is that he gets stuck in and shows a lot of heart when the chips are down. He is our youngest midfielder and can only get better.<br><br>Traore was very disappointing and looked out of sorts defensively, which leads me to the main culprit, Phillipe Senderos.<br><br>Somebody needs to take different coloured crayons and draw the following points on the board for him:<br><br>1) The aim is to get the ball FROM the opposition, not give it TO them<br><br>2) Now and again, it would be a good idea to win a header<br><br>3) Your legs are used for running as well as standing or falling over<br><br>4) You can't actually PICK THE BALL UP when it is in play!<br><br>I think it's very harsh to criticise the manager when he clearly has the bigger picture in mind. It's also clear that the main reason we lost was Senderos. He sends negativity throughout the whole team and makes the MOST basic blunders.<br><br>A top class defender can't be as prone to errors as he is and I think it must be all that time on the fringes with Pascal Cygan that has harmed his career. That is the only explanation I can think of why he has gone backwards.<br><br>MH<br><br></div>

The problem is they don't really play well when they are away from home. I think its because of the many younsters that they have in the team... Playing well in the EPL its like bread and butter, they have got used to it. But when they go out to play in Europe, its a totally different thing altogether for them...<br><br>The way they prepare for the match, the longer than usual air travelling compare to their normal bus rides on the highway to get to the stadium and the different types of crowd are all unlike from their normal weekly epl matches. Most of the young players still lack of this kind of experience... Therefore may get overwhelm by these things and it could affect their performance.<br><br>The away win that they got in the CL only came against Steaua Bucuresti, probably one of the weakest side in the CL. And a single point against Slavia Prague, not exactlly one of the better sides too. Away to Seville was a test for them but it seem that they have failed. Seville showed Arsenal can be taken apart if you put them under pressure and attack them with speed.<br><br>Actually i don't think PSV will be more of a danger to them than Real Madrid or Barce... To be fair, they come across teams that plays negative football almost everyweek in the epl and they don't have any problem breaking them down in the course of 90 mins. Their last season lost to PSV was probably due to them not being able to score in Holland over 90 mins. PSV's goal came from a set piece where Alex scored with a header from a corner kick.<br><br>I think it the type of team that has the players with the potential to attack them is where they are most vulnerable... Seville wasn't a defensive team... The gunners were lucky to get away losing only 1 - 3. It could have been worse. Nevertheless, i also belief the gunners also can beat the teams from Spain but they have to be at the very top of their form to achieve this.</div>
