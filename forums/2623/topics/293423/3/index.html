            <div class='col-md body'>---Written by a Gunner's fan, boyslikegirls<br><br>Arsenal got pwned this morning by Sevilla 3-1, ending their 28 match unbeaten run. Arsenal first took the lead by Eduardo but a series of mistakes by Almunia and Gilberto cost Arsenal the top spot in their qualifying group with them behind Sevilla now by two points.<br><br>Many people point to Arsene Wenger's poor decision of using fringe players, youth and cameo players like Traore, Bendtner, Denilson. Instead of attempting to preserve the unbeaten run, Arsene Wenger's side has gotten younger by each game. and more inexpereienced.<br><br>I as a Gunner fan am rather frustrated with Wenger because all started well in the season but in the recent 10 games, Arsenal have been drawing too many and have lost all because they trust youth. No doubt Fabregas and Flamini is promising. But this morning, the only promising youth who played was Fabregas and Flamini was left at the bench.<br><br>Lehmann has shown his inconsistentcy at the start of the season. Almunia has begun to do so, showing his lack of competancy by conceding 2 against man u , 1 against reading, 3 against sevilla. Now it's time Fabianski gets a chance to shine.</div>

Arsenal's discipline began to fragment and Hoyte was yellow carded for treading on Adriano Correia after a late tackle from the Sevilla player.<br><br>The second-half had a frantic start as Eboue claimed a penalty and Denilson picked up a booking for a nasty two-footed tackle.<br><br>Midway through the second half Sevilla claimed their own penalty, arguing Senderous handled the ball in the area, but that call also went unheeded by referee Eric Braamhaar.<br><br>The Dutch official appeared to give the penalty, before reversing his decision and awarding a drop ball.<br><br>But with three minutes left Braamhaar pointed to the spot when Kanoute went down under the combined challenges of Toure and Bakari Sagna.<br><br>Kanoute, who had missed numerous chances in the preceding 87 minutes, showed an altogether more deadly nature as he tucked away the penalty.<br><br>Just prior to Kanoute's goal Wenger was ordered to leave the technical area for remonstrating with the fourth official.<br><br>---------------------<br><strong># Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:</strong><br><br>"I had no exchanges with the referee.<br><br>"I don't know why I was sent off, I was really surprised.<br><br>"The fourth official was really difficult for the whole game, I said to the referee 'will you explain to me why I have been sent off?'."<br>---------------------<br><br><strong>Sevilla:</strong> Palop, Daniel, Fazio, Dragutinovic, Crespo (Mosquera 63), Jesus Navas, Poulsen, Keita, Adriano Correia (Marti 90), Luis Fabiano (Kerzhakov 75), Kanoute.<br>Subs Not Used: De Sanctis, Renato, De Mul, Kone.<br><br>Booked: Crespo, Adriano Correia, Palop, Keita.<br><br>Goals: Keita 24, Luis Fabiano 34, Kanoute 89 pen.<br><br><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Almunia, Justin Hoyte (Sagna 66), Toure, Senderos, Traore, Eboue, Fabregas (Rosicky 56), Silva, Denilson, Eduardo (Walcott 81), Bendtner.<br>Subs Not Used: Lehmann, Diarra, Flamini, Song Billong.<br><br>Booked: Justin Hoyte, Denilson.<br><br>Goals: Eduardo 11.<br><br>Att: 65,000.<br><br>Ref: Eric Braamhaar (Holland).</div>

I am really surprised. I had no exchanges with the ref at all."<br><br>Wenger appeared to be involved in a running battle with the fourth official for much of the match which Arsenal led thanks to Eduardo da Silva's 11th minute effort.<br><br>However, they soon lost their advantage as the hosts ran out worthy winners thanks to goals from Seydou Keita, Luis Fabiano and a Fredi Kanoute penalty.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difficult</span></strong><br><br>"When I was down (on the touchline) I said it was naive to let him gain that time. The fourth official was really difficult for the whole game. I wanted to ask him why I had been sent off."<br><br>Wenger also seemed unsure where to stand after being ordered away from pitchside.<br><br>"I did not know where to go. I could not get in the stand," he complained.<br><br>Arsenal skipper Kolo Toure was also critical of Braamhaar.<br><br>Toure, who manfully marshalled a weakened Gunners defence, said: "We gave everything. I don't like to talk about the referee but tonight he was a little bit difficult for us.<br><br>"The ref sometimes helped them but when you go away it is always like that but they deserved their win. We gave everything but that's the way football goes."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by boyslikegirls:</div><div class="quote_body">---Written by a Gunner's fan, boyslikegirls<br><br>Arsenal got pwned this morning by Sevilla 3-1, ending their 28 match unbeaten run. Arsenal first took the lead by Eduardo but a series of mistakes by Almunia and Gilberto cost Arsenal the top spot in their qualifying group with them behind Sevilla now by two points.<br><br>Many people point to Arsene Wenger's poor decision of using fringe players, youth and cameo players like Traore, Bendtner, Denilson. Instead of attempting to preserve the unbeaten run, Arsene Wenger's side has gotten younger by each game. and more inexpereienced.<br><br>I as a Gunner fan am rather frustrated with Wenger because all started well in the season but in the recent 10 games, Arsenal have been drawing too many and have lost all because they trust youth. No doubt Fabregas and Flamini is promising. But this morning, the only promising youth who played was Fabregas and Flamini was left at the bench.<br><br>Lehmann has shown his inconsistentcy at the start of the season. Almunia has begun to do so, showing his lack of competancy by conceding 2 against man u , 1 against reading, 3 against sevilla. Now it's time Fabianski gets a chance to shine. </div></blockquote>as a gunner fan,i'm ashamed tt u typed this bollocks out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>having youth in your side.<br><br>u need to identify their strength and weakness.<br><br>no one is perfect.<br><br>i beg to differ with boyslikegirls comments.<br><br>First of all, why did wenger gave this young players the chance?<br><br>Against Wigan, Reason was, Hleb and Van persie was injured. Fabregas on a match ban<br><br>Against Sevilla, Reason was, We have achieved qualification to the Second Round, we need to rest our First Team players for the match away at Villa Park.<br><br>Our Utmost Priority from now is the Premier League, and to take maximum points from all games, and increase the lead that we will have at the moment.<br><br>i urge BoyslikeGirls to read up more on Arsenal News and be Better eqiupped with our team news.<br><br>Thanks.<br>Corebooster<br>Moderator</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Wenger underestimated Seville here... I guess Wenger really believe the team he put out could handle Seville. After all, They beaten them 3 - 0 in their earlier meeting and Seville are still a team that is not settle after their coach left for Spurs... The rage shown by Wenger towards the officials during the match showed how much this match meant to him...<br><br>Whatever it is, they started the match well and even went infront with an early goal. I think Wenger made a mistake here and hopefully it won't come back to haunt him... Cos they were beaten at their own fast game by a Seville side who had they put away their chance better, The gunners would be leaving Spain after receiving a thrashing...<br><br><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Almunia, Justin Hoyte (Sagna 66), Toure, Senderos, Traore, Eboue, Fabregas (Rosicky 56), Silva, Denilson, Eduardo (Walcott 81), Bendtner.<br>Subs Not Used: Lehmann, Diarra, Flamini, Song Billong.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/11_04/Wenger2811DMEFE_468x287.jpg"><br><span class="small">Wenger was dismissed late on after complaining to referee Eric Braamhaar about the over-reaction of Daniel Alves to a foul as the Gunners slipped to a 3-1 defeat</span><br></div>
