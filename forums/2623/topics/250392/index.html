            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas has spoken of being 'bound' to Arsene Wenger, amidst speculation that the pair could be on the move from Emirates Stadium.</strong><br><br>The departure of David Dein last week has cast a cloud over at least one side of North London and given the closeness he shared with Wenger, it has led to inevitable talk that the Frenchman could consider his future to be away from a club with whom he has achieved so much.<br><br>Fabregas, though, has moved to allay any such fears as he remains confident that Wenger will fulfill his contract at Arsenal, with the Spanish schemer of a similar mindset with regards his own future.<br><br>Despite his tender years the diminutive playmaker has established himself as perhaps Arsenal's most important player and while he has made no secret of the fact he would one day like to play football back in his homeland, for the moment at least, he is content in the capital.<br><br>"One of the reasons why I am at Arsenal is Wenger," Fabregas told Marca.<br><br>"He (Wenger) has said that is going to fulfil his contract and I trust his word.<br><br>"I would like to return to Spanish football, but before I must finish my time in England. Now, my plans are to stay in London.<br><br>"I am very happy here. I am enjoying playing football. We have not had good results but we have played well."<br><br>When questioned on reported interest from Real Madrid, the former Barcelona starlet conceded he knew little of being pursued by the Spanish titans.<br><br>He concluded: "I don't know what is going to happen. I don't know if they (Arsenal) are going to sell me, but I am very happy here.<br><br>"I am very bound to the coach (Wenger) and I think that he will continue." </span></div>
