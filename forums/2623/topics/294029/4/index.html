            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Gunners comeback sinks Villa*<br><br>Arsenal have moved five points clear at the top of the Premier League after fighting back from a goal down to beat Aston Villa 2-1 at Villa Park.</strong><br><br>Villa forged ahead in the 14th minute when William Gallas diverted John Carew's left-sided cross into the path of Craig Gardner who slotted home past Manuel Almunia.<br><br>The visitors responded in style and were level nine minutes later when Mathieu Flamini drilled a left-footed effort past the helpless Scott Carson after Villa failed to deal with Emmanuel Eboue's cross.<br><br>Arsenal were in front before half-time when Bacary Sagna's right-wing cross was superbly headed home by Emmanuel Adebayor, despite the attentions of Zat Knight and Olof Mellberg.<br><br>Villa upped their game after being second best to Arsene Wenger's side in the opening 45 minutes, although the closest they came to equalising was a Carew header that struck the crossbar.<br><br>Carson was called upon to make the first meaningful save of the game, turning a low 25-yard drive from Emmanuel Eboue around the post.<br><br>Alexander Hleb made a powerful run into the Villa box but Carson rescued the home side with a perfectly timed tackle.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opening goal</span></strong><br><br>Then after 14 minutes Villa midfielder Gardner broke the deadlock. Carew surged down the left flank before cutting into the Arsenal box and his cross deflected off two defenders before breaking to Gardner whose left-footed half volley was drilled past Almunia into the corner of the net.<br><br>Arsenal responded and Martin Laursen did well to get his body in the way of a powerful drive from Hleb.<br><br>The Denmark international got another crucial touch on a low drive from Emmanuel Adebayor which was enough to send it wide of the post.<br><br>But the visitors were building up momentum and in the 23rd minute they deservedly got back on level terms through Flamini's second goal of the campaign.<br><br>Adebayor's flick played in Eboue whose low cross took a deflection off Hleb to tee it up perfectly for Flamini whose well-struck shot flew past Carson.<br><br>Laursen's knack for being in the right place at the right time again proved crucial in blocking another effort from Flamini.<br><br>Villa were forced to make a substitution after 30 minutes when Petrov, who had been doubtful before the game with an ankle injury, limped out of the action to be replaced by Shaun Maloney.<br><br>Arsenal were still the dominant force and Carson clung on to a rising shot from Hleb.<br><br><strong>Visitors ahead</strong><br><br>It was no surprise when Adebayor put the Gunners ahead after 36 minutes via his eighth goal of the season.<br><br>Sagna drilled an inviting cross into the box and Adebayor's header flew past Carson despite the attentions of Mellberg and Knight.<br><br>Villa made a positive start to the second half and Laursen could have brought them level but he poked the ball wide from close range after good control by Carew had set up the opening.<br><br>Carew could have no complaints about being yellow-carded for a late challenge on Hleb which led to the midfielder being injured and replaced by Theo Walcott.<br><br>Young was now more of a threat and another inviting cross led to a Carew header thumping against the Gunners bar with Almunia well beaten.<br><br>But it was the nearest they came to finding a way through the Gunners' rearguard.</div>
