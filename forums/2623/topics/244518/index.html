            <div class='col-md body'>William Gallas admits he was frustrated by Arsenal's medical staff after being misled over the extent of his thigh injury.<br><br>The Frenchman returned to the Arsenal side in February following a three-month lay-off, but he had expected to be back in action much sooner and claims the club's medics diagnosed his problem incorrectly.<br><br>"It has been my most difficult season for a long time," he told L'Equipe.<br><br>"The most difficult part was remaining unclear. If I had known from the beginning that I would need three months, I would have accepted it.<br><br>"But at first they told me it was a cramp, when in fact it was a strained muscle.<br><br>"Do I have something against the Arsenal medical staff? A little, yes, with the error in diagnosis.<br><br>"The doctors did then do their best for me to come back, but in the end my season has not been satisfying."<br><br>Gallas also concedes it has been difficult to play for such an inexperienced side after leaving Chelsea last August.<br><br>He believes Arsenal's young players are full of promise but must learn quickly to turn good performances into winning results.<br><br>"I knew the Arsenal team was young, but day after day I have come to understand they really miss experience," he explained.<br><br>"We made mistakes that experienced players would never do.<br><br>"When I left Chelsea I knew we would remain behind for at least one year.<br><br>"We play very, very good football, but that is not enough. We have to fight, and have a killer instinct in front of the goal.<br><br>"We can't always rely on Thierry and the youngsters have to understand it.<br><br>"Our young players have to do more."</div>
