            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jose Mourinho has knocked Arsene Wenger's recruitment policy, while insisting that he focused on assisting the English game during his time as Chelsea manager.</strong><br><br>Arsenal boss Wenger has often been criticised for his process of signing up Europe's hottest talent, with Uefa president Michel Platini the most recent to hit out at The Gunners' current squad.<br><br>Mourinho, though, insists that he carefully managed Chelsea in order to develop the correct balance between home-grown players and footballers from abroad.<br><br>"Unlike Arsenal, we sought success and tried to build it through a concept of the game using English players," he says in his book <span style="font-style: italic;">Jose Mourinho a Born Winner</span>.<br><br>"That was to have a positive effect, on the dressing room and on the press, in terms of the image that the club would project.<br><br>"We had to get players who fitted the profile of the team but without running the risk of filling the club with foreign players because that could bring us problems in handling the players in the dressing room and the press, which is sensitive to the use of English players and doesn't easily forgive clubs which misrepresent the championship with complete intakes of foreign footballers.<br><br>"Of course the animosity of the English against (Roman) Abramovich was due to the idea that was established that the Chelsea owner was going to transform the club into a depot of players who came and went without any criteria other than spending money."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool-Jamie Carragher,Steven Gerrard,Jermaine Pennant,Peter Crouch.<br>Man City-Michael Johnson,Michael Johnson,Darius Vassell,Michael Ball.<br>Arsenal-Theo Walcott,Justin Hoyte,Matthew Connolly,Kerrea Gilbert.<br><br>Base on the info Arsenal do have some very young English players, in the past they had produce some good young English players who had been bought by some top English teams. Which in fact some team r not producing English players instead of buying them. And for National team, they r just selecting players from the big 4. So how many young English  telant did Mourinho produce ,just becos they had the money to spend over Arsenal? And the numbers of young telant produce by big 4 is lesser and lesser, so Mourinho and company r trying to presssure Arsenal for not able to buy enuff English players? They r scare of Wenger vision on buying young telanted players from oversea which other r losing money in buying old "super star".<br>Platini is another crap who want more teams in UCL so to make more $$ out of it, and lower the standard instead. The motive by all these is to criticise his success.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>England should blame themselves, their own breed of players are always so expensive compared to Brazilians who are much more talented than them. So what if there are no England players playing in Arsenal, clubs from other countries will still buy them if they are good, this shows that they are still not up to standard. 19 teams in the EPL have teams which contain 5&lt; english players, only 1 club does not, does it make a difference? So what if Arsenal is part of the Big Four, Chelsea and ManU already contain most of the England eleven.</div>
