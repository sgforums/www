            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsene Wenger insists he never considered quitting Arsenal for another club and has expanded on Thierry Henry's reasons for leaving Emirates Stadium.</strong><br><br>Earlier in September, Wenger ended the uncertainty surrounding his future in North London by signing a new contract.<br><br>The Frenchman concedes the departure of David Dein as vice-chairman made him question his future, but he always ruled out joining another team.<br><br>"Indeed at a certain time I had doubts," Wenger told France Football. "You always have that kind of thinking when you are close to the end of your contract.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difficult to swallow</span></strong><br><br>"But to go somewhere else? No, I never started any talks with any other club.<br><br>"David Dein's departure has been something very difficult to swallow. Anyway, David remains an Arsenal fan and he has always pushed me to stay at the club."<br><br>Wenger also explained that Henry, who joined Barcelona in a Â£16million deal, was not willing to wait around for the current Arsenal team to mature.<br><br><strong>Faith</strong><br><br>He continued: "Thierry Henry told me, 'Coach, it is true we have a good and young team. They will probably be very good, but I have not got more time to wait. Will the team be good next year or in two years? I don't know, but today I have to make a decision'.<br><br>"I replied, 'Thierry, I can perfectly understand your trouble. I believe that the team will be very good soon, but I understand you ask yourself such a question'.<br><br>"So he said, 'I want to leave'. That is why he left. Then, it is true that the departure of David Dein had an influence on his decision, in a way it helped it.<br><br>"Thierry's injuries also participated in his departure. He stepped a little back from the team and during some matches he probably thought, 'We won't win the national title'.<br><br>"Maybe Thierry felt the faith was not there anymore at certain times."</div>
