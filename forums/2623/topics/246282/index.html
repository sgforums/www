            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal announce Willow Foundation Matchday</strong><br><br>Arsenal Football ClubÂ’s home game against West Ham United on Saturday 7th April will be dedicated to its Charity of the Season, the Willow Foundation.<br><br>The charity, founded by Arsenal legend Bob Wilson and his wife Megs, offers quality of life and quality of time to seriously ill young adults aged 16-40 through the provision of special days. It will benefit from many awareness raising activities and charitable giving on the day including: a donation of fifty pence from each matchday programme, various raffles and bucket collections around the stadium and charity coverage on Arsenal TV and on perimeter boards.<br><br>Bob Wilson will be signing copies of his books, Beyond the Network and Googlies, Nutmegs and Bogeys (the profits of which go to the Willow Foundation) from 12 to 1.15pm in the Armoury megastore and merchandise from the ITV 2 show, WAGS Boutique, which is being sold in aid of the charity, will also be on sale in store.<br><br>Bob Wilson said: Â“It is an enormous honour to be Arsenal's Charity of the Season in such a significant year in the Club's history.  The association has opened up a host of opportunities for the Willow Foundation, todayÂ’s Matchday being one of them. With the tremendous support of the Club and the fantastic fans, the matchday will enable us to reach out to more seriously ill young adults throughout the UK, significantly increase awareness of our service and ultimately allow us to fulfil more special days wishes.Â”<br><br>Arsenal manager, ArsÃ¨ne Wenger said: Â“WeÂ’re delighted to have the Willow Foundation as our Charity of the Season for this special first season at Emirates Stadium.  We hope that the matchday will help to raise greater awareness and lots of funds for this wonderful charity. Bob was a terrific goalkeeper for the Club and is a true Arsenal great and weÂ’re so happy to be in a position to help secure the long-term future of the charity. Supporters have been fantastic in their support for the Charity of the Season and we hope that the matchday will help the Foundation grant many more special days.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Head to head: Julio Baptista v Carlos Tevez</strong><br><br>Cast your mind back to August and transfer deadline day and you may remember a slight fuss over goings-on at Upton Park.<br><br>West Ham United had struck a double deal which many believed would make them genuine contenders for a Champions League place. ArgentinaÂ’s World Cup duo Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano would spend the season wearing the claret and blue.<br><br>Things donÂ’t always turn out as expected though. Just six minutes of action between October and January saw Mascherano switch his Hammers shirt for the red of Liverpool, while Tevez only found his first goal for the club three matches ago Â— after 19 previous attempts.<br><br>Since then however the stocky striker has netted in three successive games and began to galvanise what was a sinking ship into one which has West HamÂ’s fellow relegation strugglers glancing over nervous shoulders.<br><br>Returning to transfer deadline day, Arsenal were also rushing through transfers of their own. William Gallas and Denilson signed permanently while Brazilian striker Julio Baptista joined on loan from Real Madrid. After a mixed start he too has showcased his talents since putting four past Liverpool at the turn of the year.<br><br>On Saturday, Â‘The BeastÂ’ and Â‘The BullÂ’ will lock horns at Emirates Stadium. But what do the statistics tell us about how the two have performed this season?<br><br>Well, as their respective nicknames (Tevez earned his in his homeland whereas Baptistia's was the invention of the Spanish press) suggest neither are short on power, and both have used that to run at their opponents. Tevez has done so more often, but has been dispossessed attempting 18 of his 33 dribbles. Our man on the other hand has been far more productive, finding a team-mate following 10 of his 15 forays forward.<br><br>When it comes to finding the net it was again Baptista who found his feet first. The burly Brazilian has eight goals in all competitions of which one Â— in last monthÂ’s 2-1 win over Reading - came in the Premiership. Yet despite Tevez not notching until the 4-3 defeat to Tottenham last month the ArgentineÂ’s purple patch has given him two more league goals than his counterpart. The pair have also provided two assists apiece for their respective teams.<br><br>Furthermore, the stats suggest they may have netted more often. Baptista has produced 27 shots so far of which 12 have been on their way to goal. Of those three have been blocked en route, eight have been saved and the one against Reading crept in. Tevez on the other hand has managed 20 shots on target and 20 off, had seven blocked and hammered the woodwork on two occasions.<br><br>Finally, they have performed with similar efficiency when it comes to distribution. A hamstring injury left Baptista on the sidelines earlier in the season and as a result he has played just 743 minutes, 355 fewer than his fellow South American. This is important when you consider Baptista has been accurate with 64 per cent of his passes at a rate of one every 13 minutes. Because, in comparison, Tevez has enjoyed success with 67 per cent of his passes but only at a rate of one every 16 minutes.<br><br>SaturdayÂ’s game may go some way to deciding where both sides will be playing their football next season. Arsenal need to cement that top four spot while time is running out on West HamÂ’s battle against the drop. The Emirates faithful have shown confidence in Baptista while Tevez, despite his troubles, is undoubtedly a fansÂ’ favourite too.<br><br>This weekend theyÂ’ll have a chance to prove their worth again. The battling qualities of Â‘The BeastÂ’ and Â‘The BullÂ’ are needed more now than ever.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wenger should study his plan and try to draw his opponent out of their half. Instead of applying counter attack they kana counter attack by Westham afew times and almost 2 nil down. Their defence is too relax and the midfield is not creative enuff.</div>
