              <p>Despite still only
              being a teenager, Walcott is preparing for his fourth season in the
              Premier League at Arsenal and is being tipped by many to enjoy a
              successful campaign in Arsene Wenger’s team.</p>
              <p>The youngster certainly has the backing of goalkeeper Almunia who, speaking in the <em>Telegraph</em>,
              claims that Walcott is going to be one to watch this season. He said:
              “I've seen him concentrating in pre-season and he knows it's going to
              be his season. He's going to have an important part to play in the
              squad.”</p>
              <p>The 19 year old finally began to stake a claim for a place in the
              first team last season and managed 25 appearances and 4 goals in the
              Premier League as Arsenal finished the season in third place.</p>
              <p>Whilst he is clearly gaining experience, Almunia suggests that
              Walcott doesn’t have much to learn on the pitch, other than to toughen
              up. He confessed: “The only thing Theo maybe has to improve is his
              character; he's a lovely guy on the pitch - I keep saying to him he has
              to become more nasty. After this he will be one of the best players in
              the Premier League.”</p>
              <p>However, the Spanish stopper is also expecting Walcott to improve
              this season and that Arsene Wenger’s experience with young players will
              help him to fulfil his undoubted potential.</p>
              <p>“When you are young at Arsenal you have to make use of the people at
              the club, use the facilities and improve,” said Almunia before adding,
              “It's impossible not to improve. You have to be stupid not to improve.
              I believe I'm a good example.”</p>
              <p>After four seasons in North London, Almunia finally got his hands on
              the number one spot last season and has managed to become the first
              choice goalkeeper at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>Despite reportedly not seeing eye to eye with former encumbent Jens
              Lehmann, Almunia happily paid tribute to his former team-mate.</p>
              <p>“The relationship I had with Jens drove me on,” confessed the
              Almunia before concluding, “I think Jens also made me a better keeper.”</p>
