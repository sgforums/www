              <p>Arsene Wenger led his side into a new era after watching Thierry Henry
              leave for Barcelona this summer, and his side began firing to an even
              greater degree than he could have imagined.<br><br>They were on top and
              looking like one of the best teams in Europe - certainly in England -
              but that now all seems so long ago, as their late season collapse has
              left their season almost looking rank average on paper.<br><br>For a
              top side as they are, to go a fourth year without a trophy, and only
              managing to get as far as the quarterfinals in the Champions League,
              almost signals a lack of progression. This, from a group of players who
              have come on leaps and bounds in a short space of time.<br><br><strong>Great Team</strong><br><br>While
              Wenger was keen to point out the Gunners' creditable points tally for
              the season, Gael Clichy highlighted the team's quality, and rued their
              lack of fortune. With injuries hitting key players, the full-back
              asserted that the Gunners did not have a squad as big as their rivals
              to cope quite as well.<br><br>“I think there are two ways of seeing our season,” Clichy told <em>Setantasports.com. </em><br><br>“Everybody has seen that we have a great team, we have qualities and we can play great football and we had some great results. <br><br>“But
              on the other side we haven’t won anything for three years now so we
              can’t say that the season has been positive but we can’t say it has
              been negative. <br><br>“Some people say Arsenal don’t deserve what they’ve got, some say the contrary, it’s up to anyone to have their own opinion. <br><br>“It has been negative in terms of trophies. <br><br>“Being at the top of the Premier League for seven months is quite impressive. <br><br>“We have shown everyone that we can play to a high standard in the whole season. <br><br>“Unfortunately
              we had some bad injuries including Eduardo [da Silva], we lost Robin
              [van Persie], Abou [Diaby] and Tomas Rosicky. <br><br>“That kind of player can make the difference anytime in a game. <br><br>“That
              was a big shame for us, a big blow to lose them, but once again you
              cannot hide behind injuries or being unlucky, we didn’t win anything
              and that is what matters in football.” <br><br><strong>Progress</strong><br><br>The
              Frenchman was pleased with his own season, in which he made the most
              appearances of all his team-mates, which pleased him in particular, due
              to his history of injuries.<br><br>“Just talking about myself, I
              haven’t been injured, which was the most important thing for me after
              all the injuries I had in the last couple of seasons," he explained.<br><br>“I think I improved a lot. I think I have room to progress. <br><br>“I
              work hard every day at training to do that. For me the season has been
              good but it could have been perfect if we had won something.” <br><br><strong>Big Blow</strong><br><br>Clichy added that he believes the lack of squad depth may have hurt the Gunners' prospects over the course of the season.<br><br>“I
              think the main reason is when you have a short team like we have got at
              Arsenal it’s good because everyone has the chance to play some games,"
              he noted.<br><br>“So the atmosphere is great but also when you miss
              players, like five of those, including Tomas Rosicky, one of the best
              midfielders in Europe, Robin van Persie one of the best strikers,
              Eduardo, that’s big blow and you can’t do anything about that. <br><br>“Look
              at Chelsea and Man United, you take Ronaldo, Rooney and Tevez out, and
              Chelsea you take Terry, Carvalho and Drogba out, it’s not the same
              team. <br><br>“So it’s really unlucky, I don’t know if we would have
              won the league with those players but for sure we’d have had more
              chances of doing it. <br><br>“We’ve got five players injured and it’s
              really difficult to cope with that and we tried, we tried really hard,
              and of course when you make the mistakes we made against Birmingham and
              Liverpool away, it’s difficult. <br><br>“We have plenty of quality and next season will be better.” <br><br><strong>Turning Point</strong><br><br>Many
              view the turning point in Arsenal's season as the 2-2 draw against
              Birmingham City. That game saw Eduardo da Silva stretchered off with
              his horrific leg break, and also saw the Gunners' concede a last-minute
              penalty - Clichy the offender - and the first of four successive league
              draws.<br><br>Replays revealed that the youngster got the ball. Captain
              William Gallas' infamous histrionics will have done his confidence few
              favours, but he believes it was Eduardo's injury that changed the
              season, and did not even address the controversial spot-kick.<br><br>“Personally
              I think that Birmingham was the turning point because we lost Eduardo
              when he was performing at his best," he opined.<br><br>“It took him six
              months to settle in English football and he scored some great goals. I
              think with him in the team we could have done something good. <br><br>“And as well we lost two points at the last minute so that was the turning point, I think.”</p>
              <p><em>he's so mature..not moaning like others and threaten to leave Arsenal. kudos to him</em></p>
