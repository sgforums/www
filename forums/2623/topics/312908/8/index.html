              <h2 class="ss-header hstyle2 main-headline">Gunners shot down by Reds</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Liverpool to face Chelsea in semi-finals after 4-2 win</h3>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Liverpool burst into
              the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League as Rafa Benitez's side
              claimed a 4-2 second-leg success over Arsenal in a dramatic encounter
              at Anfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A fascinating fixture - the third of the recent trilogy - ended
              5-3 on aggregate after last week's first leg at The Emirates ended in a
              1-1 draw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Abou Diaby handed The Gunners a dream start on 13 minutes when
              he fired past Jose Reina; but Sami Hyypia's thumping header drew the
              sides level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The free-scoring Fernando Torres then struck a classy second for
              the home side as The Reds appeared to be heading for the final four.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, Theo Walcott's sensational solo run saw him assist
              Emmanuel Adebayor, who tapped home to swing the tie back in Arsenal's
              favour on away goals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The drama continued to unfold, and Benitez's men made it 3-2
              just two minutes later as Steven Gerrard dispatched from the penalty
              spot after Kolo Toure felled Ryan Babel, before the Dutchman wrapped up
              the success in injury-time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Sensational</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Gunners started in sensational style, displaying blistering
              pace, strength in the tackle and sublime passing skills. Liverpool were
              stretched every way possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alexander Hleb, in a central role supporting Adebayor, was a constant danger and they were ahead in the 13th minute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anfield was stunned into silence as Hleb threaded a ball down
              the right for Abou Diaby to surge into the box before crashing home a
              shot between Jose Reina and his near post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For 30 minutes Arsenal had been impressive and Liverpool struggled against Arsene Wenger's men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, they equalised through veteran Hyypia. The 34-year-old,
              with a newly-signed contract this week, produced a towering header from
              Gerrard's corner that crashed into the net on the half-hour off Manuel
              Almunia's post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool were buoyed by their leveller and Gerrard flashed a 30-yard shot wide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then Arsenal suffered the blow of Mathieu Flamini being carried
              off after looking to have fallen awkwardly on an ankle. Gilberto came
              on after 40 minutes. By now Liverpool looked a changed side; steaming
              forward, their confidence restored.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Agonisingly</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fabio Aurelio's shot was deflected agonisingly wide by Crouch, Torres having provided the cross.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was the Spain striker, quiet up to that point, who forced
              Liverpool ahead. Crouch's flick-on reached the Liverpool goal machine
              in the box, he turned Senderos with ease before firing his shot into
              the top corner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wenger responded by replacing Diaby and Emmanuel Eboue with
              Robin Van Persie and Theo Walcott, knowing another Arsenal goal would
              put them through.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Adebayor then missed when clean through before Babel came on for Crouch, who left the field to a standing ovation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool switched back to their preferred system, with Gerrard
              working behind Torres while two holding players protected the midfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But with Liverpool on the attack, Arsenal caught them cold on
              the break. Walcott embarked on an amazing run from his own half before
              pulling the ball back for Adebayor to drill in the equaliser after 83
              minutes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, The Reds rallied. Straight from the restart, Babel surged into the box and was brought down by Kolo Toure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Swedish referee Peter Frojdfeldt pointed to the spot, and with
              the Kop in hushed agony, Gerrard drove the penalty high into the net.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>The end</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p>John Arne Riise came on for Torres, Liverpool desperate for the end now. Another Gunners goal would again see them through.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But with Arsenal up in numbers in Liverpool's box for a
              free-kick, the ball broke from the mass of players to be belted forward
              for Babel to outpace Fabregas to gloriously drive home the fourth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alvaro Arbeloa came on for a shattered Kuyt, and there was nothing left now from Wenger's men as Anfield celebrated.</p>

              <p><br>given tis kinda situation, i rather wenger spend big on signing henry n pires back again.</p>
              <p>n let's not forget number 23 is vacant for the moment, is wenger has a place for beckham in mind? getting him is good for arsenal in term of marketing value n free kick option.</p>

              <blockquote><em>Official post match from the boss - arsenal.com</em>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">on losing the game...<br></span></strong></span>"It's down to a dodgy decision by the referee I believe but also to a lack of concentration straight away when it was 2-2. We found Babel in the box straight from the kick-off and that's where the concentration dropped a little bit. I believe over the two games it's very difficult to swallow because it's a double disappointment. All the big decisions went against us and with three minutes to go we were qualified against a Liverpool team we feel we created more chances than."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">on coping with poor decisions...<br></span></strong></span>"I believe that we have to live with that and sometimes you have to swallow it. It is like that but it is very difficult to understand it because it was not a penalty tonight. I watched it clearly again. Last week [the challenge on Hleb] was a real penalty but we have to accept it. As well we have to accept in a game like that where we had so much control, but we were too naive. We lacked a little bit of maturity defensively."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">on how he felt when Adebayor scored...<br></span></strong></span>"I didn't think it was over, the game is until the end. I'm long enough in the job to know that anything could happen. I thought as well that we could have scored the third goal and we should have scored one before, we had a clear-cut chance to kill the game off."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">on his team's mental strength...<br></span></strong></span>"The mental strength of the team was fantastic tonight. We came from 2-1 to 2-2, we had a chance to score the third. [The defeat] was not down to mental strengths, it was down to big mistakes defensively. We conceded the first goal on a corner, the second goal I feel we gave Torres too much room. But this team has plenty of talent and potential, they are mentally strong. We just lack maturity in some situations."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">on whether Liverpool's experience made a difference...<br></span></strong></span>"No, what is happening at the moment is that for several weeks the team is shocked because they feel that everything goes against them at the moment. We lack that little bit of extra confidence because week after week we get disappointment after disappointment."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">on Arsenal's strong start...<br></span></strong></span>"I feel we played well in the first half. When you play away from home you know you will be a little bit under pressure but it was never really [heavy pressure]. I felt in the last 20 minutes that there was plenty of room to come back and score. But it didn't work and we go home. We lost the game 4-2 but that does not reflect what we produced tonight."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">on the injury to Mathieu Flamini...<br></span></strong></span>"Flamini has an ankle injury. I don't know how important it was but I felt Gilberto played well when he came on."</p>
              <p><span class="gold"><strong><span style="color: #dac088;">on picking the players up after this defeat...<br></span></strong></span>"It is very difficult to pick them up because the whole dressing room is completely down. If you lose against a team which is better than you then OK, but that's not the impression we got over the two games. Now we will try to finish the season strongly. We have a big disappointment tonight and a feeling of injustice, so that makes it doubly difficult."</p>
