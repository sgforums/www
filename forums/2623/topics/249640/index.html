            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Arsene Wenger does not want to discuss extending his Arsenal contract at least until the end of the season.</strong><br><br>The French tactician is currently tied to The Gunners until the summer of 2008 and has every intention of seeing out his deal.<br><br>The sudden exit of former vice-chairman David Dein was believed to have unsettled Wenger, although he is remaining firmly 'committed' to the club.<br><br>Wenger has until the end of next season on his current deal and wants to concentrate on the short-term before talking about the possibility of extending his Gunners stay.<br><br>"I don't want to speak about beyond my contract at the moment," he said at a press conference on Friday.<br><br>"I feel that it's more important to focus on the short-term and to leave that until the end of the season.<br><br>"I've said that I'm committed to the club. I have a contract until 2008 and if Dein had not left nobody one would asking me about this.<br><br>"I've always respected my contract and I'll give my best for as long as I'm here.<br><br>"I feel that it's important that I continue to give my best for the club, as I always do. I'm committed to doing that."<br><br>Wenger also reserved special praise for Dein, with whom he helped develop and bring success to Arsenal.<br><br>"We've lost a man of class, intelligence and competence who has contributed to the success and development of the club," he continued.<br><br>"David always had the club's best interests at heart. Even if I'm very sad, it is important that we keep the best interests of the club in his and my mind."<br><br>Meanwhile, Wenger is pleased with how his side have developed this term following a slow start, but is looking for more consistency next season.<br><br>"I feel the team is developing well, but we've not shown enough consistency this season," he continued.<br><br>"We've shown great quality in patches this season. Therefore the target is to transform that quality into consistency, that's down to maturity as well.<br><br>"Stability is important in my opinion and that will be maintained within the squad.<br><br>"My basic target it to keep winning until the end of the season. Money is not necessarily the key for success next season.<br><br>"We've gone through a difficult period. They will be up for it from the first game next season. They might surprise everybody."<br><br>Arsenal tackle Tottenham on Saturday in the North London derby, live on PremPlus, and Wenger is expecting another exciting encounter.<br><br>"We want to continue our winning steak. We want to go to White Hart Lane and win the game," noted Wenger.<br><br>"Recently in Arsenal and Spurs games both teams have gone for it and they have always been spectacular games."</span></div>
