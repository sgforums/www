            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has confirmed he was interested in Carlos Tevez until Manchester United made their move for the striker.</strong><br><br>The Argentina international joined The Red Devils last summer following a hugely successful second half of the season with West Ham.<br><br>Although Wenger was keen on bringing Tevez's quality to the Emirates, he opted against pursuing a deal once United's intent was confirmed.<br><br>With the likes of Robin van Persie and Emmanuel Adebayor set to start the season following Thierry Henry's exit, Wenger wanted to give the duo a confidence boost and the chance to impress.<br><br>"When I saw Manchester United on the case, I thought no," explained Wenger. "If they had not been on the case, yes.<br><br>"I would have analysed it and looked at how would it go. But it looked as if they were on the case early.<br><br>"However, I knew I had (Robin) Van Persie and Adebayor to play at the start. I wanted to give them confidence.<br><br>"Then I had (Nicklas) Bendtner behind and I wanted to give him confidence. [In the end] I looked for a player like Eduardo, who can play left wing, right or central."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investigate</span></strong><br><br>Meanwhile, Wenger wants to investigate whether there was a chance Adebayor could have left Arsenal last season for The Red Devils.<br><br>The French boss has confirmed no approach from Old Trafford was ever made for the 23-year-old Togo striker, who only extended his contract with the club back in May.<br><br>"I would first like to check that it's true," he continued.<br><br>"If it's not Adebayor, I think it's his agent. He had a contract at that time as well, anyway, and I have never been approached by Manchester United.<br><br>"He has extended his contract here since then."</div>
