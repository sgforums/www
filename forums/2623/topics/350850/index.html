              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Gael Clichy insists Arsene Wenger remains the ideal candidate to bring success back to Arsenal. </strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners have gone almost four years without a
              trophy, although they remain in the hunt for FA Cup and UEFA Champions
              League glory this term.</p>
              <p>That barren spell has seen Wenger's role come under scrutiny for the first time in his 12-season tenure.</p>
              <p>The
              Frenchman has seen his transfer policies questioned on a regular basis,
              while his young side are often criticised for lacking the steely
              determination required to compete for top honours.</p>
              <p>Clichy,
              though, believes any criticism of a man that has helped to mould the
              Gunners into a world-class outfit is out of order, with the full-back
              of the opinion that Wenger remains one of the best coaches in the
              business.</p>
              <p>"As a footballer you just want to focus on football,
              but when something like that happens with your coach it is difficult to
              cope with," he said.</p>
              <h4>Success</h4>
              <p>"That is the main thing for Arsenal, to have someone like Arsene Wenger as a manager.</p>
              <p>"You can play well even without your best player in the team, but the club cannot have success with many different coaches."</p>
              <p>Clichy
              believes Wenger has become a victim of his own success, with Arsenal
              having claimed seven major trophies under his guidance and established
              themselves as a force to be reckoned with at home and abroad.</p>
              <p>"In football you can have 10 fantastic years and then one year the results are not there, but that is the top level," he said.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal
              are who we are thanks in a big part to the boss, and people tend to
              forget a little bit. We have to realise he is an amazing coach.</p>
              <p>"The
              boss has shown that he has a lot of commitment to this club and all the
              success is down to him. We can respect what he has done for the club."</p>
