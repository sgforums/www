            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.football.co.uk/shared/images/news/400x400_MartinJolNew5.jpg"><br><br>Martin Jol last night told the Tottenham board he can emulate Arsene Wenger's achievements at Arsenal if he is given the time.<br><br>Despite their touchline clash of two seasons ago, the Dutchman hailed the French coach as "one of the best ever, certainly in England" before the two meet in the north London derby today.<br><br>But while Wenger's 11-year tenure at Arsenal is set to continue after he agreed a new three-year contract, the continuing uncertainty over Jol's position means he is clinging on to his job on a game-by-game basis.<br><br>Failure to break a self-confessed "mental barrier" against their local rivals - Spurs have not spiked the Gunners since November 1999 - could prove the final nail in the Dutchman's coffin.<br><br>After nearly three years in his job, Jol claimed he "had" enjoyed more continuity than many of his predecessors in the White Hart Lane ejector seat. But after two fifth-place finishes in the past two years, everyone at the club wants more.<br><br>And chairman Daniel Levy remains unconvinced Jol is the man to take Tottenham from best-of-the-rest to silverware winners. So victory today would be the Dutchman's best defence.<br><br>"We had that continuity," Jol said with repeated use of the past tense.<br><br>"I am here now for nearly three years and nobody else did that before.<br><br>"With the same continuity, I will do the same as Wenger. That is what I have said all along. But that depends on a few little things. A bigger stadium, turnover, wages. But we are doing fine with the tools we have got."<br><br>Levy has begged to differ after only one win in five so far this season. Champions League qualification is the minimum requirement, but Tottenham must start beating the big four to break into the big four.<br><br>Not only have Spurs not beaten Arsenal in nearly eight years, Jol's only win in 26 attempts in league and cup against top four clubs was against Chelsea last season. But the Gunners are a particular obsession at White Hart Lane. "My record against the top four is OK," claimed Jol. "I've had draws against Man United twice away, and a draw and a win against Chelsea last year.<br><br>"But you have to beat big teams, otherwise we will always be in the top five or six. That is not enough. We want to do better.<br><br>"We do have a mental barrier against Arsenal. Every game against Arsenal is special. My first game was a thriller (4-5 in November 2004). But it's time to get a win under our belts.<br><br>"Hopefully a win will be the first of many because for the last couple of years we have been stronger.<br><br>"We haven't beaten them since 1999 so there has to be a first time for everything."<br><br>To achieve that Spurs must neutralise Cesc Fabregas (inset) - "in the top three midfield players in England," says Jol - and outwit Wenger. It has so far proved beyond him.<br><br>But the Dutchman claims the two men share similar philosophies and their spat during the last Highbury derby two seasons ago - after Spurs scored when Emmanuel Eboue was down injured in the 1-1 draw - had even increased his respect for his opposite number.<br><br>Jol says: "My relationship with him is very good. Since he came up to me a couple of years ago I like him.<br><br>"If you have got Gallas and Toure it is easier to bring in the kids. We have done that as well.<br><br>"He must be one of the best managers ever, certainly in England. If we've got a lot of resources we can do the same here."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">LOL! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></div>
