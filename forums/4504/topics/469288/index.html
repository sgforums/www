              <p>I know that there already are a lot of forums out there asking similar questions, but i really hope someone would answer my questions here as those other forums i found have answers dating back a few years ago. Maybe things have changed in these 3 to 4 years.</p>
              <p>I have been accepted into NUS FASS and SMU biz. I am in a dilemma as to which to choose.</p>
              <p>Firstly, i want to get into Biz. So if i want to go NUS i would have to appeal. However I do like the SMU teaching style a lot. Hence I'm unsure if I should even go through the hassle to apply for an appeal. I am a little hesitant to accept the SMU offer as I am afraid that I would miss the opportunity to experience the campus lifestyle, such as in NUS. So here are my questions.</p>
              <p>1) Does SMU have a hostel which takes in singaporean first year students? I found the Prinsep Hostel, however it seems to only cater to international students.</p>
              <p>2) Even without staying in a hostel, are there enough opportunities given in SMU to allow me to feel a somewhat campus kind of lifestyle? eg. Activities organised by school such as parties, night events. I'm not talking about CCA though, I'm just enquiring about the whole "feel" while being in the school.</p>
              <p>3) Must one attain results which are good enough in order to take part in activities such as exchange programmes? or is it compulsory for all students to do so?</p>
              <p>I really do hope you guys would help me out here as i have no seniors from SMU at all. Thanks!!</p>

              <p>1) No, only international students are accepted.</p>
              <p>2) What's most important is the group of people that you are spending your time with. Sure, there are quite a number of parties and events (e.g freshmen and end-of-semester concerts), and a whole bunch of CCAs out there, but the "feel' would not be there without an amazing group of friends. This is applicable to every school, not just NUS or SMU.</p>
              <p>3) Grades does matter to some extent, but it also depends on the demand of the country and school that you would like to go to. For example, a school like UPenn is of course demanded by more students of high GPA, while a Korean university might be available to students with a lower GPA. I have friends with GPA of 3.0 going to Spain and enjoying his time in Europe.</p>
              <p>Enjoy the uni journey. Don't think too much about the teaching style. Everywhere is more or less the same (seminar-styled lessons exist in NUS and NTU too). It's more of how you approach your own learning.</p>
