            <div class='col-md body'>Love is like standing on wet cement, the longer you stay the harder it is to leave...and you can never go without leaving your prints behind...<br><br>True love hears what is not spoken, and understands what is not explained, for love doesn't work in the mouth, nor the mind, but in the heart...<br><br>"Love may leave your heart like shattered glass, but keep in mind that there's someone who'll be willing to endure the pain of picking up the pieces so you could be whole again"<br><br>sth frm email...<br><br>What does love mean? A group of professional people posed this question<br>&gt; to a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, "What does love mean?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have<br>&gt; imagined.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; See what you think:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint<br>&gt; her<br>&gt; toenails anymore. So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even<br>&gt; when<br>&gt; his hands got arthritis too. That's love." Rebecca - age<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You<br>&gt; know that your name is safe in their mouth." Billy - age 4<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; they go out and smell each other." Karl - age 5<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French<br>&gt; fries without making them give you any of theirs." Chrissy - age 6<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is what makes you smile when you're tired." Terri -age 4<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip<br>&gt; before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK." Danny - age 7<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of kissing,<br>&gt; you still want to be together and you talk more. My Mommy and Daddy are<br>&gt; like that. They look gross when they kiss." Emily - age 8<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening<br>&gt; presents and listen." Bobby - age<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who<br>&gt; you hate." Nikka - age 6<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it<br>&gt; everyday." Noelle - age<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still<br>&gt; friends even after they know each other so well." Tommy - age 6<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "During my piano recital, I was on a stage and scared. I looked at all<br>&gt; the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. He was the<br>&gt; only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore." Cindy - age 8<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else kissing<br>&gt; me<br>&gt; to sleep at night." Clare - Age 6<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken." Elaine -<br>&gt; age<br>&gt; 6<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is<br>&gt; handsomer than Robert Redford." Chris -age 7<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone<br>&gt; all<br>&gt; day." Mary Ann - age 4<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes<br>&gt; and has to go out and buy new ones." Lauren - age 4<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I let my big sister pick on me because my Mom says she only picks on me<br>&gt; because she loves me. So I pick on my baby sister because I love her."<br>&gt; Bethany- age 4<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars<br>&gt; come out of you." Karen - age 7<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she doesn't think it's<br>&gt; gross." Mark - age<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it. But if you<br>&gt; mean<br>&gt; it, you should say it a lot. People forget." Jessica - age 8<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Author and lecturer Leo Buscaglia once talked about a contest he was<br>&gt; asked<br>&gt; to<br>&gt; judge. The purpose of the contest was to find the most caring child. The<br>&gt; winner was a four year old child whose next door neighbor was an elderly<br>&gt; gentleman who had recently lost his wife. Upon seeing the man cry, the<br>&gt; little<br>&gt; boy went into the old gentleman's yard, climbed onto his lap, and just<br>&gt; sat<br>&gt; there. When his mother asked him what he had said to the neighbor, the<br>&gt; little<br>&gt; boy said, "Nothing, I just helped him cry."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hope this will make your day just a little bit better.<br></div>
