            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Story Of Fate</strong><br><br>There was a scholar who was to marry his fiancÃ©e, but on the day of marriage, his fiancÃ©e changed her mind and married someone else. The scholar was devastated and fell ill. His family seek all kinds of medical treatment for him, but still he showed no sign of recovery. They were about to give up hope on him when a wandering monk passed by. After learning about the scholar's condition, the monk walked to the scholar's bed and took out a mirror for the dying man to see.<br><br>In the mirror, the scholar saw a vast ocean, and the naked body of a murdered woman lay on the beach. A man passed by, looked at the body, shook his head and left. Another man who passed by saw the body, took off his robes to cover the body and left. Finally came a man passing by who saw the body, dug a hole and laid the body carefully to rest before burying it.<br><br>The scene in the mirror suddenly changed. The scholar saw his fiancÃ©e in a nuptial chamber and another man was lifting her wedding veil...<br><br>The scholar blinked at the monk, confused.<br><br>Slowly the monk explained, "The woman whose body you saw on the beach was your fiancÃ©e in her previous life. In your previous life, you were the second man who gave her his robes to cover her body. To repay your kindness in this lifetime, she loved you for a period of time and became your fiancÃ©e. However, ultimately the man whose favor she has to return for the rest of her life is the third man who buried her. And that man is now her husband."<br><br>Enlightened, the scholar sat up and recovered from his depression.<br><br>***<br>It is truly amazing -- this thing called "Fate".<br>There was a movie in which the theme song went like this: "You can<br>say it is a big world, you can say it is a small world. But for the promise of this lifetime, we shall spend our entire lives to fulfil."<br><br>All of us are in this big grand masquerade, among the throng of people, we seek expectantly... in that electrifying moment when our fingers touch, the masks are removed to reveal our true selves.<br><br>Before this moment, we were drifting aimlessly, not knowing what we<br>really wanted. Till you meet this particular person, you finally realize<br>what you really want is not what you have wished for in the first place. It amazes you that standing in front of this person is a different you! You without any mask!<br><br>Fate is not something meant to be forced upon. What is yours will<br>eventually come to your arms; what is not yours will never come to be. In any case, we should not lose heart and give up on our hopes for love that is true, good and beautiful.<br><br>The value of life, in a certain sense, is determined by the maturity of<br>how we love. Of how we give and accept love.<br><br>Treasure what you have... Time is too slow for those who wait;<br>Too swift for those who fear; Too long for those who grief;<br>Too short for those who rejoice; But for those who love...<br>Time is Eternity!</div>
