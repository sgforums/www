              <p><strong>Yes</strong>, of course it is happening, and it seems it could get worse. With that, I would like to ask you, the public, for your opinion on the topic and some questions as my group and I are doing a project on the topic.</p>
              <p>1. What could be causing people to be homeless in a country like <strong>Singapore</strong>?</p>
              <p>2. What could be done to help the situation get better?</p>
              <p>3. What is being done currently to help the situation?</p>
              <p>4. Who is actively working on this situation? Is the general public pitching in too?</p>
              <p>5. What would you do, in your power, to help these homeless people?</p>
              
              <p>If you have more questions, I'd appreciate if you would post them too. <strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

              <p>1)The economic of Singapore is blooming and expanding. Being a developed country, the living expectations grew higher and higher. The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer. In this society, being educated is essential to attain a job with acceptable income in order to own a living. Most of the non-educated people are having very low income. Furthermore, the population of singapore is proportionately greater then the space available. Thus, resulting in people to be homeless.</p>
              <p>2) Encouraging employers to hire people despite their background status. In addition, encourage more people to take up courses to enhance their knowledge and skills of different aspect. So that more people are able to find a reasonable income job--&gt; afford to own a house.</p>
              <p>3) Policy of distribution of income [if i'm not wrong]. Building of taller buildings so as to accomodate more people.</p>

              <p>1) Due to the increase in population, as well as, the limiting space in singapore. The number of flats in singapore cannot cater to the needs of all singaporean. Thus, the price of flats increase. Also, competition is faced in the working society, job opportunities are only provided for people who are highly educated. People who are not well educated can only fight for those jobs with low pays. Therefore, the poor people cannot afford the high price of flats. This result in people to be homeless in a blooming economy like singapore.</p>
              <p>2) I think that the situation can get better by changing the mindset of the employers. They should not always think that the educatates are the best as they are many people who are talented in other ways too. They just could not show their talent in studies, for example designing. They may not be strong in their language, sciences and mathematics. But they can have high skills. This will provide equal job opportunities for both the educated and non-educated.<br><br>3) Government had make use of the land to build new buildings. There are new companies which help people to find job that suits their abilities and preferences. This measures will reduce the high unemployment rate.<br><br>4) I think no.</p>

              <p>1) Loans from Banks intead of HDB cause banks are more strict with payment. once you have overdued payment for more than 3 months(if im not wrong) you will be forced out of your house.Of course its also due to the economic downfall that lead to many ppl losing their job or getting paycuts causing them not being able to pay for all the expenses incurred. Rising cost of grocery items also lead to more money needed to be set aside for grocery shopping.</p>
              <p>- I believe there's homeless people in any country, even in countres which are developed. in my opinion, it's not entirely the economy of that certain country which is causing this situation. it may be the person himself who doesn't love his life which eventually leads him to such pathetic state. or it's the lack of education or the upbringing of one's family..</p>
              <p>2) The government should provide financial  aids as its not that people dont want to work but its mostly due to problems with work, retrenchment, paycut etc. And people also need money to eat and continue living. but if all the money earned have to be set asside for bills, then what can they eat?</p>
              <p>- nothing much can really be done to prevent this situation. it's up to parents and the person himself. educate them and ensure they learn the meaning of life. cz some just dont appreaciate living in this world. to cure, however, you can just put them in welfare centres, make them go for courses so that they can live on their own, not begging for money or wandering at streets.</p>
              <p>3) Well so far there is the GST offset package to help  needy people to cope with the rising GST. There arent really places for homeless ppl to shelter. The only choice they have is to either live with relatives or rent a room but that the problem is that some people dont have jobs thus no income. Worst, no relatives and that lead to them being homeless.</p>
              <p>4) the government i guess. but still, they cant really help  everyone</p>
              <p>5) I will build a homes for the homeless people. but of course there have to be policies such that they have to get a job within a period of time and move into their own maybe rented home. otherwise everyone will want to use this facilities and wont want to work. that would be even chaotic</p>
              <p>- depends on what kind of power i have. parents really play an important role. they decide on their children's future, which in turn decides whether they become the homeless people or not. power of god, i choose not to have it 'cause its gonna be meaningless for me to help them. somebody just need to go to them, look into their faces in say wake up.</p>

              <p>There are a few point which i think why Singaporean maybe homeless.</p>
              <p>lets take the elderly and adults for an example.</p>
              <p>From what i think, elderly are homeless because:</p>
              <p>1. their children abundant them as their children's thinks that they are a burdened to them.</p>
              <p>2. Elderly are poor, as they do not have a fixed monthly income to support themselves, thus they have got no money to own or rent a house or even stay in the old folks home. Moreover elderly are old and they might not be as physically fit as the youngster, therefore it is hard for them to get a job.</p>
              <p>3. perhaps some of them cant be bother about whether is it necessary to have a home or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whereas for the adult:</p>
              <p>1. they are jobless or too poor, therefore they do not have money to own a house. </p>
              <p>2. they are overdependent on the government, as they think that the government would help them to settle their "homeless" problem.</p>
              <p>3.they are abundant by their family</p>
              <p>4. they think that having a house is useless to them as it only provides them a place to sleep, so they might as well stay under blocks or at any shelter they could find.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe it would be better if renting houses at a lower rate to those who have financial problems. Providing them with more aids, for example raising fund for the people who are really in need of such aid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From what i think, some flats[3 room flat ?] have been built specially for elderly  who do not have enough money to own or rent a flat. I believe that the rental are relatively low enough so that they could afford it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i believed that the government or organisations are working hard onto resolving such problems in Singapore. In my opinion, i do not think that most of the public is helping to resolve the problem, perhaps only a small amount of people are willing to do so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If i were given the power to do so, i would give them a large sum of money for the people who are really in need of the money. At the same time, providing them with a job, so that they have got money to own or rent a place for them to stay. Ensuring that all of them has got a place to stay.</p>

              <p>1) Well, to me, there are a lot of reasons. However, the main reason would of course be money. Without money they can't buy houses or flats to live in, right? Another reason I feel would be the social responsibility. As we all know, some irresponsible people would cheat their parents of money, causing them to be homeless. Of course, like what fionker said, its partly due tothe inflating economic. As we know, the recent oil prices have gone up, this would surely affect those of a lower income group,  putting more people in the danger of being homeless.</p>
              <p><br>However, the homeless might not be the ones of lower income. The increase of usuage of credit cards and hire purchase in recent times, I feel, has a part to play as well. Many who over spent end up facing bankruptcy. Many would sell off their house/houses to pay, causing them to be homeless. Same thing would happen for those who burnt their fingers through stocks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Many could be done to help them. First of all is of course jobs. With jobs, these people could earn a living and hopefully, live a better life. However, I feel that we could only help the minority. From my view, I feel that most homeless people a those of an old age, many of which do not have family. Even with jobs, they could only earn enough for the day's meal. Many are also not able to work, due to medical or physical conditions. I feel that only something like a free old folks home could cater to the needs of these people, helping them to pass the last few years of their life.</p>
              <p>I feel that inorder to prevent more people to be homeless, the public must be educated. They should be taught how to not over spent and how to save for a rainy day. More loan schemes could be introduced to the lower income group, so that they would be able to purchase a flat and stillbe able to pay in years to come. I do not feel that Singapore has a shortage of flats, for now. But I do feel that there should be cheaper flats to cater to the really poor people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) I think that the government is all along doing something(s) to help.From what I know, they have allowed more flexible housing loan schemes to cater to the lower income group. They have also set up funds to help them. Other various groups like NTUC, CDAC, MENDAKI, SINDA, are also always helping the poor. For example NTUC Fairprice had absorbed GST for a period of time, as well as give special prices to household goods.</p>
              <p>4) The organisations mentioned above. The general public helps out by giving donations or doing charity work. The public could donate theirrecent GST package/ GST rebate (or something similar, not sure of exact name) to those who are really in need. This is also another way which the public is helping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) For me, I would help them is they needed some help on the streets. I would not donate any money to them though, as this would encourage begging. I'm not sure how can I help them, as I feel the only people who can help them the most are themselves.</p>
