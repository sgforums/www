Many go in dont even know how to tie shoelace properly. Some have weird habits. Some are like chao gu niang. When we ORD , we become like a man - independent, mature, skilled. We dont complain much like last time. Some used to be havoc, now tone down already.<br><br>Living here for many years, I rather serve NS, than to suck thumb in Malaysia. NS equals military deterence, and deterence equals peace for the past nearly 40 years of independence. Malaysia first prime minister threatened to squeeze us if we let out even a pip. Now, they check our water supply daily to make sure they are not sabotaged.<br><br>If you go JB, chances are you will be robbed. You want to go Hawaii? Forget it. At least here officers and sergeants know their limits. Caucasian see one Chink, they see him as a target for bully.<br><br>I heard a story once about a SAF colonel addressing a parade. "I hate SAF, but I love my country" . If you hate SAF, do something about it. NS is a totally different matter altogether. Whatever problems we have here on NS, the Swiss, Israelis, Swedes, Taiwanese and Koreans are also having the same problems.<br><br>Mistreatment does not equal lousy policy.<br><br>I do love Singapore, and will never migrate anywhere else.

You lose your reasoning on the issue of NS, and even started this topic on a emotional grounds (chao guniang). When run out of ammunition, you started to be nastier to people. Like the Hulk, you rampage the grounds and not let anyone off. It tells us a lot about yourself. Simply amazing creature you are. (smirks) . You want to look down on people? Remember, there is this Chinese saying, one mountain is higher than another.<br>Second grade or not, thats not the point, coz you are using this thread to vent stupid frustrations and KBKB.

Did your father sexually abused you when young? Did you always run to your mother whenever you have problems and came bawling?
