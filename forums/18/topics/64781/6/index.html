            <div class='col-md body'>Well, maybe if he go for sex change, he can suck cock too.<br><br>For your information guys, I was born in Malaysia, and later moved to SG. Got my citizenship here too. Served my NS, got downgraded coz of wear and tear on ankle during NS.<br><br>Thinking about NS. I seen my friends turned for better. Many go in dont even know how to tie shoelace properly. Some have weird habits. Some are like chao gu niang. When we ORD , we become like a man - independent, mature, skilled. We dont complain much like last time. Some used to be havoc, now tone down already.<br><br>Living here for many years, I rather serve NS, than to suck thumb in Malaysia. NS equals military deterence, and deterence equals peace for the past nearly 40 years of independence. Malaysia first prime minister threatened to squeeze us if we let out even a pip. Now, they check our water supply daily to make sure they are not sabotaged.<br><br>If you go JB, chances are you will be robbed. You want to go Hawaii? Forget it. At least here officers and sergeants know their limits. Caucasian see one Chink, they see him as a target for bully.<br><br>I heard a story once about a SAF colonel addressing a parade. "I hate SAF, but I love my country" . If you hate SAF, do something about it. NS is a totally different matter altogether. Whatever problems we have here on NS, the Swiss, Israelis, Swedes, Taiwanese and Koreans are also having the same problems.<br><br>Mistreatment does not equal lousy policy.<br><br>I do love Singapore, and will never migrate anywhere else. Last stop. Period.<br><br></div>
