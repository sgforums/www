            <div class='col-md body'>Many of you use the reason "we're very lucky compared to other countries, hence we shouldn't complain" ... which I felt was a red herring and doesn't address the problem.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">well... there ARE alot of countries who are inferior to us... in a war against Malaysia... i would say we have a 75% chance that we will win...</span><br><br>This is another false dilemma. We can still have a *shorter* national service and still produce citizens who can defend themselves and trained for war. Moreover, why issit so important that every singaporean (at least the males) have to be trained for war?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">a shorter NS will result in fewer experience... experience is a great deal in a real WAR... imagin a soldier with 5 years of experience handling a gun compared to one who has onli 1 year...</span><br><br>Your analogy is no good, even misleading, since<br>1.the soldiers defending Singapore then were not even singaporeans.<br>2. our professional army can still be trained *professionally* in jungle warfare.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">well firstly, the soldiers were nt even singaporeans... do u think u will fight for a country where u were nt born in? mabe yes... but nt full-heartedly... the soldiers of Malayan at that time... were juz HOLDING out time... they were retreating and retreating... and most of the operations stop cos they were betrayed!  Secondly, there WERE singaporeans in the army... but the numbers compared to Malayan soldiers were much smaller... again... these ppl are usually the first one to die... cos they were fighting for their country as well as their loved ones... u think it is very easy to be trained in jungle warfare? professionally somemore within the period of less than 21/2 years? maybe it is possible... but wat bout other aspects? </span><br><br>Your example using China is laughable. You think IF China really attack us, we can still WIN ah? Wah leow .... I dunno you have such high confidence in our military (regulars + NSFs) leh ...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">if China attack us... seriously i will give us a 50% chance of winning... u look down on our military too much... our military are much better compared to China...</span><br><br>So? What's it about handing over nuclear weapons? You've not shown conclusively that US will most likely sit back and let an invasion take place. On the contrary, I give you example of Yugoslavia, Desert Storm '91 etc ...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">y US would nt attack North Korea is cos there is nothing there that they wan... y don they attack even though North Korea still own nuclear weapons... y do they attck Iraq even though United Nations ask them nt to? cos of the resources...</span><br><br>You think with US and other foreign interests in Singapore they'll not gain a single thing by helping us?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> let's faced it... if there is a threat of war... US citizens will be out of this counrty before u even realise it...</span><br><br>Who says our fully equipped professional army don't have any trained soldiers? I find your view of things here very laughable.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">u juz said tat u wan the training period to be shorter... more n jungle warfare... u think there is sufficient time to train the soldiers to equip other things? i find ur view more laughable...</span><br><br>You gave incredible proposition mah, so this discussion is without any rein liao ... anyway your USA attacking us already make them condemned forever also .. haha<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">y is being attacked by US condemned? let's faced it... nt all the countries are for US... whereas terroists are condemned in most of the countries... </span></div>

But if you're comparing on the basis of military (you said we're much better), then of course China will win.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>y do they attck Iraq even though United Nations ask them nt to? cos of the resources... </strong></span><br><br>This is your view. The argument goes deeper than this, let's not make any hasty generalization. Iraq is not exactly North Korea.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>let's faced it... if there is a threat of war... US citizens will be out of this counrty before u even realise it... </strong></span><br><br>The interests refer not only to the lives of US citizens, but their investments, companies etc. And we're ally with US in many other aspects, so our relations are better than you think.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>u juz said tat u wan the training period to be shorter... more n jungle warfare... u think there is sufficient time to train the soldiers to equip other things? i find ur view more laughable... </strong></span><br><br>All the while, I separate the regulars (aka professional military) from the NSFs. Which one you referring to now?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>y is being attacked by US condemned? let's faced it... nt all the countries are for US</strong></span><br><br>Why is attacked by US without any tangible reason not condemned?
