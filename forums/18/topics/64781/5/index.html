            <div class='col-md body'>In time when war do broke out...i dun think you will have the time to make it to the destination to bake in the sun. Most likily be hiding in selters trying hard to accept the facts that Singapore are in war. Besides if Singapore do go to war, i think that will be close to the brink of a world war again. so do u think u can enjoy? if u happen to be out of Singapore, u are jus a 2nd class cv and u will still have to dogde missles and bullets if war does spreed while we at least well equip well fed able to fight. Dignity! If to die we will die with frens or love one by side. We at least will be remembered in history for bravery if there is. Our child if they survive will be walking with head high with pride....<br><br>The problem with people is they refuse to work as one, and thus diversified. Just like a bunch of sticks, the thinker the harder to break. A single sticks will just break too easily. If u study the early history of war, most defeats due to selfish individuals.<br><br>what if some 1 chat with u while u bake under the sun and singapore is in war...<br>"Hi, where r u from?"<br>"From Singapore..."<br>"Issnt Singapore at war? Dun u intend to help...?"<br>how would ppl look at u when u travel around with Singapore passport while Singapore is at war?<br><br>Well unless...<br>1. U are not Singaporean...<br>2. Loser that feels nothing wrong about it...<br>3. abanden your love ones when they are in danger...<br>4.

            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF is not meant to deter countries with strong military powers but rather, it's more to defend ourselves against some of our neighbours.<br><br>Many people have doubts that with our small size, can we really defend ourselves, even from our neighbours who are reportedly lacking behind us in terms of military power? the truth is nobody knows that until we really fight, as winning a war depends on many factors, not just the technologies of ur forces.<br><br>however, one thing for sure is the "posion shrimp" analogy.. that is we might be small, but we still can give them a bad stomachache if they eat us.<br><br>any countries who want to attack us must be prepared to get a serious punch from us even if we will lose eventually.<br>just like the saying in matrix revolution - "IF WE MUST GO, WE GIVE THEM HELL BEFORE WE GO!"<br></div>

All I can do is sit around and do data entry....I'm serving my NS in SCDF. Most of u guys might think SCDF do nuttin, damn lobo. That's where u guys are wrong. Who'se there to give 1st aid in a serious accident? Who's there to fight the fire when ur house is buring? Those guys out there are NSFs, juz liek most of you out there. Without them, things can go horribly wrong... i think u guys noe wad I mean.<br><br>My point here is being that is if no 1 is willing to serve NS, who else will be there for our own people? The past 2 world wars have proven a lot to us. There is no one to count on except ourselves.<br><br>There is this song in the army dat goes: "Have u ever wondered?

Too hard, not happy just quit... too pampered, can't take hardship.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SumOne:</div><div class="quote_body">As I already said, singaporeans have other jobs to choose, so usually, capable people who know they can do better outside would definitely choose jobs elsewhere but the army. And quite often, regulars are those who have no choice but to work in army and don't have the ability to find better jobs elsewhere.</div></blockquote>haha this is a bit long/unfair liao...sorry dun mean to start flaming someone(no pun intended) but i just wanted to discuss this...<br>It is also many 'capable ppl' who gets close brush with laws because they think they can outsmart others or those that are jobless...so those so 'capable ppl' are really capable, maybe a few really are. In SAF there are ppl, who is offered job from outside sector as well...<br><br>Summary:<br>Government or commerce. same same...ultimately my point will focus on mindset. If u have to do it, do ur best...[/quote]</div>
