            <div class='col-md body'>one of the rare times i see an intellectual discussion in Bar. Ok while we as citizens of singapore should serve NS, our country on the other hand does owe a debt to those who have died or become crippled in the course of serving the nation. It seems like the compensation paid out to the unfortunate victims are often paltry, and the govt seems to just try to hush hush the case up, and brush over everything like nothing;s ever happened. Victim's families are under compensated, which i think is very un fair. A fair number of my fellow NSFs, who during training, have picked up injuries serious enough to downgrade, and which have left permanant lingering side-effects, are oft view with suspicion that we are faking our injuries, or making them out to be more severe than they seem, to get a "good" life. I think that is inherently unfair, and the we do not owe our country one-way, but our country and the SAF also owes us their honour at pledging to take care of us, failing which, they owe us their honour at at least according us fair and proper treatment, both medical, and in attitude. Its the least they can do after their miserable failure in keeping their honour.</div>

Ok fight like how you been train for and I will be watching how you people lose . Shooting at targets and shooting at real people are totally different . You pause for one second in front of the enemy and you are worm food ...</div></blockquote>ok for all my misgivings about Singapore n SAF and the govt, this is where i will still disagree with you. I will fight,  even though to be honest, ultimately, for all who fight, death is only certain for we are too small, too bigotted in our warfare to win. We are more interested in showcasing our technology, how smart we are so on and so forth. Once during a NE seminar, i put forth a question to the SAF officer addressing us. He was talking about how the SAF trains their officers to think that victory is certain, so I put it to him: "The Israelis commanders had the same attitude of 'victory is certain' resulting in them being grossly unprepared for the Arab onslaught during the Yom Kipper war, especially at Golan Heights. Only the tenacity of their ground troops, who fought to their deaths, as a result of the commander's complacency, prevented the Arabs from over-running Golan Heights, and ensured the survival of Israel. Now aren't we training our commanders to fight under a dangerous mindset?"<br>His reply? Oh we, mummble mummble, because we are small... mummble mummble... and then his voice trailed off.... really conficence inspiring... I know for sure if we ever fight a war, we're doomed. But, I'll fight. Nvm the dying.</div>

We can still have a *shorter* national service and still produce citizens who can defend themselves and trained for war. Moreover, why issit so important that every singaporean (at least the males) have to be trained for war?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">a shorter NS will result in fewer experience... experience is a great deal in a real WAR... imagin a soldier with 5 years of experience handling a gun compared to one who has onli 1 year...</span><br><br>Your analogy is no good, even misleading, since<br>1.the soldiers defending Singapore then were not even singaporeans.<br>2. our professional army can still be trained *professionally* in jungle warfare.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">well firstly, the soldiers were nt even singaporeans... do u think u will fight for a country where u were nt born in? mabe yes... but nt full-heartedly... the soldiers of Malayan at that time... were juz HOLDING out time... they were retreating and retreating... and most of the operations stop cos they were betrayed!  Secondly, there WERE singaporeans in the army... but the numbers compared to Malayan soldiers were much smaller... again... these ppl are usually the first one to die... cos they were fighting for their country as well as their loved ones... u think it is very easy to be trained in jungle warfare? professionally somemore within the period of less than 21/2 years? maybe it is possible... but wat bout other aspects? </span><br><br>Your example using China is laughable. You think IF China really attack us, we can still WIN ah? Wah leow .... I dunno you have such high confidence in our military (regulars + NSFs) leh ...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">if China attack us... seriously i will give us a 50% chance of winning... u look down on our military too much... our military are much better compared to China...</span><br><br>(SORRY FOR USING CAPS LOCK)<br><br>I DONT BELEIVE SINGAPORE HAS 1% CHANCE OF WINNING.

YOU DO REALISE THAT CHINA HAS WON MANY WARS, THEY DID WRITE A FAMOUS BOOK ON IT(FORGOT NAME) AND I DONT THINK THEY WILL ATTACK SINGAPORE EITHER, THEIR HISTORY SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE NEVER INVADED ANOTHER COUNTRY UNLESS PROVOKED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THEY ATTACKED INDIA DUE TO HIMLAYIAN MOUNTAIN DISPUTE.<br><br>So? What's it about handing over nuclear weapons? You've not shown conclusively that US will most likely sit back and let an invasion take place. On the contrary, I give you example of Yugoslavia, Desert Storm '91 etc ...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">y US would nt attack North Korea is cos there is nothing there that they wan... y don they attack even though North Korea still own nuclear weapons... y do they attck Iraq even though United Nations ask them nt to? cos of the resources...</span><br><br>OK HERES THE THING, THEY DID NOT SAY THEY WOULD NOT ATTACK NORTH KOREA.<br><br>NORTH KOREA DOESNT OWN ANY NUCLEAR ARSENAL, US HAS ALREADY SAID THAT ONE KEY INGREDIENT WILL TAKE DUNNO 10 YEARS OR 40 YEAR TO DEVELOP/PROCESS(NOT TOO CLEAR MYSELF). US DOESNT WANT THEM TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY.<br><br>MOREOVER NORTH KOREA IS A COMMUNIST AND HAS STRATEGIC VALUE. YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT TAIWAN AND PHILLIPINES FOR EXAMPLE OR EVEN LOOK AT SINGAPORE.<br><br>You think with US and other foreign interests in Singapore they'll not gain a single thing by helping us?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> let's faced it... if there is a threat of war... US citizens will be out of this counrty before u even realise it...</span><br><br>Who says our fully equipped professional army don't have any trained soldiers?

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, wonderful.<br>Another NS hater.<br><br>What you get from NS, quite simply, is either<br>A) basic combat training<br>b) basic clerk training.<br><br>That is, if you didn't go for a number of courses, such as ranger, commando and such.<br><br>Yes, you can choose to rot in NS, slack off. Or you can choose to avail yourself of the facilities there. Learn something in there. Heard of the E-prep? You can actually learn something useful while "rotting" away in NS.<br><br>In any case, you will have learnt how to survive in a office, or god forbid, survive in combat, which i doubt you can.<br><br>Let me give you a bit of history. In WWII, Hitler did something called the Holocaust. I need not go into details, but it involved the killing of of people he considered undesirable. Why? Not because of education, sex, material goods, but their RELIGION.<br><br>How would you feel if you were rounded up and stuck into a camp just because of your belief? Now, everybody knows that.<br><br>But does everybody know that before "kristallnacht", Hitler initiated a arms control act, which required all privately owned weapons to be registered to "keep track" of them? And the same lists were used to confiscate the weapons.<br><br>Now, ask yourself. Would the Jews have died in such ... horrendous numbers if they had a rifle or pistol for every 4 or 5 able-bodied men? No.<br><br>If they had been organised into a armed forces or even militia, could they have resisted the Wehrmacht and perhaps even survived to evacuate their dependents? YES.<br><br>The point is this.<br>A armed human is a citizen.<br>A unarmed human is a subject.<br><br>Which would you rather be?</div>

But the very same feeling is incited, as it is human nature, even when you're a pacifist and hardcore supporter of arms control. Is this contradictory? No.<br><br>Does owning a rifle change anything, other than killing a few more Japanese? If anything, it will only escalate the bloodbath. If you know the history, the Japanese MASSACRED unarmed people/civilians openly 'cos of the violent resistance faced! They even mutilated the bodies of soldiers! An account is told of bodies (think Indian soldiers?) hanging on trees along Bukit Timah Road, near the present Ngee Ann Poly. The result of the Bukit Timah battle. And the Alexandra Hospital Massacre was initiated by what? I don't think I need to go on.<br><br>The Kempeitai rounded up many groups of people, and one of them is the milita or soldiers from SVC. Imagine if more people were SVC and they told the truth. All die lor.<br><br>I think if the males are combat trained, as in the case now, then the aggressors have no qualms about shooting into the civilian crowd, to defend themselves. ALL males are automatically suspect, since they have the capability to fight back.</div>
