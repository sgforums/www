Who say that NS has to be tough training? A modified BMT for females is possible, to teach them the fundamentals of combat, so that they can defend themselves and the kids during FIBUA. But I think females can serve in the civil defense, with more emphasis on nursing skills.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ppl who completed army usually get more pay than those who never go army isn't it?</span><br><br>Of course la ... the guys are already 2 years behind their female counterparts who graduated first and find work first, hence earning more than the guys (2 years pay difference).<br><br>Moreover, NS is seen as some sort of work experience, so it's justified that the *starting* pay is higher.</div>
