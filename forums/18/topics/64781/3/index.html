A modified BMT for females is possible, to teach them the fundamentals of combat, so that they can defend themselves and the kids during FIBUA. But I think females can serve in the civil defense, with more emphasis on nursing skills.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">if the training is nt tough hw do u think they will be able to protect the child AS WELL AS thamselves? use wat? tai ji quan?</span><br><br>Of course la ... the guys are already 2 years behind their female counterparts who graduated first and find work first, hence earning more than the guys (2 years pay difference).<br><br>Moreover, NS is seen as some sort of work experience, so it's justified that the *starting* pay is higher.<br><br>[i]as u said...

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">I don't see what's wrong with complaining per se, as it can be a form of fighting for improvement ...<br><strong>er... wat have this got to do with NS?</strong></span><br><br>Many of you use the reason "we're very lucky compared to other countries, hence we shouldn't complain" ... which I felt was a red herring and doesn't address the problem.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">if there is no national service hw do u think the singaporeans will be trained for war?</span></strong><br><br>This is another false dilemma. We can still have a *shorter* national service and still produce citizens who can defend themselves and trained for war. Moreover, why issit so important that every singaporean (at least the males) have to be trained for war?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">So? Are you implying a professional army, one that doesn't conscript, is not well-trained?<br><br><strong>tat was nt professional enough... if you read history correctly... most of the soldiers were nt trained in jungle warfare and tat's y they lost to the Japanese so badly... </strong></span><br><br>Your analogy is no good, even misleading, since<br>1.the soldiers defending Singapore then were not even singaporeans.<br>2. our professional army can still be trained *professionally* in jungle warfare.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">If the country attacking us is China for example... US may or may nt life a finger to help us... tat will depend on the frienship between them isn't it?</span></strong><br><br>Your example using China is laughable. You think IF China really attack us, we can still WIN ah? Wah leow .... I dunno you have such high confidence in our military (regulars + NSFs) leh ...<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">US maintain a military pressence... and yet they could nt get North Korea to hand over nuclear weapons?</span></strong><br><br>So? What's it about handing over nuclear weapons? You've not shown conclusively that US will most likely sit back and let an invasion take place. On the contrary, I give you example of Yugoslavia, Desert Storm '91 etc ...<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">amazing... US will onli help if they gain something from it... u think they are "so" kind?</span></strong><br><br>You think with US and other foreign interests in Singapore they'll not gain a single thing by helping us?<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">a fully equipped army without any trained soldiers... are nt sitting ducks... it is plain commit suicide... </span></strong><br><br>Who says our fully equipped professional army don't have any trained soldiers? I find your view of things here very laughable.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">if tat really happens? singapore will be condemned forever... getting help from terroist shd nt be the way.</span></strong><br><br>You gave incredible proposition mah, so this discussion is without any rein liao ... anyway your USA attacking us already make them condemned forever also .. haha</div>
