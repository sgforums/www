            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a conversation that took place in 2000 between a 25 Year old analyst from Germany at an investment bank (these people draw close to 10K USD a month), lets call him Analyst and a 23 year old temp who just out of NS waiting to go to NTU. We will call this guy Temp.<br><br>I swear, that the temp guy is not me.<br><br>Analyst : You draw good powerpoint slides. So you are an intern set on become an analyst too?<br><br>Temp: No lar.. haha. I am going to study after June.<br><br>Analyst: Yes.. yes. Almost everyone here has an MBA. You should get it too. Its really a necessary bridge to rising to become a consultant. I did mine at Wharton and was an intern here less than 2 years ago. Prior to that, I spent 3 years on an engineering degree back home in Germany.<br><br>So where were you from?<br><br>Temp: Me? Nanyang Junior College. That's the equavalent to the senior years of high school in the US.<br><br>Analyst: You are 22 now aren't you?<br><br>Temp: Yes. After that, I got conscripted into the army for 2 and a half years. Mandatory National Service.<br><br>Analyst:  ...must have been fun. After my engineering degree, I toured North and South America for several months, traveling from Seattle to Mexico alone on a back pack. Then went on for my MBA..but hey.  You mean you haven't got your college degree?<br><br>Temp: Not yet. I will do it this June.<br><br>Analyst:  So you will be.. 26 when I see you again back here? I hope to be somewhere else in 3 years though. Like strategy consulting at McKinsy or something. Pay's good.<br><br>Temp: I wish. But for now, its back to work at $8 an hour, drawing charts for the analyst. ha.<br><br>Today, almost 4 years later, the temp draws $2000 a month, graduated from NTU and testing sound card. Last heard, the analyst has gone on to become a senior consultant at some big name management consulting firm.

If anything, it will only escalate the bloodbath. If you know the history, the Japanese MASSACRED unarmed people/civilians openly 'cos of the violent resistance faced! They even mutilated the bodies of soldiers! An account is told of bodies (think Indian soldiers?) hanging on trees along Bukit Timah Road, near the present Ngee Ann Poly. The result of the Bukit Timah battle. And the Alexandra Hospital Massacre was initiated by what? I don't think I need to go on.<br><br>I think if the males are combat trained, as in the case now, then the aggressors have no qualms about shooting into the civilian crowd, to defend themselves. ALL males are automatically suspect, since they have the capability to fight back.</div></blockquote>IF YOU KNOW YOUR HISTORY.<br>WELL!<br><br>Then you should know that the allies outnumbered the japanese.<br>Combine that with a citizenry trained and armed, every last able-bodied man, and you get a few additional battalions of infantry.<br><br>Have you thought that a bit more resistance, and the Japanese might not even have succeeded in winning?<br>Wow, multilating bodies of soldiers. What a surprise. It's been around since Roman times, if not before. When your a soldier, and you know your to be mutilated or worse if you surrender, what do you do? Fight to the death.<br><br>You Think. You think, i thought, and who's going to confirm?<br>By your THINKING, should we ever fall in battle, everyone above the age of 18 needs to be lined up and SHOT.<br><br>Oh, and how should we prevent the mutilation of our (soldier's) bodies while alive? The answer, fight.<br><br>I point you to Iwo Jima. There, almost every last Japanese soldier held their ground. And in doing so, won themselves a honorable death in accordance with their warrior ethos.<br><br>But wait a minute, have you went through NS?<br>What do you know about warrior ethos?<br>And what would you know about historical cases where armed militias turned back professional soldiers?<br>There's a recent case.<br>Somalia.<br><br>I rest my case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Johnston:</div><div class="quote_body">Then you should know that the allies outnumbered the japanese.<br>Combine that with a citizenry trained and armed, every last able-bodied man, and you get a few additional battalions of infantry.<br><br>Have you thought that a bit more resistance, and the Japanese might not even have succeeded in winning?</div></blockquote>Well, history is full of "what if", what if we have more citizen soldiers, what if Yamashita or Tsuji wasn't born etc? From hindsight, it's easy to say if we have that bit of resistance, we might win, but is this the case? Who's to say too many cooks will not spoil the broth? Who's to say with your well-trained infantry battalions in place, the British will not cock up, 'cos of over-confidence or some other reasons? Everything is armchair speculation. There're simply too many variables in the equation. To be fair, I will not say whether your scenario will guarantee victory for the Allies (in spite of the fact Johore Bahru is not Dunkirk, we're not Britain and we don't have good air force and navy and a channel to prolong the battle).<br><br><blockquote>Wow, multilating bodies of soldiers. What a surprise. It's been around since Roman times, if not before. When your a soldier, and you know your to be mutilated or worse if you surrender, what do you do? Fight to the death.</blockquote>I do not know how the common Allied soldier then viewed the Jap soldier. Is the latter bloodthristy to the extent that they mutilate every POW? But I think they know if they incur the wrath of the Japs, mutilation of soldiers and massacre of civilians is not impossible.<br><br>It's not about fighting to death. It's more of following orders. If you receive the surrender notice from your superior, then as a good soldier, you do that.<br><br>I'm not against fighting to death. I salute the heroes who did that. I was just pointing out the consequences of a stubborn resistance. You can't deny this historical fact.<br><br><blockquote>By your THINKING, should we ever fall in battle, everyone above the age of 18 needs to be lined up and SHOT.</blockquote>What you mean? Your 'fall in battle' is too vague to reach the conclusion whether everyone need to be shot.<br><br><blockquote>Oh, and how should we prevent the mutilation of our (soldier's) bodies while alive? The answer, fight.</blockquote>I'm not saying we should surrender when the odds are clearly against the enemy. But a desperate struggle, with little chance of winning, in chinese you call da4 shi4 yi3 qu4, the defeat following the stubborn resistance might signal another Nanking massacre. More so if the enemy has history of doing that.<br><br><blockquote>I point you to Iwo Jima. There, almost every last Japanese soldier held their ground. And in doing so, won themselves a honorable death in accordance with their warrior ethos.</blockquote>Interesting. We were discussing that part of history when the Japs were the aggressors, now you use the later part of history when the Americans were the aggressors. Sly indeed. I'm sure you know the Americans were very less likely to massacre local civilians or mutilate the soliders compared to the Japs.<br><br><blockquote>And what would you know about historical cases where armed militias turned back professional soldiers?<br>There's a recent case.<br>Somalia.</blockquote>I assume you're speaking about Mog. What you mean turned back? There were resistance, but the Americans were not eliminated. US failed in her mission to capture the warlord and his lieutenants, some soldiers were killed, and that's about it. Eventually, APCs drove by Malaysians went in. You call this turned back?<br><br>The Americans were very kind in trying to follow the ROE. They could just shoot into the civilian crowd or threw grenade inside a suspicious house. Civilian casualties.</div>
