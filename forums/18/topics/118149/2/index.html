            <div class='col-md body'>Jamieyeo, I support u. It will be tough, but please press on.<br><br>Eliminate the chances and the sources of motivations.<br><br>First, chances. Think of the times and the pattern of which u do it. For example, if it is mostly during nights, then avoid this. Go out at nights, for example to restaurants, meetup with friends, watch movies at cinemas, etc, until u r tired and have no more energy. So when u reach home, u will want to rest and sleep.<br><br>If u do it when u r alone, then avoid this too. Find ways, for example, invite ur female friends to ur home and chit chat until night when u r tired and need to sleep. Better still, ask them to sleepover. It will be good if someone sleep in the same room like u, so u have no chances at all.<br><br>The idea is to eliminate the chances.<br><br>Nextly, eliminate the motivations. Think of the times and pattern when u r motivated and feel the urge. U said something about clothes. Then u need to wear other clothes. Avoid also other sources of motivations, like maybe erotic magazines, etc, whatever which cause u to feel motivated.<br><br>If u eliminate the sources of motivations and the chances, u will succeed more easily. Remember, no matter how resolute u r, it will be hard if those temptations still exist. So u need to help ur resoluteness by real and practical action by eliminating the sources of motivations and the chances.<br><br>Hope u will be successful. No matter how hard it is, please press on. Remember, after storms, there will be rainbows. At the end of a dark tunnel, there will be light. Ur struggle will not be forever. Please persevere and u will be fine soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't expect this realization to reach your life so soon. aCtually i expected TWo to Five years more for you to come to this end of yourself.<br><br>Have you realised that there are times in your life, you'll ask yourself why are you so into sex and pleasure? And you'll also see that you could easily shrug those questions.<br>But as time goes by, it gets stronger and stronger....leading to a point of disatisfaction. Void, discontentment.<br>I believe you know that there's MORE to life then sexual adventures.<br>There's something out there for you to overcome and be great. (Otherwise then being good in bed)<br><br>I think you tend to have male hormones in your brain. Which allows you to see emotions and sexual pleasures in seperate terms.<br>You are able to think in a way that SEX is just sex and Love is Love.<br><br>I hope you'll get thru this ordeal...it's tough but not impossible.<br>Other then keeping yourself busy, you need to place your emphasis on your MIND.<br><br>Remember: Women's gateway to arousal is the mind.<br><br>If you're able to control what you want and know why you are doing certain things. You should be able to control your life. And in turn, strive for far more beautiful things in life.<br><br>I hope it helps.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sex is something reassuring maybe thats why you have the urge to have sex to reassure yourself that you are attractive. Woman can be attractive in many ways, not neccessary sex. If men compliment how good you are on bed or whatever, they are just trying to get you to have sex with them. Having sex is just for satisfying one's sexual needs. Making love is another thing altogether. Its with someone you are fond of even though he/she might not satisfy you. Maybe you should try making love instead of having sex. Its a thin line between these 2 but its a hell lot of difference... Hope you can achieve what you wanna achieve.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
