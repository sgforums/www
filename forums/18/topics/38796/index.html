Triumph is actually coming out with some good stuff but the new Glamour (the jewelry decorated ones)ones tend to be quite fragile.  Trust me on that one, mate.  Top Shop also sells pretty nice ones.

Marks &amp; Spencers are ok but they can be a bit too pricey and may look a wee bit boring.  Guess, Calvin Klein and Elle are also good comfy brands for ladies.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Every woman is different, so you'll have to go out there and check out all the different types of thongs first (I don't mean wear them, okay?).  It's like perfumes.

Go out there and see (or feel for this matter) for yourself.  You wouldn't know what a perfume smells like till you go to the shop and test it.  Same for women's lingerie.  For all you know, mate.

Look at it this way, if I shop for perfumes, does it mean I'm gay?  I'd naturally ask a salesgirl about it, right?  You'll be surprised how friendly they can be when you ask them about lingerie.  Trust me, it's their job to answer such questions.  And of course, it's the way you ask them.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
