But dare not post at Aunt Agony coz im afraid my bf wil read... Itz like dis...<br><br>Ppl here wil noe i had some probs wif my guy back den a few mths ago... We've been v happy together ever since tat matter. But now there's another prob...<br><br>There's a particular ger, let's name her [b]P</strong>. I noticed tat recently she kept sms-ing my bf... Initially i dun feel anythin... Coz my bf told mi she's onli a colleague. But she's too much loh. I mean her msges... Tat day she sms him askin him 2 bring her on a ride on his bike. My bf agreed 2 do so when he's free. Dis raised my unhappiness loh. Coz i dun like my bf 2 fetch other gers on his bikes except mi. N i oso hate it when other gers wear my helmet (my bf bought a new helmet 4 mi mah...).<br><br>Den when i told my bf abt my dislike n dissatisfaction, he assured mi there's nothin btw them. He oso promise mi not 2 do things tat i dun like loh. I got tell him tat i get jealous v easily loh... So i cant stand gers who always try 2 get close 2 him. Juz imagine tat <strong>P</strong> is on my bf's bike holdin tightly onto him. Juz e tot of it makes mi scared liao. Of course i dun like lah...<br><br>Den nvm. Last nite <strong>P</strong> sms him again. I was holdin on 2 my bf's hp mah. Den i look at e msg. Itz her again. She dis time even request 2 take an individual photograph wif him. After readin e msg my face turned black loh. I dunno wat he replied her loh. But i was angry n sad. I went into his room n continued watchin tv, as if nothin happened, but i couldnt hold on any longer. My tears started rollin down my cheeks loh.<br><br>I reali dunno wat motive <strong>P</strong> has... I juz noe tat she's a threat in our relationship... Although my bf keep assurin mi tat he onli loves mi, but i stil feel insecure... Becoz of tat ger. I dunno wat 2 do. I cant possibly keep an eye on my bf all 24hrs. I cant c wat e ger is doin too... She makes mi feel tat she's a B*itch... She's totally blacklisted by mi... I hate her. Why muz she come in n disturb... N itz not tat i dun haf confidence in my bf, i do trust him...<br><br>Maybe i juz dun haf confidence in myself...

Obviously he has something for that gal. Being a guy, who doesn't like to have a gal being interested @ him? If you think that he may be cheating on you then leave and give yourself time and chance to start afresh. If your bf really love you, he will prevent the breakup. If not then of course, dress up and make up and go get yourself a new guy! Not worth fighting over a guy who is obviously has some interest in the other gal! Don't let him two time you. Don't let him have the assurance that he has you and the other gal @ the same time ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> You will only encourage him to further on the other relationship.  </span></div>
