N i oso hate it when other gers wear my helmet (my bf bought a new helmet 4 mi mah...).<br><br>Den when i told my bf abt my dislike n dissatisfaction, he assured mi there's nothin btw them. He oso promise mi not 2 do things tat i dun like loh. I got tell him tat i get jealous v easily loh... So i cant stand gers who always try 2 get close 2 him. Juz imagine tat <strong>P</strong> is on my bf's bike holdin tightly onto him. Juz e tot of it makes mi scared liao. Of course i dun like lah...<br><br>Den nvm. Last nite <strong>P</strong> sms him again. I was holdin on 2 my bf's hp mah. Den i look at e msg. Itz her again. She dis time even request 2 take an individual photograph wif him. After readin e msg my face turned black loh. I dunno wat he replied her loh. But i was angry n sad. I went into his room n continued watchin tv, as if nothin happened, but i couldnt hold on any longer. My tears started rollin down my cheeks loh.<br><br>I reali dunno wat motive <strong>P</strong> has... I juz noe tat she's a threat in our relationship... Although my bf keep assurin mi tat he onli loves mi, but i stil feel insecure... Becoz of tat ger. I dunno wat 2 do. I cant possibly keep an eye on my bf all 24hrs. I cant c wat e ger is doin too... She makes mi feel tat she's a B*itch... She's totally blacklisted by mi... I hate her. Why muz she come in n disturb... N itz not tat i dun haf confidence in my bf, i do trust him...<br><br>Maybe i juz dun haf confidence in myself... After all our relationship do haf a scar...[/b]</blockquote>I used to encounter the same prob as u 2... mine is 2 of his x always msg him... so frustrating... initially i still can take it well but as time goes by, i started to flare up...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> those 2 gers r reali ridiculous... can sing songs n leave in his voice mail or can msg dat kind of mushy things... until i beh tahan n i asked him to call them in my presence to stop msg or calling him... after he done dat, all the msgs n call stopped...</div>
