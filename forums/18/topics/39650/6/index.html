I'll talk to him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Do not follow what the others have said if your heart doesn't want to.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

But dare not post at Aunt Agony coz im afraid my bf wil read... Itz like dis...<br><br>Ppl here wil noe i had some probs wif my guy back den a few mths ago... We've been v happy together ever since tat matter. But now there's another prob...<br><br>There's a particular ger, let's name her [b]P</strong>. I noticed tat recently she kept sms-ing my bf... Initially i dun feel anythin... Coz my bf told mi she's onli a colleague. But she's too much loh. I mean her msges... Tat day she sms him askin him 2 bring her on a ride on his bike. My bf agreed 2 do so when he's free. Dis raised my unhappiness loh. Coz i dun like my bf 2 fetch other gers on his bikes except mi. N i oso hate it when other gers wear my helmet (my bf bought a new helmet 4 mi mah...).<br><br>Den when i told my bf abt my dislike n dissatisfaction, he assured mi there's nothin btw them. He oso promise mi not 2 do things tat i dun like loh. I got tell him tat i get jealous v easily loh... So i cant stand gers who always try 2 get close 2 him. Juz imagine tat <strong>P</strong> is on my bf's bike holdin tightly onto him. Juz e tot of it makes mi scared liao. Of course i dun like lah...<br><br>Den nvm. Last nite <strong>P</strong> sms him again. I was holdin on 2 my bf's hp mah. Den i look at e msg. Itz her again. She dis time even request 2 take an individual photograph wif him. After readin e msg my face turned black loh. I dunno wat he replied her loh. But i was angry n sad. I went into his room n continued watchin tv, as if nothin happened, but i couldnt hold on any longer. My tears started rollin down my cheeks loh.<br><br>I reali dunno wat motive <strong>P</strong> has... I juz noe tat she's a threat in our relationship... Although my bf keep assurin mi tat he onli loves mi, but i stil feel insecure... Becoz of tat ger. I dunno wat 2 do. I cant possibly keep an eye on my bf all 24hrs. I cant c wat e ger is doin too... She makes mi feel tat she's a B*itch... She's totally blacklisted by mi... I hate her. Why muz she come in n disturb... N itz not tat i dun haf confidence in my bf, i do trust him...<br><br>Maybe i juz dun haf confidence in myself... After all our relationship do haf a scar...[/b]</blockquote>Hi shan_cai,<br><br>Why so scare to post in AUnt Agony???? Sooner or LAter you still need to talk to him about this.. You cant run away..

Until she reali fcuk her way out of our relation den i'll put my mind at ease...</div></blockquote>Dear shan_cai,<br><br>I read those two posts you posted..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>Well the first POst..</strong><br><br>You dunno what's the reason behind that makes him so bad mood.. You try to show concern to him.. and ask him.. but he refuses to say... NOW have you ever thought of what's the reason behind it? Noone knows.. not even you.. BUt oni he himself..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You give him time to cool down.. But when you meet him at night.. he seems like nothing has happen.. Curious of what makes the sudden change in him? At first was so moody.. so unhappy.. but later in the day when he meet you.. he feels better.. You ask him again what happen.. he still refuses to speak to you about it.. I know you are upset about it.. but try not to force him.. If he wants to tell you he will.. Always let him know that you always be there for him.. Caring and supporting him.. With given time.. he will slowly pour out everything..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>Now the second post...</strong><br><br>Your bf wants a break up not long after he had his bad mood... He msg you saying breakup.. indeed he dunno how to face you.. The breakup reason is becos YOU dun UNDERSTAND him?? Why does he feel that?? Ask him about it.. I'm sure you can talk things out with him.. He doesnt even solve together with you about it.. and jus decide on a break up.. Isnt he giving excuses and tryin to escape from it?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Have you two come to talk about and solve this 2 post you posted? Or jus leave it all at the back of the head.. as if nothing had happen before...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>The third post...</strong><br><br>Now comes a third party... How come this girl will come into the picture? He told you is his colleague.. After one incident and another... Do you think is jus merely his colleague that easy? Can SMS him to go for a ride on his bike.. and take photograph together.. Your Bf agrees when he's free.. or when he's not with you??   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Now slowly analysis this three problems together.. Firstly, He's in bad mood..and he's a working adult now.. One of possibilty maybe.. he had a crush with this girl in his office.. happen to be his colleague afterall.. At that point of time.. He is confused.. Mixed feelings dunno what to do.. He's not sure whether to tell you anot.. That's why he needed time to cool down.. But when you meet him at night.. everything is like per normal.. it might be when he sees you.. he feels that.. maybe towards to the girl he only had a crush n that's it... And you are all he wants he loves..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Secondly, the minute he is back to his office.. he saw that colleague of his... and he couldnt control his feelings again.. he was so confused that he thinks that he doesn;t love you anymore.. and that's why when you SMS him that time.. (happen to be this matter was goin thru his mind...) And without even thinking.. he initated the break up... At that moment.. you dun even know what's goin on.. or what you did?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>After that when he cool down.. he realised that it was jus a "Cong Dong". He couldnt find any reason to come up with and that's why he says you dont understand him.. Its jus an excuses for him to get away with it.. And of cos.. i dunno what did he so or say to you.. that you both are ok..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>7 months say long not long.. say short not short.. Think long term is good.. but always take things step by step... He always promise you this promise you that.. But what if one day he broke his promises.. And you be there sitting alone.. thinking why did he give you empty promises.. He promises he only love me only.. promises not to do things that hurt me.. but in the end.. he still does it..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I dun believe in promises.. Only make promises when you are able to fulfill it.. And not to say jus for that moment.. for the sake of saying it.. to make the other party feels better.. but when you are not together.. all this promises becomes useless and empty.. I'm sure alot of people encounter this before but somehow they dun realised that the promises they gave will eventually hurt the other.. If they are not able to do it...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I'm not saying dun believe what he says to you.. but think twice.. You dun wish to get hurt badly right..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well good that you 2 have agree to talk things out.. better then quarrelling.. Quarrelling is very bad for relationship.. People always say... In a relationship must have some arguement than this relation will last... No. Its not neccessary true.. You can have one couple who doesnt even quarrel at all.. but if any problems arise.. you both can speak out in a nice way.. and we will be listening to what he/she has to say... But if we raise our voice and screaming at the other party.. do you  think the 2 will be EVen listening to what they got to say..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Breaking up may not be the solution to everything... try not to mention this word... No mantter how big a problem might be.. there's always a way to solve it.. Don't be too tense.. And also watch out for the words you are speaking..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>YOu say the other time wasn't becos of 3rd party.. What makes you so sure about it.. Where you don;t even know the reasons behind why he is reacting in this way.. As earlier on.. i have linked the three problems together.. I;m not tryin to HURT you! I'm jus saying what i think.. Maybe my deductions is wrong!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I suggest you to talk to him one day.. As soon as possible.. dun drag.. The more you drag on this matter.. which you are so confused about it... the more this matter worsen!! You also know that this girl is a threat to your relation.. Talk to him.. You say you wan his assurance... not oni jus by words..( Like "I only love you" ) You wanna see actions done..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don;t be too possessive... Give him and yourself some space and privacy too.. If you control him too much.. one day he would be able to take it.. You cant stop seeing or talking to his colleague.. cos they bound to see other in office.. Take it easy ok.. one more thing - pls DON'T ever TRY killing yourself.. Is not a good solution.. and issit worth doing such things for a guy who doesn;t aprreciate or love you at all..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Always have confidence in yourself, him and also this relation.. Honesty and trust too.. Dun get so confused.. give yourself more time to think alone.. ok??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Feedback to me ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
