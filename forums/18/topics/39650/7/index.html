            <div class='col-md body'>Relationship is a balance of power.  Now you're on the weaker end which is why you willingly take all the nonsense from your boyfriend.  Nobody can force another person change; no promises made, no restrictions imposed or undying love shown, unless one is willing to change himself from the inside.  And you really have no right to demand anything that he isn't ready to give.<br><br>From what is being told here, I don't see why Shan Cai should be worried that the boyfriend is cheating on her.  (Unless he has history of cheating which isn't stated here).  Has she explored what kind of relationship does P have with the boyfriend.  Why is the boyfriend stuck on her?  If it is for some flattering female company and attention, this habit is hard to break.  Or maybe they have a very strong friendship?  Or she understands him more than you do?  We all need friends outside of a romantic relationship.<br><br>Instead of him doing things your way, you should work for a compromise.  For eg, Don't insist he totally don't see her, but see her in groups.  Or go out with them together.<br><br>What you must not do is to stoop down to the other girl's level and ... beg for his attention, or to confront the girl.  Have some pride and some dignity.  The world does not start and stop with him.</div>

But dare not post at Aunt Agony coz im afraid my bf wil read... Itz like dis...<br><br>Ppl here wil noe i had some probs wif my guy back den a few mths ago... We've been v happy together ever since tat matter. But now there's another prob...<br><br>There's a particular ger, let's name her [b]P</strong>. I noticed tat recently she kept sms-ing my bf... Initially i dun feel anythin... Coz my bf told mi she's onli a colleague. But she's too much loh. I mean her msges... Tat day she sms him askin him 2 bring her on a ride on his bike. My bf agreed 2 do so when he's free. Dis raised my unhappiness loh. Coz i dun like my bf 2 fetch other gers on his bikes except mi. N i oso hate it when other gers wear my helmet (my bf bought a new helmet 4 mi mah...).<br><br>Den when i told my bf abt my dislike n dissatisfaction, he assured mi there's nothin btw them. He oso promise mi not 2 do things tat i dun like loh. I got tell him tat i get jealous v easily loh... So i cant stand gers who always try 2 get close 2 him. Juz imagine tat <strong>P</strong> is on my bf's bike holdin tightly onto him. Juz e tot of it makes mi scared liao. Of course i dun like lah...<br><br>Den nvm. Last nite <strong>P</strong> sms him again. I was holdin on 2 my bf's hp mah. Den i look at e msg. Itz her again. She dis time even request 2 take an individual photograph wif him. After readin e msg my face turned black loh. I dunno wat he replied her loh. But i was angry n sad. I went into his room n continued watchin tv, as if nothin happened, but i couldnt hold on any longer. My tears started rollin down my cheeks loh.<br><br>I reali dunno wat motive <strong>P</strong> has... I juz noe tat she's a threat in our relationship... Although my bf keep assurin mi tat he onli loves mi, but i stil feel insecure... Becoz of tat ger. I dunno wat 2 do. I cant possibly keep an eye on my bf all 24hrs. I cant c wat e ger is doin too... She makes mi feel tat she's a B*itch... She's totally blacklisted by mi... I hate her. Why muz she come in n disturb... N itz not tat i dun haf confidence in my bf, i do trust him...<br><br>Maybe i juz dun haf confidence in myself... After all our relationship do haf a scar...[/b]</blockquote>Poor gal, I would hate to be in the situation you are in. You should just tell him that if he really loves you, he would make an effort to stop keeping in touch with her. I hope everything works out for you. You should just issue an ultimatum to him. If he chooses to contact her still, then you know that you deserve a better guy who would be sensitive to your feelings.</div>
