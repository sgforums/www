I'm not sure if they are allowed to do anything they like as long as they don't do anything to tarnish the brand but generally how they work is something like this.  The franshisee will pay money to BK to get the BK signage, they'll also receive training on how to make the burgers/fries from BK's own system(eg:how long to fry fries, how to serve customer).  The raw materials like beef platters, fries, bread and drinks are most likely from an authorised  distributor.<br><br>MLM share similar traits.  We can call it personal franchising as well cos we don't open  outlets.  Same thing, we apply to be a 'franchise' from our upline and we get the products from the MLM company we are affiliated with. We also follow the system that will be taught to us by our upline(if our upline teaches crap, the downline may be crap too)...then we follow the methods as well.<br><br>I hope this helps in some way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
