            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that MLM is a very subjective industry as some people are closed minded about it and some are open minded to it.<br><br>It's actually a very good opportunity to take advantage of for people who wants to own a business but don't have the time and capital to start one.  The concept is very simple and the potential is great but the process to reach the goal is not going to be easy.

I've typed a very long post for you but somehow I can't post n I've lost the whole post.(Darn!!)  So now, perhaps I'll just retype as much as I can.<br><br>Few points I wish to point out:<br>The method of getting revenue is very fair as anyone in the structure can have a GOOD CHANCE to earn more than their upline.  In a pyrimid, those people at the bottom can never earn more than their upline. I can't explain it clearnly here but from what I see from most MLM company's plan, they are very fair.  From the outside, both have pyrimid structure but by looking into how the structure works, you can see that both MLM and pyrimid works totally differently.  Do note that there are some small time MLM companies that are using MLM name to do pyramid.<br><br>I'm not saying that pyramid is good or bad.  Anyway, since we are at it, let's also look at the very familiar structure that we are very familiar with.  Let's take a can of soft drink as an example.  The manufacturer makes a can of soft drink at 10 cents, this can of drink will be passed thru the wholesaler and retail shop before it reaches us.  Let's suppose that the manufactuer and wholesaler marks the drink up by 20 cents respectively.  This means the retailer buys the drink at 50cents.  The drink is then sold to us at $1 by the retailer.  So looking at this system, do you think it's also a very large pyramid system that we have been in the past decades.<br><br>Also to answer your questions:<br>1)Like I mentioned before, those who claim that their product can do miracles are doing things wrongly.  Such claims are not supported by their respective MLM companies usually and they are usually made up by the seller themselves.  These are against the law too and we can report it to the relavent authorities.  I don't believe in luohans giving winning 4D numbers either, what about you?<br><br>Also, network marketing focuses on bring BETTER QUALITY products to the consumers at reasonable prices(not always lower prices) thru word of mouth.  Adviertising will increase the cost of the product and this is also contradicting to the whole network marketing  concept.  Sometimes the prices can be much higher  but in such cases, it's good to look into the quality of the product first before concluding anything.<br><br>2)If you own your own supermarket, do you think it's good if your friends and relatives can come and buy things from your supermarket?  Also note that in MLM, we are not supposed to push products.  We recommend them.  It's up to the individual we approach to buy or not to buy.  Again, those who push products are not doing things right for this business.  Note that most MLM companies have money back guarantees for their products, therefore, our friends/relatives can get refunds if they don't like the product.  So do you think they are suckered when they buy a product willingly and get a refund if they don't like it after trying?  Also, if they do not buy from or 'supermarket', they'll still buy it at other supermarkets.<br><br>3)To speak of market saturation...let's look at it from this angle.  Everyday, people die of old age and people turn 18.  With this kind of balance, do you think that there are always new prospects everyday?  Let's look at another example of bridal shops.  Marriage has been an old custom n practice.  We also see that bridal shops are everywhere and some have survived thru the decades already.  How is it possible?  That's because everyday, there are new couples getting married.   I won't elaborate too much on this but do you get the picture?<br><br>4) You are right abt most MLM being big companies.  Some of them are even over half a century old and still growing strong.  Do you have any idea how these MLM companies can survive and be still growing till now if this whole MLM concept is a scam?<br><br>This is just half of what I've got from the lost post.  I hope that it can help you clear some doubts and also help you or anyone reading this far think a little deeper into this matter.<br><br>The bottomline that I'm driving at is that if network marketing is done corretly, is a very good business with very good potential.<br><br>Feel free to keep this discussion meaningful.<br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, MLM says you own ur own business, that you would be free from bring under a boss, can have ur own time. But then, you are actually working for the company. If NuSkin falls, their agent falls, what business do u OWN? And abt having more time flexibility, true you no longer work 8 - 5. But all these free time are taken up by your uplines asking u to go back for meetings, asking u to attend seminars at ur cost, so what flexibility do u have? You have to ask urself, are u a distributor for say, Nuskin, who needs u to increase their sales and presence or do you really own a business who is independent of Nuskin?<br><br>Secondly, in the world of business, when the channels of distribution are reduced, the costs to the end user naturally reduce, classic example is DELL who is cheaper and faster becos they cut the middlemen and retail shops and sell direct. but GUESS WHAT? MLM changes this FOREVER! They use direct sales but yet their things are, say it after me, DAMN EXPENSIVE. Why should a piece of unproven matress be sold at $1600? why should skincare products be sold at such premium? even Bodyshop who uses natural products or branded goods are not as expensive. Think abt it, it is all becos they transfer the high cost to consumers so that they can pay high commission to their agents.<br><br>Thirdly, like what some say, if your things are as good, why was it not widespread? If someone found the cure to cancer, it should be BIG NEWS! Since the Magnetic Matress from Astral Mag and some other stuff from other MLM claimed to be breakthroughs in health, skin and consumer care, why was it not known? why was it not endorsed by official health organisations? why didnt doctors recommend it? All MLM does is to give u some pretty brochures and booklets and show their BIG factories to impress us. ok some of us are stupid, but most of aint. ENRON was big but it fell anyway. So quit telling me how big ur research lab is, what kind of awards it won. If one day a doctor or the health ministry tells me it is good, i will believe. Why should i believe in a booklet and some MLM fools who think they know everything abt business becos they read some books from Robert "the MLM shIt" kyosaki?<br><br>Fourthly, insistence that MLM is the best marketing or business model is just not going to work. I studied marketing. I do marketing. MLM is nothing but a distribution model. So quit ur dreams and do something proper.<br><br>Fifthly, recommendation is fine. Persistence is necessary. But irritation is what MLM does and it is not fine.<br><br>Lastly, only 5% of MLM people actually succeeded according to US research. Why not become a salesman for some more useful products like Insurance, cars or whatever that is not MLM. afterall, MLM people are but GLORIFIED SALESMAN.</div>

The concept is very simple and the potential is great but the process to reach the goal is not going to be easy.  The same problems can go for any other business that we may want to start...only that we need more time n money to start a traditional business with significant risks.  (A little generalisation here)Some people think of doing MLM biz as a way to get rich quick which is wrong...when they realise that their MLM business didn't let them get rich fast enough(many people who put in good effort make it though), they'll resort to unscrupulous ways to get ppl to sign up or buy things...that creates another black sheep for this good industry.   Good news spreads slow while bad news spreads fast...I think that's why many people shun the MLM industry becos of these black sheeps.  Luckily these black sheeps don't last long in this industry though.<br><br>When we are choosing a MLM company to work with, we need to be sure that the MLM company and our potential mentor is good before starting on it.

I guess sgforums limit their time for the user to log on.  I lost my post to you again.<br><br>Anyway,  I seek your respect to my industry and also let's keep this discussion meaningful n open minded..else I don't think we should continue.<br><br>Ok, here's a cut short version of what I've typed previously....<br><br>I see myself as a maketer and distributor of the companies product.  I own my business cos I can arrange my own time to work and decide how I want my business to grow.  Working for the company means that I have to work the designated hours and get a designated pay from the company.  We still need to put in sufficient effort to learn the business and then grow our business till the business is sizeable enough for us to have residual income(some form of royalty income which some successful franchise owners gets).  Do you believe in having income without putting in effort from the start?<br><br>You've mentioned that big companies collapse too...but to weigh the odds of that happening, it's very insignificant.   We can die tomorrow too.  That's why choosing a company from the start is impt.  I always advice friends who are looking at MLM companies to choose carefully n not be attracted just by the high commision rates.  Some companies that boasts good compensation plans faded in just a few years.  The failure rate of MLM distributors are high but do take into account that there are network marketers who do not do things properly thus resulting in failure.  I have downlines/crosslines who want to do things their way despite warnings(sometimes being very pushy) and the failed expectedly.  On the other hand, I have friends who joined different companies and they are starting to enjoy more free time now.  So it's a matter of choice.<br><br>Buying direct doesn't mean cheaper.  It also means that we can get better quality items are a reasonable price.  We should also compare apples with apples in this case.  Take skincare products for example.  If you compare skincare products from a MLM company, we should also take into account of the ingrdients, manufacturing process and the QC of the product.  Natural is a vague word and a company can use cheaper natural ingredients to manufacture skincare products too.  Also, the quality of the natural ingredient has to be considered too.  I can't say that all skincare products from MLM companies uses top quality ingredients though.  Comparing their prices with big brands like Estee Lauder, etc, they are still cheaper and the quality of the product is similar.<br><br>As for the miracle claims on products, good MLM companies will not do that.  However, we can always report them to relavent authorities on such cases if the product if the claim on the product is false.<br><br>I suppose you are very concerned abt endorsements and I am not vey much different.  It's a good guide for us to follow but it's up to us to try the product to be sure that it works for us be it if it's endorsed or not.  That's why most MLM companies have money back garantees on their products.  Do note that endorsements may not be ok all the time too.  The recent Pan Pharmaceutical case is one that has caused quite a bit of alarm.<br><br>You are right that MLM is a type of distribution model and we do not need to study marketing to understand that...but what do you think is improper about this industry?  Anyway, i believe that it's not everyone's cup of tea to do it.  It's not our job to push anyone to do it either.  The same goes for insurance, many people condemned the idea when the insurance concept was first introduced but there are also many who embrace it.  So it's up to the choice of the individual.  Some see it as a channel to achieve what they want while some prefer other channels.  MLM is not the only channel definitely.<br><br>I do agree that persistance can be irritating sometimes.  That is why I usually just show them the concept and if they are interested, I'll go on and if they are  sure that they do not want to do it, I'll let them be.  Showing respect to the prospect is very impt and is the correct way.<br><br>I think this should be enough for me to state my stand.  I've spent too much time on this thread already.  Hope it's helps in some way to anyone who is reading this though.<br></div>
