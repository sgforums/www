            <div class='col-md body'>Don't Lie to Mom<br><br>John invited his mother over for dinner. During the meal, his mother couldn't help noticing how beautiful John's roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between John and his roommate, and this only made her more curious.<br><br>Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, John volunteered, "I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just roommates."<br><br>About a week later, Julie came to John and said, "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?" John said, "Well, I doubt it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure."<br><br>So he sat down and wrote "Dear Mother, I'm not saying you did take a gravy ladle from my house, and I'm not saying you did not take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner."<br><br>Several days later, John received a letter from his mother which read: "Dear Son, I'm not saying that you do sleep with Julie, and I'm not saying that you do not sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now. Love, Mom."<br><br>Lesson of the day...Don't Lie To Your Mother.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have<br>dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the<br>girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would<br>like to go out and make love for the first time.<br><br>Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so<br>he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The<br>pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy<br>everything there is to know about condoms and sex.<br><br>At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms<br>hed like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy<br>insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather<br>busy, it being his first time and all.<br><br>That night, the boy shows up at the girls parents house and<br>meets his girlfriend at the door. Oh, Im so excited for you to<br>meet my parents, come on in<br><br>The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the<br>girls parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace<br>and bows his head.<br><br>A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his<br>head down.<br><br>10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.<br><br>Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend<br>leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, I had no idea you<br>were this religious.<br><br>The boy turns, and whispers back, I had no idea your father was<br>a pharmacist.</div>
