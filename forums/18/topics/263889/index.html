            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>just curious.<br><br>when u all guys' penis (those un-circumsized ones) get erect, does the foreskin automatically stretch back, so much so that the result looks like a circumsized penis?<br><br>because i know that for those un-circumsized penises, there's this very tiny stretch of skin linking the underneath tip of the penis foreskin to the penis head, right? if so, how can those un-circumsized penises' foreskin still retract when erect?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If your co ck head is too big for the opening of the foreskin, the head cannot poke out. You need to see a doctor, for complete or partial circumcision. Beware, ppl have had their penis tip sliced off during circumcision. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Ideally your foreskin, when the  penis is erect should should retract to just exposing the head.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, after seeing so many "replies" that do not actually reply the questions of the thread starter. I shall start with a proper reply. I do not want to offend anyone but I feel that if someone asks a question, we should try our best to reply and not give lame answers. Okay, if you want to have fun, you can poke fun in a thread that is not asking for help or anything, but a joke thread or something. I'm expecting to be flamed but I dont really care. Now, for thread starter's questions...<br><br>Okay absically, all you need to do is google this: circumcision, foreskin, phimosis, frenulum breve and other related stuff in sites that might interest you.<br><br>I can answer some of your questions but in future, try to look them up yourself. Firstly, the tiny stretch of skin is called a frenulum. It is a concentration of nerves so it's a great spot for pleasure. Yes, it connects the head to the shaft but in most cases, they are loose enough to allow the skin to be pulled back over the whole head. However, in some cases, they are extremely taut and sometimes tear during sexual activities. A taut frenulum may restrict the retraction of the foreskin. (This may be the problem, or not)<br><br>Secondly, I am not circumcised although I am going to be. I can tell you that yes, the foreskin can be pulled back until the whole head it shown, just like a circumcied one. That is exactly what I am doing now, in preparation for my circumcision, I have pulled back the skin and taped it back so that the head is constantly exposed to the rubbing against my underwear and other stuff so that I would not feel uncomfortable straight after circumcision. Oh, and you mentioned that WHEN ERECT, it can be pulled back, I don't know about other people, but mine can be pulled back fully whether erect or not.<br><br>Thirdly, as for your concern in circumcision, the website <a href="http://www.circlist.com" rel="nofollow">www.circlist.com</a> provided me with alot of useful information on the styles and methods. Yes, sadly, you'll have to restrain from sexual activities for a few weeks, or at least until the scar is formed.<br><br>Although I am pro-circumcision, I would not advise you to go for or not to go for circumcision cause I believe that everyone makes their own decisions.<br><br>Also, your condition may be phimosis (google it if you want to find out more). basically, it means that your foreskin is too tight to be fully retracted but that USUALLY happens in people aged 15 and younger although adult cases have been seen. Circumcision is a good solution but the other more tedious solution is the slow stretching of your foreskin everytime you take a bath. If your problem is a frenulum breve (tearing of the frenelum) you'll probably need a circumcision as a circumcision removes the frenulum as well.<br><br>I hope this helps, and if yo've got any other questions, please dont hesitate to ask or PM me. Good luck.</div>

But according to some websites, the pain of having your stitches torn is enough to turn you off and make your erection go down, unless of course, you're someone who advocates S&amp;M.<br><br>Also, there are methods to combat erections. For example, I'm sure you're familar with the term, morning glory and night erections. This can be avoided through practises such as urinating before going to bed and sleeping in a fetal position. I've tried this advice while not circumcised yet and I agree that it works for me. Also, another piece of advice is that you do the method in which you pull back the foreskin and use surgical tape to tape it down so that your glans is constantly exposed.<br>This website tells you how to do it, <a href="http://www.circlist.com/preferences/feelcut.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circlist.com/preferences/feelcut.html</a><br><br>This method works exceptionally well for me in reducing erections and getting comfortable with having a circumcised penis. Basically, the retracting of the foreskin forces your glans to rub constandly against my underwear, hence it was uncomfortable for the first day (I had lots of erections), and I was walking bull legged as though my penis hurt (which did, a little)<br><br>However, on the second day onwards, I gradually became more used to the feeling of my glans rubbing against my underwear. And after a while, my erections became lesser and lesser. Combined with the sleeping position and the urinating advice, I found out that my sleeping erections were almost gone.<br><br><blockquote>actually, i was looking at porn and recently started to discover that those circumsized penises look a lot better, because the gleam of the head's flesh is like more water and rubbery, juicy.......girls see already also lao-nua, compared to a penis whereby the skin covers the head (like non-naked like that).<br><br>then, i also realized that lots of un-circumsized guys, their penises' foreskin can stretch back all the way to reveal the head, so it's like they have the best of both worlds : ability to reveal the head and also cover it when needed without going for operation!<br><br>actually i got think of going circumcision, but i'm very very scared loh.....sigh.</blockquote>As for you, I found out about circumcision through a friend who is chinese. When we were in Secondary One, we attended a camp together and when we showered as a group, I noticed that every other guy's penis has a little fold of skin while his was a pinkish rounded tip (He was circumcised at birth). After asking him, he gave me more information on circumcision. That was how I got interested in circumcision.<br><br>Also, I decided to pursue being circumcised because I agree with you. A circumcised penis looks way better than a intact (non circumcised) one. There is one point I totally disagree. If you can pull back your foreskin and left out your glans for a few hours, you would notice why. Firstly, a circumcised penis will not have a rubbery and watery glan. This is because the constant exposure to the open air and rubbing against your underwear results in a dry glans which is smooth and powdery to the touch. The rubbery and watery look is probably achieved through lubrication.<br><br>My foreskin can be retracted fully, but I still want to and I am going for circumcision because even though my foreskin can be pulled back, it will not stay back! hence, I do not really feel that it's the best of both worlds cause I'd rather my foreskin being retracted all the time.<br><br>Since you're intact, I think you'd agree on this, there tends to be a buildup of secretions and other fluids under the foreskin, resulting in a sometimes embarrassing and smelly mess no matter how many times you clean under it. Circumcision gets rid of this problem.<br><br>If you're still considering circumcision, don't just refer to <a href="http://www.circlist.com" rel="nofollow">www.circlist.com</a> because I dare say that it leans slightly to advocating circumcision. Otherwise, it is pretty balanced. However, there are also a lot of websites out there that are AGAINST circumcision. It's be best if you had a close friend who has been circumcised to talk to about it cause like my friend, a personal experience is always better compared to websites who are biased.<br><br>Sorry for the long post, the site doesn't allow me to post so often, yet.<br><br>If you've any more questions and problems, I do not mind looking them up for you and answering them. And you're welcome.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha eagle, I agree with you, the TS sould read up on disadvantages of circumcision and the risks. But you see, I am pro-circumcision, so my argument tends to be biased although I am trying to balance it by telling TS that it is ultimately up to his decision.<br><br>Your foreskin got cut away in Primary 1? Why? I thought it's usually done at birth. Are you a muslim? Even so, I thought muslims were circumcised at birth too... You can help the TS about his decision for circumcision since you've experienced life with and without a foreskin... but I still have a foreskin even though I hope to cut it away soon...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
