            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks to this thread, I tried to retract the foreskin on my 'little one'. I managed to get it behind the ridge. But when it became erect, it felt as if I had a very tight rubber band around the back of the ridge. It felt as though the head was being strangulated. After a few moments admiring my smooth shiny glans, I had to pinch the foreskin, stretch it delicately, and bring it back over the glans. I am worried: do I have phimosis?</div>

'Gentle' stretching doesn't really work, I need a little tugging. I am just afraid if tiny scars might form that may actually worsen the situation. What do u mean by 'primary' phimosis?</div>

Phimosis is when the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back behind the glans. Paraphimosis is when a guy with phimosis forces the foreskin to go behind the glans, and gets stuck there. Listen to eagle, stretch it everyday in warm water. And AVOID THE TINY CUTS AT ALL COST. Scar tissue makes it TIGHTER, not looser. So if tiny cuts start to form, STOP. BTW, how old are you? Cause it may be a age problem... I hope.</div>
