            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, but it hasn't really been proven that circumcision will make you lose your nerve endings, you see, the main nerve endings that are pelasurable during sex (for me) are on the INSIDE of the foreskin, the part just behind the glans when the foreskin is pulled totally back, and not the foreskin itself. What SOME circumcised people are worried about is that the constant rubbing of the glans on underwear makes the glans desensitised. and hence, have less pleasure during sex. But another complain  is that intact males have glans that are too sensitive, resulting in premature ejaculation and leaving the woman unsatisfied.<br><br>Yes, for me, the foreskin can be pulled back behind the ridge really easily, it takes almost no effort at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went to a private urologist last time to ask about circumcision cuz when I was doing it with my ex-gf, I couldn't do full penetration cuz it hurts. I thought it was because my frenulum was too short. Wanted to either snip off the frenulum (like what some male porn actors do) or go for circumcision. The doctor said that circumsion will not help.<br><br>Analogy: you have a shirt with very long sleeves (uncircumscised foreskin). We can roll up our sleeves so that our hands are exposed (pull back the skin until "turtle head" is exposed). Circumcision will only cut of the sleeves of the shirt (the extra foreskin) so that our hands (the "turtle head") is permanently exposed. No tampering of the frenulum at all (iirc).<br><br>The frenulum is a very sensative piece of nerve and doing anything (un-natural less accidental) to it may disrupt your sex life. If you feel that your frenulum is short, it's advisable to keep pulling back your foreskin to stretch the frenulum whenever you are taking a bath. And circumcision will mean that your "turtle head" will be permantly exposed and constantly rubbing onto your underwear, thus decreasing it's sensativeness which may somehow affect your sex life too. Can be good or bad depending on the way you look at it.<br><br>Personally, only start considering to go for a circumcision if the extra foreskin pose a problem to your sex live.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I think, when a person is young and penis is not circumcised the head might not expose, but normally you know the guys will start m...brate and after having regular sex, this problem should not have. I remember in my teenage I used to have the forskin opening problem, you can use a crude way of using lubricant like oil and m..brate (which is not good if you do too often) or when you have a partner and have regular sex this problem will disappear. Personally, I think it is not necessary to circumcise just because it does not open completely.<br><br>This is not a professional openion and just from experience.<br><br>Best of luck and wish u the best.</blockquote>Yes, I agree that when a guy is young, the foreskin will not pull back, and as a guy masturbates, it graudually does, but soemtimes in certain people, they have phimosis - tightness of foreskin. I didn't have a foreskin problem cause I forcible pulled mine back when I was oung. I still remembered it. I was in sec sch and I was still experimenting. So I pulled back the foreskin to see my glans and it felt good, so, I tugged more on it and it felt better (It was kinda stuck at the sidest point of the penis). as a result, I kept tugging until suddenly there was a brief pain and the whole skin just went behind the glans, even so, I still kep pulling until I realised that it won't go back any further.<br><br>And I'm going for circumcision not because of this problem, I am going for it cause I choose to have a cleaner and smoother glans and one that looks better.<br><br><blockquote>I went to a private urologist last time to ask about circumcision cuz when I was doing it with my ex-gf, I couldn't do full penetration cuz it hurts.

The frenulum cutting is an option for the doctor. I'm not sure why most do cut it off but I think it's because too much rubbing on it may cause you to keep having erections. If you referred to eagle's post on wiki, yes, the frenulum is cut off.<br><br>As for the rubbing, it is just temporary, yes it will be desensitised but, if it's too sensitive, it will cause premature ejaculation. And as you are intact, your glans is usually moist and might smell if not washed properly. A circumcised glans will not smell, nor will it be moist, it's smooth, clean and dry.<br><br>The foreskin does not pose to problem to my life. It's just that from a POV of fashion, I feel that penises without foreskins look better. As for pragmatism, I also feel that it is practical to go without the foreskin. I mean, my foreskin has been retracted continuously for about 2 weeks! I taped it back to ensure that I wont feel uncomfortable when I get circumcised!<br><br>Hence, I really do want to cut off the foreskin. To share a bit of news with you, I even attempted to cut it off myself and it was disastrous.</div>
