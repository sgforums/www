            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a modern well-educated singapore girl and have a lot of problems meeting modern well-educated singapore men who arnt any (usually all) of the following:<br><br>1. playboys and think they are God's gift to women<br>2. have massive chips on their shoulders<br>3. think they are modern and well-educated but the actuality is quite the contrary.<br><br>But I also agree that most females in my category are also have the above qualities.<br><br>It all boils down to confidence (not to be mistaken with arrogance) and meeting the right person. There is no need to "deal" with them. Just treat them with respect and decency. A little chivalry never goes amiss. You will find that if you have something to say for yourself and are confident of your own personality with a touch of courtesy, you will go a long way.<br><br>btw - my bf earns less (I banker, he regular) and is less educated (I MA, he diploma) than me but is more MAN than any of the swaggering bankers/lawyers/shentonwaysharks that I've met.<br><br>Good Luck!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

[and yes, expectation of the 4 c's keeps coming up. grrrr...]. yet.<br><br>maybe i just look in the wrong place..<br><br>anyway, with regards to like2koon's comments, i see alot of it is true.. rarely have i met a sg guy who is truly independant and respectful of the opposite sex in all ways - those who ive met are very very good people indeed..but they are rare!<br>[heh, i dont count me.. i am not a very nice guy!]<br>imo anyway.. just thinking aloud..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Maybe some women go for slick men, with sweet words for her and the local men are not really that sort although a minority are. These are players and they are into trophies.<br><br>I guess most guys are quite tongue tied, and my guy had been asking his work colleague who had no gf all his life to start learning and practicing how to communicate with a girl. Its not suggesting the men go become honey tongued but at least be able to listen and talk. Its not talking about men's fav topics only, its about getting to know and appreciate the person.<br><br>Although this is condescending, I know that some guys come up and chat. Then I ask them about themselves and they would go on and on for 30 to 45 minutes non stop about themselves and how great they are. At the end, these guys actually think they communicate well and they think I am interested. I am a very polite person and will continue the conversation solely focusing on the guy and all topics will revolve around him only .. its my way of knowing more. However, I would not reveal much about myself cause I know there is no point cause, its just a monologue and it will never work.<br><br>Women want partners, communicators, lovers, and etc to share. No one wants to be talked down or treated like secondary. I like men who don't yabber too much cause sweet talk is just nice to hear nonsence talk.<br></div>

These are players and they are into trophies.<br><br>I guess most guys are quite tongue tied, and my guy had been asking his work colleague who had no gf all his life to start learning and practicing how to communicate with a girl. Its not suggesting the men go become honey tongued but at least be able to listen and talk. Its not talking about men's fav topics only, its about getting to know and appreciate the person.<br><br>Although this is condescending, I know that some guys come up and chat. Then I ask them about themselves and they would go on and on for 30 to 45 minutes non stop about themselves and how great they are. At the end, these guys actually think they communicate well and they think I am interested. I am a very polite person and will continue the conversation solely focusing on the guy and all topics will revolve around him only .. its my way of knowing more. However, I would not reveal much about myself cause I know there is no point cause, its just a monologue and it will never work.<br><br>Women want partners, communicators, lovers, and etc to share. No one wants to be talked down or treated like secondary. I like men who don't yabber too much cause sweet talk is just nice to hear nonsence talk.<br></div></blockquote>having good PR could be one attribute for females to filter out the guys..</div>
