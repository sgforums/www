As i said, it is not monologue which is exactly what you engaged in thus she will loose interest to even talk to you.  Talk as in have a conversation, not you talk she listen. You guys must be talking about a common topic. Don't need to arouse what conversation, just be natural. I had guys who fill every silence with their voice. Others boast about themselves. Next are a bunch who was trying to look for sugar mummy, then there was this mommy boy who wanted a maid. How do I know all this? These men talk too much about themselves.<br><br>Whatever it is, it cannot be taught over some site and reading typed words. It requires fundamental change in the mental models about talk in the male mind. Men think talking is exchanging info, boosting egos and such. Women think its a form of shareing, emotional attachment. These 2 arrive from different points of view. in addition, if a guy really want to learn, he has to learn how to adapt his conversation style.  Any such form of so call "learning" is in the form of coaching... forums are not the best ways to do this. Last of all you must be sincere.<br></div>

Then again, there is such a thing called competitive cooking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok. as my nick suggests, i'm just a girl here.<br><br>I'm turning 23. Enjoying my simple admin job with an extremely fantastic environment and colleagues. I just started doing a part time degree at SIM (this part sux to the core). I don't drive - I don't trust myself to.<br>My boyfriend is still in NS and will be out thie mid-year. He's got a diploma and intends to get a degree. He just started riding his bike.<br><br>Most of the time, I realise I do the talking. He also tries to make me decide on the mundane "Where/What to eat?" questions. Much as I feel that a meaningful conversation about ethics and politics is highly engaging, I would not go so far as to say that talking about movies and entertainment is shallow. (You can even call it the Arts so it ain't so shallow. haahha!)<br><br>I feel that talking about anything you are passionate about is a sign that you feel. Now that's good for me. Be it sports, gaming, whatever... as long as it doesn't totally engulf your entire life(style), I think it can be a good thing. I wouldn't want to go out with someone who didn't even know what were the movies in the theatres now! Now THAT's scary.<br><br>But maybe i'm just not that "highly educated"? Or I'm just not so inclined to the "finer things in life". I am pretty much the "traditional" girl I guess. I was brought up that way. My sis turned out different but hey, somehow I stand by my way. I enjoy talking about anything from pop stars' gossip to musicals; newsy topics and ethics... I'm not very well-read so yes, obviously there's a limit to what I will talk about. But I enjoy it. 'cos my fundamentals in life are family and friends. Everything else is too secondary to bother about.<br><br>Like I said... I'm "traditional".. perhaps abit too traditional and optimistic for this world/singapore.</div>
