The queen was fascinated by the bull and wanted it in her but knew the bull will kill her.<br><br>She then devised a plan. She had a wooden hollow cow constructed with her inside. Her servants (sworn to secrecy) placed the cow with her inside in the field where the bull was. They rubbed discharges from a cow in heat on the wooden cow.<br><br>The bull sensed the cow and then mounted it through a hole in the back of the wooden cow. The queen was positioned doggy style with her vagina fronting the hole. The muffled cries of the queen could be heared.<br><br>After this, the queen became pregnant and a half bull, half man creature called the minator was born.<br></div></blockquote>where u heard that from.. i only heard of the minotaur which was kept in a maze like area. then a hero was suppose to kill it or smth.. not sure.</div>
