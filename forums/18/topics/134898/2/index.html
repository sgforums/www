Also, ppl in Korea do plastic surgery, and it's not necessarily to have western features. That statement of yours is such a sweeping statement and so one-sided. Also, western celebrities are known to go for plastic surgery and other cosmetic enhancements as well. So the western features you see on tv aren't all that western.<br><br>Only diff is that in Korea, even very average ppl will go for cosmetic enhancement.<br><br>Since you mention Korea, would you describe Harisu(who was originally a guy) as having western features? What about Jang Nara? BOA? Members of S.E.S? And my personal fav, Jeon Ji Hyun? Do any of these ppl look very western to you?<br><br>You probably think Lucy Liu is the idea of asian prettiness.<br><br>And let's not just stay with Korea, look at the popular celebrities in Japan. Ayumi Hamasaki, Utada Hikaru, Kyoko Fukada.<br><br>Too many names to list. Point is, most of them do not look very western.<br><br>Main thing is, western views of asian beauty are quite screwed up. I keep seeing those caucasians at Zouk approaching the not so pretty and more plump girls on the dance floor rather than the many other pretty and slim ones (dance better as well) on the dance floor. Not saying all westernised ppl are like that, but I just don't trust their taste that's all. Just like how I don't trust yours.</div>

If you ask me, the pagaent is essentially a westernised competition and based on western standards.<br><br>Besides, saying chinese have slitty eyes is a rather biased statement. I know of lots of chinese who have big eyes. Really wonder how people in America and other western countries get the idea that all asians are slanty eyed. It's interesting how they come to that conclusion.<br><br>Moreover, the kind of asians western ppl tend to choose as models, actresses (think Lucy Liu) and even as asian porn stars are the ones that are slanty eyed. Which shows what kind of fixed idea of asians they have. Looks ugly if you ask me. But in doing so, they reinforce the idea that these are what chinese/asians look like, especially the ones considered pretty.<br><br>Personally going by looks alone, I'd choose a regular girl on orchard road over someone who looks like Lucy Liu anytime.<br><br>Western people really have poor taste when it comes to choosing 'pretty' asians. In fact, I would say asian countries would stand better chances if they sent someone more slanty eyed, since that's what they perceive as 'asian beauty'. Of course such a person would have problems winning their respective domestic pagaent.</div>

I'm fine with that, I don't like them too big actually. Western ppl have this big fixation on huge breasts, even if they look really fake and un-natural. At least with most asian ppl I know, they may like big but they prefer it natural. People like the Americans don't care.<br><br>Slitty eyes. That is a pretty sweeping statement. To say all chinese or asians have slitty eyes. Covered that in my previous post.<br><br>Porked nose? I'm quite sure most chinese I know don't have nostrils that I can stare right into wtihout them having to tilt their heads. I did happen to see this man at a bus stop once who must have been in an accident or something and I could look right down his nostrils. Feel sad for him, but point is, it was an accident (not a pretty one).<br><br>As for the double eye-lids thing, again another sweeping statement. I personally do know chinese who naturally have double eyelids. No operation and not of mixed parentage. I'm sorry I don't have pictures to prove it though, so I guess you may not believe me on this.<br><br>Anyway, youve basically stereotyped an entire race. I'm not angry or anything, but just to point that out to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My two cents worth.<br><br>Every race has its beautiful people,while its true that Indians have better features(Aryan descent) among Asians,I find myself attracted to girls of every race who look good.Some Chinese girls I've dated were shit shot.<br><br>Only idiots go into a debate about which race is more beautiful etc,because there is no answer to this question.I once even had a fling with an African-American I found hot.I think North Indian girls are shit hot as well(Not South Indian though,but I am NOT racist),and even some Malay and Arab girls.<br><br>Those who appreciate true quality do not care about where the prduct 'is made'.<br><br>Open up your mind and stop being bigots.Get youself an education.</div>
