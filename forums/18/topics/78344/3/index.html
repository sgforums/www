I mean, you could actually press charges for molestation!<br><br>In Singapore, the boy's picture will not be shown as he's underage. However, your picture will be shown on Newpaper! You could be famous! Known as the hot tuition teacher who seducted an innocent little primary sch going boy! tsk tsk...<br><br>If this was the states, you could sue the parents and get some money for it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  As they will prolly want to settle the case outside of a court jury and prolly ask for a plea bargain and an outside settlement for an undisclosed amount. Similar to the previous MJ case a few years back with the child he 'molested'?, the parents of the child dropped the charges and got a big tidy sum. Which brings back to the current day, he's back again in court with 10 charges, wonder what kind of tricks his million dollar a day legal lawyers and consultants are going to do.<br><br></div>
