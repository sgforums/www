            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, that's something that I would love to....you know, to slp with an ex. Well, actually I had such experience too. But not drunk kind. We broke off and still miss each others. After that, I felt the same as you too!<br><br>My advise is to stop doing that. Remind yourself that you are not her b/f anymore and it's not right that this is happening. If you really still love her, then let her know that you should not be doing this as a "Friend".<br><br>In case, next time both of you get back again. This thing will not be a "Dark Side".<br>Worst....If somehow things turn ugly between the two of you in future and maybe, (I say maybe as I really dun know how she is as a person!) what you did with her became a "weapon" against you.<br><br>Nobody has the right to say what you did was right or wrong. What you really want determines your actions. And your actions will have consequences. So think properly. Wish you luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cause your topic title is really bad as in the way you reference your ex.<br>It's actually up to you. Such private stuffs and as an adult you should know how you want this r/s to work out. If she don't mind and you feel that there's nothing wrong with having regular ONS with her then it's perfectly fine.<br><br>However, all our advices are on the safer side. have a clear cut so it won't get you into further dilema or trouble.<br><br>good luck lah.<br></div>
