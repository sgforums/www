            <div class='col-md body'>A woman is least likely to get pregnant during her period. During menstruation a woman's body is flushing out both the unfertilized egg and the lining her body prepared for the possibility of a fertilized egg, so it is quite difficult to get pregnant during this time. <strong>Yet it is not impossible</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sperm can reside inside of a woman's body for several days after sex, and a very slim chance exists that these several days will extend into the beginning of a woman's fertile period. </span><br>The greater risk involved with having unprotected sex during a woman's period is that she has mistaken spotting or other midcycle bleeding for her period. If this is the case, then a woman may be having unprotected sex at a time when she is very much fertile. It is also essential to remember that menstruation does not protect either partner from contracting HIV or a STD! Both menstrual blood and vaginal secretions can transmit STDs and HIV, exposing the partner of any HIV+ woman to greater risk. Also, many women with Herpes experience flare-ups during menstruation, making themselves more vulnerable to HIV or other STD infection through open sores and their partner more vulnerable to Herpes. There is also some debate over whether sex during menstruation exposes a woman to higher risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[<span style="font-style: italic;">b]It is always best to practice safe sex! [/b]</span></span><br><br>The only way to know for sure whether you're pregnant is to take a pregnancy test. And pregnancy tests are accurate early Â— as soon as a few days after a missed period. To be absolutely sure, it's best to have the test done by a health care provider. Health care providers use urine tests to detect pregnancy. Home tests can also detect pregnancy from a urine sample, but make sure to follow directions carefully and correctly.<br><br>i agree whole heartedly with WENDY on this better be save than sorry.......................................................<br><br></div>

Sometimes a girl will experience a small amount of vaginal bleeding at the time of ovulation - the time when she is most fertile. During ovulation, an egg is released from one of the ovaries and travels down a fallopian tube to the uterus. It's common for girls who are ovulating to have some vaginal bleeding that can be mistaken for a period.<br>Sometimes ovulation can occur before the bleeding from a girl's period has stopped, or it may occur within a few days after her period is over.

Along with the risk of becoming pregnant, there is also a risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, such as chlamydia, genital warts, or HIV.
