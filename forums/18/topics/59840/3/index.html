            <div class='col-md body'>I think underwear or panties is going to be unisexual sooner or later. Some panties from CK, Pierre Cardin etc.  are similar to the man's crocodile type underwear. And some of the underwear for man are using lycra material, low waist and even no seamline in front which is similar to a lady's panties.<br>I managed to buy some unisex underwear in China and Japan, they are very comfortable and sexy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Now is just that designers have not designed lace underwear for man.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Met 1 of them at an undergarment shop &amp; 1 of them happened to be a course mate.<br></div>
