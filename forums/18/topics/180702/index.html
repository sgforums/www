            <div class='col-md body'>These are mainly guidelines, as rules cannot be enforced. Guidelines can be encouraged. Anyone who's been "about" for a while will know these anyway. Be aware that the good guys might read this and say Â‘itÂ’s all common senseÂ’. Not everyone you meet Dogging either knows of this Site or cares a toss about the guidelines. So donÂ’t come back on here and complain. These will help you enjoy the experience, but not make it too regimented.<br><br>SINGLE GUYS<br><br>The FIRST thing you have to understand is this:<br><br>The WOMAN in the party is in command.<br>NO means NO, STOP means STOP.<br>If you don't UNDERSTAND this, then dogging ISN'T for YOU.<br>The name of this game is FUN.<br><br>THERE ARE MANY TIMES MORE SINGLE GUYS DOING THIS THAN COUPLES OR SINGLE WOMEN.<br><br>So, don't expect a lot of action.<br>You may be lucky, but you probably won't. Waiting is most of the game.<br>It may seem a good idea to YOU to park at one end and then drive down when a car comes into the car park, so that your lights shine on the occupants. But others also think the same and they'll be doing it too.<br>It isn't a good idea, it's a very BAD idea because it always ends up with four or five cars driving up-and-down all night.<br>Don't keep your lights on when parked-up. If you're afraid of the dark, stay at home.<br>If you're too thick to appreciate this, please stay at home.<br>Patience IS a virtue, in fact in dogging it's about the only one.<br>If you arrange to meet a couple, please don't bother going to a dogging site because there WILL be others there and they WILL be watching you. If you don't like that idea then go somewhere else.<br>Don't creep-up on cars, if you think they are in for a show, let them see you first.<br>If they aren't up for it they'll drive off.<br>If they are and you creep-up on them you'll scare the woman (more likely the bloke though, in which case the woman will give you a kicking, masochism is optional)<br>This is a dark car park/park we're talking about, not a lounge.<br>I'D get scared if someone crept up behind me !<br>Sign Language: Flashing brake lights are for gays.<br>Couples drive in and flash the internal lights mainly, then the<br>headlights if they see you.<br><br>Basic behaviour:<br>If the window isn't OPEN, or they haven't ASKED for you to join in, then they don't WANT you to.<br>Even if the window IS open ASK first, or LISTEN.<br>If the window is open, go and chat to the GUY.<br>*DO NOT* grab hold of the woman unless INVITED or ASKED.<br>Please don't expect anyone to blow you if you've been sitting on your arse in a car all day and your dick is humming. Try and be a bit clean, use some baby wipes and clean the bits that matter. Even if the couple DO want to play and have rubbers with them, it's polite to have your own.<br>If a couple ask you, or others, to move away because there are too many guys about...MOVE AWAY...DON'T moan about it just DO it.<br>If there are others already "ON" a car and you aren't, DON'T sit there with your lights on thinking they will move off and you can get some action because the COUPLE will move off too.<br>If all you can think about is getting a free shag and f**k everyone else, then you have got the wrong end of the stick. There is FAR more WATCHING than DOING in this game.<br><br>*******************************************************<br>COUPLES<br><br>Credits:<br>Taken from a variety of other sites and also from discussion with doggers and couples.<br>First part: Description and general advice.<br>*******************************************************************************<br>Dogging is the broad term used to cover all the sexual outdoor activities that go on.<br>This can be anything from putting on a show from your car, to a gangbang on a picnic table.

If this advice helps you, please take the time to email me and let me know, it's nice to know people to appricate the effort it takes to write these advice pages, and if you would, I'd love some more dogging experiences for my erotica section.<br><br>This next bit was sent in by Christine from Tamworth and it covers clothing for dogging females.<br><br>After much hassle over the years and with the need to look sexy yet be able to get lost quick sometimes.<br><br>Top- IÂ’ve found that a crop jacket with zip all I need for a top half Â– though in summer it something simple a cooler like a boob-tube works.<br><br>Bottom half - Short skirt no underwear for ease Â– maybe a pair of stay-up stockings.<br><br>Footware Â– this can actually be a nightmare and stiletto shoes or big platforms (although sexy) can be a real pain. The best thing I can ever suggest are kneeboots with a medium heel or lower Â– if a higher heel is worn, itÂ’s better for the heel to be quite thick (never suede). If you are going to do a group thing on the ground - consider a slightly racier longer boot to<br>protect your knees. I once wore a pair of very high strppy things while being taken at both ends over a motor bike and burnt my damn legs Â– so boots are definitely the way to go Â– and the guys love themÂ…bless<br><br>One final item that I sometimes wear depending on the situation - is a pair of glovesÂ… if you are playing with many people in an evening , then these become very helpful indeed and can add a slightly fetish feel to everything. If buying leather ones, go for unlined and very tight, if you go for pvc ones Â– red looks better in the dark than black (oddly).<br><br>DonÂ’t wear earings!! Sharp nails hurt!!<br><br>Mouth washÂ…. What can I say Â…<br><br>Wet wipes Â– amazing what you can clean, even before you start lolÂ… and kitchen role is better than tissues<br><br>A blanket!!!!<br><br>KY !!!!!!<br><br>Take care Christine<br><br>Hope this helps you have fun - Luv Mel xxxxx<br></div>
