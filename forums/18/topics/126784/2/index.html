            <div class='col-md body'>The constant click-clacking from our keyboards broke the silence in the office.  The events that have passed has made me slightly lose concentration in my work.  I kept casting subtle glances out of my room, looking at her, reassuring myself that she is still around.<br><br>In my mind, I was formulating thoughts on how best to handle this abrupt, sudden "closeness" to her.  It is a fact I have not gotten laid for a long time.  I always have this uncanny jinx that prevents me from having an orgasm with a woman.<br><br>This jinx have always been the contributing factor in many a joke my buddies come up with.  With me as the main lead, of course.<br><br>My work done, I took another look at her out of the corner of my eye.  Poor girl.  I noticed the clock read 10.34pm.  She's very dedicated to her work, I thought.<br><br>I punched her extension number on my phone as I picked up the handset.<br><br>"Hello, what time you going back?"  I asked her.<br><br>"Sian lor.  Still have some more.  You done yet?"<br><br>"Me too."  I lied, wanting to stay back a little more.  Deep inside, I was wondering if I could get lucky today.  After all, in every man, a part of him is always a dreamer.  "You want a drink?  I go to the pantry and get for you."<br><br>"Water please.  I'm so tired.  Thanks hor."<br><br>I went back to her desk and sat on the table, passing her the drink.  As she gulped down water, I noticed her chest moving up and down with every gulp.  I couldn't see much as she was still wearing her office jacket but well, it made me wonder a little on what lies within.<br><br>Feeling a little frisky, maybe relieved with the work that I had already completed.  I told her I was good at massaging and if she wanted to try it out.  I lied obviously, I don't know much about it but I knew I could be good with my hands.  (good in many aspects she probably didn't know about)<br><br>"Good good.  Help me massage please."  She giggled again.  She sounds so cute and cuddly when she giggles.  It makes one want to tickle her just to hear it again.<br><br>She swiveled around on her chair, back facing me.  I got to work and starting to hold her shoulders with both my hands and compress them.  LIke I said, I'm not a trained professional in the art of massaging but half of me wanted to relieve her and the other half just wanted to, you know, feel her body.<br><br>I must be doing it right.  Alternating between her shoulders and the back of her neck, pressing and squeezing.  She looked relaxed and leaned her head forward when I worked on the neck.<br><br>"You want to take off your jacket or not?  No one around to see and furthermore the air con shuts down from 6pm onwards."  I said, as a matter of factly.<br><br>She unbuttoned her beige jacket and I helped to take it off.  She was wearing a very nice tight white blouse under it.  She does have a very nice figure.  I love women with small waists and this girl definitely had one that made me want to hold.<br><br>She wasn't very busty but she's not flat either.  I would say she's very proportionately endowed.  But what really turned me on was the black brasierre.  There it was, lace and all, under a semi-translucent white top that didn't do a good job hiding it.  I was pressing my hands on her shoulder and I longed to feel the strap of the bra without the soft material of the blouse in the way.<br><br>"Feel better?  Working OT is always like that.  Hope you don't do it often so you won't need to get used to it."  Another lie for today.  I would definitely hope she OTs more.  And guess who's going to stay back too.<br><br>"Mmm.  Very nice leh.  You must have practiced this on a lot of other girls is it?"  Her hand moved to mine and I held it for a moment.  Does this mean the gun has fired and I should dash furiously towards the finishing line?<br><br>I moved forward a little and now stood directly behind her.  It was unfortunate that she had all the buttons in the blouse in place or I would have the good fortune to look down into her cleavage.<br><br>With the jacket out of the way, I plucked up courage and started to move my hands lower.  Started by massaging the sides of her shoulders downwards towards her elbow.  Her hand was still on mine as I applied pressure around her back and upper arms.  I intentionally brushed the side of the breasts when I moved downwards towards her elbow but there was no resistance at all.<br><br>Looks are very deceiving.  All this while I thought she was a goody-two-shoes but it seems like she is a very modern and open woman.  I made a mental note to not come to any conclusion in future, based on fashion sense, when it comes to women.<br><br>Out of a sudden, while I was still engrossed in my thoughts, she moved my hand atop her soft breasts.  Damn!  What's happening!?  My actions came to a standstill, with one hand on her shoulder and the other cupping her breasts.  I was pleasantly shocked and I could feel my heart shifting into overdrive.  Here we were, a man and a woman all alone in the office.  Nothing should happen, but everything was happening.<br><br>"Don't stop."  She said softly and leaned her head back on the seat looking lovingly at me.  It seemed as though her eyes were begging me to continue, to keep on massaging her beautiful breasts.<br><br>-final part coming up-<br></div>

Stacks of documents to go through, papers to sign and the incessant complains from my direct reports on the latest and greatest humiliation they have gone through with another colleague in another department.  Sigh...<br><br>6pm.  Many people start packing up and leaving the office.  Being a mid level manager with a requirement to have frequent conference calls with my manager in the US.  I am required to work late on nights where there will be critical decisions to make.  Tonight is one of them.  A relatively new girl, who had recently joined the company, is staying back as well.  From my position in my room, I can look out into the cubicles and watch her staring at her computer screen, punching in data.<br><br>"She's probably in her mid 20s." I thought.<br><br>Dressed up in a standard fare beige suit and matching beige skirt.  She looks really decent but kind of attractive in a sweet way.  As usual, I don't go very far fantasizing about women, much less in my office.  I've had a bad reputation for not getting any luck with women at all.<br><br>A little past 7pm.  The silence is broken with a knock on my door.  There she was, giving me a full frontal view of a very normal office lady.  He hair was let down to the shoulders.  I could tell she had it rebonded recently.<br><br>"I'm going down to get some food hor.  Wanna come along or I tah pao for you?"<br><br>I looked at my screen, the PC was still waiting for the reports to be downloaded.  Should I go grab a bite and come back later?  Or maybe take a small break and surf the web a bit?<br><br>"You go ahead lah.  I still need to wait for the US guys to call me back.  So sianz."  I decided on the latter.  Feeling a little lazy today.  Furthermore, I wasn't in the mood to be flirty today.<br><br>"Aiyoh, it's a bit late and you still haven't eaten."  She walked into the room and stood beside me, taking a look at what I was doing.  "No point waiting anyway, come let's go down and eat lor.  You should be very hungry now too mah."<br><br>Fate must be playing a joke on me today because at the same time.  A good friend of mine decided to send me a message on Yahoo IM.  A pop-up came up on the screen and on it appeared the dreadful words.<br><br>"Hey f ucker!"<br>"I heard from Jack you haven't had sex for months!  You damn jialat leh!  Wanna go AM or not?"<br><br>*AM in my cliche = An Mo (massage)<br><br>I was leaning back in my chair when those words appeared.<br>She was looking at my screen when it appeared.<br><br>I must have beaten a world record sitting back straight up and pressing Alt-F4 to close the chat window.  But alas, it's too late.  She managed to see it.  I could see her look turn a bit embarassed and well, I believe I might have reddened up too.  The silence was embarassing.  Only thing I could hear was the air-con humming above my head.  For a moment that lasted like an eternity, we did not speak a word.<br><br>I moved my mouse around to close off some of the programs that were not needed.  Then I plucked up the courage and said, "So pai seh.  My friends usually not very tactful.  Sorry for letting you see that."<br><br>"Aiyoh, suddenly my impression of you change.  Did you know the first time I saw you I thought you are very decent and gentleman type?"  She gave me a smile as she looked at me.  At the same time, I realised her hand was on my shoulder.<br><br>"Sorry lah.  Office environment mah.  Everyone will act "decent" here."  I said, a matter of factly.<br><br>"So how, let's go and eat lah.  You reply your friend and tell him your thirst will be quenched today lor."  I stared at her as she said that and gave me a wink and a little squeeze on my shoulder.<br><br>Am I dreaming?!<br><br>-to be continued-</div></blockquote>got this from <a href="http://www.dirtystories.com" rel="nofollow">www.dirtystories.com</a> ?</div>
