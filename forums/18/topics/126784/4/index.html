            <div class='col-md body'>Well, being a very normal and sane man, I could not stop even if I wanted to.  I could tell in her eyes that she was actually yearning for more.  And in all fairness, I wanted more too.  I could feel my rationale starting to move from the brain into the other head.<br><br>Without further ado, I started to unbutton her blouse and was rewarded with a very marvelous top down view of her black bra.  Like I mentioned earlier, she wasn't a very busty lady.  But it was enough to look at, much more to feel.  I cupped both my hands lovingly on each side and started to feel her already erect ni*ples through the smooth material.<br><br>"Erm, I don't remember learning this massage technique before."  I joked as I started to rub and caress her brea*ts.<br><br>She laughed and held both my hands, as if as she was hanging on during a carnival ride.  "But I think this is the best massage you have given me tonight.  More relaxing than the backrub."<br><br>I bent a bit and kissed her on her forehead.  A short quick peck.  Women love that a lot.  Women have this inkling that when they are kissed on the forehead, it shows that the man adores them a lot.  At the same time, I slipped my hands underneath the bands of her skirt and groped around a bit.  I felt the soft silky bands of her panties but unfortunately I could not go in deeper or lower.  I had to get her off her skirt.<br><br>It was about 11 plus now, the thought of us making love in the office seemed more like a reality.  To hell with Jack, I thought.  Wait till I tell you guys how happening my "rendezvous" was.<br><br>I turned her around on her seat so she was now facing me.  I knelt in front of her and we kissed lovingly.  A long soft kiss that lovers shared.  Moving my hands behind her back, I slipped off the hooks on her bra and pulled the cups out, revealing two petite, perky and very attractive brea*ts.  No warning given, I slipped my mouth over one of them and began to tongue the nip*le.  The other was not spared either, as my hand started to give it the attention it deserved.<br><br>It must have felt quite good for her.  She hugged my head tightly to her torso and I could hear her breathing become shorter and slightly louder.  I would definitely love to hear her moaning but sadly, she didn't.  That made me work even harder.  I challenged myself to make her moan in pleasure before this ended.<br><br>Switching my attention to the other brea*t, I started to unzip her skirt and pull them off.  Right now, sitting in front of me, was my colleague in her opened blouse, black bra unhooked with both brea*ts revealed and slightly damp from the oral massage.<br><br>But the greatest turn on was that wonderful silk panty she was wearing.  It wasn't the hot and sexy G string that we men notice whenever we walk behind a girl thats wearing it.  It was the classy, silky type that had lace and patterns on it.  It was really a great turn on looking at it and feeling the soft material.  My brother would feel right at home rubbing against the material.  That great, orgasm-inducing silk.  Sigh...<br><br>We kissed once more and she locked her arms around my neck and held me close.  I started to rub slowly and gently on her crotch, moving my fingers around the lower front of her panty.  She was getting into it now, her legs lifted up and opened wider as I fingered her.  The aroma of sex was now more noticeable as I continued masturbati*g her while we kissed as though as we were a reunited couple.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>My knees felt painful and tired, from kneeling for so long.  It would be nice if I could stand up and make love to her while she rested on the table top instead.  I broke the kiss and stood up, making sure to kiss her on her forehead once more.  Without saying a word, her hands moved to my pants and she undid the button (I don't have a habit of wearing a belt) and the zip and pulled them down.  Man, it must have been embarassing for me as of all days, I had to choose today to wear my mahjong boxers.  Pictures of mahjong tiles were scattered all over the green and red boxers.<br><br>She gave me a very amused look.  "So cute."  And pulled the boxers down too and held my already long erected brother in her hand.  It felt good being held by a woman, the warmness of her hand seemed to dissipate into the blood engorged flesh, and the anticipation was driving me crazy.<br><br>Now I am very convinced this woman didn't seem like what she wore in the office.  She took me in her mouth and started to return me a mind-blowing oral massage, her style.  I could feel her tongue licking the underside of me and darting around the head, it was heaven.  I never felt so good looking at the rhythmic movement of her head and hand.  She knew when I wanted her to go faster.  I don't even need to say anything or to guide her with my hands and all I did was to lay them on her shoulders and relax.  This is certainly the best blow job I've had in my entire life!<br><br>The sensation was reaching a climax and I could feel myself getting ready to come in her mouth.  It was certainly a challenge trying my best to hold back, while she was trying her hardest to make me come.  I don't want to come without first giving her my best in lovemaking.  Pushing her away, I pulled her up and sat her on her desk.  It would be too selfish right now for me to have a quickie and just leave her hanging there.  At this point in time, I wanted both of us to leave the office with the best memory and experience we have ever had.<br><br>I pulled off her panty and revealed a soft mound of pubic hair hiding the small opening that was her vagi*a.  It was wet with moisture and look very soft and inviting.  Certainly the stuff wet dreams are made of.  I could picture me inside her bucking non stop as she held me around my neck and hooked her legs around me.<br><br>I was almost ready to penetrate her small and tight pussy.  But I was still close on the verge of having an orgasm and there is no way I want to embarass myself by coming so soon like a teenager.  I pulled her close for another kiss and once more began to wet my fingers by exploring her again.  She moaned this time as I slipped my finger into her and felt her wetness.  I increased my pace and she opened up wider and held my arm as if using me as her vibrator.<br><br>With another moan, she whispered in my ears, "I love you.  F uck me now please."<br><br>"I will.  Let's make sure we are both ready ok?"  She's not helping me relax and ease up the orgasmic sensation by saying this.  Her hand moved to my brother and held it, pulling it towards her opening, wanting me to enter fast.  She was really desperate for it, using her other hand to hug my body towards her.<br><br>Not able to control or resist it anymore, I told myself to screw the embarassment even if I came early.  I could not hold back anymore and I just want to do it right now!<br><br>BANG!  There was a sudden, loud sound that echoes throughout the office.  Pulling my thoughts together I realised someone had entered the side entrance to the office as that was the sound of the door closing.  I bet we had the biggest shock of our lives!<br><br>There was a sound of something being dragged along the floor and I shouted into the nothingless, "Hello!? Who's there?"<br><br>A foreign voice replied me, "Hello? Sir?"<br><br>Oh damn!  The cleaner usually comes at about midnight to vacuum and clean up the office.  In my lust, I totally forgot about it and didn't realise it was close to midnight when we started our little escapade.  At about the same time, her mobile phone started to ring.  Imagine the confusion and shock we must be going through.<br><br>I shouted back, "Wait! Don't come in yet.  You go out!"  And received an acknowledgement and the prompt slam of the door as the cleaner left the office.<br><br>She was in the midst of putting on all the clothes as she hung up from her call.  I was hastily putting on my own clothes too.  We both looked at each other and giggled like little schoolchildren.<br><br>"I'm sorry leh.  I forgot about the cleaner.  Being with a beautiful woman like you, I forget everything."  I really meant that.  While we were enjoying ourselves, time seemed to stop and I totally forgot about the daily cleaning service.<br><br>"It's ok.  I felt really good after your special massage too."  Her smile was so sweet and my heart warmed by it.  I'm thinking of sending her back but maybe drop by a budget hotel to finish what we started.  But what she said next sent me crashing back down to earth in disappointment.<br><br>"I need to go.  Can't stay in office.  My friend meeting me downstairs soon."<br><br>This was just so unfortunate.  Another great experience with lots of opportunities for me and then it has to come to this.  With a heavy heart, I sent her out through the main door and went back to the side door and told the cleaner to come in and do his work.<br><br>I went back to my room and sat in front of my PC, wanting to continue the chat with my friend and share with him my agony.  What I saw was just "StarBurst may not reply you as his status is currently offline."<br><br>Crap!  Alone again and not having any sex in real life...<br></div>
