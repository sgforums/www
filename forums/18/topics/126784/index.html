            <div class='col-md body'>It's another boring, mind numbing day at work.  Stacks of documents to go through, papers to sign and the incessant complains from my direct reports on the latest and greatest humiliation they have gone through with another colleague in another department.  Sigh...<br><br>6pm.  Many people start packing up and leaving the office.  Being a mid level manager with a requirement to have frequent conference calls with my manager in the US.  I am required to work late on nights where there will be critical decisions to make.  Tonight is one of them.  A relatively new girl, who had recently joined the company, is staying back as well.  From my position in my room, I can look out into the cubicles and watch her staring at her computer screen, punching in data.<br><br>"She's probably in her mid 20s." I thought.<br><br>Dressed up in a standard fare beige suit and matching beige skirt.  She looks really decent but kind of attractive in a sweet way.  As usual, I don't go very far fantasizing about women, much less in my office.  I've had a bad reputation for not getting any luck with women at all.<br><br>A little past 7pm.  The silence is broken with a knock on my door.  There she was, giving me a full frontal view of a very normal office lady.  He hair was let down to the shoulders.  I could tell she had it rebonded recently.<br><br>"I'm going down to get some food hor.  Wanna come along or I tah pao for you?"<br><br>I looked at my screen, the PC was still waiting for the reports to be downloaded.  Should I go grab a bite and come back later?  Or maybe take a small break and surf the web a bit?<br><br>"You go ahead lah.  I still need to wait for the US guys to call me back.  So sianz."  I decided on the latter.  Feeling a little lazy today.  Furthermore, I wasn't in the mood to be flirty today.<br><br>"Aiyoh, it's a bit late and you still haven't eaten."  She walked into the room and stood beside me, taking a look at what I was doing.  "No point waiting anyway, come let's go down and eat lor.  You should be very hungry now too mah."<br><br>Fate must be playing a joke on me today because at the same time.  A good friend of mine decided to send me a message on Yahoo IM.  A pop-up came up on the screen and on it appeared the dreadful words.<br><br>"Hey f ucker!"<br>"I heard from Jack you haven't had sex for months!  You damn jialat leh!  Wanna go AM or not?"<br><br>*AM in my cliche = An Mo (massage)<br><br>I was leaning back in my chair when those words appeared.<br>She was looking at my screen when it appeared.<br><br>I must have beaten a world record sitting back straight up and pressing Alt-F4 to close the chat window.  But alas, it's too late.  She managed to see it.  I could see her look turn a bit embarassed and well, I believe I might have reddened up too.  The silence was embarassing.  Only thing I could hear was the air-con humming above my head.  For a moment that lasted like an eternity, we did not speak a word.<br><br>I moved my mouse around to close off some of the programs that were not needed.  Then I plucked up the courage and said, "So pai seh.  My friends usually not very tactful.  Sorry for letting you see that."<br><br>"Aiyoh, suddenly my impression of you change.  Did you know the first time I saw you I thought you are very decent and gentleman type?"  She gave me a smile as she looked at me.  At the same time, I realised her hand was on my shoulder.<br><br>"Sorry lah.  Office environment mah.  Everyone will act "decent" here."  I said, a matter of factly.<br><br>"So how, let's go and eat lah.  You reply your friend and tell him your thirst will be quenched today lor."  I stared at her as she said that and gave me a wink and a little squeeze on my shoulder.<br><br>Am I dreaming?!<br><br>-to be continued-</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We had a simple meal at the food court at the basement of Suntec City.  Since she was relatively new, we talked about life in the office.  People who are nice, and those who aren't.  We felt comfortable with one another.  She laughed infectiously when I joked, throwing her head back when she did, making me think a little of the "dirty" movies I watched where the female lead arches back in ecstacy.<br><br>I changed the topic to a more personal level.<br><br>"Your guy meeting you later?  Or do you have a hot date tonight?" I smiled.<br><br>She avoided answering my question and said, "You leh?  Young, successful guy like you sure have a lot of women going for you hor?"<br><br>Man, how I wish what she said was an undeniable truth.  "Wah! Don't anyhow say.  You saw what my friend said in Yahoo earlier, what you think?"  I laughed like a little schoolboy confessing his puppy love for his cute schoolmate.<br><br>"That bad meh?  Then you must be a very eligible, right?"  She giggled.<br><br>"Aiyah, let's go back."  Like I mentioned earlier, I felt lazy today and just want to wrap up and go back for a well deserved rest.<br><br>"Hey finish your drink leh.  Don't waste."  I had only sipped on my fruit juice a little but was busy chatting that I forgot about it.<br><br>"Oh yah!  You said my thirst will be quenched today right?"  I finished the drink and stood up.  Ready to go back to my room and bury my nose in work.<br><br>She looked up at me innocently and pointed at my crotch, "I didn't mean this thirst ok?  I meant that one."<br><br>Whoa! Wait a minute!  Is she making some sexual indication to me?  I could feel the temperature on my face turn up a few notches.  Here I have, my new colleague, just a normal, sweet-looking woman, who just attempted to appeal to my desires.<br><br>I took a moment to look at her again, unsure of what to say in response to her.  She really has a nice pointy chin, I thought.  The types that you see in Korean dramas.  She had only mild makeup on but it was evident that she would still look attractive without any.  It would be nice to have her remove her spectacles and see how she looked without them.<br><br>Though it was a slow, lethargic day, hearing that seems to perk me up a little.  I wasn't expecting anything to happen between us at all, even with the words she said.  I guess she was probably having her period.  My friends used to tell me women are especially "naughty" when their relative visits for the month.<br><br>We took the lift up to the office.  The ride was slightly less than a minute.  But usually gives people enough time to have some small talk.  Surprisingly, we did not have much to talk about.  I was standing near the door of the lift, eager to get back to work while she was just behind me.  I could see the reflection of her face in the lift's door, which acted as a mirror.  She saw me staring and gave me another naughty wink.<br><br>"You know something?"  She broke the silence.  "A lot of girls in the office think that you..."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>She started to giggle cheekily, "Have a nice..."  And she patted my butt with her hand.<br><br>We arrived at our floor.  My mind was racing with thoughts on what this woman was doing to me.  She certainly didn't look like a wild one, but she was definitely driving me wild with her little actions.  My butt felt like it wanted to feel her palm again.  The feeling made my hair stand as we went back to work, back at our places.  I glanced out of my room periodically and looked in her direction, wondering what else this night might bring.<br><br>-to be continued-<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me add more space into this:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I quickly stepped out of the lift upon reaching our office floor.<br><br>No, I kept telling myself. I must not succumb to this temptations.<br><br>Office relationships were a big taboo in our organisation, and I had seen what had happened to the previous accounting manager when he was found kissing his secretary intimately in the ladies.<br><br>Fired.<br><br>I couldn't risk losing this job, I had worked so hard for it, toiling day and night, even to the point of ditching my ex-girlfriend of six years because she kept complaining I had been spending more time in office than with her.<br><br>What was I thinking?<br><br>The inner demons within me were raging and I felt as if a surge of illogical thoughts seemed to overwhelm me.<br><br>Why was I even working my ass so hard for?<br><br>Memories came back and flooded my mind: Mom.<br><br>Mom wasn't the greatest of mothers; she was the best.<br><br>As far as I could tell, she always could balance housework with her career, fighting and struggling every single day to make sure me and my sister were properly clothed and fed.<br><br>Dad might have walked out on us for one of his female colleagues at work, but Mom was more than a mom to us, she was everything.<br><br>And so think of how devastated I was when I was finally promoted to General Manager six months ago, I thought I could finally give Mom the life she wanted.<br><br>I mean, all I had to do was scrim every cent and work hard, Mom's dream of a nice house and big garden wouldn't be out of my means if I made the right investments and make the right friends.<br><br>Then the medical report came back: Terminal colon cancer.<br><br>I couldn't bear breaking the news to my mom, but when I did, she just froze and fought back the tears bravely.<br><br>Her son? Me?<br><br>I just broke down.<br><br>After her imminent death (it was swift), I buried myself daily in work to overcome the pain I had endured seeing my mother suffer her whole life just for me and my sister, only to not be able to enjoy the fruits of her labour.<br><br>That was also why my ex girlfriend broke up with me: Workaholic, she termed me.<br><br>Oh well, she should have known better. I was workaholic yes, but only because work seemed to be the only alcohol I knew that would give some sort of brief reprise to my mother's loss.<br><br>.....<br><br>Suddenly this girl seems to be interested in me?<br><br>What was she thinking?<br><br>I was neither handsome nor charming, I had some cash but hey, I was basically a no-lifer, work for me ended with a daily routine at the gym to sweat out my woes.<br><br>Life was in mono: Wake up, work, gym, sleep... I felt I was turning into more of a zombie...obviously she felt it differently.<br><br>I peered out of my office room and there she was, still on her computer, perhaps MSNing with her friends or maybe blogging down her thoughts on this weird male colleague who doesn't respond to woman's advances...<br><br>Sorry lady, I'm not your average male colleague.......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All this while i was fantasizing about what could possibly happen later in the evening if i were to stayed longer<br>waiting for that email or phonecall from the guys up in US. The phone evetually rung and i hestiate to pick it up.<br>That i did because i know i have to- work.<br><br>"hallo" i answer while my other hand wondered (not to my crotch minfd you) over to my computer's mouse and clicked<br>on the latest download from my bosses in US. The hell got me! VIRUS!<br><br>"Get out of here...." comes a man's voice, in great pain and hesitantly panicky.<br>"Get out .....while....u ....can" the voice turned metallic and then monstruously rough!<br>"ARHH......" and then on the other side of the line i heard automatic gunshot fired and machine guns ratters.<br><br>I knew it! All this while the secrecy and covering up i am doing for the firm all boils down to one thing. I knew we<br>were doing some reserach and procurement of top secret weapons for the US here in Singapore. But little do i know that<br>this day would come. I ran over to look out at the skies and saw the impossible came true to life - our lives. The sky<br>turned red, as red as hell. I knew they fired the lates biological weapon after a failed negotiation. We were acquiring<br>this missle but the russian marked the prices sky high and a couple of my colleagues went undercover to retreive the<br>formula from their mad scientists but wer in vain. Non of them returned and there were not even a single rumour about their<br>ever existence after the mission.The Reds finally pressed the button. the missile exploded some 5 kilometers up in the sky<br>and created a nuclear fusion afterwards. The fusion were technically coupled with a biological reaction that burns and eats<br>up every living being and everything around me. One which once stood fall. Mankind dropped on all fours and started huunting<br>like the beasts. I scrambled for that jab which i knew boss' kept safe in his drawer on the table. It is the only antidote to<br>keep me alive and a main prevention from enslavery as a walking corpse and a hunting beast of my own kind.<br><br>I grabbed the spyringe and injected it into my heart through the riib cage without hesitant. Oh the pain was so unbearable<br>but i gritted my teeth and and applied piston pressure so that the precious fliud will flow faster towards my heart. It did<br>and for once in life i was filled with vigour. I made it and keep me alife! Like a gifted and seasoned warrior, i removed my<br>tie and reached for my loaded beretta. 16 rounds of 9 millimeter parallebrum with 15 in the clip and 1 round already<br>chambered through the breech. I thumbed the safety off but i am now reaching for the Remington Brushmaster and that regular<br>box of 12-gauge shotgun rounds holding ball bearing shots that will probably save in when the time comes for me to cross the<br>bridge between life and death.<br><br>I tugged my pistol into my trousers and pumped a sturdy red 12 gauge into my Remington shotgun. Heading out of the office room<br>i saw the security guard fuc king my female colleague! Damn this is a situation which i did not wish to land in because they were<br>2 walking corpses and zoombies banging! Waht the hack?! They used to be human and we cannot denied a good f cuk from them even now<br>when they are half gone, can't i? No time to lose. I squeezed the trigger and got the undead security in a pool and splash of<br>blood and gore.<br><br>"i am sorry my dear but i just have to let you go to save my own as s." I hispered to myself and i slide another round into my<br>shotgun. Affirmative and with a sharp slide-action report from the mechanism's clicking, i level the sights at her boobsy chest<br>and let the second round fly. Home it went.<br><br>I notice the MP5 submachine gunlaying on the floor and it once must have served the security guard. The though of having it under<br>my possession seems meaningful enough and i know i will get abundant supply of the 9mms from the weapon cache and arsenal room<br>located on the second floor......<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
