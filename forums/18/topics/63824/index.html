            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry about this girls you just met, she is superficial. She didn't want to be your girl friend because you are to skinny that just shows how lame this person is.<br>But however if your weight will affect you in the future with your interactions with other girls, just go to your local health food store and ask for something called a mass gainer with lots of calories. A good one I recommend if they have it in Singapore is called "Maxi's weight gainer". It really does work, I was to small to play rugby and after about 4 months of taking it and doing weights I went from 76 to 92 kilos.<br><br>Also there is a book called "Body for life" written by a guy name Bill Phillips, or you can just check out the website www.bodyforlife.com, which might help as well.</div>
