You should not have taken it seriously, next time don't take it seriously, I believe if you want to find someone, do it in person, or go clubbing or something, as long as its not a chat thing only. You never know who is at the other end, next time it may be some cannibal freak who says he is who "she" is.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>She says I am too skinny and she got no sense of security being with me .......</blockquote><br><br>Well most guys here are skinny, so its all right if you can blend in with the crowd. If your in a foreign country with big men then you should worry. But the feeling of security a woman gets does not just come from size and physical brawn, security comes in a lot more other forms: Money, Grace and attitude as well as charm. Examples, money is self explanatory for most of us I think. Grace/Charm can also give a woman security, for example when your walking with her along a road, you should act gentlemanly and walk with her keeping your body between her and the road, while your both on the pavement. Its simple things like this which reflect grace and character, that can also provide a woman with security.<br><br><strong><blockquote>I know I am skinny and I am only 51 kg you know I feel so inferior of myself for being so skinny I wanna cry </blockquote></strong><br><br>If your 24 years old, 1.75 cm tall and only 51 kg, you are underweight, you should be at least 70 kg. So you should eat more carbohydrates or protein shakes to be more leaner. Its easy, just try it.<br><br><strong><blockquote>But how can I gain weight no matter what i eat i am still so skinny like a stick</blockquote></strong></div></blockquote><strong>[/b]<br><br>No mate, its not WHAT you eat, its HOW MUCH you eat that decides your weight. You really need to stuff yourself, you've got at least 20 kilos you need to gain. So you've got to do what Eddie Murphy did in Nutty Professor.<br><br><strong><blockquote><br>[b][quote]<br>Do girls really go for looks ??? </blockquote></strong><br><br>Sadly, like most of us, YES. Girls do go for looks, but you must bear in mind that looks forms only a part of who we all are. However, looks are important, so is character, and while character is important so are looks, they come together. Both features one can change, so you have to work on it, everyone needs to work on something to be more perfect, even though it is harder to achieve.<br><br>Final words for you Mel: Keep looking until it becomes hopeless and then give up. The thrill of the chase will give you contentment, but soon the adrenaline will wear out and you will become dark and sinister. Trust me. But take care.<br><br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would not say the girl is shallow or superficial. I am a firm believer of Darwin's theory about evolution - selective breeding amongst healthy beings. The girl you are talking about is just demostrating the natural primitive behaviour necessary for genetic survival in our world which has and will always be shaped by evolution of our human species.<br><br>Standing at 1.76m and weighing only 51 kg, I think you are in need of some mass gaining to look better. Your height is fine and mass can be gain through very traditional and common methods of eating and exercising.<br><br>Unlike me, only 1.67m and 60 kg, there are really hardly any easy methods for me to be nearer to the sky.<br><br>So if after reading this and you are still feeling sore over your failed attempt at finding a mate, then you are a weak-minded loser who does not qualify to compete in the evolution race.

Was just asking, cause guys are normally thin, until they start working or when they start going to their 30's.  Anyway, i think someone else has already said it, go down to a GNC store and get a big-a s s bucket of weight gainers.  One of my friends actually did that, and he is trying not to gain too much weight now   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I think it's pretty sad that our younger generation are making friends online rather than in real life. People normally speak and behave differently online. Someone told me she is more real online, but what is real ?<br><br>And the more you are into "virtual world" communication, the more isolated you are from the real world.</div>
