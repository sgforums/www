Next time you can post it in Aunt Agony Section instead. (Heng, saw this in Top 50 topic)<br><br>***<br><br>First lesson you ought to realise - never take relationship for granted. How the future is like, will be shaped by the past. Tree can't grow properly if the stems has no room to grow and expand, instead it squeeze whichever way it could to take up for it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This degenerate a relationship.<br><br>You made three common mistakes:<br><br>I) Not showing appreciation of affection. This is critical especially if your girlfriend is Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces. One thing about long term relationship is that - the longer you lead them, such [b]personal appreciation, mushy talks, mini non-sexual intimacy has to double in frequency.</strong><br><br>II) Long term relationship is at great risk of a routine relationship. To break routine cycle, learn this: <strong>if you can't make everyday a different thing, avoid making everyday the same</strong>.<br><br>III) You want a invulnerable relationship, with love itself, it is not sufficient. You can't run away from effort. Man has this tendency to slack within the relationship after having them a long period of time. Break that tendency and love well everyday. <strong>Love is expressive - SHOW and BE KNOWN and not keep mum and remain passive</strong>.<br><br>Learn to see that relationship is especially vulnerable when the past screwed the future. See! you are worried now.<br><br>She allows a soul talk with you and the outcome turn out to be rather positive. At least she is willing to speak and she is willing to share what's going on with the relationship. There may be other factors going against you - but that shouldn't be our primary concern now.<br><br>I suggest if possible, take a break and go overseas holiday for say 3 days. Work stress and everything else can hinder your objective. Dump everything and enjoy your days somewhere nearby if cash is a problem. With only the two of you - let your behavior speaks for themselves. Do the three pointers I bold above, from there, you can slowly work your way up.<br><br>P.S: Don't be unnatural. Be yourself, but show your willingness to fork and give to this relationship. Don't expect - only give. Rewards? Talk later.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers      [/b]</blockquote>Hi, your advice is indeed good. I have been doing whatever you have said. I am trying to 'give' and not expect any rewards. But the fact is that without any visible results or improvement, i am becoming disheartened and slowly losing the will to carry on.<br><br>This is really tough!</div>
