            <div class='col-md body'>as ppl said, before you claim that she's a dead fish, check if the problem lies in you. We cant confirm it's your problem, only you know yourself, if you think you are ok in terms of time, in terms of quality of foreplay(you dun just take off her pants and start banging, rite?), in terms of others elements.<br><br>Girls do enjoy sex, but maybe not the way you think, try something romantic with her, light some candles, play some soft music, kiss her touch her for a long time before the real "action", she may like it. And try to do differnt things with her, or else both of you will feel boring doing same thing everytime.<br><br>ok, if it's not your problem, you have big little brother, you can do many times, you give her good foreplay, you take the trouble to set up romantic atmosphere, but she is still a dead fish....... Then you should ask her what's the problem, she dun enjoy sex at all or what. If you really have a very jialet sex life with your wife, maybe you can seek help from doctors, many ppl feel paiseh to seek help from doctor when comes to this kind of thing.<br><br>"wife is dead fish" is not an excuse to find girls outside.</div>

We cant confirm it's your problem, only you know yourself, if you think you are ok in terms of time, in terms of quality of foreplay(you dun just take off her pants and start banging, rite?), in terms of others elements.<br><br>Girls do enjoy sex, but maybe not the way you think, try something romantic with her, light some candles, play some soft music, kiss her touch her for a long time before the real "action", she may like it. And try to do differnt things with her, or else both of you will feel boring doing same thing everytime.<br><br>ok, if it's not your problem, you have big little brother, you can do many times, you give her good foreplay, you take the trouble to set up romantic atmosphere, but she is still a dead fish....... Then you should ask her what's the problem, she dun enjoy sex at all or what. If you really have a very jialet sex life with your wife, maybe you can seek help from doctors, many ppl feel paiseh to seek help from doctor when comes to this kind of thing.<br><br>"wife is dead fish" is not an excuse to find girls outside.</div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">words from a man.<br><br>thumbs up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></div>
