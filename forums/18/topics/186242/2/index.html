Who knows, she could be a "wild dragoness" when she's doing with someone else?<br><br>If your thoughts of finding other women to fulfill your sex desire is alright, well...it does gives your wife the rights to find other guys out there whom can bring her sexual desire to "wild fire"...<br><br>You want your wife to be fcuked by other guys out there and she love sex with other guys rather than with you? Imagine~~~~ Imagine she enjoying sex (NOT WITH YOU) with pleasure to the max....but NOT WITH YOU....<br><br>Can endure with such scenario? If can't, better don't try to find other women to fulfill your sexual desires...coz..the world's round and you know what's retribution?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mochou:</div><div class="quote_body">as ppl said, before you claim that she's a dead fish, check if the problem lies in you. We cant confirm it's your problem, only you know yourself, if you think you are ok in terms of time, in terms of quality of foreplay(you dun just take off her pants and start banging, rite?), in terms of others elements.<br><br>Girls do enjoy sex, but maybe not the way you think, try something romantic with her, light some candles, play some soft music, kiss her touch her for a long time before the real "action", she may like it. And try to do differnt things with her, or else both of you will feel boring doing same thing everytime.<br><br>ok, if it's not your problem, you have big little brother, you can do many times, you give her good foreplay, you take the trouble to set up romantic atmosphere, but she is still a dead fish....... Then you should ask her what's the problem, she dun enjoy sex at all or what. If you really have a very jialet sex life with your wife, maybe you can seek help from doctors, many ppl feel paiseh to seek help from doctor when comes to this kind of thing.<br><br>"wife is dead fish" is not an excuse to find girls outside.</div></blockquote>agree with u fully. gals enjoy sex. need to improve on his foreplay. if aroused, how dead can we be.... also need to check whether his one is too big or too small. reasons are obvious. pain level need to get used to. once when with an angmoh, his one so big, initially felt stimulated, but when inside, so pain, need to breathe and get used to his size. told him not to go all the way inside. men like to see us moan in pain when they pump us. the louder the moan, the harder he becomes, by then, already wet, not pain anymore. enjoy your sex. if not now, then when.</div>
