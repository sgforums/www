            <div class='col-md body'>Vampire rapist chews off victims' faces<br>Spurned by girlfriend, he bites off her nose, ear and cheek<br>NP, June 29, 2006<br><br>HE was sentenced to five years' jail in 2003 for brutally stabbing a woman and holding her hostage during a 19-hour ordeal.<br>Click to see larger image<br>Andrew Wild was sentenced to life in prison for his violent crimes.<br><br>But Andrew Wild was released two years early on the condition that he wear an electronic tag so his movements could be monitored.<br><br>Barely two months after his release, Wild viciously raped and beat up another woman, biting off parts of her face and laughing while he did it.<br><br>Last Friday, Wild, 40, was sentenced to life in prison for his violent crime.<br><br>The court heard that Wild, who is from Bury, Greater Manchester, had befriended his 38-year-old victim shortly after his early release, reported the British papers.<br><br>They got into a relationship, and Wild tried to propose to her twice.<br><br>When she wanted to stop seeing him, Wild snapped. He grabbed her and told her: 'You're not going anywhere.'<br><br>He then removed his electronic tag, and dragged the woman to Uppermill, where he held her hostage on a canal barge in a seven-hour ordeal.<br><br>On the barge, he bit off part of her nose and ear, bit her cheek and smashed her head against a wall. He also threatened to kill her children.<br><br>When officers found the victim, she was covered in blood. Bits of her flesh were also recovered from the barge.<br><br>The woman, who had to undergo plastic surgery, later told police that Wild was like 'a wild dog and a vampire', laughing as he attacked her.<br><br>Wild eventually pleaded guilty to rape, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, false imprisonment and assault.<br><br>This was not the first time that Wild had been so violent.<br><br>The court heard that he had two previous convictions for causing grievous bodily harm when he bit off part of a previous partner's ear and chomped of parts of another man's ear and eyelids in an attack in 1992, reported the Manchester Evening News.<br><br>Then in 2002, Wild was arrested for attacking his then girlfriend, Ms Christine Speed, and holding her hostage in an armed siege in Failsworth.<br><br>He also stabbed her in the arms, chest and legs.<br><br>And when armed police officers tried to coax him out of the house, he whipped out a chainsaw and threatened to kill them.<br><br>In February 2003, Wild pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, perverting the course of justice, threatening to destroy property and affray.<br><br>But even though Wild was given a life sentence this time round, British campaigners have criticised the legal system for releasing him early despite the severity of his crime.<br><br>'This is just a typical example of how the government and judiciary fail to keep the streets safe and the public safe,' said Mr Norman Brennan of Victims of Crime Trust.<br><br>'People should serve their full sentence, the government is more keen to keep people out of prison than in prison.</div>
