            <div class='col-md body'>I think hor, how you feel and how you behave is human nature.<br><br>But after the first look, your self control should come in.  This is something you need to learn and train to do.<br><br>Do not embarase your colleague by keeping on the stare at the bust.  Do concentrate on her other assets, such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc.<br><br>Of course you can say some words of praise such as "your are dressed bery bery pretty today, or for that matter everyday".<br><br>Buying more buns for your family members will definitely help.  Should extend this good habit to your friends also.  Of course not forgetting the forum mates here.<br><br>Enjoy yourself.</div>
