              <p>I recently went to Thailand with my friends for a holiday. At first we frequented the bars and we drank a lot of draft beer. From young, I am quite protected, my father never allowed me to go out but stay at home. But now, I am working and my father is more lax about who I mix with. So this is my first time partying with alcohol with my friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then we went to a go go bar. A lot of GRO ladies there. My guy friends were so excited they grab the GROs and groped them. Some of the GROs sat on my friends' laps and started bouncing up and down. Then one GRO saw I was so shy ask for my name. I was shy but I didn't want to show my friends that I am a sissy so I talk to the girl. But as the music start to flow, everyone was dancing, smoking and grouping each other, the GRO started touching me, tickling me and stroking my hand. As the music grew louder, she started to grab my thighs, tickled my neck and stroke my back. She began to huddle over me. I felt so uncomfortable and shy. My face went red because I couldn't stand the ticklish feeling as she was stroking my face, my back and pinching my chest. She then went for my balls and grouped my balls. I jumped up and said to her, please please no.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I looked at my friends for some relief and hoping they leave soon. But we spent 2 hours there ! The GRO fed me Tiger draft. I drank like 6 mugs (I am not a good drinker). I felt so high that I forgot the GRO was on top of me, molesting me and I was so vulnerable that she could even strip me but i wouldn't even know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the 2 hours, my friends decided to call it the day not because they are tired but they ran low on cash to buy beer. As i was about to leave, she asked me if I wanted "extra service". Being virgin, I am so shy but I listened to my father's warning about STDs. So I politely told her I wasn't keen. After we left, it was an experience to some but for me, I felt guilty because this place didn't treat women with much respect. I heard the GROs were badly paid and some of them university students desperate to work here to pay for their education.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you were me, what would you have done? Walk out on your friends? Or stay on and enjoy?</p>

              <p>It's good that you're cautious of STD. However, you shouldn't have to feel guilty about having some fun. Contrary to what Women's Groups are saying, many of these women are actually there by choice and the amout they earn is way above the average in their country.</p>
              <p>Go ahead and have fun with your friends but try not to drink too much. Whatever you do, is your choice to accept or decline. Cheers!!!</p>
