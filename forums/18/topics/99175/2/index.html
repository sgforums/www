But guess we are still not so...<br><br>As for how good Sly is... Hm... Though I kinda like he's style.. But I got to agree with Ken's comment that he looks more rock than he sounds.. I remembered he sang Bonjovi's Always and totally screw it... imho.. He's voice is still not tat rock.. Gota improve on that I suppose..<br><br>Daphne is just plain sweet... (nothing else) When it was announced that shes doing a Christina number, I'm ready for wat is to come... soft n weak performance.. A judge once said that she might be too young to conquer the idol stage and she replied "i'll prove it to u week by week" this could be a sign of either confidence or hao lian depending on how ppl view it...<br><br>Chrissipoo.. Not much comment..

            <div class='col-md body'>the media is biased against maia.. gave 4/10 for her performance.. wtf? its definately worthy of a better score. no one disagrees that her dance moves are bad, she is a good dancer and singer also so she doesnt deserve to leave so early. i still want to see more of her but i cant now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> i dont think ill continue to watch sg idol like that..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

As well, I am not sure if the votes are bias because she is a single mother as there have been lots of snide remarks about her private life. I think we are still not as open minded as we think we are. Anyway, I think Maia is being true to herself. She knows her style and she knows what she is good at. She does not have the vocals for some songs, so she don't do them. I agree with Ken here that she should just continue with what she is doing and not change.<br><br>Sly is down to earth and yes I agree he totally screwed the Bon Jovi song and he totally screwed up big time for the Aerosmith song. Though the rest of Singapore doesn't think so. I agree totally with Ken as well that he looks more rock then he sounds. The thing about Sly on why he appeals to lots of Singaporeans is because he is very down-to-earth and he takes critisms positively. I dunno why he looks more chinese rock star material then one who belts out english rock pieces. He needs to improve on his pronounciation as well. I like Sly as a person but I won't vote for him as an idol because to me, he just don't have what he takes.<br><br>Daphne is sweet but she don't appeal to me. Maybe she is young but I think she is lacking in the X-factor.<br><br>Christopher....well, I dunno why but I can't stand his looks. Seems to me that he is trying very hard to act cool and suave. He should just stick to songs that will not strain his vocals.<br><br>Olinda and Taufick are very consistent and improving, though I think Taufick can be very forgettable on performance. I dunno why but his performance just leaves no impression on me.  Nothing to do on his voice though.<br><br>Leandra has the vocals and her style but she needs to be more consistent.<br><br>Anyway, kinda sad that Maia is out.
