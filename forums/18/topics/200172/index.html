            <div class='col-md body'>The Electric New Paper :<br>S'PORE WOMAN MARRIES 5 MEN IN 6 YEARS<br>Hubbies get $10,000 each as dowry<br>Her marriages last less than a year. Religious scholars say...<br>MEN heading off to Indonesia or Thailand to marry in secret have made the news often.<br>By Faith Teo<br>14 July 2006<br><br>MEN heading off to Indonesia or Thailand to marry in secret have made the news often.<br><br>But now, a woman is doing just that.<br><br>Mona (not her real name) has had five 'husbands' in six years and she's thinking of taking a sixth.<br><br>Her marriages last less than a year.<br><br>Mona, 50, has three children and three grandchildren.<br><br>She uses a practice called 'kahwin misyar' to legitimise her marriages, reported Berita Minggu.<br><br>Technically, it's a legal form of marriage that involves conjugal rights but no other obligations.<br><br>In other words, both parties are not obliged to perform duties that a normal married couple might, such as providing financial support.<br><br>The Singapore Islamic Scholars and Religious Teachers Association (Pergas) told The New Paper that marriages like Mona's are 'an abuse of the Islamic religious rulings'. (See report on facing page.)<br><br>SHE APPROACHERS MEN<br><br>Abuse or not, Mona says this type of marriage suits her fine. She doesn't want to be saddled with obligations.<br><br>After divorcing her first husband six years ago after several years of marriage, she made a trip to Batam, where she met a 38-year-old imam (someone who leads prayers in a mosque).<br><br>He told her about his version of the concept of kahwin misyar, and eventually became the first of her next five husbands.<br><br>She divorced the imam after eight months.<br><br>She claimed that four of the men she married are Indonesian, while one is a Singaporean whom she married in Thailand.<br><br>The youngest, at 23, was less than half her age and the oldest, 43, is her current local husband.<br><br>The beauty salon owner said she travels to Batam often on business trips.<br><br>She also said she was the one who approached the men, some of whom already had wives or girlfriends.<br><br>Mona claimed that she has other women friends who are doing just what she does.<br><br>Each time, she would go through the local conventional legal marriage with the man, with dowry, witnesses and a wali (a senior male relative such as a father or uncle) to give her away.<br><br>Four of her marriages were solemnised in Indonesia.<br><br>The men continued to live in their own countries after the weddings, with Mona visiting often.<br><br>She married her latest husband, a Singaporean, in Golok, Thailand, late last year.<br><br>But the marriages have not lasted. Even the latest looks shaky, with Mona complaining that the man is becoming more 'distant'.<br><br>'Each of my marriages lasted only between six months and a year, because I realised we were not compatible,' she told Berita Minggu during a recent interview.<br><br>LEAVES HUSBANDS WELL-OFF<br><br>But by the time she divorces them, the men would have been comfortably set for life, she claimed.<br><br>She claimed each of the men got $10,000 in cash when they married her, together with a dowry of prayer beads.<br><br>In addition, two of her Indonesian ex-husbands now own terrace houses, each costing Mona $25,000.<br><br>She said she also financed a new business for the imam and bought a car for another husband so that he could run it as a taxi to make a living.<br><br>Her current husband, an already-married Singaporean working as an entertainer in Bangkok, supposedly receives $300 a week as pocket money.<br><br>She pays for the maintenance of his car and motorcycle.<br><br>Whenever any of them fall short of money, all they need to do is ask her.<br><br>'If I have the money, what is wrong in helping them financially?' she asked.<br><br>'I want every man that I marry to look good and live well. If they are sad, I don't feel good. I have never regretted anything.'<br><br>In return, she gets the attention she craves. Even from the husbands she has since divorced.<br><br>When she 'misses' one of them, she sends him an SMS. He then replies to say if he can meet up with her.<br><br>If he can, she travels to meet him.<br><br>'I feel so appreciated and loved. When I visit, the man will come to meet me enthusiastically. He keeps me company when I go shopping, dining or just walking around.<br><br>'But the most important thing is that we can be together. It's very enjoyable and satisfying.'<br><br>TEMPORARY MARRIAGES<br><br>The concept of entering into a temporary marriage to appease the guilt caused by religious or social rules is not new.<br><br>In 2000, The New York Times published a story on Iranian temporary marriages, called 'Sigheh'.<br><br>In a country where even holding hands is disallowed, couples had been using Sigheh, lasting from a few minutes to years, to sidestep the rules.<br><br>The concept, taking advantage of certain lines from old Islamic scripture, allowed couples to have sanctioned sex.<br><br>In 2003, we reported a trend in the Middle East where rich Arab men entered into temporary marriages with women from Kerala, India, in order to have guilt-free sex with them.<br><br>Just two weeks ago, it was reported that Arab men have been paying to enter into temporary marriages with local Indonesian women, then divorcing them hours or days later.<br><br>The most popular destination for these Arabs is reportedly Puncak, near Jakarta.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2005 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
