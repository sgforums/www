U guys make a clip together. After a few months of lovey dovey, u guys fall apart and break up. Then he decides to blackmail you despite the risks of getting caught. Eventually he is caught, but you still suffer the shame of exposure.<br><br>Bad, right?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scene 2:</span><br><br>You refuse his request, which turns out to be a demand, then metamorphoses into a requirement for a placing in your relationship. After a heated exchange, you break up.<br><br>Sad, but there's other fish in the sea, right?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scene 3:</span><br>You refuse to do the clip, he says alright, it's ok. And you carry on your unmeaningful lives as per normal.<br><br>Damn <strong>boring</strong> siah~<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scene 4:</span><br><br>You accept his request, he makes the video, he sends copies of it to his friends at work and all, you get shamed, and he still says he loves you. That jerk.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Whaddya do when that happens?</span><br><br>Here's some advice.<br><br><strong>Your life is yours to live. Nothing in this world is actually ours, except our thoughts, emotions, and decisions.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When something bad happens, don't look for someone to blame.
