            <div class='col-md body'>#1<br>Depends on whose perspective it is you are talking about when you said you are "handsome" and not egoistic and all the good qualities you've been selling about yourself. I reserve my comments.<br><br>#2<br>Depends on the targetted demographic of women you want to get laid with. Obviously young chick ain't gonna find an old uncle interesting cause of the age gap unless they are interested in your inheritance. And from what I know, old men likes young brainless chicks just to play with. Ain't it?<br><br>#3<br>Older, matured people have baggages like no one else. They have also developed a system of living that is quite exclusive and selfish which they themselves do not know. When they have baggage, its comparible to the amount that paris hilton goes on a day trip.<br><br>#4<br>Have you noticed that you are not much of a conversationalist? Topics revolved about you and you only and its singing your qualities over and over and frankly quite "sour grapes".  Some ladies can smell out a jerk and word to get around what kind of a jerk is running about. Mindless young studs might break the ladies heart but its not a guarantee, fact is some are very nice people and faithful too. And at least young men are fun to be around and do not use wealth to weigh others down. You seem to assume that wealth will get you friends and chicks.<br><br>This is my observation and point of view from my observations about your chitchat.  I suppose people have been kind to entertain you and patronise you.<br>Anyways, I'm sure you must be insulted by now. I really don't fuk care.<br>Enjoy whatever your casino makes you. At least you have money.<br>You can't have the best of all worlds, at least enjoy one.<br></div>
