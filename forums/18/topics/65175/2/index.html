If Legolas were to be firing from a modern weapon (say a sniper rifle), i can assure u that he will be even better!<br><br>To be an archer, you need to know (throught gifted or experience) how to judge the distance between yourself and your target, resistance against the arrows from any possible strong winds. Just like artillery, arrows travels not in a straight line but in an arch like a projectile. Raise your aim higher above the target and it will shoot further. Raise it too high or too low and it may land nearer than you think it will go. That is the reason why it is easier to train up a battalion of crossbowmen than archers.<br><br>just wan to share some of my knowledge here.<br>anyway, i like Legolas - he's cool, very cool.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Whatever little we saw was at Orthanc, when he and Gandalf fought each other, and Aragorn said they only needed to be wary of his words.  Gandalf - the little fireworks at the Shire for the kids, defending himself before Aragorn's sword, Gimli's axe and Legolas' arrow when he first appeared as White Wizard at Fangorn forest, transforming himself then Theoden King at Rohan - hardly the stuffs used to fight Orcs.  Guess there's a more realistic limit to what powers a wizard possess, instead of flying around on broomsticks, et al.  Wisdom is probably the greatest prowess they have.<br><br>I think we should not mistake a servant's affection for his master as being gay.  Remember, they come from the Shire, hitherto untouched by evil and cynicism of the world we live in today, so they obviously speak differently.</div>
