            <div class='col-md body'>You think induced miscarriage is like 'pop' the baby goes into the toilet bowl and you flush it the end? Any form of incomplete pregnancy is damaging to the fertility to a woman, sometimes permanently. It's a very immature line of thought, you probably aren't much older than 16 yourself. Have you even considered the emotional consequences of abandoning one's baby especially in such an undignified manner? Escaping from religious hounding is the attitude you share with them, so it really speaks alot about your own integrity as well. Truth be told, even if i do know how to remedy the situation i'd f@#king shut it cos with your kind of maturity and your attitude, you don't deserve jack help from any of us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think she meant "self-induced" miscarriage compared to formal abortion.<br><br>I think she is thinking along the lines of making-herself-trip-and-fall-and-hope- there-is-a-miscarriage or worst getting someone to use a baseball bat and bash her tummy in (being too extreme here, but you get my drift).<br><br>Well in my humble opinion (as other ppl here in the forum too), your friend should bite the bullet and just face the facts and have the baby.<br><br>As they say, having a baby is a blessing.  Think of all the other couples who are struggling to get a baby conceived.  If your friend aborts the preg now, just imagine what her future kids (if she is ever planning to have any) would think of their unborn bro/sis who didn't have a chance to come into this world and have a life but instead was "murdered" by his/her mum!</div>
