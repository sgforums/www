            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hi small_girl,<br><br>An "induced" misscarriage is not a good solution, or whatever 'quick fix' solution. There are repercussions to such 'quick fixes', such as health issues that might not be apparent now. Also, an induced miscarriage might lead your friend to be hospitalized, therefore exposing the whole situation to her parents. Right now, you might want to sit down with your friend and consider what options that are available to her. For example, telling her parents are an option. If her folks are also catholics, they might be more understanding than what she expects them to be. Who knows, the whole incident might pull the whole family in support of her. Another way is to seek tempoary shelter, have the baby, then decide for herself what she wants to do with her life. There was an article in the newspaper some time back that showcased one of these shelters. If not, you can always google it for her. Extreme measures might seem the only way out at the current moment, but take some time to think it over when emotions are settled, you might find that there are more options available than you think. Lastly, let her know that she should not be making a decision that she might regret a few years down the road.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
