And that was about how long it took for their marriage to be over.<br><br>Blow One: John (we are not using their real names to avoid embarrassment) did not know it when he got married, but his wife was a sex worker in Indonesia.<br><br>He found out only after his wife, Amy, left their condominium and returned to Indonesia in June.<br><br>It was the first of three devastating blows.<br><br>Blow Two: She was offering her sexual services on a website.<br><br>Blow Three: She infected him with a sexually-transmitted disease - twice - and put him in fear of contracting HIV.<br><br>When John, who is in his 30s, discovered that she was a sex worker, he had already contracted gonorrhoea - a sexually-transmitted disease (STD) - on two separate occasions.<br><br>Last month, the Family Court granted John's application for the marriage to be annulled, based on the grounds that Amy was suffering from a STD at the time of their marriage.<br><br>Such annulments are extremely rare. This is the first reported case of its kind.<br><br>Figures from the Department of Statistics showed that of the 268 annulments last year, about 99 per cent were granted on the grounds of non-consummation.<br><br>COULD NOT BE TRACKED<br><br>John's lawyer, Mr S Balamurugan, said Amy could not be tracked down for legal papers to be served to her.<br><br>He applied successfully to the court to let the case proceed without her.<br><br>Speaking to The New Paper, John recounted the short-lived relationship that had taken many twists and turns.<br><br>For him, it had ended in fear - that he could have contracted HIV.<br><br>In January this year, he met Amy, who is in her early 20s, through a mutual friend.<br><br>Said John, who works in logistics: 'She was very loving and she gave me a sense of belonging. I fell in love with her after we went out for a few times.<br><br>'She seemed to be very serious about the relationship and we decided to get married.'<br><br>John often travelled to Batam on business. He would contact Amy on her handphone.<br><br>Amy, who is slim and has long hair, told him she was from Palembang and had been a waitress in Batam for six months.<br><br>In March, they registered their marriage here in the presence of John's family and a few close friends. He said no-one from Amy's family turned up. They consummated their marriage but, two weeks later, John noticed a discharge from his penis. He visited his family doctor and was told that he had gonorrhoea.<br><br>'I was taken aback because I had been faithful to her since I met her,' said John.<br><br>'When I asked her, she denied that she had STD. Besides, she looked fine.'<br><br>John decided to let the matter rest. He was prescribed antibiotics and recovered after a few days. He also refrained from having sex with Amy for a while.<br><br>Dr Lee Wei Hong, a gynaecologist, said gonorrhoea is very unlikely to be transmitted through mere physical contact or the exchange of other bodily fluids.<br><br>'There has to be sexual contact before the bacteria can be passed on,' said Dr Lee.<br><br>In his affidavit to the court, John stated that Amy was a social visit pass-holder and would stay with him in Singapore for no more than two weeks at a time.<br><br>'Whenever she was here, she would also ask me for money to send back to her parents in Indonesia,' said John.<br><br>'She'd also throw tantrums for no reason and go back to Batam.'<br><br>Then, in late April, John began having the same symptoms he had during his first bout of STD. The doctor confirmed he had contracted the disease again.<br><br>Amy was back in Batam at that time.<br><br>When she returned in June, John confronted her and they had a big quarrel. Amy then left in a huff.<br><br>That was the last time he saw her. She also changed her handphone number and he was unable to contact her.<br><br>He asked his friends to help him find her. They asked around Batam and found out about a website which showed Amy's photos.<br><br>'She was featured with a few other women and the website also stated that they were good in providing 'sensual erotic services',' said John.<br><br>With a heavy heart, he called the number listed on the website and spoke to the person in charge, who confirmed that one of the women was indeed Amy.<br><br>But she became unhelpful when he asked to speak to Amy, according to court papers.<br><br>FREQUENTS NIGHTCLUBS<br><br>A check showed the website no longer exists.<br><br>John said his friends also found out that Amy had been in Batam for two years and would go to nightclubs frequently. She also smoked and drank.<br><br>'I was shocked and stunned as I was ignorant of her ways and her reasons for going to Batam frequently,' said John.<br><br>'She had painted a completely different picture of herself. I'm also angry with her for infecting me with STD.'<br><br>John, who is not in a relationship now, said he felt betrayed.<br><br>'Never did I ever imagine that my marriage would end this way.'<br><br>About three weeks ago, John went for an HIV test.<br><br>'My friends told me that I could get the results instantly so I decided not to put it off,' said John.<br><br>'Thank God I was negative. I'm so relieved. Now, I just want to put everything behind me.'<br><br>If Amy came back to him and apologised, would he forgive her?<br><br>'If she could lie to me about all these things, I don't know what else she could do next,' said John.<br><br>'For me, it was all over months ago, when I found out the truth.'<br><br>When a marriage is void...<br><br>OF the 6,561 marriages which broke up last year, only 4 per cent were annulled.<br><br>The remaining 6,293 were divorce cases, according to figures from the Department of Statistics (DOS).<br><br>There were 268 annulments last year, down from 287 in 2002. About 99 per cent such cases were granted on the grounds of non-consummation in both years.<br><br>Last year, there were only 4 annulments that were not due to non-consummation. DOS was unable to provide more information on these cases.<br><br>You And The Law, a book published by the Singapore Association of Women Lawyers, says there can be void as well as voidable marriages.<br><br>A marriage is void - considered not to have taken place - when:<br># Either party is under 18 years of age and married without special consent<br># The parties are closely related and married without special consent<br># A marriage has taken place overseas, but not followed the law there<br># Either party is already married<br># There's no valid marriage licence.<br># The parties are of the same sex.<br><br># In voidable marriages, the marriage is legal but can be annulled for special reasons. This happens when:The marriage cannot be consummated because of impotence<br># One party refuses, without good reason, to consummate the marriage<br># Either party is of unsound mind or didn't agree to the marriage of their own free will<br># Either party had a sex disease at the time of marriage<br># The woman was pregnant with another man's child at the time of marriage.<br><br>Divorced wife after he finds out she had Aids virus<br><br>LAST year, a man applied to divorce his wife after he found out she was HIV positive.<br><br>The Singaporean man, 41, had married the woman, 25, an Indonesian, despite knowing that she was working as a prostitute in Batam.<br><br>He had been her client before he married her in November 2000.<br><br>Five months later, he found out she was HIV positive when she had a medical checkup as part of her application for a long-term pass to stay in Singapore.<br><br>He did not contract the virus from her but applied to divorce her on the grounds that there was 'no likelihood of reconciliation' between them.<br><br>It is not known if the divorce went through.</div>
