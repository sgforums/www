What are sexually transmitted infections?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), also known as sexually-transmitted diseases (STD) or venereal diseases (VD), are infections that can be transmitted through sexual intercourse. Bacteria, viruses, fungi or protozoa can cause<br>these infections.<br><br>2. What are the different types of STI? What are the agents causing these STIs?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>The STIs caused by bacteria include<br>Syphilis - Treponema pallidum<br><br>Gonorrhoea - Neisseria gonorrhoeae<br><br>Non-gonococcal urethritis -<br>Chlamydia trachomatis<br><br>Ureaplasma urealyticum<br><br>Mycoplasma genitalium<br>Chancroid - Haemophilus ducreyi<br><br>Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) - Chlamydia trachomatis<br><br>Granuloma inguinale - Calymmatobacteria granulomatis<br><br>The STIs caused by viruses include:<br>Genital herpes - herpes simplex virus type 1 &amp; 2<br><br>Genital warts - human papilloma virus<br><br>Viral Hepatitis - hepatitis A, B and C viruses<br><br>AIDS/HIV infection - human immunodeficiency virus type 1 &amp; 2<br><br>Molluscum contagiosum - molluscum contagiosum virus<br><br>The STIs caused by fungi include:<br>Vaginal candidiasis - candida albicans<br><br>The STIs caused by protozoa include:<br>Trichomoniasis - trichomonas vaginalis<br><br>The STIs caused by parasites include:<br>Scabies - sarcoptes scabiei<br><br>Pubic lice infestation - pediculosis pubic<br><br>3. What are the common types of STI?<br><br>The common STIs are:<br>Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU)<br>Syphilis<br>Chlamydia infections<br>Gonorrhoea<br>Genital herpes<br>Genital warts<br>AIDS/HIV infection<br><br>4. How are STIs transmitted?<br>STIs are transmitted through sexual intercourse or close body contact with another person who is infected with an STI. Transmission of some STIs e.g. NGU, HIV, Hepatitis B and gonorrhoea occurs when there is transfer of body fluids (e.g. semen from the male genital tract or vaginal and cervical secretions from the female genital tract) from an infected person to the sex partner. Transmission of other STIs, e.g. scabies, pubic lice, syphilis, herpes and warts occurs when there is intimate skin-to-skin contact. Some STIs e.g. syphilis, hepatitis B and HIV may be transmitted from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy or delivery. These infections may also be transmitted through sharing of injection needles or through contaminated blood transfusions.<br><br>5. Are STIs transmitted through sharing of food, utensils, toilet seats or through handshakes?<br>No. STIs cannot be transmitted through sharing of food or eating utensils, shaking hands, through toilet seats or swimming pools. The organisms causing STIs usually cannot survive outside the human body.<br><br>6. Can STIs be contracted through kissing?<br>Dry kissing is generally safe. Some STIs can be transmitted through deep, wet kissing. Syphilis, gonorrhoea, chamydial infection, and herpes may be present in the mouth/throat of infected persons. However, STIs are not commonly transmitted through kissing.<br><br>7. Can a person be infected with more than one STI?<br>Yes this is possible and not uncommon. This is why it is always important to be tested for other STIs if you have been diagnosed as suffering from any one STI.<br><br>8. Can someone inherit an STI from his or her parents, i.e. is it genetic disease?<br>STIs are acquired diseases; they are not inherited. However, mothers with some STIs can pass on the infection to their baby during pregnancy, during delivery or breastfeeding. Early treatment of an infected pregnant mother can prevent infection in her baby.<br><br>9. What are the common symptoms and signs of STIs?<br>STIs may present in a number of ways. The commonest symptoms of STI are:<br>Genital discharge (from the urethra or the vagina)<br><br>Dysuria (pain on passing urine)<br><br>Genital sores or ulcers (these may be painful or painless)<br><br>Blisters on genitals<br><br>Growths on genitals<br><br>Swelling of lymph glands (in the groin)<br><br>Rash on genitals and other parts of the body<br><br>Sometimes an infection can present in the absence of any symptoms or signs -<br>This is called an asymptomatic infection<br><br>10. Do these symptoms and signs occur only in STIs?<br>Not necessarily. Rashes and growths on genitals may be signs of conditions that are not sexually-transmitted. Similarly not all discharges and dysuria are due to STIs. You should consult your doctor if you develop these symptoms and signs.<br><br>11. How long does it take for the symptoms and signs of STIs to appear after infection?<br>The incubation period is the period of time from infection to the appearance of symptoms and signs; it can vary according to the type of STI. Some infections such as gonorrhoea, non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) and genital herpes have short incubation periods, ranging from 2 days to 3 weeks. The incubation period of other STIs such as syphilis may range from 2 weeks to many months, and that for HIV infections may be several years.<br><br>12. What must you do if you suspect that you have contracted a STI?<br>See a doctor immediately. Avoid sex as you may pass on an infection. Do not self-medicate.<br><br>13. How soon should you see a doctor after having sex with a stranger?<br>You should see a doctor as soon as you notice any of the symptoms and signs of STI. If none of the symptoms or signs occurs, blood tests for syphilis and HIV should be carried out after about 4 weeks. Your doctor should be able to provide further advice or order other tests. Do refrain from unprotected sexual intercourse until the doctor has given you the all clear. Do not self-medicate as this is usually ineffective and may lead to complications.<br><br>14. What will happen to the symptoms and signs of various STIs if you do not seek treatment?<br>In some cases, the symptoms and signs of the STI may disappear even without treatment. This however does not mean that the infection is cured. Even if you do not have any symptoms or signs, the infection may still be present and may spread to the other parts of the body. The organisms may begin to invade the internal organs and cause irreversible damage.<br><br>15. Can a person with STI not have any symptoms or signs?<br>Certainly. All STIs are symptomless during the incubation period. More than 10% of males, more than half of females with gonorrhoea and chlamydia trachomatis infection do not show any symptoms or signs. Asymptomatic STIs are also more common in individuals who are incorrectly treated i.e. who have self-medicated with antibiotics or those who did not follow prescribed antibiotic treatment. Individuals with an asymptomatic STI can still transmit the infection to their sexual partners.<br><br>16. Are all STIs curable? Why do I need to seek early treatment for STIs?<br>Bacterial STIs are curable if treated early. Early treatment of an STI prevents transmission to others and also prevents complications. Most viral STIs however are not curable.<br><br>17. Can all STIs be diagnosed or confirmed by blood tests?<br>Blood tests are useful only for a few STIs. These include syphilis, hepatitis B infection and AIDS/HIV infection.<br>For the other STIs, examination of specimens from the discharge and samples from the skin and mucous membranes are used to confirm diagnosis.<br><br>18. How are STIs treated?<br>Different STIs are treated differently. Those caused by bacteria are treated with antibiotics; those caused by viruses with antiviral drugs; and those caused by parasites with antiparasitic drugs. There is no single medication that can treat and cure all STIs. It is therefore important to identify the type(s) of STI before treatment.<br><br>19. Can a person take antibiotics before sex to prevent STI?<br><br>No. Oral antibiotics before sex or after sex are not useful. Different STIs require different antimicrobial medications. Antimicrobials taken before sex as a preventive measure may actually mask the symptoms and signs of infection in an infected person, he or she is still carrying the infection. Preventive antimicrobials will also promote the development of resistant organisms. STIs caused by resistant organisms are more difficult to cure. The only recommended prophylaxis against STI before sex is a condom.<br><br>20. Can a person be immunized against STIs? Does a person develop immunity to a STI once he is cured of the infection?<br>With the exception of hepatitis B infection, no vaccines are currently available for use to prevent STI. And with the exception of hepatitis B infection, a person can be infected repeatedly despite having been cured of an STI.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
