            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Two Types Of Orgasm</strong><br><br>It is now known women can experience two kinds of orgasm. But they are not clitoral vs. vaginal as some have reported.<br><br>1.The most common (some times called clitoral) also involves the vagina since the clitoral stimulation also produces contractions of the pubococcygeal (PC) muscle supporting the pelvic floor which is where "vaginal" contractions are felt.<br><br>2. G-spot and Uterine. G-spot stimulation results in orgasmic contractions around the uterus, which is several inches above the pelvic floor.<br><br>Later research has shown that women who can orgasm both ways have even deeper, more powerful blended orgasm, resulting from contractions in both areas at once.<br><br>One women described the difference this way: " I have two DISTINCTLY different types of orgasm. The G-Spot orgasm tends to result in my vaginal walls contracting and fluid being expelled. The clitoral orgasm can either have fluid expelled or be "dry" but both result in my uterus contracting, not my vaginal walls. And both types can either be whole body or localized. I state all this because it seems as if some posters are implying there is only one kind of orgasm and that it always involves uterine contractions and I'm here to tell you that that is not always true. So good luck in experiencing ALL the kinds of orgasms there are for women<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Techniques For Stimulating G-Spot</strong><br><br>Lie back with your knees pressed up to your chest. In this position, your vaginal depth will shorten and even small fingers should be able to reach the G-spot. With a partner, lie on your side with one leg drawn up to your chest as your partner enters you from the rear. He should be able to hit the spot.<br><br>The G-spot responds to pressure rather than to touch. Gently stroking is not likely to get any results. It's more like massaging a pea under a mattress - one has to compress the flesh to find it.<br><br>Insert fingers and bend them gently up, around and behind the pubic bone. Beyond the rather rough-surfaced tissue immediately behind her pubic bone, your fingertips will encounter a very soft, smooth area. Go very slowly and let her tell you what she feels as you explore the smooth area, which will feel to you like the inside of a very slippery mitten. When you straighten your fingers and reach further inside, you'll encounter a hard, rubbery structure that feels like an erect nipple pointing south. This is her cervix. The G-spot is somewhere just his side of the cervix, about an inch beyond the mitten, in the flesh immediately in front of the vagina.<br><br>Imagine you're holding a tennis ball on those two of three inserted fingers. An area about the size of a grape in the center of the tennis ball is what you're trying to reach. It can be anywhere along that two-or-three inch long area between the pubic bone and the cervix. Explore slowly, allowing for feedback front he woman - let her guide your fingers with her words if she can feel the stimulation. The G-spot responds to pressure rather than to touch. Gentle stroking is not likely to find it. It's more like massaging a pea under a mattress - one has to compress the flesh to find it.<br><br>When you reach in from the front with the woman on her back, the heel of your hand is over her clitoris while your fingers hook around her pubic bone. Pull upwards, as if you're trying to lift her off the bed. Do this with the same sort of rhythm you'd use fooking, and keep your fingers hooked, so they press deep into the tissue. Once you know where it is you can try using your penis on it, but for good G-spot orgasm, she may prefer your hand. In face-to-face intercourse, the penis may not stimulate the spot enough to do any good, although some positions, such as the one where the women draws her knees close to her chest, may increase the changes for a G-spot orgasm.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DO YOU KNOW THAT.....male have G-Spot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>The Male G-Spot:</strong><br><br>Also knows as the prostate gland, is located near the root of the penis just below the bladder. It's purpose is to produce a thick liquid that makes up most of the semen. For most men its about the size of a walnut. The easiest way to reach it is to insert a finger or a toy. Now, some people may have issues with this or are nervous to try it so you can take these simple steps to help make it a little easier for you.<br><br>The first thing you can do is bathe. I'm sure the most common reasons people don't like to insert anything into their ass is because they think its dirty. It's really not just so long as your hygiene is ok.<br><br>Before you insert anything in your ass make sure you use A LOT of lubricant.<br><br>After you've bathed and lubed up you can now begin penetration. Spread your legs, and slowly move a finger inside your anus. Once its inside, press the finger firmly against the wall of the anus towards the stomach. Curl your finger and make a "come hither" motion. It may take a little bit to find the exact location because its in a different place for everyone.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
