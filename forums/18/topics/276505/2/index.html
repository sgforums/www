            <div class='col-md body'>its not as "glamorous" loh, looking between woman's legs is one thing, you cannot choose just to see chio bu, old woman, fat, young, rotten ones, smelly ones, ugly ones all have to see and smell.<br><br>And the way they go about it have to be very professional, there will always be a nurse present, you don't see the woman strip / take off (forget what you see in AV regarding doctor's examination)<br><br>typically, the nurse will help the patient prepare, the doctor will arrive after the patient is on the bed, parts that are not "in use" are covered, you only see the organ - how shiok can that be.  Don't forget, you have to smell and during the whole time, you have to maintain your professionalism, because the nurse is there.<br><br>And for many gynaes, examination is only one small portion, he have to diagnose, he have to aid in delivery, handle complications, see blood, etc.  And you want to maintain professionalism because its easy for patient to cry molest if you are not careful.<br><br>Its not easy and I think you wont get hard on after seeing that day in day out loh....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alamak, don't take it as if there are always beautiful sight to see.  There is also this thing call job hazard, which comes with it.  Imagine checking someone who is unintentionally infacted with HIV and the doc working on it only to discover it later?  This cases are rising though the no. is small.<br><br>Several yrs ago, I heard from this radio program while studying in UK about this professional who operates  on women.  As usual, he was ask the same old question of seeing female's organ and his reply was fun and interesting initially.  However, all soon forgtten as the investigation, checking prgress, PROFESSIONAL mah.  However, he was also asked the next serious question about his sex life and his wife with regard to what he does...<br><br>His reply was, sometimes he simply get sick of making love to his wife and not want anything to do with love making.  His job has become a hazard to his daily life.  He also mentioned that, more often when he sees his wife's part... he get turn off and become very professional and then it kills everything.. He has to seek professional help, like visiting pyschiatist to help him get on with his life.... not sure how many are like that here.  imagine seeing such thing for so many years, he was in his 50s...</div>
