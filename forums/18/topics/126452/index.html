            <div class='col-md body'>tot u mentioned in another topic that he's a married guy or taken?? so are u a third party in this or wat??<br><br>no offence...<br>but if u are a third party, u are asking for it... dun expect love in return... u know he's not urs in the first place, so y should u expect it??<br><br>if u both is juz a normal dating couple, i apologise for my misunderstanding on this....Sometimes we must get hurt in order to grow, we must fail in order to know...sometimes our vision clears only after our eyes are washed away with tears....<br><br>juz an advice, there are some things in life that don't go the way you want them to or the way you think they should, but you can't dwell on these because you'll miss out on other opportunites.... Don't give up one something just because you don't think things will work, you won't know unless you give it a try.... But don't hold onto something that left a long time ago, because sooner or later you'll realize some things just aren't meant to be....<br><br>Change is not bad as long as both people are willing to change together to make things better; it's when one person demands all the changes and refuses to make any of the other person's requests that change is destructive....Some things are not meant to last, they just take a place in your heart and make you smarter the next time ....<br><br>In your darkest hour, never worry that there is no hope for the future. The most extraordinary thing about this life is that YOU are the author of your own destiny, and you get to decide what's in the next chapter....</div>
