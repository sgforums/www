            <div class='col-md body'>Female sales rep have advantage in some way. Even if they are not sexy, even they just look OK, they have the advantage. For those who know how to do the tricks like wear low cut, talk sweet(or even bitchy), body contact, etc will be even better.<br><br>imagine u are on the street and a very chio gal come and ask you directions, most likely i would take the trouble to tell her how, or even bring her there if not too far/same direction i am going. But if a guy come, i would also tell, but not as detailed, and sure wont bring him there. Tat's the different. Guys, what about u?<br><br>back to the main topic, sexual advance at work, it's very common anywhere. In China, some ppl are suggesting to raise a law against it but not officially approved yet. Cos in china, taking money as bribe is very common for govt officers, business man, etc. And now girls offering sex as bribe is getting more common. They use it to get business deal, climb in job position, etc. Since using money to bribe others is illegal, then how about using sex offer to bribe??<br><br>search google for the chinese word "xinghuilu"(sex bribe) will find some news articles on this issue.</div>
