              <p>Like i said before. We are only humans. And humans are not made
              to perfection. At times, our mind can stray and drift.</p>
              <p>It is always easy to say what a perfect boyfriend should be
              like. We think he should be like this, we think he should act like
              this... I think that actions can be done to show how much we care
              for others.The thing is we are talking about the mind now. Can the
              perfect boyfriend mentioned by mancha ever exist?? A guy with
              completely zero lust or even thoughts about lust. It is easier
              said. But I still  do agree at some point in mancha's
              statement that faith is important in a relationship.</p>

You love her for exactly who she is, sex included, that's why you're able to be with her for so long. And that alone deserves a standing ovation. These days, 10 years is really really something. just continue loving her for who she is, and those thoughts of wanting another girl will naturally fade away.Even if they don't, they won't bother you till this extent.I dont know if you as a 25year old would understand the words of a 21 year old.Haha...</p></div>

              <p>10 yrs in a relationship is not easy. I feel that i can understand u as my Ex was also like u. We had been 2gether for almost 8yrs. It is pretty normal for guys to think like u......</p>
              <p>We discussed this topic out of the blue and came to conclusions:</p>
              <p>1) He can do any monkey business behind my back since we are not married, since i dun know that it's fine. But if i found out, means sayonara........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) I was his 1st, same as he was mine, we can play open and bo chap till the day we get marry, we have to be faithful.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Or we break off once one of us have this thought, as that means our relationship has cracks......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody can define what is right or wrong in a relationship. Should a 3rd party exists, that means both of us did not cultivate our relationship properly. So the above for u to ponder....</p>
