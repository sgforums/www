I think in a way, i was trying to convince myself that wat i was thinking about was quite normal for a guy. That thought is absolutely selfish and naive. I agree with you guys.

              <p>                    Glad that you have a mature mindset  when it comes to such a topic. Humans are imperfect. I only wanted to discuss this problem maturely and with a progressive and positive approach in mind.Though i may have not been a perfect boyfriend for my girlfriend in my thinking, but i can honestly say i have not done anything such as flirting, one night stand cheating or even hiring prostitutes in my life. There are lots of guys out there that cheats on their girlfriends frequently and still thinks narrow-mindedly thinks that it is alright.</p>

              <p>We are only but human living in this world governed by temptations, be

              temptations? I sometimes wonder whether we(male or female) are in fact
              designed by the "one" on top to occasionally crave greed or lust. Are
              we made that way? Is there not a little greed or lust in everyone of us? If it is not right to greed or lust, then why make us the way we are. And make us condemn and contradict one another on what should or should not be the way.</p>

              <p>This is not the regular con job.</p>
              <p>This is betrayal. Of trust. You hide things from her. She is going to be dissapointed in you, when she finds out what you are hiding. Because she will feel that you have no faith in her. Also there are elements of dishonesty in you. Dosen't  matter if no one knows it, because you know it. And you won't feel good about yourself.</p>
              <p>If you can't confide in her, then your relationship is just at the superficial level. You have to tread carefully. And that no way to have a permanent relationship.</p>
              <p>Cheating just does not necessary mean having sex with another woman, not having faith in your partner is cheating, especially after professing faith in your partner.</p>
              <p>Some cheating have serious consequences, some are just frown upon.</p>

              <p>Like i said before. We are only humans. And humans are not made to perfection. At times, our mind can stray and drift.</p>
              <p>It is always easy to say what a perfect boyfriend should be like. We think he should be like this, we think he should act like this... I think that actions can be done to show how much we care for others.The thing is we are talking about the mind now. Can the perfect boyfriend mentioned by mancha ever exist?? A guy with completely zero lust or even thoughts about lust. It is easier said. But I still  do agree at some point in mancha's statement that faith is important in a relationship.</p>
