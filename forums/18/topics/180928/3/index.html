            <div class='col-md body'>It takes 2 hands to clap. Both cyclists and pedestrians have to be wary of each other. Since I used to cycle, I totally understand. It isn't right for one to put the blame on another, because in the end, cyclists would still have to use the pavements. Would you rather them cycle on the roads and hold up traffic because their bikes can't go as fast?<br><br>Of course, cyclists, when cycling on the pavements have to be extremely careful of human traffic too.
