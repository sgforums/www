What if you knock them?<br><br>I once saw this MPV delilberately overtake a cyclist on the left and serve into the cyclist's path to intimidate them. I was walking by the side of the road. I shouted some vulgarities at the MPV driver and showed him the finger even though the cyclist uncle took it calmly. That driver didn't dare to come down from his Toyota.</div>

LTA should follow Netherlands, where there are plentiful roads meant just of cycling. This would encourage people to have a healthy lifestyle and reduce pollution at the same time.</div>

I think is the taxi drivers too hurry to earn $$$ so do tis bah....</div></blockquote>I more afraid of them swerving into my lane from right to left ('cos u cycle on furthest lane on left) to pick up passengers.<br><br>When u've a road bike, a pedestrian pathway is too dangerous, so you move to road; on the roads, you're definitely not as fast as cars, but there are so many lanes! Can't the cars just give way? Not as though the lane is so small that only 1 car can fit in. At least be more understanding and run on the right side (i.e. 2nd lane) of the cyclist.<br><br>We just dun wan accidents, right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh don't blame cyclists from China, India or Bangla Desh or wherever lah.<br>Long time ago before there were any of these 'foreign talents' Singapore cyclists already biking around like they owned the roads and pedestrain walkways. Trouble is LTA has been especially lenient by not requiring cyclists to register their machines. So cyclists can do whatever they want and not get caught. It's about time the government make cyclists register and pay a fee so that more bicycle  tracks can be built.</div>
