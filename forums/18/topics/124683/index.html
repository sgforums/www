            <div class='col-md body'>I read that in the true ghost stories of singapore when I was quite young. Ya, if for pregnant women ever encounter a pontianak, the creature would either try to dig out the foetus with her unusually long fingernails or if lucky enough to avert this kind of tragedy from happening, the baby will either turn out to look like the pontianak (whatever face the creature might possess) ?</div>
