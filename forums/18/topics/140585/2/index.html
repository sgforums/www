            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... i had an experience when i was studying overseas. I was working as a bartender at this classy chinese/western restaurant. I was bar manager..n i noticed her n her friends always come dinner on Wednesday n Saturday nite. Most of them married.. she was the second yuongest. 33 if i was not mistaken. I see her at the gym i go to there.. mmm.. she likes her whiskeys. Scotch with a dash of lemon. i gave her quite a few 'on the houses' we got along pretty fine.. i was not sure what to make of these things but well . SHe gives 50 to 100 bucks tip k.. even the manager ask me to tend to her table personally always, bottom line is..  i continued to see her for 4 months..  but things didnt go well , especially from her peers. I have to admit they are very good conversationalists... she rich... i jsut feel inferior. Coz the 350Z she driving makes my car look hella bad.. damnit..she got 3 car somemore.
