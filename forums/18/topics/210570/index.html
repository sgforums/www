Afraid kids and husbands will start to peep into the flat? Anyway, unless only people who have nothing better to do will start to oversee someone's flat from opposite.<br><br>At times I do wear only my undergarment, walked around the house when I am not able to decide what to wear yet. I remove my clothes at the washing machine which faces the kitchen windows before I enter the bathroom sometimes.<br><br>Haiz.... men exposed, women complained. Women exposed, women also complained... if those women goes to US or Australia to see people exposed, sunbathing in the beach naked, those women also pass negative comments on them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Every morning not one, not two, but three women have been strutting around topless in an HDB flat.<br><br>Their antics have upset some of their neighbours in a block at York Hill, off Chin Swee Road.<br><br>A Shin Min Daily News reader said the women looked like they are in their 20s.<br><br>Two are slim, while the third is well-built.<br><br>They are believed to be foreigners.<br><br>The female resident, living in the opposite block, said she was shocked at what she saw when she looked out of her window one morning.<br><br>'Through their kitchen window, I saw one of them walking around topless,' she said.<br><br>'I just could not believe my eyes!'<br><br>A few seconds later, another two topless women joined the first woman.<br><br>'All three had nothing on and went about their activities as if it was the most natural thing to do - from chatting to brushing their hair in front of the mirror, and brushing their teeth and so on.'<br><br>This went on for almost three hours.<br><br>The reader said she was not certain if the women were totally naked.<br><br>'But how can anyone do something like that?'<br><br>ROUTINE<br><br>Since that first incident, walking around the flat topless has become a routine for the three women, said the reader.<br><br>'Often it happens on Sundays between 10am and 1pm.<br><br>'Sometimes it is one woman, sometimes two,' she said.<br><br>Acting on the tip-off, the Shin Min Daily News team staked out the unit and witnessed one woman undressing before walking around the flat.<br><br>The woman, who was wearing a bathrobe, had walked into the kitchen to put out a pair of panties to dry outside the window.<br><br>She then left the kitchen and when she returned, she was topless.<br><br>She proceeded to brush her teeth, and then raised both hands to tie her hair, all this while her breasts were in full view.<br><br>Another neighbour said the women had moved into the flat early this year.<br><br>It was believed that they had rented the unit from a male odd-job labourer.<br><br>'I am not sure what they are working as, but they usually return home at about 2am,' said the neighbour.<br><br>A third neighbour said she had once seen a male driver waiting for one of the women at the carpark.<br><br>Last night, the New Paper spoke to some residents in the block opposite the one in which the three women lived.<br><br>None of them seemed to be aware of the women's antics.[/b]</div>

So they report on these petty things.  But these reports will usually attract inconvenience.  For the normal people, they would feel restricted (as you do now).  For the people who reported, they may be cursed.  For the topless women, they may suddenly find people walking around to and fro outside, pretending to be lost and looking for places. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Making out in the car is also illegal.  But most of the time, the police just flash a light from far lah (that is, if they even come round at all).  Unless someone complains, usually its OK (and very exciting).  There was one case some years back where some car sex people reported the case of a peeping tom (a doctor with a very established medical chain here).  They went to court and both parties were fined - one for peeping, one for showing.<br><br>Eh, did you say you move around naked?  Er...where you live ah? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
