They also have penises that are 2 feet long.<br><br>Fleas are known to engage in sex immediately after feasting on a rabbitÂ’s blood specifically if the opportunity presents itself.<br><br>The 16-inch long Argentine lake duck has the longest penis of any bird - 17 inches, and some researchers speculate that they use it as a sort of lasso to keep the reluctant females from getting away.<br><br>Before mating, earthworms produce special mucus to glue themselves together.<br><br>ChimpanzeesÂ’ sex drive knows no limits and no sexual taboos. Rape, incest and promiscuity are common and some chimps even tackle bestiality, trying to copulate with other species, including unsuspecting human observers. Also, female chimpanzees have been observed masturbating with their fingers, twigs, and a water faucet.<br><br>Female baboons have been known to engage in a primitive form of prostitution by stealing food during sex.<br>If you think black widow mates have it rough, thatÂ’s nothing compared to the fly Serromyia femorata.

Sometimes the female will bite off the maleÂ’s head even before theyÂ’ve begun mating, but this too fails to slow him down, and though headless, manages to grope his way to fatherhood.<br><br>The ten-inch Banana Slugs of the Northwest end their 30-hour hermaphroditic mating session by chewing off each otherÂ’s male sex organs.<br><br>Pigs do indeed have a corkscrew-shaped penis.

He even had an ongoing sexual relationship with his daughter Lucrezia.<br><br>The renowned 18th century French actress Mlle. Dubois, made a catalog of all her lovers over a 20-year period, and the final tally proves to be a number thatÂ’d make Wilt Chamberlain blush: 16,527 individuals, which works out to about three per day - and that was just during that particular 20-year period.<br><br>The English knights during the first Crusade spent their entire campaign fund on prostitutes.<br><br>Military outposts along the expense of the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) included a Â“barracks brothel.Â” In addition to their regular duties, government prostitutes were trained as reserve soldiers in the event of an attack by the Mongolian hordes.<br><br>NapoleonÂ’s withered penis was purchased at a 1969 auction for $38,000.<br><br>Humain<br><br>Julius Caesar was known as the husband of every woman and the wife of every man.<br><br>Both Hitler and Napoleon were missing one testicle, proving once and for all that lacking such measures of masculinity is not necessarily an indicator of a manÂ’s mettle.<br><br>Pope Alexander VI; during one of his many orgies, had fifty prostitutes service the male partygoers with a prize given to the one with the most stamina.<br><br>While the stereotypical sexually-frustrated-oversexed adolescent boy begins masturbating long before his first sex act (with another party, that is), just the opposite is true of women as most actually donÂ’t start to masturbate regularly until after theyÂ’ve begun having sexual intercourse.<br><br>According to an interview with the late Timothy Leary, it was claimed that Â“in a carefully prepared, loving LSD session, a woman can have several hundred orgasms.Â”<br><br>A manÂ’s penis not only shrinks during cold weather but also from intense nonsexual excitement like when his favorite team scores a touchdown.<br><br>Today, Japan leads the world in condom use.

Michael later commented that he hoped he and his wife could remain friends.<br><br>At the height of his career, John Holmes was making $3000 a day from films and reportedly as much selling himself as a gigolo.

This intromittent organ is a special modification of the ventral wall of the cloaca and it exits in birds such as tinamous, most waterfowl, currasows and ostriches. Chicken and turkeys have a small penis, which enlarges with lymph fluid that is added to semen in the vas deferens in the reproduction system. Ejaculation of this fluid occurs through a longitudinal phallic groove. Why such different birds have evolved such an organ while others do not is not clear.<br><br>quoted: http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=1095&amp;type=6&amp;root=4&amp;parent=4&amp;cat=35<br></blockquote>anyway, the praying mantis can indeed have sex without its head. it's scientifically proven<br><br><blockquote>There is one species, however, the Mantis religiosa, in which it is necessary that the head be removed for the mating to take effect properly.
