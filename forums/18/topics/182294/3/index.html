I am sure the guys will agree that it is the secret to a happy marriage but can the women accept that?</div></blockquote>She can accept that becos her husband is RICH!!! 'The one eye dragon's wife reportedly said that as long as he came home and doted on her(give her rolex watch and many credit card) and loved her, well he had done his husbandly duties(give money to children and her to spend) and what he did outside is none of her concern.'(Money is more important than love) I think even her husband being violent to her,she can even take it for the sake of money.<br>Imagine he is penniless and go outside fooling around,her comment will be a 180 degree turn... Money make her close one-eye.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>casino_king,<br><br>I think u and the ppl u hang out with are either unreligious or do not know the meaning of Marriage!<br><br>What is the point of getting married if you still go out and "fool around"?  After one gets married or "ties the knot" there is a fine line there that married couples are not to cross.  Even though the temptation is always there.<br><br>To me your way of thinking is also selfish, what if there were kids in the marriage.  What do u think goes through their mind when they find out what their Dad or Mum do outside?  Think of the psychological damage and scarring it can cause to them.  Do you think they will understand?  Put yourself in their shoes...</div>
