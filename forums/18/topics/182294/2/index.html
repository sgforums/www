Of course if one side do it until it becomes open, then that would be bad. The understanding is that you can fool around but don't do it to that extent. As for STD, only if you don't use condom and fool around with cheap pros then maybe you get it.</div>

What I don't understand if why men often persist in failing relationships, often waiting and waiting for the other party to force a split up simply cos they don't want to be the bad person to trigger the breakdown of a marriage.<br><br>There are many reasons why marriages don't work out, and what you have described - the insecurity of women - is only one possible reason.<br><br>I think it is equally painful for women to suffer insecurity. And many men, who 'suffered' at the hands of insecurity, have their tables turned when they have relationships with independent women who are not insecure. It is a sad irony that, basically what a lot of men want is to BE the person a woman thinks about, without wanting to feel the inconvenience and pressure of being missed. Unfortunately marriage is about commitment AND an obligation to each other, whether it is about fidelity or not.<br><br>Without commitment, there neednt be a marriage n the first place, a casual relationship is good enough.</div>

What I don't understand if why men often persist in failing relationships, often waiting and waiting for the other party to force a split up simply cos they don't want to be the bad person to trigger the breakdown of a marriage.<br><br>There are many reasons why marriages don't work out, and what you have described - the insecurity of women - is only one possible reason.<br><br>I think it is equally painful for women to suffer insecurity. And many men, who 'suffered' at the hands of insecurity, have their tables turned when they have relationships with independent women who are not insecure. It is a sad irony that, basically what a lot of men want is to BE the person a woman thinks about, without wanting to feel the inconvenience and pressure of being missed. Unfortunately marriage is about commitment AND an obligation to each other, whether it is about fidelity or not.<br><br>Without commitment, there neednt be a marriage n the first place, a casual relationship is good enough. </div></blockquote>Like I said, come home and dote, love till death.<br><br>It seems that it is not enough for many and thus resulting in misery. Maybe the issue is not fidelity but security and insecurity. It would seem though that more women are insecure than men. Could be that men are known to have strong urges while women no.<br><br>Like I read somewhere, if a man had sex, he had sex with another woman.<br><br>When women had sex, she had sex with their lovers.<br><br>An average woman will not simply have sex for fun unless it is for money as a profession or with a lover. Men can have sex with anybody who offers herself up or is not too expensive. This could be where the insecurities of women stems.<br><br>An interesting note; even women who have sex as a profession is possesive of their regular customers. Something to think about.</div>
