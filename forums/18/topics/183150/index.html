You can be so wild sometimes that you may even be, well, how should I put this nicely, easy. Wild and kinky is good, but you should lean to use it in maderation. Hold out a bit when it comes to having sex with a new person. You don't have to let it all hang out! Sure, people want you, but it's probably because they know they could have you. It's ok to play hard-to-get once and a while. In fact, it makes you even sexier!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"You're kinda cute!"<br>You are 49 fuckable!<br><br>Ok, so you can attract a few people. But, don't get too cocky. I said a few! Not many people have erotic thoughts about you. Perhaps it's because you're too hard-to-get. Ya know, have high standards and live in a fantasy of everything being perfect and grand. Well, it's not that way, sweetie! Perhaps it's because you're too shy. Ya know, shy can be cute, but it can also be annoying. If you're always nervous and insecure, it's hard to see you as much else. Be bold! Be sexy!<br><br>Hahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>
