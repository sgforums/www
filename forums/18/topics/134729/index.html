            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe i selected the wrong forum but can't seem to find other suitable....<br><br>anyway, any of you here ever experience going to the doctor for some simple checkup and in the end he/she did things you never expected and in the end felt rather "violated".<br><br>what i mean is in those instances where your employer require you to go to some checkup, or you are going to some country and the embassy wants to do do the checkup.<br><br>what happened was that someone close to me (don't want to be specific as ppl in this forum knows me), is applying for a visa and the embassy wanted her to go to medical checkup, no where in the documents ever mentioned what's involved.<br><br>She thought it could be nothing much other than, blood/urine, xray and listening to the heart.<br><br>At the doctor's, she was asked about medical history and doctor asked her to lie down as he wants to check her abdomen (the one use finger to hit and listen).<br><br>what came next was unexpected as the doctor asked her to pull her shirt higher up. She thought the doctor needed to check ribcage area, but to her surprise, the doctor also asked the bra to be pulled up and he proceeded with breast exam.<br><br>what disturbed her was that, the doctor did not brief what's going to happen or nobody or no where was informing her what checks are involved.<br><br>also, the doctor did not offer if she preferred a chaperone during the check.<br><br>when she later questioned the doctor's assistant, the reply was simple, "there's no legal requirment for chaperones but patients can always ask for one".<br><br>well, she said she would be ok with it had the doctor mentioned what's gonna be involved in the subsequent moments at least she's mentally prepared, as opposed to sudden just asking her to expose herself.<br><br>she did feel violated but at the same time helpless, but since realised she's not alone anyway... thought some friends do have to sign an acknowlegdement saying that checks in private areas will be carried out.</div>
