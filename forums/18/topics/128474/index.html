            <div class='col-md body'>let the expert do the job...<br>Swinging, sometimes referred to in North America as the swinging lifestyle or simply the lifestyle (although this simplified term is also used by people into Leather and BDSM), includes a wide range of sexual activities conducted between three or more people. Swinging activities can include watching others have sex; having sex with your partner while being watched; kissing, stroking, or having oral sex with a third or fourth person (called soft swinging); or having penetrative sex with someone other than your partner (Full Swap), which is the commonly understood definition of swinging. Typically swinging activities occur when a married, or otherwise committed, couple engages with a similar couple or a single individual. These acts may or may not occur in the same room. Sex on these occasions is often referred to as play. The phenomenon (or at least its wider discussion and practice) may be seen as part of the sexual revolution of recent decades.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Psychologically normal but medically unsafe, warn experts<br>Explaining the psychology of swingers, Dr Bryan Yeo, consultant psychiatrist at the Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, said: "Swingers are neither abnormal nor mentally ill.

It can be tied to a lack of personal security. In some cases, intra-personal relationships of the subject may be affected, but not seriously," said Dr Yeo.<br>.<br>Since swingers' parties are by invitation only, the feeling of exclusivity adds to the allure. "Those who attended swinger's parties purely for sexual gratification tend to take pride in the fact that they were part of an exclusive gathering.

They treat it as their exclusive activity that distinguishes them from everyone else," he said.<br>.<br>But after the short-term thrill, swingers may feel emotionally empty, said experts.<br>.<br>"Some patients who need constant sexual gratification could loose their self-esteem in the long run if they stop engaging in promiscuous sex after getting hooked onto the habit.

Apart from Aids, people can also be infected with gonorrhoea (a condition characterised by discharge of pus from the penis after sex with an affected partner, followed by a burning sensation during urination) or syphilis, in which sores appear on the penis."<br>.<br>The use of a condom makes such practises "safer", but it does not eliminate the risk completely.<br>.<br>"I would say that the idea and habit of promiscuous sex is unhealthy," he said.<br>Explaining the psychology of swingers, Dr Bryan Yeo, consultant psychiatrist at the Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, said: "Swingers are neither abnormal nor mentally ill.
