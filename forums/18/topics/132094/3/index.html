There's a lot of good singers out there...but for one who can perform LIVE with just solo instrument..it's not easy at all. Recordings can cheat..you can adjust till it's perfect line by line until the whole song is done. But LIVE singing is different. No chance for mistakes. Once you go off key..the audience will know.<br><br>I've been to a lot of so-call very popular singers and that includes Steph Sun...to me..I love to hear her on the CD..she's not really that good with LIVE performance.  Don't be mistaken, I'm a big fan of Steph Sun..just that her power in LIVE singing isn't as good as what you hear in the CD and at times you can hear her go off key.<br><br></div>
