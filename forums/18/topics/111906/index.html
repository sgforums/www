            <div class='col-md body'>We Singaporeans are having a good time. Just need to balance between working (or studying) &amp; social life, of which both we can have a good time too. I'm having a good time everyday, and I see myself as just an average Singaporean. Just too bad you're living in a cage, so you never saw us enjoying ourselves.<br><br>Sidetrack abit.... someone once told me the best way to keep milk fresh is to keep it in the cow.<br><br>You know what's the best thing to do? Since you think life is short, go to mommy, ask her very nicely "Mom... can I go back in?" I think you'll be safer there. Curl up... nice and warm... very comfy. 1 or 2 countries doesn't matter. Don't even need to come back to sgforums to see if someone flame you for your narrow-minded thinking. (Maybe the optician cheated you... instead of glasses, they gave you 2 toilet rolls stapled together... thus your narrow vision.)<br><br>Funny or not? See?
