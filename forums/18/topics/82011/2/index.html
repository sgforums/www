And you've only proven more of how immature you are. You have not hit on my weak spot regarding this topic or anything. But have have utterly pissed me off for making personal attacks. Moderators really should do something about that.<br><br>If you couldn't comprehend from my last post, I never said that I agree with rape towards any person in any way. So what's with all this talk about morals being directed at ME? If you're unhappy about anything, don't lash out blindly at innocent people!<br><br>What I meant by proper was to have an objective discussion regarding the matter. Not make brainless personal attacks like you have.<br><br>You can go start any thread you like, I'm not the moderator here anyway. I can't say I like it, but it only proves how much of a f.u.c.k.i.n.g arsehole you are. And it only proves how dumb you are to not realise that people are not benig hostile to you in any way. Yet you bl00dy like provking people.<br><br>Maybe I don't know who I'm f.u.c.k.i.n.g with. But I can say I don't bloody care who you are. Only thing is I've done nothing but be objective, but you however seem to enjoy being a jerk more than anything.<br><br>Seeing that you were to blinded by your rashness to notice, I want to repeat to you that I never once condoned rape in anyway. Nor did I ever say that I have ever done anything against young girls in anyway. So why are you directing so much flaming against me? Did I hit some weak spot about you not being objective enough?<br><br>Besides, this topic isn't just about rape, it's about how sexual interest in child seems to be very common.<br><br>You have been bl00dy quick in flaming people so don't pretend to be so self-righteous. You don't even know who is against you or not. I am not against you regarding your stand towards sexual abuse of minors or your stand against rape, I am just saying we could discuss the issue of how some people are phidaeophillic more objectively. Starting a discussion about phidaeophiles doesn't mean one is a phidaeophile, but your suggestion of starting<br><br><blockquote>"'How do you want to rape SumOne's sister/gf?</blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">is nothing but a personal attack. I wonder what is the moderators stand on such a pesonal attack?</span></span><br><br>Talking about things that are immoral doesn't make you an immoral person. It depends on what context you discuss rape and child sex.<br><br>Child Prostitution in Thailand is very rampant, and articles in magazines and newspapers have talked about it before. So do you deem those articles immoral? Talking about it doesn't mean you support it, in fact, it can strengthen your stand AGAINST it.<br><br>You have a f.u.c.k.i.n.g attitude problem, and YOU are the one who needs help. Nobody here is trying to pick a fight with you or anything so quit being so bl00dy personal. If you're just in the forums here to rail at people than I hope you f.u.c.k off!!!<br><br>Once again I wonder, what have the moderators got to say about you?</div>
