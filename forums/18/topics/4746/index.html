            <div class='col-md body'>I'm fond of a guy but too shy to express myself. I jus felt that most of the times I 've had the opposite behaviors when we've the opportunities to talk. I really hope to know him better and not just b'cos of his look. I had recently tried practiced having the conversation using the mirror, but that jus wasn't the real situation. Most of the times he 'll smile when he run into me out of his errands, but nothing further than smiles. B'cos of the constant smilings make my heart melt away and hope to run into him often. I wonder how he find me? Can the men give me good advice? I don't want just smiles.. How to go further than this?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Chimewing1...Now, I'm no expert by far in the dating game, but I do have my advice on how to approach this man.  First all, your probably going to have to bite the bullet and just talk to him.  I think it's important to remember that you can't expect the guy to ask you out, but you, as the women, must do it yourself sometimes.  Hey, this guy might be as shy as you.  Is there something about you that brings down your confidence?  Your ability to hold a conversation maybe...I don't know, what ever it may be.  Your looking at this guy, and you believe and/or know that he is a good guy.  They are few and far between, I know, I am a guy, the majority of us are real idiots about everything.  If you just be yourself, than this guy, as a good guy, should see who you are.  Just don't try to approach him as something that you think he wants.  Who knows, you may start a conversation and he might just ask you out.  Sure would be wonderful, eh?  Best of luck to you. CF</div>
