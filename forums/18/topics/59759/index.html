            <div class='col-md body'>On 13th Sept, I went to this shop AFD in Sim Lim Square and bought a modem. Later, I tested and realised it is not working. Hence I sent for 1 on 1 Xchange, test again, spoilt again. Again, i went back that shop and result is they sent the modem for servicing. Days ago, I got it back happily went home to test it, Gone! Still it can't be used! So again I returned to the shop and guess what? That boss told me to leave it with them so they send for repair again, no 1 on 1 exchange or changing. I was really angry, what kinda policy is this? So I asked, what if the 1 year warrenty is up and the modem still not repaired, She said"Too Bad".

But they will only blacklist if they receive more complaints about that store. Unless you can find enough people to complain with you then they blacklist.<br><br>3) Write to ST. But you will be damn lucky if they publish. Try to link it to some newsworthy article in the papers, then chances of publishing will be higher.<br><br>4) Write to local IT or any electronics mags to feedback service.<br><br>5) If got time, create a big hooha at the store to scare away other customers. Speak loudly and yell at them loh!<br><br>6) E-mail all your contacts to tell them to boycott the store and spread on the message to their contacts and their contacts. Say to 5 new persons per day/per person. impact will be very big! But must cooperate!<br><br></div>

They usually sell you things which you'll need to bring home to test out... And they'll guarantee that if the thing's spoilt, they'll CHANGE it for you... No refund though... Then you'll slowly get to realise their TRICKS... They'll make you go back to the shop and EXCHANGE everytime... When you ask, they'll say no refund... The MOST they can do is let you EXCHANGE...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  In fact I SUSPECT some of the shops are just selling SPOILT stuffs... And customers are actually just exchanging spoilt stuffs with one another...</div>
