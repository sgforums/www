            <div class='col-md body'>hi! all<br><br>i just received a mail from a friend as below. It really remind me those old days when i was in Primary &amp; Secondary School  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Are you one of them too????<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>Time and Tide wait for no man.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>h&amp;E  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>&gt;THE GOOD OLD DAYS . .<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. You grew up watching He-man, Transformers, Silver hawk and Mickey<br>&gt;Mouse. Not to forget, Ninja turtles and Smurfs too.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;2. You grew up brushing your teeth with a mug in Primary school during<br>&gt;recess time. You will squat by a drain with all your classmates beside you,<br>&gt;and brush your teeth with a coloured mug. The teachers said you must brush<br>&gt;each side 10 times too.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;3 You know what SBC stands for.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;4. You were there when the first Chinese serial, the Awakening was<br>&gt;shown on TV.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;5. Internet? What the hell is that? So you thought a decade or more ago.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;6. You find your friends with pagers and handphone cool in Secondary<br>&gt;school.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;7. SBS buses used to be non-airconditioned. The bus seats are made of<br>&gt;wood and the cushion is red. The big red bell gives a loud BEEEP! when<br>&gt;pressed. There are colourful tickets forTIBS buses. The conductor will<br>check<br>&gt;for tickets by using a machine which punches a hole in the ticket.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;8. Your favourite actor and actress is Huang Wenyong and Xiangyun.<br>&gt;Next is Lee Nanxing and Zoe Tay and the Aiyoyo woman.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;9. You've probably read Young Generation magazine.You know who's Vinny<br>&gt;the little vampire and Acai the constable.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;10. You were there when they first introduced MRT here. You went for<br>&gt;the first ride with your parents and you would kneel on the seat to see<br>&gt;the scenery.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;11. Movie tickets used to cost only $3.50.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;12. Gals are fascinated by Strawberry Short Cake and Barbie Dolls.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;13. You learn to laugh like The Count in Sesame Street.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;14. You longed to buy tibits called Kaka(20 cents per pack), and Ding<br>&gt;Dang(50 cents per box), that had a toy in it and it changes<br>&gt;every week not forgetting the 15 cents animal crackers and the ring pop,<br>&gt;where the lollipop is the diamond on the ring.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;15. You watched TV2(also known as Channel 10) cartoons because Channel 5<br>&gt;never had enough cartoons for you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;16. Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Three Investigators, Famous Five and<br>&gt;Secret Seven are probably the thickest story books you ever thought you<br>have<br>&gt;read. Even Sweet Valley High and Malory Towers.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;17. KFC used to be a high class restaurant that serve food in plates and<br>&gt;let you use metal forks and knives.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;18. The most vulgar thing you said was asshole and idiot and THE MOST<br>&gt;EXTREME WAS 'super white'...you just couldn't bring yourself<br>&gt;to say the hokkien relative.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;19. Catching was the IN thing and twist was the magic word.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;20. Your English workbooks was made of some damn poor quality paper that<br>&gt;was smooth and yellow.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;21. CDIS was your best friend.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;22. The only computer lessons in school involved funny pixellised<br>&gt;characters in 16 colours walking about trying to teach you maths.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;23. Waterbottles were slinged around your neck and a must everywhere<br>&gt;you go.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;24. Boys loved to play soccer with small tennis balls in the basketball<br>&gt;court.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;25. Hopskotch, five stones, chateh and zero point were all the rage with<br>&gt;the girls and boys too...<br>&gt;<br>&gt;26. Science was fun with the balsam and the angsana being the most<br>&gt;important plants of our lives.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;27. Who can forget Ahmad, Bala, Sumei and John, eternalized in our minds<br>&gt;from the textbooks. Even Mr Willy.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;28. You did stupid exercises like seal crawl and frog jumps.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;29. Every children's day and national day you either get pins or pens with<br>&gt;'Happy Children's Day 1993' or dumb  files with<br>&gt;'Happy National Day 1994'.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;30. In Primary six you had to play buddy for the younger kids like big<br>&gt;sister and brother.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;31. Chinese teachers were always old, boring and damn fierce looking.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;32. Your form teacher taught you maths, science and english.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;33. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor quality.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;34. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it rained, and you<br>&gt;find a dry spot in the school to sit down, dry your feet, and wear your<br>&gt;dry and warm socks and shoes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;35. School dismissal time was normally around 1 pm.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;36. There would be spelling tests and mental sums to do almost everyday.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;37. Your friends considered you lucky and rich if your parents gave you<br>&gt;$3 or more for pocket money everyday.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;38. During class gatherings, parents always tag along in case someone<br>&gt;gets lost at Orchard Road.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;39. You freak out when the teacher tells you to line up according to<br>&gt;height and hold hands with the corresponding boy or girl.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;40. Handkerchiefs were a must for both genders<br>&gt;<br>&gt;41. Collecting notebooks and all kinds of stationery was a popular<br>&gt;thing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;42. Autograph books were loaded with "Best Wishes", "Forget<br>&gt;Me Not", and small poems like "Birds fly high, hard to catch.<br>&gt;Friends like you, hard to forget".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;43. Class monitors and prefects loved to say "You talk somemore, I write<br>&gt;your name ah!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;44. There were at least 40 people in one class.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;45. Large, colourful schoolbags were carried.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;46. You brought every single book to school, even though there was one<br>&gt;thing called the timetable.<br>&gt;<br></div>
