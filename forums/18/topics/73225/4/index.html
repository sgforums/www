            <div class='col-md body'>I think it not right or wrong to say whether or not you support NS. Some people are just pariotic about their country and I have friends like that. I (a person who thinks that NS is one waste of time),  on hearing that how they enjoy army lives make me realise that army does have it good points. But for those that are pariotic, do not blame us for thinking that money and time are more important than protecting the country. Singaporeans are kiasu, we would'nt want to lose to our female counterparts. But they always have a headstart of us. Thus, most feel that this is the reason why people hate NS. I'm sure that when the time comes, this people will defintely come out to maybe not die for their country but defintely willingly to die for their family and they will come out and fight.</div>
