National Service is a waste of time because it costs us 2.5 years of our entire lifetime and Singapore is too small to even win a war. Spending 2.5 years doing National Service rots our brain, we will probably forget everything we learn in school which means that we need to spend extra time reading up about stuff again. Although its true that National Service builds up confidence but only for a minority because more people are being scolded and shouted at during National Service than scolding and shouting at people. National Service only provides us with a measly income every month where we could be earning tens of thousands contributing to the nation's economy during that 2.5 years. And also since National Service is being forced and not volunteered, who can ensure that during a war the soldiers will stay behind and fight for the country instead of running away? In the past, people claimed that women contribution to the country is by giving birth but nowadays the birthrate has decreased drastically does that mean they are still doing their " National Service " properly? Isn't it time they contribute 2.5 years of their entire life to the nation too? </div></blockquote>Yes, its true that we're a small country and if you say we can't win war.. maybe you can say that the invention of atomic bomb no need soliders in every country if you say that.. because if you want to win a war, drop the bomb.. hehe<br><br>A country without soldiers is a not country because others soldiers from other countries can simply march in and take over and over ride the laws in Singapore. Imagine soldiers killing without mercy and humilating the Women. What if the victims are your loved ones or worse.. you're the victim. History textbooks area good enough for a lesson in the WWII.  Maybe you can say that who can ensure all those ppl will fight off the enemy.. you might be surprised.. in a war, those who don't know how to fire a round or handle weapon will want to fight.. Its because they can't stand the way they are treated .. this true if the loved ones died in the enemy hands.. sure you want revenge??<br><br>Its true that Singapore is a small country.

Some people are just pariotic about their country and I have friends like that.

But for those that are pariotic, do not blame us for thinking that money and time are more important than protecting the country. <span style="color: red;">Singaporeans are kiasu, we would'nt want to lose to our female counterparts. </span>But they always have a headstart of us. Thus, most feel that this is the reason why people hate NS. I'm sure that when the time comes, this people will defintely come out to maybe not die for their country but defintely willingly to die for their family and they will come out and fight. </div></blockquote>chauvanism is the word..</div>
