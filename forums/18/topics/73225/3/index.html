            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ayukat, I'm the same age as you, and frankly, National Service seriously seems like a waste of time. I've spoken to many "graduates" of NS, and most agreed that they had spent their years in the army in vain.<br><br>War in future won't be like what it was in WW1 or WW2. Rather, if you've actually bothered to look at the situation, wars in future will be based on financial power and capitalism. The rich will always be the ones commanding the middle and lower classes to fight for them, as they are the ones who have the wealth to cause changes.<br><br>Secondly, nowadays if SG makes any enemies, we're as good as dead. With nuclear arms being commonly portrayed in conflicts between countries nowadays, we're in as much as danger as any other country. 1 or 2 nukes is enough to wipe us out. What good is an army then? As a deterence force? Oh sure, perhaps the airforce pilots in the sky would escape the radiation and flee in their slick fighter jets?<br><br>From another point of view, namely the government's, forced conscription is still necessary. Even though I personally abhore the idea of it, SG still requires a sizable army force for our defence, namely to deter any "neighbours" from launching a surprise attack on us.<br><br>SmallPanda, you're right in the sense that it's childish to think that Malaysia and Indonesia want to whack us. I mean, what can they gain in terms of economic value other than the fact that they triumphed over us? Our only resources are the people, one large island and several small islands. Heck, by attacking us they would lose resources instead of gaining! What's the financial value in that in today's world of capitalism?<br><br>The government should definitely conduct an overhaul of the military system. Instead of just contributing as army soldiers, we SG males can contribute in other ways as well such as training us to be more financially intelligent.<br><br>:  If you've bothered to analyse the so called tax rebate and slightly higher pay increments, they're actually close to nothing. Even if you get a higher pay, you're also taxed more as well. Similarly, even with a $3000 deductible tax rebate, you're still paying income tax. Not to forget with all the other taxes, you're still paying a lot, even though the rebate helps to some extent.<br><br>That said, I still enjoy listening to stories told by the army oldies. Boy, they make you laugh like dogs most of the time.</div>

There are a lot of terrible things that can happen to POWs, regardless of what sex they are.  Saying one is worse than the other is just biased.  Is a man getting castrated with a knife better off than a woman getting raped?  Rape is just a manufactured crime IMHO.   Anyway, a woman soldier is still a soldier with responsibilities.  There is no need to be over protective just because they are women.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I finished my service as a recon trooper,BRC<br>commonly known as scouts back in 2000. At<br>one point or other in my life, I have felt that it<br>was a big waste of time.. the concept of National<br>Service. Esp. when you compare yourself to<br>your lady friends who have by then established<br>themselves and had a headstart in their career.<br>Also they have probably accumulated a tidy sum<br>of $. The opportunity cost is huge.<br><br>But I remain pro-NS. You may lamblast me for<br>being a "siao-on", "tao-nao spoil" or a "hawk"<br>who loves guns, mud, violence etc. But I am not.<br>When I entered BMT, I couldnt do a single chin-up<br>and did my 2.4km in 19mins. When I was assigned<br>to my recce unit, I was the slowest man (in terms of<br>running) in my company of 74 men. My nickname was "sleeping-tiger". Simply put, I was in no way an<br>idea soldier. Still I gamely go thru my training<br>because I didnt wanna let my team down. (We<br>operate in four men teams) After all we are<br>"in the same boat".<br><br>Similarly as Singaporeans, are we not "in<br>the same boat". Are we not all living on the same<br>little isle located at the southern tip of the Malay<br>archipelago. Isnt what is good for this "little red dot"<br>beneficial for us 2? When someone intrudes into<br>your house, doesnt everyone in your family feel<br>violated and fights back? Or when that happens,<br>you simply pack up and move into another house?<br>Are you simply a journey-man in this little country?<br>I hate to say these but I feel the majority of the rich<br>would be the first to flee in times of distress.<br><br>Will all these 2 1/2 years and the $millions$spent<br>be of any use in an emergency? I would like to think<br>so. Our NS is modelled on Israel's model. When<br>their infant state were threated back in the 40s to<br>60s. Their "NS" men stood up and struck back f<br>iercely. I too hope that if that happens to us<br>Singaporeans, we would do the same too.<br><br>Today, we can call on 250,000 able bodied men<br>to bear arms if the need arises. Would you count<br>yourself as one of them? If our very soil were to<br>be threatened today, I would be proud to defend<br>it together with you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well , as for me.. I think that serving national service have its bad point &amp; good point. The bad points is the service is too long &amp; those regulars treat us like their own working machine but the good points is that you get to know all kinds of people especially those backstabbers , you learn to be more responsible , you get to be more mature in thinking , you learn how to avoid dangers etc...<br>Guys , I know is quite a hard time serving the national service but just treat it as a lesson for your life. You can't just tell the goverment to give up the ideas for national service for guys , think of those people who already served their national service. So Unfair right ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahem, I didn't fail Social Studies. Look at Japan, they aren't allowed to have an army. Are they attacked? Maybe they do have a special army like someone said before but what can it do? Do you think its good enough to fight a war? And how come nobody answered this question? Is it right to force people against their own will to serve NS? Human rights! Why are we being deprived of it?</div>

At<br>one point or other in my life, I have felt that it<br>was a big waste of time.. the concept of National<br>Service. Esp. when you compare yourself to<br>your lady friends who have by then established<br>themselves and had a headstart in their career.<br>Also they have probably accumulated a tidy sum<br>of $. The opportunity cost is huge.<br><br>But I remain pro-NS. You may lamblast me for<br>being a "siao-on", "tao-nao spoil" or a "hawk"<br>who loves guns, mud, violence etc. But I am not.<br>When I entered BMT, I couldnt do a single chin-up<br>and did my 2.4km in 19mins. When I was assigned<br>to my recce unit, I was the slowest man (in terms of<br>running) in my company of 74 men. My nickname was "sleeping-tiger". Simply put, I was in no way an<br>idea soldier. Still I gamely go thru my training<br>because I didnt wanna let my team down. (We<br>operate in four men teams) After all we are<br>"in the same boat".<br><br>Similarly as Singaporeans, are we not "in<br>the same boat". Are we not all living on the same<br>little isle located at the southern tip of the Malay<br>archipelago. Isnt what is good for this "little red dot"<br>beneficial for us 2? When someone intrudes into<br>your house, doesnt everyone in your family feel<br>violated and fights back? Or when that happens,<br>you simply pack up and move into another house?<br>Are you simply a journey-man in this little country?<br>I hate to say these but I feel the majority of the rich<br>would be the first to flee in times of distress.<br><br>Will all these 2 1/2 years and the $millions$spent<br>be of any use in an emergency? I would like to think<br>so. Our NS is modelled on Israel's model. When<br>their infant state were threated back in the 40s to<br>60s. Their "NS" men stood up and struck back f<br>iercely. I too hope that if that happens to us<br>Singaporeans, we would do the same too.<br><br>Today, we can call on 250,000 able bodied men<br>to bear arms if the need arises. Would you count<br>yourself as one of them? If our very soil were to<br>be threatened today, I would be proud to defend<br>it together with you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div></blockquote>wah u sound like yue fei leh..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
