            <div class='col-md body'>I guess there is really no point in the arguement. People are just brought up differently with different mindset which might be genetic or influenced by experiences and the environment. Fear of the regimental lifestyle may just be one the reasons one had for condemning NS even before one went through it. In any case, all able bodied Singaporean guys must go through it.  Try posting your questions to SM Lee, I think he will be able to better clarify your doubts than all of us cause ultimately we have never seen turmoils in our lifetime.  Whatever reasons we give you for the necessity of NS will sound bull shitting to you for maybe you just want to hear the answers you want.<br>Regarding NS for woman, I am actually quite for it but in a way that they be trained in the skill of first aid. I personally do not know the reasons why the government reject the proposal for woman to be conscripted into NS. Why dun you post your view in ST? I am not being chauvunistic here but I believe that not all women are suitable for combat; other roles in the service side; they are fine.<br><br>In any case, good luck for your NS which is 2 years later unless of course you can find a way out of the system.  But an advice is to cherish the time inside since lan lan, you just have to go through it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>say what you might, but one of the reasons why we're still around or still doing our own stuff without anyone messing around with us is due to nothing other than national service. sure, it might suck, but its necessary, as we're "a small island nation with no natural resources"(model answer to any question about our vulnerability), and every man has to play their part..if the time comes when we have to fight to protect what is ours, i'd have no qualms about doing so..after serving NS that is..don't know how old you are but i'm 15 this year..<br><br>about women serving NS, well..i'd just say that i'd rather serve NS than experience labour pains..<br><br>just my 2 cents worth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
