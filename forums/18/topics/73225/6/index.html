You are probably the type of person that sits in the corner of you bedroom every night lip-reading your Soldier of Fortune magazine.

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on this entire issue.<br><br>I for one, do not enjoy NS nor do I support it. Yet, I still believe that it is a necessary concept. SmallPanda, you talk about forcing someone to do something against his will. But have you ever stopped to think about what the enemy could force YOU to do against your will if they were allowed to waltz right into Singapore? Whether we like it or not, we need this deterrent force in order to prevent an idea of invasion from even materializing in the minds of our neighbouring leaders. You talk about being childish because we believe that we are surrounded by enemies. Without attempting to sound like a bigot or racist, picture South East Asia and Singapore's position. We are merely a little island surrounded by Malaysia, Indonesia and Southern Philippines. What are these countries? All Muslim ones. All Malay ones. I'm not trying to imply that Malays or Muslims are the aggressors and I'm sure the ones in Singapore are not like that. But who's to say these countries wouldn't band together to destroy everything we hold dear? Remember that jealousy often breeds much contempt and for at least 35 years, our neighbours have been jealous and often, embarassed by our astonishing progress. I for one would definitely not put it past a strife-torn Indonesia facing severe economic and social distress to take their anger out on us.<br><br>Ayukat, you for one, need to grow out of this phase of self-centric ego. True, some of us are forced to serve in the Army for 2.5 years and it is a fact that a number would not like it. But if exempting these people were a possibility, what would it make the Singapore Govt look like? Democracy is about equality and the say of the people. Wouldn't the Govt want to preserve this essential tenet of democracy by ensuring that everyone goes through the same thing? You talk about hiring a conscript army and how it would ensure Singapore's survival. What a ridiculous proposition. Imagine this scenario : You hire a security guard to stand guard at the main gate of your house for $150 a day. A thief comes along and offers him $250 and he offers to open up your gate, unlatch the front door and smiles while the thief goes inside and steals your valuables, kills your brothers and abuses your sisters. Now do you see the fallacy in that argument? A soldier is not a good soldier if he is not loyal to the cause he is fighting for. That is a fundamental concept which you obviously have not grasped.<br><br>It seems to me that your argument about the Government not 'touching' you is laughable. Fine. If the Government were to just leave you alone, how about you try leaving the Government alone as well. Pay the full amount in school fees of $200 a month for your education. Be charged $50-60 for each consultation at a polyclinic. Fork out $15,000 a year for University tuition fees. In more ways than one, you have taken from this Government and institution you so despise. So don't go crying when they ask you for that little sacrifice. Compared to the Taiwanese conscripts or even the German ones, our Army is what we would term 'chicken feet'.<br><br>I may not support the Government on certain decisions to certain issues, but what I will concede and agree on is that they have done a magnificent job in defending the interests of Singapore. But there is one area in which they have failed. Failing to provide a proper upbringing to the youth of today.</div>
