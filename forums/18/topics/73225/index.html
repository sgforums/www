            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, National Service should be made optional and for both men and women. National Service is a waste of time because it costs us 2.5 years of our entire lifetime and Singapore is too small to even win a war. Spending 2.5 years doing National Service rots our brain, we will probably forget everything we learn in school which means that we need to spend extra time reading up about stuff again. Although its true that National Service builds up confidence but only for a minority because more people are being scolded and shouted at during National Service than scolding and shouting at people. National Service only provides us with a measly income every month where we could be earning tens of thousands contributing to the nation's economy during that 2.5 years. And also since National Service is being forced and not volunteered, who can ensure that during a war the soldiers will stay behind and fight for the country instead of running away? In the past, people claimed that women contribution to the country is by giving birth but nowadays the birthrate has decreased drastically does that mean they are still doing their " National Service " properly? Isn't it time they contribute 2.5 years of their entire life to the nation too?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, Army sucks, no doubt about it. But that doesn't mean you can't learn anything from it.<br><br>Personally, I feel there is no point complaining, do what peition,etc because in the end, it is no point.<br><br>Let say you do get the goverment notice and start a public review. That is going to take what? Half a year? a year? 2 years? 3 years? to finish the review?<br><br>Let say they approve this plan of yours, making volunters sign up, do you think they are going to implement striaght away? how long this time? 2 years, 3 years?<br><br>Revising our current system and implement a new one is not going to be a overnight thing.<br><br>So by the time this plan is implemented and got going, you ORD dunno how many times liao. So in the end also no point.</div>
