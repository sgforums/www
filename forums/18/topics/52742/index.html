            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.abbys-sexual-health.com/articles/masturbation.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.abbys-sexual-health.com/articles/masturbation.php</a><br><br>Masturbation<br><br>Masturbation may be the most important aspect of sexual health due to the fact that it allows you to learn about yourself and what you enjoy most.<br><br>Ensure that you will not be disturbed when you decide to experiment.  Turn the phone off and don't answer the door.  Pull out all your sex toys to play with, turn the lights down, and light a scented candle to set the mood.  Think about whatever might turn you on and let yourself go there.  This is your time to explore what feels good without worrying about pleasing anyone else.  It's all about you, you, you.<br><br>The key to masturbation is to experiment with satisfying all your senses.<br><br>First, there is the visual aspect.  What do you want to see when you're playing?  Feel free to be naked, dress in lingerie or pajamas, or wear what makes you comfy and happy.  You can choose to watch yourself with a mirror or simply lie back and close your eyes and imagine whatever turns you on.  For those women open to adult videos, observing women who are sexually experienced gives a unique insight into different things to try that you might also enjoy.<br><br>Second, consider the senses of hearing, taste, and smell that you will allow you to relax and make you more sexually excited.  Perhaps a scented candle lighting the room would set a romantic mood.  Experiment with different smells, such as vanilla or watermelon.  Also experiment with different music, possibly music strippers use for dancing, to add to the sexual discovery.  Although most people may not experiment with taste, adding a favorite dessert such as whip cream, cake frosting, chocolate, or fruit can add an extra element of pleasure.<br><br>Third, there is the aspect of what you feel physically.  Be sure to use plenty of lube to make everything move smoothly.  And also be aware of all your erogenous zones that can be stimulated.  There is the clitoris, labia, vagina, anus, breasts, nipples, and anywhere else you find to be sexually exciting.  Experiment with light touching, harder touching, velocity changes, directional changes, pressure changes, temperature changes, and anything else that might feel good.  Continually trying many variations as it is important to learn what works for you.  Experiment with a vibrator, dildo, and a vibrating, small anal toy.  Different textured items, such as feathers and ice, can also be very exciting for your experimentation.<br><br>Your most sensitive physical areas to stimulate are most likely the clitoris, the g-spot, the pubococcygeal muscles (pc muscles or pelvic floor area), and the anus.  Clitoral stimulators or vibrators can lead to a quick orgasm when you just need that fast release.  Special oils, which increase blood flow where they are applied, can also increase clitoral sensitivity and heighten orgasmic intensity.  Also add a dildo for vaginal insertion and pleasure.  It's very arousing to stimulate the "G spot," Grafenberg's discovery of a vaginal erotic zone that can be stimulated to orgasm.  The G spot is rough textured tissue that surrounds the female urethra and runs along the vaginal wall closest to the front of your body (see image below).<br><br>G spot stimulation can also cause fluid that is not urine to expel from the urethra, according to Grafenberg reports and the personal discovery of many women including myself.  Experiment with the G spot area to increase sexual intensity and pleasure.  An area that is often ignored although it is a very erogenous zone is the anus.  Outside anal stimulation is arousing; slow, gentle experimentation also allows many to enjoy the benefits of anal play.  Add a second dildo underneath this anal region to add even more pleasure to your sexual discovery session.  The pc muscles (see diagram below), which create a large area that forms the number 8 around the anus and vagina, are very sensitive to touch and will add extreme pleasure to any sex session.  Continue to experiment with breasts, thighs, and any other sensitive area to enjoy the physical pleasures you learn from masturbation.<br><br>Finally, don't forget your sense of imagination.  Create stories or scenarios in your mind to fantasize about while you play.  Close your eyes, and imagine you are there to really get into the fantasy.  Common fantasies to start with include threesomes, orgies, or possibly experimenting with a woman.  It's healthy and quite normal to fantasize, so use it to your benefit.<br><br>After your masturbation session, think of what you liked and apply those things to future sexual encounters.  Also share these likes with your partner so your partner can also please you better.  Continue to freely experiment and keep an open mind to new ideas since tastes often change.<br><br>Recommended products:<br><br>Abby's Clitoral Vibrator Top 4 Choices:<br><br>Fukuoku Power Pack: $47.99<br>Abby Says:  9,000 vibrations per minute (wow), small enough for your pocket, fits on fingers, easy to clean.<br>Hitachi Magic Wand: $74.99<br>Abby Says: This popular vibrator plugs into wall for extra vibration; you'll never replace batteries again.<br>Rhythm Master Bouncing Cannon: $88.99<br>Abby Says: Clitoral stimulation and vaginal dildo combine to give you extreme pleasure.<br>Pocket Rocket: $43.99<br>Abby Says: This small, powerful vibrator is well-known for its use outside your home (nice travel toy).<br>Abby's Conventional Vibrator Top 3 Choices:<br><br>Gyro G-Spot Stimulator Pink:  $19.99<br>Abby Says: This vibrates inside your vagina and hits the G Spot with pliable multiple speeds.<br>Blue Water Stimulator Tidal G Spot: $23.99<br>Abby Says: This waterproof model is designed for G Spot play and more.<br>Future Flex Kit: $17.99<br>Abby Says: This vibrator has 2 textured removable sleeves for easy clean-up after playtime.<br>Abby's Top 2 Dildo Choices:<br><br>12" Double Dildo Dong Flesh:  $12.99<br>Abby's Choice: This double-ended dildo can be used in many places, all at the same time.<br>6" Dong with Balls: $15.99<br>Abby Says:  This vaginal dildo is thick and long enough to satisfy every area and need.<br>Abby's Vaginal Personal Lubricant Choice:<br><br>ID Personal Lubricant With Nonoxynol:  $9.99<br>Abby's Choice:  This is one of the most popular lubes available; for vaginal sex and more.<br>Abby's Adult DVD/Video Choices:<br><br>Up &amp; Cummers 10: Video,  $29.99<br>Abby Says:  Watch the infamous porn star, Jenna Jameson, in her first amateur video when she was a shy young woman.
