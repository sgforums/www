            <div class='col-md body'>mmmm... lets see... so you are already ignored and do not think it could get any worse.. well, in that case, maybe they are rite... maybe she wants u as her bf than the other guy? what i mean is, if u love her, just tell her...<br><br>if she is more interested in u then u lucky... if she just wants to spite her bf.. i think its rather hurting to be used as an object... and pls answer this question.. 'have you apologise?' and if u do, are u sincere?<br><br>anyways, its up to you wat your life is all about...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ive sent her two really long mails apologising non-stop and telling her how much i like her.  But she still treat it like nothing like that... dunnoe its her character or wat... but shes always blowing hot and cold... basically its driving me crazy.  I know it takes two hands to clap ... but when we were at it... it felt like we were totally in luv... even her hugs felt that way... but now hai.... jus hoping and hoping... when i drive home everyday i do wonder if she is just fooling around and looking for company... but considering that i've known her for over a year... she doesnt seem to be like that... sigh when is this confusion ever gonna end...</div>
