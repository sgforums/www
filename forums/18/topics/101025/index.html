            <div class='col-md body'>Replying back to VERY OLD MAN! Thanks for the compliment... woman are naggy, becoz, they are meticulous about things..... And, well.. you see that man differs from the past becoz, in the present.... the things that people THINK that only MAN CAN ACHIEVED had been corrected... Becoz, many things and situations have proven that both woman and man can achieve the same things. However..... there are certain things that woman can't do.... man can.... and what woman can do, and man can't.... SO!! NEVERENDING STORY DE LA!<br><br>Hmmm right, I shan speak anything more with direct bowling to your alley.. becoz, afterall... there are many factors.. in such issues..... No point me trying to outwin you..and vice versa! GET THE FACTS CLEAR.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> lalalallaa~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i do think that it happens to both guys and gals. one of the common reasons could be that they really are afraid to leave the "stable, confirm" one for a "not sure if can catch" one. quite sad huh?<br><br>with regards to the argument over MAN VS WOMAN, i think each gender has their strengths and weaknesses ya? it's like a zero-sum theory - where 1 side is stronger in something, the other is weaker; and vice versa.<br>I definitely have to disagree to the statement of women being an inferior species though.<br>Yet, if you really are, literally, a very old man, i guess we can't really judge you for your perception of that since most "old men" would have been brought up to think likewise.
