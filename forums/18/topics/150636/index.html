But u have tounderstand that there will be a counteracting force in place. In India , Hinduist country and Thailand , a buddhuist country. Their politics are influenced by religion. So in the case, religion has a say in how the country is run. So some black sheep may try to use them to gain undue power or status aka caste system ect. But  Imperialism is not a religion. it is a F*cking  exploitation and bullying. It is called a government system just like Nazism, Communism , Facism, Democracy,  belongs to the latter<br><br>If u notice around in Spore, people who Hindus and Budhhist true to their religion are good natured and compassionate. Some Christians and catholics too. Normally those Indians , malays or others u see corrupt in nature are not into religion.Monks who drive cars, pastors who commit molest are the so called imposters out to take advantage of a system. TT durian belongs to this category but his case , it was not his own kind<br>It is the belief system one grow up in and one has <strong>religiously follow it to be true to the good aspects of that belief system or religion</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Much of what came to constitute China Proper was unified for the first time in 221 B.C. In that year the western frontier state of Qin, the most aggressive of the Warring States, subjugated the last of its rival states. (Qin in Wade-Giles romanization is Ch'in, from which the English China probably derived.) Once the king of Qin consolidated his power, he took the title Shi Huangdi ( First Emperor), a formulation previously reserved for deities and the mythological sage-emperors, and imposed Qin's centralized, nonhereditary bureaucratic system on his new empire. In subjugating the six other major states of Eastern Zhou, the Qin kings had relied heavily on Legalist scholar-advisers. Centralization, achieved by ruthless methods, was focused on standardizing legal codes and bureaucratic procedures, the forms of writing and coinage, and the pattern of thought and scholarship. To silence criticism of imperial rule, the kings banished or put to death many dissenting Confucian scholars and confiscated and burned their books (). Qin aggrandizement was aided by frequent military expeditions pushing forward the frontiers in the north and south. To fend off barbarian intrusion, the fortification walls built by the various warring states were connected to make a 5,000-kilometer-long great wall (). What is commonly referred to as the Great Wall<br>is actually four great walls rebuilt or extended during the Western Han, Sui, Jin, and Ming periods, rather than a single, continuous wall. At its extremities, the Great Wall reaches from northeastern Heilongjiang () Province to northwestern Gansu (). A number of public works projects were also undertaken to consolidate and strengthen imperial rule. These activities required enormous levies of manpower and resources, not to mention repressive measures. Revolts broke out as soon as the first Qin emperor died in 210 B.C. His dynasty was extinguished less than twenty years after its triumph. The imperial system initiated during the Qin dynasty, however, set a pattern that was developed over the next two millennia.</div>

No insults intended but I can't say I agree with your posts either.<br><br>The fair and western Indians that you say are being treated better is essentially because they look more like caucasians than the average Indian. By embracing that is to agree that the average Indian looks ugly. Isn't that like sucking up to the westerners?<br><br>Besides, there are beautiful and ugly of every race. You think all caucasians look like Hollywood stars? It's only the ones you see on tv, the ones in Hollywood.<br><br>As for the part about Chinese Ruler and working slave, it's essentially about working hierachy. Superior and subordinate. You been to mustafa? Half the staff there and Indian nationals, and yet most of them don't dare to make decisions on the spot and they usually refer customers to the manager.<br><br>In fact, this idea of superior and subordinate happens all over the world, not just in chinese socieities.<br><br></div>

Lately to me, it seems there are more cases where Indians murder each other. I hope I'm wrong but it's just the impression I have. And there are always those stories of how those construction workers kill each other in fights at the living quarters.<br><br>And trust me, I've seen Malay and Indian lie and cheat as much as any other person, be it at a shop or anything else. I just got conned by a Malay guy the other day in fact. The things your friends told you is basically a result of their own stereotyping, the same thing "sexiest-stud" is doing. And many a times, I've worked with Indians who would tell just about any lie to avoid doing something. Chinese liars and cheaters? I'd say everyone's equally guilty.<br><br>And you think backstabbing only happens in chinese socieities? It happens in co-orparate ogranisations the world over. And if it happens, at least it happens for money. What else did you expect, candy bars?<br><br>Large enterprises and organisations are run on hierachy, superior and subordinate, or master and slave (worker) if you want it. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but it's not limited to just the chinese.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am talking about in terms of religion and ideology and not referring to society makeup.<br>Wanna know how i converted to hinduism? the ideas, concepts in that religion are universal moral values, unlike islam. They dont preach anything. Have u seen Indians going around asking others to join their temple or religion? nope u dont see it because it is not the type of religion<br><br>After watching the Matrix and it dawned on me that the movie was in fact inspired by Hinduism as said by the makers. I have read many hindu scriptures like the Bagavad Gita before and many of them are in fact useful to mankind. Famous scientists also were inspired by the the immense knowledge found in the scriptures. Hinduism is probably the most nobel and deep religion in the world next to buddhism which actually may be derived from hinduism as well</div>
