            <div class='col-md body'>I think...<br><br>let's break it up into several issues:<br><br>1. He had sex with a prostitute.<br>2. He had sex with a prostitute frequently.<br>3. He had an emotional attachment to the prostitute.<br>4. He still HAS an emotional attachment to the prostitute.<br>5. He compares you to the prostitute.<br>6. Implications.<br><br>Let's look at 1.<br>it has to do with how important sex places a part in their person's personal values and life. A lot of people do NOT have sex when they don't have partners and just get on with life. Are you simply shocked that the importance he place on sex is so great that he is willing to pay for it to get some? OR are you shocked that he feels no distaste in paying someone who for sex?<br><br>2.<br>Having said that.  A lot of people have sex with lots of other people when they don't have partners. In fact, a lot of people dont even need to pay to have sex with other people<br><br>do you think you would feel better if you know he had a "messy" past where he used to pick up girls from the club? i.e. he had more sex partners, but he didn't pay for them?<br><br>3. People are human. He is quite innocent if he actually end up having 'feelings' for the prostitute, and not some hard core person wanting sex. Perhaps he felt lonely, and not being able to find someone, ended up buying for some paid relief.<br><br>4. However, like any other gf, NO ONE wants to hear their bfs still have feelings for an ex, regardless of what the ex works for. Why on earth do you want to form an emotional attachment with me, if you havent gotten rid of your own emotional baggage for??<br><br>5. Of course, your skills wont be as good as a prostitute unless you have an equal number of sex partners and is a 'professional'. However, it is insensitive for him to put it across this way. If he had jus suggested 'improvements' and explain what HE desires, instead of comparing, it would have been much better.<br><br>6. Did he use a condom? Still go for the blood check. Just ask for the test in a polyclinic.  And siam him until the test is out for both of u as advised.<br><br>if you look at 1. and 2. it is really a question of values. If values and priorities are not similar, it is very hard to continue a long term rship. I will be the last to comment that prostitution is a good/bad thing in modern society now, BUT are you willing to compromise your own principles in the rship enough?<br><br>for 3. 4. 5. It's just whether you accept his character and personality or not. Anyway I think your bf is generally someone very insensitive. And don't expect him to change yeah, can you accept him despite that?<br><br></div>

Not just for sex, but for talks or chit chats, or maybe other things.<br><br>Stand by him if you really love this guy.<br>Understand him, talk to him, know him deeply of how he is like to you.<br>It takes tons of courage for a guy to tell his beloved partner that he did such a thing. Trust the man that you love and you will know what you are going to get when open this box of "love"</div>

It could take months. But it's advisable to have your blood tested IMMEDIATELY.<br><br><strong>2.  he went to geylang, before knowing me, fnot once or twice, in fact 10 times to be exact! visiting the same chicken these 10 times! i know he is horny but when he broke this secret he has been trying to hide, i dunno how to react. he even showed me the photo he took with that chicken. he told me he has got a bit of feelings for her.  crap, bullsh!t. all in the name of lust. </strong><br><br>You mentioned "he has been trying to hide" the secret.  So he did not tell you these WILLINGLY, it just goes to show what KIND of a person he is.  I jus wanna let you know.  A GOOD person don't patronise prostitutes.  A THRILL Seeker may go there with friends jus to look at them purely for the thrill factor, but would not do it.<br><br>I fully AGREE with YOU he did them "all in the name of lust", unlike what he mentioned "got a bit of feelings for her".  Patronising prostitutes is LUST, it's not LOVE nor any FEELINGS got anything to do with it.  For someone capable of saying this, wat does it make of them?<br><br><strong>3.  and he still dare to admit doing it with the girl is better than me! say my skill nto as good as hers!</strong><br><br>A guy telling he's gal this ought to be STRIKE by lightning or RUNDOWN by cars 10 times.  It's a guy's DUTY to protect his gal and to think that this animal is comparing you with a prostitute!!?<br>It clearly shows a lack of RESPECT for YOU as a person.  In it's chest, YOU probably don mean a thing to it.<br><br><strong>4.  yes i love him so have to accept his past. but a bit hard to get over it</strong><br><br>You LOVED him with all your heart.  Does he love you when he says your SKILL isnt as good as a PROSTITUTE?<br>Do you really want to be with him when he openly admits that prostitutes is BETTER then you?<br>Do you think you will want to grow old with him since he feels that prostitutes are better then you and he could visit them ANYTIME?<br>Do you want to have the constant FEAR in life, not knowing when you would be contacting AIDS and having to keep reminding him to go for check ups?<br><br><strong>5.  now i'm worried. will i get aids?</strong><br><br>Yes. You should be worried, but not by AIDS.  But by someone like him whom you so UNFORTUNATELY happened to know of.<br><br>Words of ADVICE.<br><br>Go for a BLOOD TEST now and if tested negative, go for another blood test 3-6 months later.<br><br>DUMP HIM.  There are plenty of good guys out there who will CHERISH, RESPECT, make you LAUGH and BE WILLING to grow old with you.<br><br>If you have any doubts or need any other advice, Jus return here ANYTIME and post a msg.  All of us here will be happy to listen to you n give the BEST advice.<br><br>Dont worry I believe AIDS wouldn't get close to SOMEONE like you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </span></div>
