            <div class='col-md body'>If u are already attached, I think that constitutes betrayal.<br>Anyway, the fact that why some ppl do that is coz u are extremely comfortable with e person to begin with, not so much of guys being horny.

She will narrated it in a way that she will looked good in her past.
