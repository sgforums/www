            <div class='col-md body'>joining mlm is like doing other businesses, such as setting up a retail outlet. The only good thing is ur investment amt maybe lesser, maybe around few k. but there's no guarantees or no risks. if u say doing business 9 out of 10 fail, mlm the statistics also about the same... only that ur risks lower. But if I got few thousand.. i rather invest in shares of companies that I understand. no need to go around recruiting and all that hardwork.</div>

U can persuade her to stop joining this MLM company but she might go for others.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, i was approach by a friend abt 7mounths back. After some persuasion, I was stupid enough to pump in a few grand to join her intially, however after much consideration i wanted out as i felt my interest was not been served in the best manner.<br><br>Why do i say so<br><br>Firstly, i already had quite a good paying job full time job . But the lure of earing money makes the mlm proposition promising. I soon found much difficulty slogging in the office during the day and doing some mlm training at night. Besides, even before i took up the mlm thingy, I really did not have much energy to expend at the end of the day as my job is pretty demanding. So for fellasthat are already working in pretty satisfactory conditions, my word of advice is to stick to what you are doing and be happy with it.<br><br>Secondly, it dawn upon me that i did not have much time for other aspects of life. Say, u spend abt 0800 to 2000hrs in the office, and after that u pump the rest of the day into the mlm thingy. How much time does it leave for personal affairs? So for fellas with much social and personal commitiments, u need to factor this into consideration before you dive into the mlm thing<br><br>For mlm to work, most individuals pour in much of their time and financial resources. But statistics have reflected that despite doing that, it does not guarantee absoluate success.<br><br>So if you are holding onto a good job with promising prospects, direct your forcus in that area instaed of trying to cope between a day job and part-time mlm. In the end, u need to realise there is more to living a fufilling live then making more money.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I was just approached by a very trusted friend to join his "downline" in this mlm he just got into. Being a very trusted friend, he managed get me into going to meet his"business associates" and for the sake of our &gt;5 years friendship, I did not want to atagonise him. I promise him that I would look into his "business preposition" via the internet.<br><br>FYI, the mlm he joined is AMWAY. And its amazing what you can find on the internet on amway. if you do a google on this word, you'd come to the same conclusion as me and not join.<br><br>Perhaps you can tell your wife to do a google on the name of the mlm company. After all, research before delving into a business is critical for sucess for a profit driven enterprise.</div>
