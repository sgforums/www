Its also a view into the primitive minds and how they are so easily manipulated and triggered off and the pure lack of control. Besides that, it also highlights today's clothes sense of some people and its fair warning. Let me put it this way, no girls will listen to their moms when it comes to covering up. Even aunties, they will also comment on how the girls nowadays "pang neh", "pang kah-chng" and "pang kah liao". Covering up is now left to the imagination. Then again older aunties nowadays also start to wear tight clothes and some "pang old neh" also. The old adulterous fu.ckers now look at young girls, eyeing them up and down cause they have easy access to these in geylang lor 23/Chinatown and have tasted all the young chi-na flesh and they think all girls are fair game as well. There are men and women, married or not, no longer care and they do make their own bed in their choices. Les and Gays are common sights and public displays of all sorts are becoming common.<br>So its a change my friend, there is an unbalance somewhere, lets just watch and see.<br><br></div>

Its also a view into the primitive minds and how they are so easily manipulated and triggered off and the pure lack of control. Besides that, it also highlights today's clothes sense of some people and its fair warning. Let me put it this way, no girls will listen to their moms when it comes to covering up. Even aunties, they will also comment on how the girls nowadays "pang neh", "pang kah-chng" and "pang kah liao". Covering up is now left to the imagination. Then again older aunties nowadays also start to wear tight clothes and some "pang old neh" also. The old adulterous fu.ckers now look at young girls, eyeing them up and down cause they have easy access to these in geylang lor 23/Chinatown and have tasted all the young chi-na flesh and they think all girls are fair game as well. There are men and women, married or not, no longer care and they do make their own bed in their choices. Les and Gays are common sights and public displays of all sorts are becoming common.<br>So its a change my friend, there is an unbalance somewhere, lets just watch and see.<br><br></div></blockquote>well, see it this way. last time, people all naked. then some guy invented "killing the animal and wear the skin." then later on, some guy invented "cloth" and Shit, then people all wear some lame Shit. then later, CHina invented silk. then later, Angmos industrial revolution can produce lots of clothes for ppl to wear. then later, ppl sianz make weird clothes as fashion. then later, girls all wanna get oogled at and wear very little. then later, u see girls wearing bikini on orchard road. then later, ppl kill the animal and wear the skin, then later, ppl just walk around naked cuz "its the natural way to go" and "respect mother nature" and Shit like that.</div>
