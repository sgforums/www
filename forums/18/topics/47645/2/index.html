What I wanna get across is the fact that human make mistakes, and in a true serious relationship, if both parties really love each other, then running away from problems ain't a solution at all.<br><br>Relationships is never perfect and bound to have problems, issues that both parties need to face together, be it juz a BGR or Marriage. Relationships ain't like those fairy tales you read or heard about when you are young. In reality, there are lots and lots of obstacles that both have to face together, in order for that relationship to work out.<br><br>Yes, it may not be the same as before, and to rebuild that trust, it is tougher and not easily achieveable. However, have anyone ever give it a thought that when such incidents occurs, it may not be the fault of a single person. Furthermore, if both parties can get over the incident and move on with life, ain't the bond going to be stronger.<br><br>In relationship, the bond is strengthen with every single obstacles that both face and cross over together. Love and bond is build bit by bit, accumulated over time and not juz an overnight task.<br><br>Lastly, again. I am not encouraging anyone to be unfaithful to their partners. Juz that facing problems instead of running away from it should be the approach we take in our lives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's rite, harryryan, Constructive comments!<br><br>If i was you,<br><br>i would<br><br>1) Call the best friend up, talk with her about what we done is wrong and shouldnt do it again<br>2)I would say: We would remain as friends and no more sexual contacts, i believe you still dont want to lose a best friend, rite.<br>3) I say: I would never be with you, no matter what happens. (if she begs for secret affair.<br>4) I say: I would never be with you even if you tell my gf that i went to bed with you, cos i would beg my gf to forgive me. If she dont forgive me, which i sure she would with my sincerety, i would still ignore you.<br>5) Friends forever!<br><br>6) Dont tell your gf, block that memory, telling and admitting is useless. Honesty sometimes doesnt pay.Be sure not to make the same mistakes again.<br>7) Care more for ur gf, buy her flowers, gifts and hug her like u never did.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">Whenever, u two want to start a arguement, think about the wrongs that u have done, and KEEP ur MOUTH shut. This will lessen ur guilt, even if she's in the wrong. But just softly reason with her and not shouting. I noe guys have the tendency to shout cos i also guy.</div>
