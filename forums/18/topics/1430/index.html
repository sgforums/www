            <div class='col-md body'>Please read the whole text and think over it for some time.<br><br>I disagree with Mr. Desperado. Seems to me a matter of individual opinion. ItÂ’s not news that some of the families here already practicing naturism in their homes since ages. This is an advanced society and very open minded to new ideas, which is the drive force behind the phenomenal national development. Though as far as I know, there is no known naturist club or beach here but I strongly feel that there is a great need for at least one such place. I may be wrong but to me, I feel several complexes of physical appearance in both genders and in all age groups, to which such a club can be a great relief and help.<br><br>The last word. Why donÂ’t try it at a limited level and see how mature and evolved we are as a society rather then guessing about it and imposing our own ideas to the public? What appears here in the forum (can Singaporean allow it or not) is the opinion of very few participants and cannot be regarded or labeled as the opinion of the society.<br><br>Note: The new idea referred above is not about being nude in the household but the acceptance of being nude in a social gathering (club or beach) for the social and intellectual development.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree and disagree partially with the opinion of all of you.<br><br>It is true that practicing nudism in the general public is not advisable in Singapore. The same is true for almost any country in the world. All sorts of Ah peks all over the world in any civilized population are essentially the same in nature and they sure do stare, regardless of whatever you are wearing a dress (or not wearing anything at all). ThatÂ’s why the need for a private club or beach arises to express the limited group of people who appreciate nudism. Not everybody is invited.<br><br>It is inadvisable to adopt a house or apartment for a private gathering point, as it will not be possible to exercise rules and control, which are essential for such an assembly. Sure if you are just one family or very close friends, you may live with each other under the same roof without major disputes. But it is more likely that there might be disagreements if the parties are stranger to each other. The result of any mistake by an individual will kill the spirit and will end the move for good. Please mediate for a while to get the message here correctly.<br><br>The situation will entirely be different in the case of a club, which must be established by the permission from authorities. The rules can be implemented to control any mishap. If it is an illegal assembly, the first person that disagrees by the rule and control will be heading for the help from NPP. I know that so far it is not possible here in our society even to discuss this idea with authorities. It only means that the time is not right for it now. I am sure it is not a long wait as so many people are responding to this forum. Please do not take any step in haste as one wrong step will sour the move and it may die out before its real maturity.<br></div>

Regardless of gender, we have several complexes here, both physical and psychological. Naturist way of life is the easiest to overcome these sorts of things. This is a misconception that you need to be miss world or superman to present your natural self to the world. The whole idea of nudism is to accept the reality of being a real person who you are, regardless of all your physical attributes and camouflage. May be it is difficult for a newcomer to be totally nude the first time before other people (just like going into the cold shower in winter) but moments later you will feel comfortable and relaxed.<br><br>If you happen to visit any naturist resort anywhere in the world you will notice that there are people there with every imaginable (or un-imaginable) body shape/ description, without feeling any discomfort among all Â“The most model likeÂ” people around them. The second thing you will notice is the absence of erotic charge. People will be interacting with each other just like they are dressed normally. No additional or less sexy they feel being nude. A nudist enjoys sex just like another person at the proper time and in his or her own privacy.<br></div>
