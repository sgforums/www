            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone. I've got a boyfriend and I love him very much. Though we may be busy with our own schoolwork and stuffs, we seldom fail to meet each other at least a week.<br><br>Sometimes we're bored and there isn't any nice place to go to, he likes coming to my place (only when there's no one home). Then we always cuddle together and watch the television, always halfway, he will automatically go into my room and just lie on my bed say he sleepy and wants to sleep.<br><br>I like to tease him say he dirty and smelly and always try to pull him out of the bed, but his strength is bigger, so in the end, I always end up lying on him. Hmm, then in bed, he always tries to unbutton (if I happen to wear a buttoned shirt that day) me and says he wants to touch my boobs.<br><br>It's not that I don't allow him, I feel really awkward whenever he tries to sneak his hands under my blouse. Okay I admit I quite like that feeling, but it just doesn't seem right to me. I'm sure and I know we won't and will not be having any sex.<br><br>Besides, my Mother once told me to NOT let any guys touch my boobs. It just isn't right. Even though he didn't touch it, already I feel quite sinful le. Then in SMS-es, he always request for such things, like touching or asking me to strip.<br><br>I know it's only touching and I sound quite stupid or conservative just because "My Mom doesn't allows me to". I, myself, already find it going against my own principles and thinkings by letting him going this far (unbuttoning). But my boyfriend is good enough to stop whenever I loudly asked him to. He doesn't like to force me either.<br><br>I feel like a failure, I feel that I can't satisfy him. Up to now, I dare not hold his di.ck with my bare hands. Everytime I only stroke his di.ck with his briefs on. Though each time only through hugs and me stroking him, and his manhood is hard already, I still feel so useless.<br><br>I'm not troubled because that I can't make him happy only. Sometimes I keep thinking that he's with me because perhaps I'm his first girlfriend that allows him to come this far, and not because of love. But I really love him and I can't lose him.. I've got no choice. Haix. I know I sound kind of naive and young, I'm only 17.<br><br>So, should I or should I not let him let his way?? Also, I'm absolutely sure I will be so embarrassed with his hands on my boobs. He's always "fingering" me though I have my pants on, meaning, touching/stroking me trying to make me feel good. He keeps wanting to insert his hand into my panties, and I don't shave, and I always have a little foul-smelling discharges, I'm scared if he touches them.. Yuck! It will be so disgusting and very, very awkward..<br><br>Advices? Opinions? Suggestions? Anyone.. All please feel free to post comments.. Thanks. Hopefully helpful ones, please do not joke. I'm really feeling troubled and need help. Thank you all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess that I am in the right position to give you advice since (i) I am also in secondary school and (ii) I did some of the things your boyfriend did, but I am less of a bastard; let me explain.<br><br>It is inevitable that guys with girlfriend would want to touch their girlfriend's body parts at some point in the relationship. They may not necessarily want to "take advantage" of you (as in my case); but even as a guy, I advice you to trust your instincts. You own your boobs. If you do not want anyone's hands coming near those jugs, then by all means stop him.<br><br>I once caressed my girlfriend's breasts (when making out) and we just arrived at a point where she gradually pushed my hand off. I took the hint and learnt not to touch her there anymore, because I know she does not want me to -- either because she was not ready or simply was not comfortable with what I was doing. I recognised the fact that it was not right to push on.<br><br>In your case, the only conclusion that can be made is your boyfriend is a bastard for the following reasons:<br>(i) He persisted in doing things you dislike him to.<br>(ii) He is too pushy and does not respect your decisions. Remember you had to shout just to stop him? Well, he was not respecting you; he was afraid of losing you and thus, his source of sexual pleasure.<br>(iii) He ASKS directly for sexual flavours. Do you not see anything wrong with this? Things like fondling are meant to be initiated naturally and the ones who request sexual flavours from their girlfriends are called bastards.<br><br>On a side note, if you think guys are scared off by your "foul-smelling discharges" and pubic hair, you are wrong. The large majority of guys love them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to add:<br><br>You said you feel nice when he tried to sneak his hand under your blouse. To say it very bluntly, once you go deeper and start having sex, you can't stop. One side, you can't stop having sex. The other side, you feel guilty because you feel dirty. That can be the truth.<br><br>I suggest you resist the temptation to go all the way.

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with coolmyth.<br><br>It is apparent that once you agree to take another step further, what it will lead to eventually.  As it is, you feel guilty engaging in certain activities and that feeling will escalate should you move anything beyond your current boundaries.<br><br>Guilt will damage your self esteem and might make you 'loss' yourself.  While allowing him to gratifying the lust of the flesh might 'keep' him for a while, but it is you (the whole package of personality, intergrity, character, value, commitment etc) that will keep him for life.  What you intended might have reverse effect on the long term.<br><br>Intimacy will build relationship and is a great gift to mankind.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is natural for guys to be more forward in regards to matters of the flesh.  That per se does not make him a bad person.  Human are created with passions intended for intimacy and that will never disappear.<br><br>For all you know, he might also be going through some internal struggle, whether to obey his conscience or obey his flesh?  Many guys relate rejection of intimacy as rejection of him.  So what then?<br><br>Assuming that both of you are involved in religious activities (christianity?), guide him to a greater YES might be appropriate.  Greater YES to God's precepts and word.  God never deny human desires and passions, in fact he created it.  But He does regulate it.  Done within God's confine, intimacy is great gift and bliss indeed!<br><br>Jam 4:7  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</div>

He keeps wanting to insert his hand into my panties, and I don't shave, and I always have a little foul-smelling discharges, I'm scared if he touches them.. Yuck!
