            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, read ur problem and this is the advice i'm giving u from a married man's point of view. Ur 17, don't be fool by whatever his saying, stay true to urself and ur principles.                                                                                                  NO means NO, u don't have to explain anything to him, if he truly loves u, he'll accept ur decision. There has been too many unwanted teenage pregnancy's happening and i don't think u wanna be part of it. Believe me, a lot of people will say u'll cross the bridge went ur there but i don't think u wanna find out that way. Ur body is urs and urs alone and no one else has the right to tell u otherwise.<br><br>If you should give in to him, to him ur just another gal that he did it with and you would be at the losing end. At this day and age, it might be very common for teenages to engage in pre-marital sex but why be the majority, instead u should be the minority, the one who dare to say NO, satisfying his sexual needs isn't ur responsibily.<br><br>Some teens would even brag about it after it happen, maybe for the guys, its a sense of acheivement but for the gal ??? Remember, no matter what, ur the one on the losing end. Save it for someone u really love in the future and not merely giving it away becoz u can't afford to loose him. In time u would look back at this phase of ur life and will realized that its all worth saving it for the right guy and the right guy meaning ur future husband.<br><br>Don't ever doubt urself or give in just becoz u feel ur pressurised, have faith in urself. If u have done no wrong, u would not have felt any sense of guilt. Trust me, i've waited and in return i've found my other half, she's now my wife, my friend and one day, the mother of my child.<br><br>Hope this help to put ur mind at ease.</div>

He can tease you all he want, but I know he will respect your decision because I believe he love you too.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 15963:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi everyone. I've got a boyfriend and I love him very much. Though we may be busy with our own schoolwork and stuffs, we seldom fail to meet each other at least a week.<br><br>Sometimes we're bored and there isn't any nice place to go to, he likes coming to my place (only when there's no one home). Then we always cuddle together and watch the television, always halfway, he will automatically go into my room and just lie on my bed say he sleepy and wants to sleep.<br><br>I like to tease him say he dirty and smelly and always try to pull him out of the bed, but his strength is bigger, so in the end, I always end up lying on him. Hmm, then in bed, he always tries to unbutton (if I happen to wear a buttoned shirt that day) me and says he wants to touch my boobs.<br><br>It's not that I don't allow him, I feel really awkward whenever he tries to sneak his hands under my blouse. Okay I admit I quite like that feeling, but it just doesn't seem right to me. I'm sure and I know we won't and will not be having any sex.<br><br>Besides, my Mother once told me to NOT let any guys touch my boobs. It just isn't right. Even though he didn't touch it, already I feel quite sinful le. Then in SMS-es, he always request for such things, like touching or asking me to strip.<br><br>I know it's only touching and I sound quite stupid or conservative just because "My Mom doesn't allows me to". I, myself, already find it going against my own principles and thinkings by letting him going this far (unbuttoning). But my boyfriend is good enough to stop whenever I loudly asked him to. He doesn't like to force me either.<br><br>I feel like a failure, I feel that I can't satisfy him. Up to now, I dare not hold his di.ck with my bare hands. Everytime I only stroke his di.ck with his briefs on. Though each time only through hugs and me stroking him, and his manhood is hard already, I still feel so useless.<br><br>I'm not troubled because that I can't make him happy only. Sometimes I keep thinking that he's with me because perhaps I'm his first girlfriend that allows him to come this far, and not because of love. But I really love him and I can't lose him.. I've got no choice. Haix. I know I sound kind of naive and young, I'm only 17.<br><br>So, should I or should I not let him let his way?? Also, I'm absolutely sure I will be so embarrassed with his hands on my boobs. He's always "fingering" me though I have my pants on, meaning, touching/stroking me trying to make me feel good. He keeps wanting to insert his hand into my panties, and I don't shave, and I always have a little foul-smelling discharges, I'm scared if he touches them.. Yuck! It will be so disgusting and very, very awkward..<br><br>Advices? Opinions? Suggestions? Anyone.. All please feel free to post comments.. Thanks. Hopefully helpful ones, please do not joke. I'm really feeling troubled and need help. Thank you all.</div></blockquote></div>

However wont you agree with me that some ladies even at the age of 27 will had already give in?  Wont you agree that although she is 17, her brain and gut do show sign that she is more mature than those of 27?<br><br>Also dcx wont you agree with me that girls who are preg. at young age(maybe 16 or so) and yet dispire what they will be and going to face in the future, they still willingly to continue carry, birth and support her child even through the father is running from that responsible deserve our praise?  Arent their sense of responsible is more mature than not only their lovers but to some who are at the age of 27?

I strongly feel that there is one thing that a person shall responsible for, doesnt matter what is he/her age.  And that is his/her life.

But we cant delay the fact that there are such irresponsible people around us who will take no shame in blaming others for their ruined life.  Therefore, I dont agree that mature and responsible come in the form of age and stages, rather I feel that it come in the form of mind.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi dcx<br><br>I agree that engaged in sexual activities there is no sense of maturity and responsibilities.  However, that does not limited at age limited.  All sexual activities no matter what age, there is no sense of maturity and responsibilities dont you agree?<br><br>I do not know whether have you engaged in any sexual activities before, but to me sex is an emotional and physical thing.  Even adult after the age of 21 may not able to control it at times, but even having that little control that they have we still address them as mature.  Then dont you agree that our friend here can be address as mature as well?  And if that the case wont you agree that mature shallnt be address only in age limited?<br><br>I am truly understand your concern about age limited girls getting preg.  We cant fully say that they dont know anything with so many education about such issue going around in varies media.  However, if they are not going to be responsible for they own life, they going to let someone else responsible for them (very likely their bf).  So dont you agree having a good sense of responsible about their life is better then just telling them "no it is not good"?<br><br>Frankly speaking I dont think there is anything difference for having "accidents" at the age of 16-19 or 21 and above. Have you ever see those who endure the pains and sufering even they are older than 21?  Yet have you ever see support and love given to those at the age of 16-19?  Althought I have seen both, but like I have previously said I have only see and know a small portion of it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hallo hallo!! long time nvr visit the forum liao...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by 15963:<br>....he always tries to unbutton (if I happen to wear a buttoned shirt that day) me and says he wants to touch my boobs.<br><br>It's not that I don't allow him, I feel really awkward whenever he tries to sneak his hands under my blouse. Okay I admit I quite like that feeling, but it just doesn't seem right to me. I'm sure and I know we won't and will not be having any sex....</blockquote>ok, let me first introduce, i'm a guy. and this is how I personally feel, aint sure about the other guys though.<br><br>In a relationship, some form of intimacy is really a must, and integral to a healthy relationship. And this intimacy I'm refering to need not be sexual. What I'm trying to say here is that, verbally or not, you should let yr bf know what is comfortable to you, what's not.<br><br>I.e. if you enjoy him touching you at a specific part, letting him continue is as good as telling him that you like it. If intercourse is not okay for you, let him know, by nudging him away when he's "going a little too far".<br><br><blockquote> ...Besides, my Mother once told me to NOT let any guys touch my boobs. It just isn't right. Even though he didn't touch it, already I feel quite sinful le. Then in SMS-es, he always request for such things, like touching or asking me to strip.<br><br>I know it's only touching and I sound quite stupid or conservative just because "My Mom doesn't allows me to". I, myself, already find it going against my own principles and thinkings by letting him going this far (unbuttoning). But my boyfriend is good enough to stop whenever I loudly asked him to. He doesn't like to force me either.</blockquote>let's look at this issue from another way. What do you think makes you feel guilty about letting him touch you? What is the issue that you're dealing with right now? What're your principles?<br><br>Put it this way. Meanwhile, just do only what you feel is comfortable. As for what you feel is not comfortable doing with your bf...discuss this issue with him! Like telling him during one of your love talks, what you dont feel comfortable about, how you'd like the relationship to go, your sexual limitations, etc.<br><br>It takes time for you to discover even your own sexual limitations, and even more time for you to stretch it. Naturally, your bf would want to go as far as he wants; it is you to allow as far as you permit. Feel free to experiment with your own feelings and limits.<br><br>Btw, a bf who truly loves you would respect all your limits and try to accept them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote> ...I feel like a failure, I feel that I can't satisfy him. Up to now, I dare not hold his di.ck with my bare hands. Everytime I only stroke his di.ck with his briefs on. Though each time only through hugs and me stroking him, and his manhood is hard already, I still feel so useless.<br><br>I'm not troubled because that I can't make him happy only. Sometimes I keep thinking that he's with me because perhaps I'm his first girlfriend that allows him to come this far, and not because of love. But I really love him and I can't lose him.. I've got no choice. Haix. I know I sound kind of naive and young, I'm only 17.<br><br>So, should I or should I not let him let his way?? Also, I'm absolutely sure I will be so embarrassed with his hands on my boobs. He's always "fingering" me though I have my pants on, meaning, touching/stroking me trying to make me feel good. He keeps wanting to insert his hand into my panties, and I don't shave, and I always have a little foul-smelling discharges, I'm scared if he touches them.. Yuck! It will be so disgusting and very, very awkward..<br><br>Advices? Opinions? Suggestions? Anyone.. All please feel free to post comments.. Thanks. Hopefully helpful ones, please do not joke. I'm really feeling troubled and need help. Thank you all. </blockquote>Hi...I would say the same thing to you again. As for the questions, the confusion you have, personally, I feel that you could ask yourself and try to answer them yourself. The limits for another girl cannot be the same for you.<br><br>Importantly, please...don't blame yourself for not being able to please him and stuff, okay? If you truly love him, and he loves you, both of you can compromise...and internally explore yr own sexual issues and try to stretch the limits, slowly.<br><br>As for the foul smelling discharge, I don't know how foul smelling it is!! Whether or not you shave is not quite the issue with the discharge. But you truly think it's really bad, you might want to visit your doctor/gynaecologist to make sure you're not having an infection.<br><br>Take care.</div>

As for the questions, the confusion you have, personally, I feel that you could ask yourself and try to answer them yourself. The limits for another girl cannot be the same for you.<br><br>Importantly, please...don't blame yourself for not being able to please him and stuff, okay? If you truly love him, and he loves you, both of you can compromise...and internally explore yr own sexual issues and try to stretch the limits, slowly.<br><br>As for the foul smelling discharge, I don't know how foul smelling it is!! Whether or not you shave is not quite the issue with the discharge. But you truly think it's really bad, you might want to visit your doctor/gynaecologist to make sure you're not having an infection.<br><br>Take care.</div></blockquote>Are you a s_ex Therapist?</div>
