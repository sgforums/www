            <div class='col-md body'>well 2 things.<br><br>firstly if you are pregnant you have a load of problems on your hands. Being 14 the hospital will have to make a police report. They guy that made u pregnant will be arrested and tried with statutory rape. He will definately be convicted for child sex and sentenced to a jail term not exceeding 1 year if he is not older than you by 7 years.<br><br>Accompanying that, your parents will be so dissapointed with you. All that you have ever wanted and dreamed off and wanting to make your parents proud will be over. A new lease of life awaits you. A life of living with an ex convict and coming to terms with your future.<br><br>Society will shun you as a whole and all relatives will point at you as an example for their daughters. Although i believe there will be some sympathatic listeners and helping bodies out there to assist you. Even you councellor will go home and preach to his kids by indirectly quoting your case.<br><br>Secondly, if you are not pregnant...good for you. But if you persist playing with fire...i cannot say for certain that you wont get burnt</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey you guys , damn ciak lat la, this girl is lost n seeking advice to make her relieve a little, and all u guys commented are stuff which is gonna makes her felt worse.<br><br>Hey gal, dun worry, I am sure there's a solution for this problem, of course you are a little too young to be conceive but just get to a pharmacy or a clinic to do a pregnancy test first. Only then try to discuss this with your family or your bf but if your parents do not agree, abortion is sometimes a way too to avoid bearing the heavy burden n pressure from the world, but I strongly disagree in abortion unless you really got no choice financially.<br>Anyway, it's ok , what's done is done, but like u say u have a cramp in the tummy, it sure looks like the second aunty is on the way, no worries, meanwhile just live life cool, let life goes on  .......<br>Take great care   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
