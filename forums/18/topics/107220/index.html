Unlike a normal feces extraction, the log did not pinch off when I pulled back. It remained firm - still hanging from my quivering body but touching the surface of the water.<br><br>I couldn't stop now. I had to finish the extraction process. The worst was yet to come.<br><br>I bit my lip, took a deep breath, and summoned an adrenaline-driven force of strength, resisting the urge to cry in pain as the massive cylindrical log of feces came further out of my body. I reached a point of complete and utter agony. It kept increasing in circumference. My anal cavity couldn't take much more.<br><br>Finally, with no warning, the log quickly decreased in circumference until it slithered out of my anus like a snake emerging from it's den to attack an unsuspecting animal in the dead of the night.<br><br>I sighed in absolute bliss as I reflected upon the quest I had just embarked upon. I had finally thwarted the fecal serpent, and I felt so free and clear inside.<br><br>I was pleased to see that I had literally cleaned out my entire colon - I wiped only to see a clean piece of toilet paper afterwards. I smiled to myself As I flushed the foot-long behemoth into the eternal sewers where it would soon call "home". The quest was over.<br><br>Now, 7 minutes later, I literally feel like I have been sodomized. Imagine how the Goatse man feels; that is how I feel. But at least I am free of this beast within.</div></blockquote>This bus 3rd Retarded_moron... now i know y he gave his nick Retarded_Moron....
