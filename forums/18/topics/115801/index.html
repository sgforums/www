            <div class='col-md body'>You should have informed the security guard and let him catch that guy... Do you know it is illegal to do that? It is legal to secretly take pics of girls BUT it will become illegal if u outrage her modesty in the process of doing that... The police have actually gone around catching ppl for that... In short, u can take pics of girls even when they don't know it but u cannot purposely take them zaogeng....</div>
