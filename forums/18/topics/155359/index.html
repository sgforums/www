Furthermore u have done the same if not more so u should try to understand. Does she mind tat u have done the same? Did u even tell her how far u and all ur ex progress?<br><br>Though u can say it is hard for ur own ego, u just have to let it go. If u can't then u should not have asked in the first place. By asking u should be prepared to accept watever answer she gives u and not fault her for it. She was frank wif u ok.<br><br>Forget about the past and start masturbating each other lah! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
