But AT LEAST 2 SIMPLE FLAWS I see in your 'survey' though?<br><br>1. You DON'T just do a 'personal mission' and presents it to the authority even thinking that they'll take a look at it...<br><br>2. You NEVER even ask a single question about HIV or AIDS in your survey. How can it be for that use?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But like I've said, I'll give you at least 6 points for your CREATIVITY....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> " So much for your SINCERITY and wanting us to see things in a more POSITIVE WAY?
