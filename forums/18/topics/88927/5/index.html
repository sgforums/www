Even if you did manage to have a whole bunch... managing them, watering them and making that decision will be way way tougher than you can possibly imagine.<br><br>Plenty of people have been hurt that way both guys and gals and honestly, it is not an easy decisioin.  I have frens who are like this going round picking flowers and others who are fortunate to be loved by a few girls... you think they have it easy? no... they are constantly asking themselves and their frens who is better/sweeter/more suitable and this and that.  Having Choices alone does not mean that you will end up selecting the right person.

" have you experience that pain and agony of waiting where 1 night feels totally like a life time??? how horrible!<br><br>So why put yourself and the other person through this?<br><br>What you actually need during courtship is first an understanding of yourself, your needs and expectations.  Alot of people actually dont know themselves as well as they should!  Once you know yourself, it will be easier to immediately identify will gell with you and who will not.  By having this basic knowledge, you can avoid wasting your own time and energy pursuing girls/boys that are just not suitable for marriage/long term relationship.  You also spare plenty of people hurts and pains.<br><br></div></blockquote>SuperchargerÂ…..believe me when I tell you I have gone through my fair share of pain and agony.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by supercharger:</div><div class="quote_body">As to the sex bit... sex is a very very powerful bonding agent that its there to help kick start and CEMENT a marriage. (yes old world ah peh views but what the heck!) You see, when you have sex before any meaningful and strong committment is made and before you understand yourself and the other person properly... you actually short circuit the courting and love process!<br><br>How??<br><br>You see no matter what... we are all looking for intimacy, yes physical but more than that, mental and EMOTIONAL intimacy.  What happens with sex is that it can totally enhance the existing mental and emotional intimacy or it can fake it and replace it.  If you do not already know that person and love that person, sex often will give you that false sense of intimacy.<br><br>Sex is something sooo personal and deeply ingrained in our soul that when given and received you will feel that you are really really close to a person.  That is a fact and that is intimacy.  But there are more than 1 type of intimacy and you honestly need all of them to get a meaningful and enjoyable relationship that last.  Sex attempts to and does leap over the usual getting to know a person part.  Sex actually makes you think that you are communicating at a very deep level but you are actually not!! Only mental and emotional intimacy can fulfill.  That is why you would have heard many of your frens complain (and you know that they have had sex... that there is a void and emptiness and sometimes immediately after the sex act these empty feeling actually comes in... and no matter how much sex you have... you still feel empty!<br><br>Now there are many good reasons to spice up their sex lives but if it is so as to fill that intimacy void... it will not work bec the exchange of bodily fluid does not equal to the exchange of minds and feelings!<br><br>Now courtship.... all this are intertwine and it applies before marriage as well as after.<br><br>How would you know that a person is right??? unfortunately, knowing a  person's sexual responses and how he moves when having sex is not = to knowing him.  All you know is how he behaves during sex.  now if you have sex 18hrs a day then that would be important.  But the rest of the time, the mind and emotion must take over!<br><br>So whether its great sex or not should not be a major consideration.  There is no denying that its important but should not be the key cos... you will feel empty after.   There is no substitude for knowing a person thru and thru emotionally and mentally.  sex will give you a false sense of closeness that cannot last bec it is not based on any tangible intimacy other than both of us had a great time getting that big O!  </div></blockquote>Your sage lecture rather longÂ….so I had to break it in two. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Again I do agree with what you had written about the sex part. But I do detect you are leaning towards a strong view about pre-marital sex.<br><br>To me there are two kinds Â“Making LoveÂ” and Â“Having SexÂ”. You Â‘make loveÂ’ to someone you LOVE. Â‘Having sexÂ’ is everything else minus the love part.<br><br>You are probably going to toast (as in burn and not as in raise a glass <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) me for saying thisÂ….but I believe Â‘making loveÂ’ is important before marriage <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> . It is part of  the trial of being TOGETHER for life. And I believe you can never feel empty 'making love' to the one you love. It can only make a love grow stronger.<br><br>But if it is just Â‘having sexÂ’ before marriageÂ….well I am toward the view that it should not be done. ButÂ…Â….that would be easier said than done <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> .<br></div>

Especially for some ppl, they got so much painful experiences and finally got into a prefect love. Anyway, prefect love needs lots of time to be modified into it. Same as LOVE, u dun call love if u just like someone if there is no bad and good experiences. You only classified LOVE someone when so much time had proven it to you.<br><br>LOve in first sight? I dun believe in such things... That will only be a temp feeling for those ppl, unless time had proven real love exists in them.<br><br>Why not give urself more time to cool down ... Rushing into relationship will get urself hurt again.... Believe me, you will not know what u want if u rush into one... unless u want to get hurt again..</div>
