Love isn't just about faithfulness and sexual pleasure. But basically, a guy or girl will cheat because there is something lacking in the relationship. No point looking outside if the guy/girl is already happy in the relationship right? But honestly, if a guy cheats purely because he isn't sexually satisfied, then there's no loss in giving up such a guy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey gals,<br><br>Its great that you want to do something special for your bfs but from a brief reading of this... seems that no one really dealt with the issues of why the insecurity exist or about why the guy would walk... many only post about what you can do to pleasure them.<br><br>Girls, sorry I'm a firm believer in marriage and fidelity.  The problem is that the more you give and the earlier you give your whole body before marriage, the more he becomes used to it and without commitments.<br><br>You see... sex is like a reward for committing to a relationship. it can be something beautiful and totally mind blowing!  But from what I see in my male frens and how my female frens complain... I get the idea that the more the guy gets the more he will take for granted.  I mean after all he has tasted the most precious thing that you can offer... and after a while... as you have discovered... he gets bored.. and since many people esp girls based their relationship on giving sex for love and guys literally give "love" so that they can get sex... when he is not interested in sex with you anymore... you will automatically feel taht he is not as loving.<br><br>Why?  Bec you equate how energetic his sexual approach to you as a sign of his love for you... so when it tapers off... you will unconsciously take it as he is not as interested in you.<br><br>As for the guy... honestly... many guys will say I love you and even play out the love game to get sex!  once they get enough or are bored and have new flowers to smell... they stop loving you as much and that automatically means that they are not as motivated in sex which =&gt; makes you feel that you are not as loved.<br><br>That may be one of the reason why which causes you to unconsciously feel insecure apart from many other reasons.<br><br>I do not know what the situation is and yes, the guys may actually still be totally in love with you just bored with sex bec there is nothing new about it already since both sides have tasted the best but they remain committeed and loyal.  But some guys are not like that.<br><br>I hope your bf are the first type.<br><br>Yes by all means learn how to spice up your sex life, that is important bec even sex can become routine and boring... we humans are like that one... we become desensitised to all the good things very quickly no matter how wonderful it is.<br><br>So please dont rely on sex alone to hold on to your relationship... if that is the only thing bonding the parties... sorry - too many of my frens have broken up bec that is the reason why they went into the relationship.  The one that last (with or without sex) are the ones where there is actual love and respect and understanding and communication with each other!<br><br>I know... old worldview on this but heck... if this is the only view that works... than I would stick with it.  Of cos, I would love to have plenty of sex at this moment without the marriage committment but no thanks!</div>

Even if you did manage to have a whole bunch... managing them, watering them and making that decision will be way way tougher than you can possibly imagine.<br><br>Plenty of people have been hurt that way both guys and gals and honestly, it is not an easy decisioin.  I have frens who are like this going round picking flowers and others who are fortunate to be loved by a few girls... you think they have it easy? no... they are constantly asking themselves and their frens who is better/sweeter/more suitable and this and that.  Having Choices alone does not mean that you will end up selecting the right person.  I agree with her that not only will you potentially jeopardise your chances with the girls, its potentially hurtful for the girls/guys... I tell you its real agony when you know that you are being 2 timed or 3 timed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> and you actually lost!  What about the horrible wait when you have to wait and wait to hear who that person has choosen??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  remember those horrid times when you have to wait???<br><br>There is no time as long as when you are uncertain about whether a person loves you... in a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber "Aspects of Love"<br><br><strong>"....

" have you experience that pain and agony of waiting where 1 night feels totally like a life time??? how horrible! </strong><br><br>So why put yourself and the other person through this?<br><br>What you actually need during courtship is first an understanding of yourself, your needs and expectations.  Alot of people actually dont know themselves as well as they should!  Once you know yourself, it will be easier to immediately identify will gell with you and who will not.  By having this basic knowledge, you can avoid wasting your own time and energy pursuing girls/boys that are just not suitable for marriage/long term relationship.  You also spare plenty of people hurts and pains.<br><br>As to the sex bit... sex is a very very powerful bonding agent that its there to help kick start and CEMENT a marriage. (yes old world ah peh views but what the heck!) You see, when you have sex before any meaningful and strong committment is made and before you understand yourself and the other person properly... you actually short circuit the courting and love process!<br><br>How??<br><br>You see no matter what... we are all looking for intimacy, yes physical but more than that, mental and EMOTIONAL intimacy.  What happens with sex is that it can totally enhance the existing mental and emotional intimacy or it can fake it and replace it.  If you do not already know that person and love that person, sex often will give you that false sense of intimacy.<br><br>Sex is something sooo personal and deeply ingrained in our soul that when given and received you will feel that you are really really close to a person.  That is a fact and that is intimacy.  But there are more than 1 type of intimacy and you honestly need all of them to get a meaningful and enjoyable relationship that last.  Sex attempts to and does leap over the usual getting to know a person part.  Sex actually makes you think that you are communicating at a very deep level but you are actually not!! Only mental and emotional intimacy can fulfill.  That is why you would have heard many of your frens complain (and you know that they have had sex... that there is a void and emptiness and sometimes immediately after the sex act these empty feeling actually comes in... and no matter how much sex you have... you still feel empty!<br><br>Now there are many good reasons to spice up their sex lives but if it is so as to fill that intimacy void... it will not work bec the exchange of bodily fluid does not equal to the exchange of minds and feelings!<br><br>Now courtship.... all this are intertwine and it applies before marriage as well as after.<br><br>How would you know that a person is right??? unfortunately, knowing a  person's sexual responses and how he moves when having sex is not = to knowing him.  All you know is how he behaves during sex.  now if you have sex 18hrs a day then that would be important.  But the rest of the time, the mind and emotion must take over!<br><br>So whether its great sex or not should not be a major consideration.  There is no denying that its important but should not be the key cos... you will feel empty after.   There is no substitude for knowing a person thru and thru emotionally and mentally.  sex will give you a false sense of closeness that cannot last bec it is not based on any tangible intimacy other than both of us had a great time getting that big O!</div>
