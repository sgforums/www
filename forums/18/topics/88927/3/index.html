IMO, having s*xual intercour*s is not the only thing in a relationship. To me it is secondary. The primary thing is love. There are lots of other things to do to make a relationship grow stronger besides being better in bed. Sure I want my gf to be good at it Â– who wouldnÂ’t want.

IMO, having s*xual intercour*s is not the only thing in a relationship. To me it is secondary. The primary thing is love. There are lots of other things to do to make a relationship grow stronger besides being better in bed. Sure I want my gf to be good at it Â– who wouldnÂ’t want. But loving someone just because she is good in bed is a relationship dead end.  </div></blockquote>it seems that you are indeed wrong...<br>i did say i TALKED to him about it... not just about s*x... but about our r/s as well... i told him wat i really wanted in this r/s le... but it seems that either he do not understand my language or he is brain dead that night and didnt get a word in... in any case... he did not do anything after all... so... i have to do something... I have tried means and ways to show him... but it seems s*x is the most practical one after all...<br><br>because after tat night... he seems to realize that what i wan is not what he thinks i want...and now... he seems more willing to listen to me...<br><br>of course i dunno if this is a temporary thing lah...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's damn easy to please a man in bed. Just stroke his ego. He'll think u're the ultimate bed teaser.<br><br>U can start in the day with some mental foreplay. Maybe send him a sms saying u're horny or something. Just be creative. Or maybe leave ur sexier undergarments like a thong in his bag with a note. Just do something to drive him crazy the whole day n by the time he sees u, anything u do will drive him nuts.<br><br>Or u can check into a nice hotel like 1942 n ask him to meet u there. Get some nice music n champagne n tell him how desirable he looks.<br><br>Anyway, u get wat I'm saying. Just be creative n do something different. Routine kills sex faster than anything. I've got female friends who complain that they have more drive than their bfs. Sometimes maybe the guy is tired or it's always routine. U just gotta spice it up.<br><br>But the secret is really to stroke his ego.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>If u tell ur man how he satisfies u or his proportions or skills or watever while humping, he'll feel like he's GOD. Then u'll be the best sex he's ever had. Dat'll please ur man more than anything. To know dat he can satisfy his woman like nothing. Good luck n enjoy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
