Do you think that premarital sex is infringing on our moral values? Why?</strong><br>No. Some might think it is, but to me it is not an infringment onto my moral values. Its my right and freedom to choose.<br><br><strong>3. If you were to have premarital sex, would you consider the consequences beforehand? Why?</strong><br>Yes. Ultimately, the most affected person would be me, myself and I. If I want to have premarital sex, I have to know what I'm getting into because ultimately it is my responsibility over my actions.<br><br><strong>4. Is abstinence before marriage important to you? Why?</strong><br>No. A person should not be judged on whether he/she is a virgin. Well, it is a sweet idea to keep yourself chaste before marriage for the one you love but in this society now, most probably you will be seeing a few people before settling down with one. Plus, I think some experience helps to make the whole thing more enjoyable on the wedding night.<br><br><strong>5. Do your parents discuss the issue of premarital sex with you? Why and how would it be discussed?</strong><br>Yes they did discuss this with me before. Basically they pointed out that it would be prefarable for me to remain a virgin before getting married (you know how parents are) but they leave it to me as ultimately it is my choice but I did better know how to protect myself.<br><br><strong>6. Do you think peer pressure is one of the factors leading to premarital sex? Why?</strong><br>I think it is for most cases but not for me. I feel that for most Singaporeans, they rely more on their friends on their sex education then parents.<br><br><strong>7. Do you think the government is doing enough to educate young people about premarital sex? Why? What can you suggest to make education on premarital sex more effective?</strong><br>If I'm not wrong the government is trying to get schools to add sex education as part of the education process. I feel that instead of telling young people to abstain, it might be better to educate them on the various birth control methods and the practice of safe sex. Teenagers will most probably do the opposite when forced down the throat so alternatives and methods for prevention will at least offer them a choice.<br><br><strong>8. What solution(s) do you suggest in curbing the increasing trend of teenagers engaging in premarital sex?</strong><br>Best bet is still education but ultimately it is an individual's choice. With the changing mindset, my personal thoughts is that instead of trying hard to curb the trend, it is better to educate them on the dangers of unprotected pre-maritial sex. This way, it would help to lower the current rate of STD and unwanted pregnancies.<br><br><strong>9. Do you think that China is still very traditional in nature pertaining to premarital sex? Why do you think so?</strong><br>Maybe in the more backward cities but looking at reports in the news, they are becoming very liberal towards sex as well. From what I understand they are more open to display of public affection as well as sex topics discussed in magazines.<br><br><strong>10. USA is now a global superpower and is a very liberal and open country. Do you think that Singaporeans are easily influenced by their mindsets and trends? How so?</strong></div></blockquote><strong>I doubt it. I think Singaporeans  are much more influenced by Japanese and Korean culture than USA. As well, from speaking to alot of my American friends, you did be surprised to find out that lots of them are pretty conservative. Basically I feel that USA being perceived by most as a very liberal and open country is mostly media driven.</strong></div>
