The room was quite interesting as there was a pond with fishes and a water feature ( fengshui or Something). I wanted to see you before you go back.<br>Business is slow she says as the new year draws near.<br><br>She strips from her dress seductively ( The breasts seems to bigger i guess it due the wonders of modern technologly - Wonderbra) and steps out of her g-strings. Yes I like what I see,my little friend starts to response accordingly, I stripped quickly and She led me to the showers.<br><br>She prepares the water and test if it Ok and starts to shower with me and use her body foam. She stand in front of me as apply the foam all over me , rubbing her hands over my body and washes my brother ( retracting my foreskin and soaping me) and washes my ass with soap.She moves behind me<br>and rubs her soft wet body behind me and caresss my now hard prick in her soft hands.  She then stroke my prick and washes it well. She then move in front of me and kneels down with her mouth full of hot water and starts to suck my prick with the water (hot water bbJ).The feeling is great like you have gone to another place and I kinda of shivers.She looks at me while she continues to lick and suck me hard and fast. She then proceed to lead me out of the shower as we dry ourselves.<br><br>She ask me to sit at the edge of the bed while she kneels before me, She proceed to continue to finish what she started in the shower. She holds my testicles in her hands while she mouths my stiff hard bigh cock. She use her tongue to lick my cockhead and suck me hard, She ask me to stand while whe proceeds with her excellent cocksucking skills, She moves her mouth and wet wet lips in and out of my<br>cock while she caress my body all over and moves her hands on my breasts.<br><br>She ask me to lay down on bed she continues to tease me with her mouth and kisses me and lick my body all over , She spreads my legs open with bended at the knees giving her full access to my hard stiff cock.She starts her magic again by slowing licking the shaft of my cock and moving over the head and starts from the base of my cock and move up. My cock is became harder and strains again the foreskin and she stabs her tongue into my asshole and licks me with her wet wet tongue, I could barely control myself while she assaults her again again again with her tongue. I want eat you I want to lick your sweet sweet pussy as we moved in 69 position. I stick out my tongue and touched the outer lips of her V, I stopped at the entrance and admired at the view before me ( She smells lovely and almost hairless).I proceed with lash my tongue into her wet wet hole. She moans quietly as I lick her to perfection,She starts to moan louder and louder as I pleasured her again and again.She suck me hard and deep while I lick and suck her wet pussy.<br><br>I want you in me ,She says. I want yor hard stiff cock in her as she slips the condom in me with her mouth.Yes I want you too I say in my lousy mandarin. She lays down with her legs open wide as I stroke my hard cock and eases myself into her. Yes Yes she say as I push my big bulbous head slowly into her.Fuck me Fuck me She says as I held her legs wide open and started to pump her slowly at first and then increasing my tempo. She arches herself to allow me to impale her deeper and deeper.<br><br>I want fuck you good I say as I lifted her off the bed while she clings onto me. I adjusted my grip on her hugged her tight with her legs wide open in standing position, I always enjoy this position with her as she is quite light. In and Out as I push and pull myself into her, abd Faster Faster she says I am feeling very high I want to fuck me faster and faster. I moved in response to her pleading as she slides herself in and out of her. We both came together and I slowly lowered her onto the bed.<br><br>She gives me smile as she enjoyed her sessions with me and gives me soft massage and we both shower and left.<br></div>
