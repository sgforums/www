For example some will tell you that their shampoo/toothpaste/soap do not contain certain chemicals commonly found in regular products that are suppose to be harmful to the human body, cause cancer, or other terminal diseases. Others will sell health products and claim that the more commonly available products are bad for you. Don't want to go to details here. Too much to write and after than kena flamed by supporters of MLM.<br><br>All in all, claims remain just claims. As much as some of these claims carry testimonies from various "medical authorities", they do not sit well with the government recognised authorities. You may wish to do a search here in SGforums for MLM or Multi-Level Marketing and see the amount of emotions put in by people who support MLM.<br><br>On common argument put up on such products are that there is a conspiracy theory by government health authorities and drug companies, and together, they place harmful products in the market.<br><br>Then there is the ridiculous claim that you can make quick money. Don't fall for this.<br><br>Glad you are planning a second child. You do not need lots of money to have children if you are frugal enough. Most importantly, do not compare yourself against those who have.<br><br>PM me if you want to chat about family. Take care.</div>
