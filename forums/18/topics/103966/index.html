More and more people on the internet aren't checking their spelling, it's either that they just can't spell or they think that it's customary to introduce Simplified English when typing on the internet (By the way, I hate simplified Chinese). It's not like SMS-ing where letters and characters are limited; people are just becoming plain lazy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>But there's not much we can do about it, though. ENGRISH IS becoming the NU LANGUAGE, COS GANGSTA TALK is something we should aspire towards, and Mortal Kombat would've been called Mortal Combat if someone w/o friggin' 'TUDE had been proof-reading.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>14_boy, I know how you feel, but some people think 'attitude' can be achieved through deliberate illiteracy (me being one of them more than occasionally  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> ), and you'll just have to forgive those who can't spell for sh*t. Acknowledge that they do exist, but don't get angry about them, worrying is no use and will only serve to keep you cranky. As long as Homo sapien sapiens live on, unintentional and deliberate wieldings of dylexia will endure (through poor education and adolescence).<br><br>Cheers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>p.s. - Everyone is free to point out any spelling errors in my topic, I will be more than happy to fix them up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>p.s.s - Were you supposed to spell "Out raging a 14 year old's modesty?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Because when I read it I actually mis-read 'Out raging' as 'Out raping', the first time. Probably because I was looking for the word 'outrage', which spelt as only one word; and because you used the word 'rapist' earlier, so I just made the connection absent-mindedly; and because the word 'rape' is actually quite suitable metaphorically, and would function nicely as a motif for depicting the whole ethically-alternate nature of the whole topic.<br><br>p.s.s.s - Oops, sorry about p.s.s. I'm typing this late at night, and it reminded me of the 'rushing-the-next-day-assignment' scenario, which was both nostalgic and inspirational at the same time, that's why I typed that thing above (Don't worry if you don't get it...).</div>
