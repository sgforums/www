            <div class='col-md body'>another thing to point out is SCDF never do enough boundary cooling and like the fire engine don't have enough pressure in pumping water. Never check was the fire engine connected to the fire hydrant or not. but the amount of water they used was not enough!!! its a residential blk! u must prepare to do boundary cooling to contain the fire asap and extinguish it! fire will spread upward easier than to the side. later if the floor of the unit directly above kena hit up, it will catch fire and keep on spreading!!! isee some senior officer and i think the commander of the fire stn also came down, got some young specky oc and got a few young female senior officers. Sigh!!! All very young!!! Got some old ah pek looking at the way they kalan kaboh and act cool, shaked their head and said "mana a sai ani kuan!!!" and some bystander laughing at the c.o.c.k up!!! like when the fireman was spraying water, the water came out like guys shooting sperm!!! shoot a few time and die off. They claimed we are ready for terrorist!!! not even ready to fight fire and its the basic for them to fight fire.</div>
