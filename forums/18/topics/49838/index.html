            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I don't have such experience and I certainly don't wish to have such experiences.<br><br>But I have guy friends who tell me that they are sexually active with their ex but, suddenly their ex broke up with them and within a short time got married with another guy.<br><br>I am sure there is some point before breakup where the girls already have a lot of second thoughts and maybe already line-up their next bf but still date with their current bf. And since they are sexually active, they would be having sex up to the last moment as my guy frends are completely unaware that their exs are going to leave them. That is what I am getting at.<br><br>I also have a frend's frend which is a guy and who still have sex with the ex after they broke up. They will like that for a period of time even after the girl met someone new. Of course ultimately they stop doing it....<br><br>I think this is really very "unfair" to the new bf who is completely in the dark. I guess there are all kinds of people in this world.<br><br></div>
