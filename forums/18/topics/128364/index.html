            <div class='col-md body'>Jerry and I were both teachers met at work and had been dating for four years.Though we would hug and kiss during our courtship, we didn't believe in pre-martial sex.<br><br>We soon got married and were looking forward to our honeymoon at a romantic beach resort. Jerry and I just couldn't wait to seal the union on the first night.<br><br>I wasn't nervous during foreplay. In fact, when Jerry kissed and touched me, it helped me to relax. But just as things started heating up, I became nervous and uncomfortable because I could sense that Jerry was struggling to penetrate me. The pain in my vagina got worse the harder he tried and finally, he asked in desperation : "Help me."<br><br>But I couldn't, the thought of a pen|s entering my vagina frightened me to bits.. I've always imagined penetration to be painful.How can an erect pen|s enter a vagina which is half its size or smaller?<br><br>This goes on until it became very frustrating for the both of us. I felt that I'd been denied the right to enjoy sex and Jerry became increasingly angry. Though he was able to relieve himself through masturbation, he felt abnormal to be married and still have to do it.<br><br>Soon, sex became a taboo in our marriage books and we soon started drifting apart. We both kept to ourselves, but deep down in our hearts, all we wanted to ask each other was, " waht's wrong with us?"<br><br>For a year, Jerry and I would disagree and quarrel over the slightest things, until we finally came to a crossroads. The question was : Break up or stay together? It was Jerry who broke the impasses when he lovingly declared no matter how frustrated he was about not having a normal sex life, he still love me and stay with me. We then decided that if we couldn't have sex, we could still help each other orgasm during foreplay.<br><br>But still, it ws not the best solution, as both Jerry and I wanted at least two kids. Crazy as it sounds, Jerry twice tried ejaculating into a cup and pouring the semen into my vagina to get me pregnant.<br><br>When that didn't work, we consulted gynaecologists. One recommended surgery to widen my vagina while the other insisted on counselling as a solution.<br><br>I hated the idea of another man touching me, but I gritted my teeth and decided to go ahead with it. Every week ,my gynaewould insert a finger or two into my vagina while teaching me how to breathe and control my vagina muscles to ease the pain. I was so embarrassed each time but I tried to tell myself it was just physical examination.<br><br>On our own, Jerry and I also did the finger exercise for six months. But when it comes to the real thing, I froze again. Extremely frustrated, we decided to consider more drastic measures.<br><br>Finally, Jerry suggested we try artificial insemination. It was a simple procedure as Jerry just had to masturbuate into a container and the doctor would use a syringe to inject sperm into me.<br><br>I wasn't hopeful as the chance of conceiving was low. But I was ready to try anything to fufil our wish for a family.<br><br>Six months later, after our fourth try, I was beginning to lose faith. But Jerry assured me that he would stick by my side no matter what. Adoption was not on the plate as we wanted to keep our hopes alive.<br><br>Then came the good new: I was pregnant! A caesarean was a possibility, but my doctor advised me to deliver my kid naturally as there are less risk involved and it would help stretch my vagina further.<br><br>I finally delievered our baby naturally and seeing this enormous baby come out of me put the size of Jerry's pen|s in perspective. Also, my vagina was stretched by birth.<br><br>Many months later, we finally consummated our marriage and I can never forget the look on Jerry's face when we finally succeeded, he was estatic.<br><br>Now, our baby had grown up and we're planning to get her a lil' sibling to play with. This time, I intend to do it the natural way.</div>
