            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on a lot of factors.<br>First tradition dictates the convention to follow and hence the 'right' thing to do or expect. Defy and face discrimination, face social pressure one inevitably will. Human tends to wanna fit in. Unless the rewards for defecting from the norm is great enough, or if the persons involved  have been conditioned enough to buffer the negative effects in their lives coming from outside the family, or that the persons are siao ding dong like that Joo Chiat family, then shod be no problem.<br></div>
