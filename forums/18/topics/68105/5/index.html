Maybe if you lived in Australia longer than four years you will realise this.   You may think you are having a fun time right now but once you enter the corporate world it will be totally different.  The honeymoon will end.

Thank you for your advice which wasn't much relevance.<br><br>And oh, i know i am a chinese. I've never had an English name even when i was in a catholic school for 10 years. Smallpanda.. do you have an english name? $10 bet on that you have one.<br><br>I doubt that honeymoons last for like 4 years. Or in Ged's case, 8 years.

Are you saying that every average person can afford to be educated overseas? Overseas education is an elite sport. Not singaporean I knew over here had to work to support their living expenses.<br><br>What has it got to do with what Uni i graduated from or even if i do have a bachelors?
