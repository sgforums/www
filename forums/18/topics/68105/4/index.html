First, I can easily think of 10 top professionals, doctors, lawyers and accountants amongst them, who all left Singapore because being an "elite" in Singapore was still too constricting and did not allow them to develop their careers to their full potential.<br><br>As for the second point, I have been in Australia's corporate world since 1997, while I was doing my Honours year.  For an expansion, read the "Casual Jobs in Sydney" thread in the Speaker's Corner forum.  I don't know where you got your idea that Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong are the only places where oversaes Chinese can really make it, but from personal expeirence I'll tell you right now that you're dead wrong.  I have never had any trouble having my merits recognised, either in Melbourne or Los Angeles.<br><br>Persoanlly, I believe that if you enter an environment where you assume that you are discriminated against, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: YOU generate that discrimination against yourself.<br><br>As for not forgetting that one is Chinese, I agree.  However, I wouldn't go to the other end of the scale and get too hung up on it.</div>

The brain drain involves the loss of people who are in a position to contribute to Singapore's future, in a leadership capacity.  Sure, this may be a government scholar, but at the same time it may be someone who quit school after the O levels and set up a successful business.<br><br>What these people have in common, in fact the key to their  leadership potential, is their ability to open their minds and see the way forward so that they can lead the way.<br><br>Contrary to this is closed-mindedness, by which people jump to conclusions because the topic is something they are either unwilling or unable to consider in a clear, objective manner, instead being blinded by their own biases.  This closed-mindedness is what is driving the brain drain, and that kind of mentality is reflected in the racist and sexist posts in this thread.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 2centsworth:</div><div class="quote_body">Elites tend to go to the U.S or U.K, not Australia.

But if you change the word a bit the profanity filter may not work properly, so the rules of this forum say that you cannot use words like "s-l_u-t" to get the bad words to show up on the screen.

I really should have realised that my point wouldn't have gotten through to the likes of you.  After all, simpletons need to be spoon fed.  Ah well, let's try this again.<br><br>Ah boy, you cannot be so naughty one leh.  The rules say that you cannot try to subvert the profanity filter.  You see ah, the profanity filter looks out for bad words that you write and then changes it to something like $%^$, so that people reading cannot see the bad word.  But if you change the word a bit the profanity filter may not work properly, so the rules of this forum say that you cannot use words like "s-l_u-t" to get the bad words to show up on the screen.

It's obvious that your upbringing is that of one of the lower life forms, so unless there's a leash that can be pulled to choke you, there's really no point trying to explain anything to you.  I just pity your mother and all of the fairer sex whose misfortune it is to come across your pathetic ways.</div>
