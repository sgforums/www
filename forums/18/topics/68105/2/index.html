            <div class='col-md body'>Jus a reminder... tis topic is abt "Chinese Spore girl prefer Indians"<br>PPl please stay focus &amp; dun change or drag the subject too far by involving other raciist talks. 2 me tis is a topic of dating or marriage between chinese &amp; indian.(Full Stop!)<br>Is not about racial hatre!<br><br>The indian are welcome to give comments of their dislikes about chinese in tis, we take tis as an open discussion... maybe it can help us 2 better understand each other culture, why not!?<br><br>We can study, play, work and live together in harmony, but inter-marriage is abit different &amp; sensative &amp; it is between family to family issues... &amp; let not mistaken it as racial.<br><br>Example ONly : IF my children want 2 marry an indian, I may object, but after sometime if they still strongly insist, I will let them be... I may be unhappy of coz, but please note this becoz I may be conservative or tradition but definitely not racist!!<br><br>I believe in every races, everybody also have some kind of dislike abt their own races. Anyway stick to this topic... marriage is a personal &amp; family issue not racism.</div>
