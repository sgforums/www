They took census from a large sample of participants lar.  I read b4 last time 2001 census they took from at least 1000 ppl lor, all random ppl.  It was an internet vote, where ppl just go their webpage and click.  Dun think those "working executives" so free got so much time to click lor.  They dun even have time to screw liao, where got want to go waste time clicking.  Most likely is ppl like u (but not saying you ar) that got more free time to come forums and post, that got more time to go click.  But still results like sai.<br><br>I suspect mebbe becuz s'pore got a lot of young kids and teenagers use comupters, esp horny adoloscents like to go surf <a href="http://www.durex.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.durex.com</a> for curiousity. Most likely they still virgin lor.  The only sex partner they have is their hand lor.  So when these ppl take part in the poll, it pulls our national average down.  But then again, i'm not saying most or all ppl who were surveyed are kiddos, just suggesting this could be a source of result dip.<br><br>Of course it's natural to suggest that S'poreans too caught up in the rat race of money-making, too stressed and tired, thus resulting in the nation-wide low result. Poolman, congrats for your active sex life, but i dun think other ppl may be as sexually active as you.  Dun assume you represent the whole population.  Btw just curious what's your occupation?  It's amazing u could maintain a 21-day per month sex-life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Letter From Singapore: Sex and the Single Singaporean </span></span><br><br><strong>Despite loosening controls, sex presents an area for improvement </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">By Sonia Kolesnikov-Jessop</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">NEWSWEEK INTERNATIONAL </span><br><br>Oct. 20 issue Â— ItÂ’s official. Singaporeans are not getting much. Shame of shame, the latest annual global sex survey by condom-maker Durex revealed that, once again, weÂ’re at the bottom of the league, managing to get in the sack a paltry 96 times a year, compared with the HungariansÂ’ 152. Worse, things are not improving: we made love 14 times less last year. Of course, IÂ’m sure the Hungarians are exaggerating. But 96 times a year is still twice a week. Ah, how well I remember sex in the city-state has become quite a newsy topic of late, with the seeming loosening of controls on everything from bar-top dancing to all-night partying. Heck, Singapore is even starting to emerge as a gay entertainment hub, with gay-friendly clubs, bars and saunas, even though homosexual acts are still outlawed.<br><br>Still, weÂ’ve got a problem. A recent survey revealed that nearly half of SingaporeÂ’s singles would prefer watching television, reading or meeting friends to having sex. WhatÂ’s going to happen when theyÂ’re married? How will they have the requisite two kids? This year weÂ’re heading for the lowest number of births in 26 years, a mere 37,000. For a small country like Singapore, whose only resource is its people, not wanting Â“itÂ” translates directly into a sexo-geopolitical crisis. What to do?<br><br>Enter Â“Dr. Love.Â” In a country often criticized for its lack of creativity in most matters, let alone affairs of the heart, Dr. Wei Siang Yu has risen to the challenge. Three years ago, this baby-faced sex guru set up Meggpower, a health-promotion company that puts new wireless technology to reproductive use. Say a woman wants to have a baby. She signs up with Meggpower, which maps her monthly cycle. When sheÂ’s due to ovulate, the company flashes her an e-mail (call it a hormonalgram) complete with tips on diet and fitness.<br><br>As it turns out, this 34-year-old bachelor (Â“I havenÂ’t met the right woman yetÂ”) is a mine of information. Now, IÂ’m an informed mother of two, but would I have known it takes three months for a cell to transform into a healthy, swimming sperm? This means that if your man has been boozing for weeks, only a radical lifestyle change can give his sperm a new lease on life. SingaporeÂ’s problem, says the good doctor, is too much emotional repression, not enough touching and too much concern for what the neighbors might think. Â“I know people who would like to use vibrators, but donÂ’t dare because itÂ’s too loud.Â”<br><br>He offers solutions to such pressures. One is the iDream love-boat program, where stressed-out couples are ferried by yacht to a nearby luxury resort for a weekend of passionÂ—aphrodisiac delights and sensual pleasures included! (Think massages and body mapping.) HeÂ’s even extended the concept to singles, usually 15 of each sex per trip. ItÂ’s to Â“help them mingle,Â” says Wei, Â“mingleÂ” clearly being a Singlish euphemism.<br><br>November will bring yet another ventureÂ—the first Baby Planning Camp, all about how to be BabySmart. For a mere Â“$316 per person on twin-share basis,Â” couples can study fertility management, meditation and nutrition with anti-oxidant recipes. Personally, IÂ’m not sure sleeping in separate beds is really the best position for conception.<br><br>Maybe IÂ’m just old-fashioned, but I wonder what all the fuss is about. As I see it, young Singaporeans arenÂ’t not conceiving because of a lack of sex, but simply because they donÂ’t want to. In the pursuit of the famous five CÂ’sÂ—career, car, condominium, credit card and club membershipÂ—letÂ’s face it: a small B might not be the best play.</div>
