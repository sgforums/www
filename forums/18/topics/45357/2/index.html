From what I see, romantic love usually doesn't last very long between couples. After marriage, the 'love' turns more into mutual trust and respect. Also read somewhere that there's where kids come in. With children, both parties would have a common goal to strive for and hence keep the marriage together.<br><br>Therefore I feel that if any party can't accept their gf/bf's past, a break would be most appropriate. All this stuff on if you really love her you should accept her past and all that is usually unsustainable in the long-run. As stated in some of the previous posts, a person's past is important as that determines his/her present state and has a great influence on his/her future. It would also be a guage on the person's character and moral integrity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, it seems to me everyone likens someone who is not a virgin is someone who sleeps around. However, if the girl or even guy, for that matter, sleeps only with his/her partnet, then I think its OK. Look at it this way. You are currently having sex with your partnet (not married). So, it doesn't make any sense if you do not accept that person initially just because he/she is not a virgin. One more thing, a non virgin does not equal someone who sleeps around, if they only sleep with the partner they once love.<br>As for the question, I don't have any sexual history to hide. And, I don't know if I mind if my bf is not a virgin.</div>
