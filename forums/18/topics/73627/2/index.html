Good things ought to be share right ? No guys will think one girl is enough maybe having two or three could be a good thing . My theory is one can fool around and have as many gf as he wants before he gets married . Eg . One is not feeling well today , we can always move off to the second or third gf for companion right . In the olden days in china , the king can have up to 3000 wife am i right so what is my 2 or three girls compared to him . I tried to be faithful and stick to one girl but it didn't work so of course i can't carry on my mistake right guys ?
