In case you wonder, ears are one of the more sensitive points of the body. Just leave you fingers lingering around them..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>ONe qns. Why do you want to make him high? Are you intending to do "IT" with him? if not, I somehow pity the guy coz he wants to protect you and control so hard. haha. Girl, you must be real h*rny to think about such an idea. Perhaps you can tell him you want then dun need to arouse. Guys are typical, they'll just be aroused even when you are not seducing them. Now I know why guys tell me "Alot of girls also h*rny one lor. Not guys only."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></span></div>
