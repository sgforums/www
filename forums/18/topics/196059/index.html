The issue here is on whether u can grasp the person's character. Any changes are longer term so they don't fall into the picture. So yes I believe within one month of knowing each other, its possible to know the other person very well. I do not equate knowing the other person very well to having physically gone all the way though. But it is quite possible for both to happen, and personally I would say that within this past 2 weeks I've gotten to know someone very well, and if it wasn't because I'm physically away, its quite possible that we would have physically gone most if not all the way within 1 month.</div>
