Feeling quite confuse whether is she true towards me or is she just wanting my company when her bf is not around. Wanted to take good care of her, trying to get intimate is to see whether is she true towards me. Cos I can't find any other better way to ask her. I was hurt by a girl before thus I dun really trust my 'so called' gf.<br><br>Sometimes, I'm so troubled by this that I actually behave as if I dun treasure her when I'm with her. This is a very bad situation for me as it is not my intention to do this.

            <div class='col-md body'>To be frank, I think the cause of me being hot and cold toward her could be due to my sense of insecurity in this relationship. Haiz, dun really know wat she wants, she did not really say when she will breakup with her current bf. And her current bf treat her very well too, paid for her hp bill etc. Whereas I paid for her leisure when we go out together and buy her things that she want. Her bf is a regular in the army thus seldom have a chance to accompany her.<br><br>All I really want is a true love but I dun really know whether i've chosen the right path. I feel even more guilty cos i know her current bf, a very nice guy who always give in to her even though she have a couple of record in having a fling with other guys.<br><br>I dun really know whether is her feeling abt me is true, she say that there is a possibility that she will break off with her current bf but did not say when. But a couple of mths ago, she nearly broke off with her current bf for another guy. Why can't she do the same for me if she say that she love me too.
