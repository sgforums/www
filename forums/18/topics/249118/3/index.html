My believe is... even if someone was to be so thirsty or even to the extend to make a toilet bowl clean, they wouldn't resort to that inhumane measure. Would you do it? l <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I wouldn't. Unless due to circumstances to such as being forced.<br><br>With regards on the fight on individuals inside a cell, yeah... that's not surprising. Even those triad members in SG have scapegoats going into prison... just to protect some fellow important member from being surrounded by rivals. Well, it may sound absurd but it's true. Both in SG and other countries. I believed you might have seen this in those HK or Taiwanese show about prison inmates. Just the likes.<br><br>As for the police, who hates the inmates just because they cause intentional hurt to police... It might be true in other countries but not in SG. From what i know guards will be more harsh to cellmates who commited dangerous offences but to those 1st timers usually don't.<br><br>For MPs, they have some inspiring stories in the past which i heard from my uncle's time. Apart from the corrupted cops you see today in TVs, esp HK shows, they made a impression in my head after hearing the stories. Just one of them to share. Back in the 70s or 80s. Forget the HDB flats and terrace house, it's back to atap roof where commoners live. It's told that several gang fights in SG exist back then, laws were there but still fights exist where bloodbath is often shed whereby the common "Parang" is used. Once the tussle in street involve a group of triads hurling themselves at the MPs with "Parangs" and of course, the MPs fought back. Now here's the catch. Yes they used "Parangs".. too but, they did not slash or cut like the triads did. They used ONLY the hilt of the knife to injure, not once utilising the blade. I don't know how it sounds to you but indeed they projected that Polices are there not to harm but to subdue the crowd to me. This made a heartfelt impression about MPs, therefore my respect to them.. only some lol.<br><br>Infact i could share the exp in DB. Those who went thru NS would somehow have a disliking to MPs( Military Po****). But they're not that bad actually except they "book" (the term used when they take out their handy red books)you when you're performing disorderly. Back in DB, you see another face which is hidden to most army personnel, their compassionate side. Known to many offenders who sat behind bars, those who guard the cells are quite amicable. They chat with you, sometimes entertain "ah bengs" nonsense to an extend... but only some not all.<br><br>Life in the cell (which is abt twice the size of a 5room HDB flat toilet), was simple. Writing letters which is once a month (can't really recall), exercising, reading books (in cell), sleeping and carrying sandbags(it's a term whereby all inmates fall-in and do quick march around the basketball court with Helmet, Full Backpack, t-shirt &amp; shorts, army boots and carrying sandbags). Breakfast would be hefty (a loaf of 7 piece white bread), egg, sausage/chicken patty. It's kinda funny when i used to this. Everytime after the loafs of bread i would get too bloated and saved the eggs for later snacks. Put it up on the window (which is what we call "slit" cos it's a small horizontal slit to view the outside world). Oh and of course in the wee hours of the morning... you could smell the pungent smell of fertilisers from the chicken farms away from there. Gosh, it's darn pungent i tell you, esp in the early morning when u r half awake.<br><br>What i heard now is that the exercising part which is inside the cell now is forbidden and less of the quick march. They get less opportunity to expose their eyes to the outside world now. For reasons i can't disclose. Lol. Well don't have to get me PM you, i really can't... i'm putting myself in a situation to be arrested for disclosing military info lol. Well that's for DB.<br><br>Oh yes... to your question where DB is... formerly near an ulu part of Kranji which was concealed from the civilian eyes, only to a neighbour camp. Don't ask me the road name cos when i was being arrested, i was inside a GP car reviewing my mistakes, flashbacks. Straight into the DB i got to a few procedures that i'm sure maybe fellow friends here who have friends in DB or prison knows. Now the new DB, is at the new Kranji camp which is home for Armour and perhaps Arti i think. The former Armour was at Sungei Gedong (where i was arrested). The new Kranji camp with DB by it's side would make all those army guys behaving on their toes lol, any mistake just march you straight in less than 200 meters away.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A decade or so back, I think in the Eighties, there was this Bedok serial rapist. Raped several women who worked and came home late at night.
