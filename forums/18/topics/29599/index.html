            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys. I'm a newbie here, currently servin NS. Couple of months to ORD. I really need some advice here.I got to know this girl thru my penpal at her birthday bash. We got together and that was the time I enlisted to the army. Although we only met up on the weekends,we never felt any gap between the 2 of us. Just 3 weeks b4 my POP, she left back to Jak to visit her family.I saw her off with tears in my eyes at the airport, in my smart 4, jus b4 I booked in. I told her to call me when she reached home. The call never came. I spent the whole sun nite waitin for her call and whole wk of riskin confinement carryin my hp where ever i go. Still no call yet. When i booked out, somethin jus snapped n I went to GL, together wif my friends. A wk later, my friend told me that she wanted to break off wif me cos of parents' objection. I was truly devasted. Jus recently tt I found out that she knew abt the GL thing. That's why she broke off wif me. Futhermore all this while I've been thinkin that she like my friend cos she did call me up to ask me wat r the chances of she n my friend gettin together after we broke off. It was jus a cover-up. To make me blame her and hate her. Jus cos of she didn't wan me 2 know that she knows abt the GL visit.<br>To me, I can't face her now. Too shameful to do so. Deep inside somewhere, I know that I still love her very much n wan to spend my life wif her. Wat should I do. I've betrayed her trust.<br>Seriously speakin, I never have sex that nite at GL. All in my mind was her. After that I bulls*** my friend and told him sex was great. She called my friend n someone beside his hp blurted out that i with a pro now. He did try to cover up but... I deserved to get dumped.<br>So guys, I really need yr advice. U can call me a s***head, d***head, a p***y, a w**p, an a**hole and all sorts of names but I really need some advuce now. Should I face up to reality n 4get abt her or do wat I can do to win her back? To this friend of mine who i miscuely hated wif my ex, Sorry Bro. It was afterall me that I should hate...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is sad to hear what happen... i really dunno what i should advise... as long as u still have feelings for her.. go for it.. because going to GL..n being misunderstood by your gf... i guess its not easy to explain to her..even though if u really didn't 'do' with a pros.. i guess gals will not believe u. Maybe when she cooled down, try calling her..talk to her.. n see if e relationship can be salvaged.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Dun say you dun have courage la, duno how to face her la , just stop that, those are excuses you are giving yourself.
