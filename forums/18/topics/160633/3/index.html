They have set that people who's ancestors originally from china are called chinese, and they set it the word 'chinese' can mean race also, so be it. Let me repeat, English are set by the native White man, not by you. Don't change the fact.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I got prove that i'm chinese, that my ancestors were from china and we haven't lost the track yet. I still have my relative in china. We are biological relative. My Grandfather was from a village called Ming Cheng in Foochow Province. My grandfather's brother are still there. If my grandfather's brother is chinese and I'm blood connected with him, can I suddenly be a malay or indian? or just singaporean?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This thread was a rather entertaining read. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Some of you didnt seem to realise your answers are probably as taboo as the thread starter's comments.<br><br>"Chinese" dosent just mean a nationality. It could mean a race, an ethnicity (two different issues there), a language, a culture, and so on. How one chooses to define his chineseness is for himself to evaluate.<br><br>Mongolians arent only from Mongolia. Ethnic Mongols can of coz be found in other contries, unless you refer only to the nationality of Mongolians.<br><br>I personally consider myself a Singaporean Chinese: a Singaporean with Chinese roots. I swear by my land of birth, and I cherish it for allowing me to retain my Chinese heritage. I would certainly hope our minority races feel the same way, for I am also particularly sensitive towards the issue of Chinese chauvinism.</div>

I have yet to see a significant number of "young man in china" appearing in most English-language forums thou, where Singaporeans manage to dominate and carve out a niche of their own.<br><br>Singaporeans dont claim to be superior in Chinese compared to Chinese Mainlanders, and we dont claim to be on par or better then native English speakers. Does this bother you that much? I would certainly love to watch the faces of the Mainland Chinese and the Englishmen when Singaporeans erupt boisterously in their own language...Singlish. You have an issue with Singlish too, I suppose?</div>
