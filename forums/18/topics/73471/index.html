            <div class='col-md body'>I hear what you're saying, but self-employment still falls under the same trap as any other form of employment: you stop working and you can kiss that cash flow goodbye.  Granted, you probably get two to three times as much as you would than if you were someone else's employee, but at the end of the day, if the party's over, you've got three times as much to lose.<br><br>On the other hand, if you're an investor (we're not talking about some nickel-and-dime chump change put into the stock market here - we're talking about REAL investment), you don't actually have to perform work to get the income - that's where the fun really starts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't take me the wrong way, sv3n.  I'm doing exactly what you're talking about right now, but for me, it's just the start.  In my view, creating something that belongs to you just for the sake of it is a matter of ego.  Make no mistake about it - if you're going to start a business, there is only one essential: you MUST make a profit.  It never makes any sense if you're going to pay to do something for somebody - I've seen my previous bosses do it before, and it's a painful sight.<br><br>Making something out of yourself is nice, but it's way overrated.  I finished a doctorate and immediately got more than 70 grand a year for 4 hours' work, 5 days a week, while I surfed the net the rest of the time - mind you, I could have gone for 95 grand, but then I'd have to do some real work.  That just bored the hell out of me, and right now, I don't just want to set up my own company, I want to go for the real money.<br><br>What I'm talking about is leverage.  Is an hour of your effort going to generate $20 or $2000?  It's entirely up to you how you want to play it.  Are you going to run a provision shop and make 50 cents on your 1000 sales every month, or are you going to run a chain and make 10 cents on your 100,000 sales every month?  Either way, you've created a company that is yours, but make no mistake about it - running that company is going to take a whole lot of hard work.  Are you going to make it financially worthwhile for yourself to put up with the work you have to do?<br><br>I understand what you want to do and I think it's a good thing.  Just make sure that you're not one of those poor sods who goes under in a few years, just because you didn't understand the nature of the beast you're dealing with.</div>

It takes lots of self discipline and planning too. One great thing is you get to plan your own schedule but in order for it to be rewarding, you probably have to work harder. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
