How do they know if the browser will really not buy? Based on their experience? Bollocks.<br><br>One of my pet peeves is being treated like I have no right to browse if I do not intend to buy. Women do it all the time - I mean browsing w/o buying but it doesn't mean they won't buy at all. It's just that they have not found something that they like.<br><br>Even if they don't buy, they will remember your good service and will recommend friends/relatives to your shop.<br><br>OK, assuming the owner is right abt the browser not buying, he would be a big fool to chase him out of the shop. Doesn't he know tt potential customers tend to wonder into shops that have people browsing the goods? (Herd mentality or this-shop-must-be-good thinking?)<br><br>A shop w/o a single shopper is a turn-off. This is especially true for eating establishments/hawker stalls. In fact, hawkers who have no customers for longer than normal duration sometimes prepares the food although no one ordered anything. This is to create an illusion that he is busy fulfilling orders, so other customers will walk in.<br>Next time when you buy food from a hawker/restaurant, notice this: before you ordered, there is always no one buying. Once you ordered your food, many other customers will walk in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not just the foot massager booth... a lot of the booths the exhibition helpers also very unpro and rude...<br><br>i was shopping for a new laptop and when i went to the IBM booth near the entrance, the sales-person was very helpful at first, but when i told him i needed some time to weigh the pros and cons cos i really needed something very specific for my work and there are several models that sounds good to me, he was like "yeah right..." and walked off...<br><br>i mean... yah lah... i'm sure they get commission and stuff, but this kinda attitude is really a major turn-off... i never say i dowan to buy, but i really did not want to buy from THAT salesperson after that...<br></div>
