I've been there before... Actually quite alot of people recommended that place to me in the past, but I really don't see the point? The place was full of mosquitoes waiting to feed on 'heart-warming' couples like ourselves.... Think it is really at the hill top where there're quite a couple of seats that couples started to 'do things'..... On the way up the hill some of the places are also 'quite nice', but me and my girl tried to sit on a flight of stairs (the place is really quite dark and nice) when everything started out fine... THEN, we were ATTACKED by GIANT ANTS.... GOD.... An experience that made us always THINK TWICE before we would have the idea of making out up the hill again... I must say ALOT of other parks would have scored BETTER.....<br>I agree that the top of flats (bottom also if it's late enough at night) and in lift or lift lobby are really quite nice places to be.... Staircases in flats, some shopping centres, car parks could be idea places too.... &lt;- BUT ALWAYS look out for that CAMERA!!! Roof tops at 'some buildings'.... Think the 'best place' you've mentioned is a HOTEL lah.... Or perhaps someone's home? Kissing out with the girl on your lap could be a very nice feeling too!!!<br>Toilets can actually be really great place if ya happened to find the right ones... Like.... Isolated in a way, the toilet should be quite clean.... &lt;- Most idea if ya can lock the WHOLE toilet from INSIDE.... Then you and your partner can enjoy the whole place, which is really 'something'.... I like to have my girl on the sink most of the time as toilet sink usually can be provide quite a large area for her to sit and I could also use the mirror and the water from the tap to 'tease' her... ;PPP<br><br>Nakata&gt; Telephone booth??? Think ya can only think about it when the place's REALLY ISOLATED and it's really quite late at night...<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

I know how ya felt about the peeping stuff.... Once I was with a girl at an isolated playground (at least we thought so?). There were only couples in that park and it was quite late in the night. Halfway through our petting, I heard some noises, then realised that 2 Malay guys were masturbating themselves just underneath where we were!!! I yelled at them and they ran off into the bushes.... One good thing was that nothing could really be seen UNLESS they wanna see me?? The girl got quite upset about it..... Hmm... Guess we were really too engrossed? That place was actually quite 'open' in a sense... But I thought we should have noticed if anybody approach us? Guess we didn't? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">PPP<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
