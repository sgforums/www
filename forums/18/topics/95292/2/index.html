What would you say if I or someone else declared how ridiculous, for whatever reasons, it is to not have sex till we get married?  Both are right yet both also 'not so right'.  It really depends on how how you feel about it and not press your beliefs unto others.  You don't like it if people pressed you to believe their ways, do you?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div></blockquote>I asked for views as it seems like society is so open minded abt this...

Woodstock, acid, Jimmy Hendrix, The Beatles, Elvis, weed to the max, free love, hippies.  You'd be surprised if I said that was the time of social revolution, mate.  The issue you've raised has always been happening even before our grandparents were born.  It's just that it's being spoken more publicly today.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Like I always ask - lust before love or love before lust?  If you said love before lust, I'd say, 'Wow...  you mean you fall in love with a person the moment you set eyes on him/her?'  More like you were wanting to know what's it like to get all horizontal with him'her is more like it.  Chuckle...<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
