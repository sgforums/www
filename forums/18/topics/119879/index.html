            <div class='col-md body'>There was the usual crowd of pushy working girls already hanging just outside Lor 8 in the blazing afternoon sun, trying to woo the single male passer-by.. I felt lucky I had not known any of them though many of them had spotted me before.. I downed the rest of the ice-milo in a beat and briskly walked out, turning the corner to avoid any encounters..<br><br>Soon the heat hit me and I began having random thoughts while wandering the already familiar streets and alleys of Geylang.. I blamed the absence of machismo in my upbringing for my reluctance to indulge in the oldest profession.. On a more mindless note, I wondered if one could actually fry eggs, sunny side up, on the sidewalk..<br><br>In the midst of my lightheaded rambling I caught sight of a stunningly beautiful young girl.. She wore a loose floral mini dress with shoulder straps and flip-flops.. She had a delicate, slim figure with beautiful curves and smooth snowry white skin.. She looked graceful and innocent, not at all like a working girl..<br><br>Casually adjusting my pace, I began to keep her in sight.. She turned a couple of corners and paused by a storefront where she sensed my gaze from a distance.. Her eyes avoided me and for a moment she frowned in pride..<br><br>Later she walked into a budget hotel and I sat a distance away on the shady side of the street and lit a cigarette, concentrating on not inhaling.. I wondered if I would ever have the luck to meet her and if my chances would have been better had I been born rich, I would have pay for her freedom and settle in one of the sophiscated condo in district 9.. I had not yet met such a beautiful girl in my whole life..<br></div>
