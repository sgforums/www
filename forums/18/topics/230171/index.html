            <div class='col-md body'><br>One of the secrets of great manual sex is varying your hand motions. Here are a few indispensable techniques:<br><br>SWITCH HITTER<br><br>Use both hands, alternating back and forth in a pattern you develop to offer him the most arousal. He will notice the difference. Don't get into a routine where the strokes are dull, and noncommittal. Give it to him good. Get him to the point where he's singing out, "I second that hand motion!"<br><br>DOUBLE WHAMMY<br><br>How about going double or nothing! Bring both well-lubricated hands down on his shaft. Some c0cks are so big they require both hands. If your partner's doesn't, then use the other hand to caress and lightly flutter his balls, or tighten around the base of his shaft. If both hands fit along the length of the shaft, move then together, up and down, in the typical pumping motion. Pretend you're holding a baseball bat and are about to score a grand slam. You can also vary the directions of your hands, one up, one down at the same time. There's no doubt that two hands are better than one.<br><br>THE ANVIL STROKE<br><br>Bring one hand down, letting it stroke the penis from the top all the way to the bottom. When it hits the bottom, release it. Meanwhile you're bringing your corresponding hand down to the top of the shaft, creating an alternating beating motion, hence the name "anvil stroke." Think of those blacksmith duos who keep up a double beat pounding motion as they beat that rod of iron on a piping-hot anvil.<br><br>THE SHUTTLE C0CK<br><br>Not many people have heard of the "shuttle c0ck," but it's one of the best. Take the penis in both hands, fingers lightly touching the sides of the shaft. In order to visualize the position, think of yourself holding a clarinet. Now flick the penis back and forth between your two hands by holding on to the loose skin of the shaft. Shuttling it back and forth in this manner may not seem incredibly thrilling to him at first, but pretty soon, as it builds up momentum, it will drive him out of his mind. Orgasms encountered via this method are sometimes messy, but always memorable.<br><br>THE BOOKENDS<br><br>Place both of your hands side by side against his shaft like a pair of bookends. Now push hard against his penis. Then lift your hands up and down. Continue in this manner for a while. The constant tugging of the skin around the balls and the mons pubis will do the trick.<br><br>THE FLAME<br><br>Place your hands down on either side, your fingers pointing away from the c0ck. Pretend you're a campfire girl and start spinning his pecker like a stick of wood. This way you'll keep the home fires burning for a long time to come.<br><br>THE BASE CLUTCH<br><br>Tighten your thumb and forefinger around the base of the shaft, pressing down on the balls. This will cut off the blood (acting as an impromptu cock ring) and help you steady the shaft in your hand. If the skin on it is slick and immutable, you can stroke the penis with more friction, thereby enhancing the excruciating experience.<br><br>THE LOVE TUG<br><br>As you are stroking him, lightly pull on the wispy strands of pubic hair sprouting from his testicles. Don't pull so hard that you remove them, but tease them gently, lovingly. This will make him holler with delight and awe at your inventiveness.<br><br>THE TWO-TIMER<br><br>Tickle his balls with one hand while the other jerks him up and down.<br><br>THE THIGH-SWATTER<br><br>Use the hand that is currently unemployed to firmly but lovingly pat his inner thighs.<br><br>BEST FIST FORWARD<br><br>Place your fist against his perineum as you're stroking him. He'll probably start opening his legs a little wider, giving you more space to press against. Guaranteed to drive him wild.<br><br>As always, it is the psychological impact of what you are doing that makes the sex so satisfying. Let your mind escape into the uncharted wilderness of fantasy. As a sexual pioneer, it is your manifest destiny to explore the outer limits of your sensuality.<br><br>THE MILKER<br><br>Opposite of the Anvil - Hands alternate 'milking' up the penis, starting at the base and working all the way up past the tip.<br><br>THE PERPETUAL PENETRATION<br><br>Like the Anvil, but rather than just grabbing the penis at the top, let his penis 'penetrate' into your fist on each stroke. Before the head of his penis pops out of your hand, bring the other hand up for the next penetration. This way it seems to him like he is penetrating deeper and deeper into an infinite vagina. Make sure you keep the penetration continuous for best results. Try faster or slower to taste.<br><br>THE PALM SWIRL<br><br>Use your open palm to swirl around the head, the way your tongue would lick an ice cream cone. This sensitizes the head, and will make it get larger and turn (even more) red. Try reversing direction for a surprise.<br><br>TINY CIRCLES<br><br>As in "The Palm Swirl", use your open palm on his glans, but stop at each "hour of the clock", and make circular motions with your open palm. This will make this part of the head EXTREMELY sensitive, so move to the next hour after a few circles.<br><br>THE RING<br><br>Make a ring with your thumb and forefinger, and pump up and down with this ring. When you get to the top, close the ring, then make him squeeze his way in as you slide back down to the bottom.<br><br>THE DOOR KNOB<br><br>Turn the head of his penis like a you're trying to open a door knob coated with grease. It won't turn, but he may flip. Now try turning the other way. Repeat.<br><br>THE SHAFT<br><br>Stroke only his shaft, ignoring the head. You will notice it swelling and turning red. When it's bright red and rock hard, use the Door Knob, the Palm Swirl, or the Perpetual Penetration.<br><br>THE SPOT PINCH<br><br>Lightly and slowly run a finger up the under side of his c0ck. Ask him to tell you where the most sensitive spot is. Pinch it, squeeze it, nibble it, tease it. This is a good spot to pinch to turn a soft c0ck rock solid.</div>

This will make him holler with delight and awe at your inventiveness.<br><br>THE TWO-TIMER<br><br>Tickle his balls with one hand while the other jerks him up and down.<br><br>THE THIGH-SWATTER<br><br>Use the hand that is currently unemployed to firmly but lovingly pat his inner thighs.<br><br>BEST FIST FORWARD<br><br>Place your fist against his perineum as you're stroking him. He'll probably start opening his legs a little wider, giving you more space to press against. Guaranteed to drive him wild.<br><br>As always, it is the psychological impact of what you are doing that makes the sex so satisfying. Let your mind escape into the uncharted wilderness of fantasy. As a sexual pioneer, it is your manifest destiny to explore the outer limits of your sensuality.<br><br>THE MILKER<br><br>Opposite of the Anvil - Hands alternate 'milking' up the penis, starting at the base and working all the way up past the tip.<br><br>THE PERPETUAL PENETRATION<br><br>Like the Anvil, but rather than just grabbing the penis at the top, let his penis 'penetrate' into your fist on each stroke. Before the head of his penis pops out of your hand, bring the other hand up for the next penetration. This way it seems to him like he is penetrating deeper and deeper into an infinite vagina. Make sure you keep the penetration continuous for best results. Try faster or slower to taste.<br><br>THE PALM SWIRL<br><br>Use your open palm to swirl around the head, the way your tongue would lick an ice cream cone. This sensitizes the head, and will make it get larger and turn (even more) red. Try reversing direction for a surprise.<br><br>TINY CIRCLES<br><br>As in "The Palm Swirl", use your open palm on his glans, but stop at each "hour of the clock", and make circular motions with your open palm. This will make this part of the head EXTREMELY sensitive, so move to the next hour after a few circles.<br><br>THE RING<br><br>Make a ring with your thumb and forefinger, and pump up and down with this ring. When you get to the top, close the ring, then make him squeeze his way in as you slide back down to the bottom.<br><br>THE DOOR KNOB<br><br>Turn the head of his penis like a you're trying to open a door knob coated with grease. It won't turn, but he may flip. Now try turning the other way. Repeat.<br><br>THE SHAFT<br><br>Stroke only his shaft, ignoring the head. You will notice it swelling and turning red. When it's bright red and rock hard, use the Door Knob, the Palm Swirl, or the Perpetual Penetration.<br><br>THE SPOT PINCH<br><br>Lightly and slowly run a finger up the under side of his c0ck. Ask him to tell you where the most sensitive spot is. Pinch it, squeeze it, nibble it, tease it. This is a good spot to pinch to turn a soft c0ck rock solid.</div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
