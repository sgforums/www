            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kaobeikaobu:</div><div class="quote_body">ok....first to clarify, i'm nt on any side...the onli way to stop all these aimless flaming is to maybe ask d admin to make you one temporary moderator (less d bj).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ...(ok, sorry, but i just find this corny).<br><br>Yes, you raised up the problem..tts fine..but talk the talk is cheap - this thread you started ain't gng anywhere... If you can do a better job than d present one, then nobody wld ever flame u or doubt you. in other words, you r nt only justifying wat u said to d rest of d ppl but most important of all, to yourself.<br></div></blockquote>Don't worry, it is not my wish to get personal with anyone. I understand that some people may not agree with my views and that in forums, heated discusssions can occur due to difference in opinion.<br><br>However, some of the flaming came about not because of difference in opinions but rather for reasons that weren't related to the topic. It wasn't even about whether I could be a moderator or not, just plain being personal. The flaming was unnecessary just as you said, yet it happend.<br><br>I agree with you totally to be responsible for you own words. And I have never said that I wanted to be a moderator did I? And I am still saying that I do not want to be a moderator.<br><br>I do not have the commitment nor the capability to be a moderator. Neither do I have the support so being a moderator is out of the question whether I want to or not.<br><br>Talks IS cheap and that's all I'm offering. If I really wanted to change things around here I'd just go straight to being a moderator and start enforcing the kind of control I want to have in the forum. I wouldn't start a thread stating what I see as a problem in BAR when I could actually just control that problem myself. And no, I am not asking for that kind of power.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>Yes, you may protest n say ' why d need to become a moderator?'<br><br>Well, i can tell u, since you raised up d problem(whether it's true or nt) n u chose nt to leave d forum, i reckon you wld ve some constructive solutions (or maybe even one) to it. You ve got to realise tt, one nt only has to been responsible for wat he/she said but also d probable consequences or watever tt comes out of d discussion; definitely when things are getting nowhere. Since you wanted to stay on, n nobody can meet your request/requirement then take over d rein. Do you know wat i mean? Hope you don't get personal on wat i said, as i'm only directing at d matter itself.<br>Eg. when u go to work/or are working. You can't raise any issue in a meeting without being responsible for wat u said, esp when nobody can/or want to do abt it.<br><br>if you can pin-point a real problem, fine..good job...but if u can't/or dun wan to do anything abt it and so is every one else, let it be or walk away frm tt point.<br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </strong></blockquote>This is the part where I can't quite agree with you because our situation here isn't exactly the same an office scenario. In real work meeting, people aim to complete specific tasks to to get certain jobs done, hence the need to identify specific problems that hinder the group objective.<br><br>But here in the case of chatting in a forum, there is no such group with a specific or common task to work on. Hence the comparison may not really be valid in this case.<br><br>Besides, not everyone here considers the things that I have pointed out as problems. So if it's not a problem to everyone, it's not exactly something that needs to be solved either? Everyone has different opinion regarding the posts in BAR, so some of us now have just voiced them out.<br><br>Although I have 'identified' a problem, I have also made suggestions as to what could be done to change the situation of posts that occur. To repeat, my first suggestion would be to change the control or action by moderators towards posts in BAR. Another suggestion I made was to add or change the moderator so perhaps a different level of control could be put upon the forum.<br><br>I commented on something I felt that could be changed in BAR and I have also said how things could be changed, all in my first post of this thread.<br><br>I said I'd stay on in BAR but not as a moderator nor to change anything. I have only said that I choose to continue to read the posts in BAR and to post occasionally. Basically, to continue doing what I've been doing all the while.</div>
