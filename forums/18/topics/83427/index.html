            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all, not here to start a flaming war, but since there people here talking about it in so many posts, I thought why not just make it into a thread.<br><br>A number of times people have commented how threads in bar seem to start off with a certain topic but degrades into a series of off topic babbling and flaming between forumites.<br><br>Of course people have also commented how the moderator has contibuted to the lack of objectivity in all the discussions. I'm not trying to piss anybody here, but it's a fact that the activity in the BAR forum is controlled by the moderator.<br><br>However, personally, I find that the moderator herself tends to hit out at people who start topics related to sex by making sarcastic remarks and I know I'm not the only who who thinks so. Her very actions encourage others to flame those who start sex-related topics. Resulting in lots of posts that are not related to the original thread topic.<br><br>It is true that some people post really lame topics, but there are times when peole are genuinely trying to find out information or are really seeking for opinion and guidance. For example the masturbation thread by tube_girl. Started out as a girl asking about things I think lots of girls ask about and write to women's magazines about. As far as I know, it's a genuine topic if you ask me. Tube_girl may be a guy pretending to be a girl but we don't know that for sure do we?<br><br>If you ask me people like Cortez deserved all the hate from other forumites for the kind of threads he used to start, but not every person who starts a sex-related thread is a pervert or an idiot waiting to be flamed. Some people just want to chat and to talk, simple as that. Flaming wars are not on that agenda.<br><br>BAR is a forum rated <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adult</span></span>, so why shouldn't sex-related topics be here? If it's going to be nothing but chatting where no sex-related topic is allowed, then the <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adult</span></span> rating for BAR may as well be removed. It's not that I'm against FireIce or anything, but I honestly feel that maybe should let someone else take over as moderator. Just an opinion of mine, you all may disagree, but it's not my intention to start a flame war with the moderator.<br><br>Anyway, here's the thread for you all to discuss about what you all like or not like about BAR forum. I'm aware that the moderators may shut me down but what the heck, they are the moderators. I started this thread not to flame anyone, but was just thinking since people have talked about it, why not just start a thread on it?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Took this post from another thread since it seemed relevant to this thread.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm...do you know the moderator personally? Then how can you justify your cause by calling the moderator names?  </div></blockquote>For someone who's so quick to flame others in other threads, I'm surprised to see you standing up for a lady. Then again, maybe because it's a lady? Still, I agree with you that the name calling was wrongful and uncalled for.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div><div class="quote_body">Well...if you really don't like the way this Bar forum works, you can always click somewhere else. Your mouse is working right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I think you are the one who is not supposed to be here because you are too sensitive. This is afterall, just a forum...and a public one to be correct. Nobody is obligated to please you, so don't feel so bad if you are pissed off about the behaviour of the forumites here. And by the way, I do not know the moderator at all...so not considered as her friend. I'm anonymous.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Another solution would be for you to go and set up your own 'Bar' type of forum and be a moderator of your own forum. That way you can then enforce whatever rules as you deem fits.<br><br>But don't forget...nobody likes to be restricted with rules...especially if it is too overbearing. So perhaps then you will understand the need to be relax the rules a bit sometimes so that people will be attracted to participate your forum.<br><br>Good luck and I would like to see the activity rating for your own 'Bar' forum.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Well, it's true that this is a public forum and that such a forum isn't made to please only a few individuals, but it seems that this forum aims to please those who make fun of those starting sex-related topics. So it isn't so "public" anymore I guess.<br><br>As said, it's up to the moderators to decide how they want they're forum and I'm fine with it. Just that I'm voicing out what a few have said, that this is BAR, an <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adult</span></span> forum yet there seems to be a lack of mature discussion regarding the issues brought up. Afterall, the Adult rating is there.<br><br>Of course someone could always start a new forum or whatever, but I'm just voicing an opinion.</div>

So it isn't so "public" anymore I guess.<br><br>As said, it's up to the moderators to decide how they want they're forum and I'm fine with it. Just that I'm voicing out what a few have said, that this is BAR, an <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adult</span></span> forum yet there seems to be a lack of mature discussion regarding the issues brought up. Afterall, the Adult rating is there.<br><br>Of course someone could always start a new forum or whatever, but I'm just voicing an opinion.</div></blockquote>well i have actually pm a mod about this and that we may need a sex education forum instead of bar where ppl there may not be open enough to talk about sex related topic... but... i have not received any reply yet... so i guess i know what their comment on my idea... so i think i will rest my case....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
