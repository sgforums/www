And maybe you yourself should go back to the thread and see my replies. I have told you that I myself am against child sex as well. So such a thread could be used to voice out against such acts. But however, you were more carried away by me quoting you than anything, which is why I have said, that you are more interested to start a flame war than anything. So far you have done nothing but carry out personal attacks on me.<br><br>You ask me if I know you personally well of course not, neither do you know me personally. But at least I have given you enough respect to understand your intentions. And I have in no way made fun of your objection towards child sex. But rather, you have done nothing but throw insults at me and aimed to provoke me. Look back at your own posts, wasn't that what you were trying to do?<br><br>I did ask you to speak out but not against the people posting in the thread. You yourself should be the one to go back and read yourself the first time I quoted you. To repeat to you after so many times of telling you, I am not for child sex or child prostitution. You are just sore that I quoted you.<br><br>I am against such acts and rather than choose to just sweep under the carpet, such things should be dealt with but carefully of course. So perhaps the guy who posted that thread lacked sensitivity. Anyway, you have been too carried away by my quoting you and you have let your anger actually get the better of you.<br><br>Your words about considering consequences is good and valid, but I would like to tell you not to direct your anger and frustrations at the wrong people. I am against child sex, so I object to it and would be against it, so are you saying I'm a sick person for being against child sex?<br><br>Like you said, if certain topics are taboo to you or displease you, you have the right and the choice to click elsewhere.<br><br>Once again, I just want to say to you that you have let your anger and your pride get the better of you. You are just unhappy that I had quoted you and made a comment about your post., hence you've gone on your personal hate war against me. When all this while I have supported your stand against rape and child sex.<br><br>Come on, you were the one being personal for no good bl00dy reason and are too proud to admit it.</div>

Was the real man at the last line when defenders flanked on both sides to attack.<br><br>Jorge Andrade : 6.5/10<br>Had an average game and was unable to really sort out threats like Michael Owen.<br><br>Luis Miguel : 7/10<br>Assisted in the some of the pretty offensive moves, but always lacking in defending service.<br><br>Jorge Nuno Valente : 7/10<br>Stood back in defence, was looking quite spaced out and slow to match speedy attackers.<br><br>Alberto Ricardo Carvalho: 7.5/10<br>Awesome in defence, but oftenly slower than real threat like Darius Vassell.<br><br>Francisco Costinha : 8/10<br>Cost Portugal the first goal, but showed determination to assist the back four and was part of the pretty offensive moves. Always lurking to head the ball in.<br><br>Luis Figo : 8/10<br>Was everywhere in the attack. Stamped his authority left right centre of the offense but concentrated a bit too much on holding the ball.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo : 8.5/10<br>The true man who cheated English defenders. Ashley Cole, Gary Neville had some run-ins with this classy player. Did not showed his tricks but however showed good character in passing and chasing speedy attackers to aid defence.<br><br>Nuno Maniche: 8/10<br>Great player who often dispossess opponents and did lot of linking with the rest of the players.<br><br>Anderson Deco: 9/10<br>Not one of his best, but definitely was rock on the right side of defence where he retreated to assist in defensive duties when there was a player switch. A versatile, skillful, player who overall looked the best for the portugese.<br><br>Miguel Nuno Gomes: 7.5/10<br>Lurking constantly. Doing a lot of running but always letting David James get the better of him from set pieces.<br><br>Substitutes:<br><br>Helder Postiga : 7.5/10<br>Scored a goal, scored an audacious goal from the spot during penalty taking. Was unable to really blow the defence apart.<br><br>Manuel Rui Costa : 9/10<br>Though he missed the spot kick for penalty taking, he responded entirely over the field to stamp his authority like Luis Figo did. A real classy player who scored a brilliant screamer. Definitely, a match winner.<br></div></blockquote></div>

Definitely looking more like a goalkeeper than his constant absence previously during spotkicks and corner kicks. Misjudged and allowed Postiga to head in the equaliser.<br><br>Gary Neville : 8.5/10<br>Was part of the offensive moves in the second half, but showed good quality preventing direct shots locking on the right flank.<br><br>Ashley Cole : 8/10<br>Forced Cristiano Ronaldo to often pass the ball around and was part of one of the offensive moves in the left flank. However, sometimes caught out by the skilful crosses to Ronaldo. Did clear a few of the crosses through heading the ball away.<br><br>John Terry : 7.5/10<br>Had most of his job done well by Cole, Neville and Campbell. Headed clear one or twice. Was simply around to do a shadowing over the ball, thus preventing any real threats direct at the goal.<br><br>Sol Campbell : 8.5/10<br>Rock in defence, headed and did most of the air clearance in absence of a solid aerial defender. Used his experience well to close in on threats.<br><br>Steven Gerrard : 8/10<br>Other than being the the pole position of the defence from midfield, he hardly contributed to the attacking flow as the Portugese dominated with possession. Tried very hard to dispossess the Portugese.<br><br>David Beckham: 6/10<br>Captain? Free kick specialist? He probably only ran in the second half of extra time. Definitely shown that he was outplayed by the Portugese.<br><br>Paul Scholes: 5.5/10<br>MIA. This man is missing in action. He looks lost, had trouble intercepting balls. Missing in the offensive moves and looked like a terrible statue in midfield outplayed by a skilful portugese side.<br><br>Frank Lampard : 8.5/10<br>The real winner of the English Side. Definitely did well to defend and attack and dispossess the opponent. Score a goal when he had a chance. A real match winner, too bad on the wrong side.<br><br>Wayne Rooney : 4/10<br>Wayne what? Looney? Where is he? Injured ankle? hahaha. Golden boy of English soccer? Isn't he heading home to see papa after England is gone? Bye bye Looney. See you in World Cup.<br><br>Michael Owen: 8/10<br>Lurker. Looks dangerous hiding and showed predatory skills with his third minute goal. Looking tired and rather outplayed in second half.<br><br>Substitutes:<br><br>Phil Neville: 6/10<br>Did some defending. Enjoyed running into covered areas. You sure he played well in Man. United?<br><br>Darius Vassell: 7/10<br>Did some runs, but was never in the right and dangerous places. More like a lost horse on a canter and slowly galloping into wrong and difficult to score areas.<br><br>Owen Hargreaves: 9/10<br>Outstanding. He showed Paul Scholes how to be a midfielder. He was at the right places, right time, did some real running and played real well. If only he could link up well enough with the rest he would be perfect.<br></div></blockquote></div>
