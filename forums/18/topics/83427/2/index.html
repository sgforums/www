Her very actions encourage others to flame those who start sex-related topics. Resulting in lots of posts that are not related to the original thread topic.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> </strong>You having a problem with that? Create your own FORUM within sgforums and she can't do anything but read and post. You can even modify her post if you want whenever she post in YOUR forum.<strong><br><br>It is true that some people post really lame topics, but there are times when peole are genuinely trying to find out information or are really seeking for opinion and guidance. For example the masturbation thread by tube_girl. Started out as a girl asking about things I think lots of girls ask about and write to women's magazines about.

Some people just want to chat and to talk, simple as that. Flaming wars are not on that agenda.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> </strong>You don't like it you can don't read it. There's no fine rule that says nobody should be off-topic or flame someone.<strong><br><br>BAR is a forum rated <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adult</span></span>, so why shouldn't sex-related topics be here? If it's going to be nothing but chatting where no sex-related topic is allowed, then the <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adult</span></span> rating for BAR may as well be removed. It's not that I'm against FireIce or anything, but I honestly feel that maybe should let someone else take over as moderator. Just an opinion of mine, you all may disagree, but it's not my intention to start a flame war with the moderator.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> </strong>Why should we let anyone else other than Jason to decide whether it's worth it or not. You can create your own adult-theme forum within sgforums and not let her ruin your pleasure of reading such material. Of course, Jason still determines the right as the owner of the forum to decide the eventual outcome of your membership should you cross the line too often. <strong><br><br>Anyway, here's the thread for you all to discuss about what you all like or not like about BAR forum. I'm aware that the moderators may shut me down but what the heck, they are the moderators. I started this thread not to flame anyone, but was just thinking since people have talked about it, why not just start a thread on it?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> </strong>If you're unhappy, GO CREATE YOUR OWN.
