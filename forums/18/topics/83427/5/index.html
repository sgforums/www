For one reason, they very much stick to the rules.  Either that, or you're out.  That can be a bit irritating at times.  But once the strict rules are loosen, this is what you get.  Lame posts &amp; bo liao chit chats.  Most of the time we won't be able to find anything useful.  But I guess this means FUN to a lot of people.  So...  juz let things be.  If you gotta tell them to stick to the rules, you will probably look as though you're looking for trouble.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I'd say, a good forum would have a balance between sticking to the rules &amp; having fun.

Doesn't mean we can't comment on how immature you sound.</blockquote></div></blockquote>Nope, go ahead, comment. Though it probably is still an opinion. I understand you're not alone either. So fine by me.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong> Jason does a fine job of drawing a straight line between adminstrator and moderators. He gives them the job, he leaves the decision to them until there is an issue he need to address to. For Example, Cortez's insults. </strong></div></blockquote>Fair enough, just that since it mentions two moderators, but it's true we usually only see FireIce active. But heck, it is Jason's forum, so like you said, it's his final say who he wants to run his individual forums.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote><br>It's also our choice to start making this go way out of point and turns into crap.</blockquote></div>Not unless moderator steps in and restricts what is said, if not, anything goes. So you can say the things you say because the moderator gives you freeway to do so.<br><br>[/b]Like I said, if you don't like the way Bar is, go create your own Adult-themed forum name Disco or Lorong 18[/b][/quote]<br><br>There is no need for me to create such a forum, as already, it's my right to start such a thread or not. And no point repeating, it's also my choice to post here.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong> You're probably inable to decipher what is joke and what is serious talk.    You're probably unable to see that some people although they make fun, they do give their own ideals. If it's adult-themed, it's going to be about entertainment (sex), so what's wrong with laughing or joking? Are you still Primary 3 that you can't take a joke.<br></strong></blockquote>It's not that I'm against jokes and I'm not saying topics and posts should be totally uptight. Just that I feel the crapping is a bit excessive and may have gotten in the way of general discussion of a particular topic in general. like somebody else has said, a good forum should have a good balance of rules and fun.<br><br>Don't understand why you're being so personal here, guess you realy love BAR a lot. Not being sarcastic, but for you to speak out so much against me, means you're more than fine with the way BAR is and I respect that.<br>[/b]</div>
