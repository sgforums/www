By some people's standards the BAR forum would seem to be fine, whereas maybe there are others who don't think so. It's hard really to draw a line sometimes. Afterall, BAR is also the most active because of the most crapping as well. It's BAR but yet most of the posts don't seem to be about clubbing, drinking or adult matters. Then again, we're all just here to chat aren't we?<br><br>I'm aware that some people are feeling hostile towards me for what I've said, but as I've said, it's not my intention to start enemies, just maybe getting people to share. So far there have been people who feel that posts and topics in Bar are lame and off-topic, there are those who feel that it's ok. Whatever your stand is over the standard of the forum just voice it out. Open public forum right?<br><br>I guess the flaming and insults would continue, because some people just love to get personal. I guess heated discussions occur, but even if it gets heated, it's still possible that people remain on-topic. There was this thread in sgforums not too long ago, where posters started debating on the real life military mission that the movie "Black Hawk Down" was based on. Tried finding the thread but don't know where it went. Even though some of the posters got really pissed with each other, they continued to debate very fierecely about the main topic and although unfriendly, the thread remained on topic.<br><br>I guess there will be differences in opinion and conflict arises, but being personal is a different thing. When people are just calling each other names rather than talking about the main issue, it's just plain stupid name-calling.</div>
