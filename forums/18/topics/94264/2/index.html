That's not rape.  Rape is when you clearly tell your woman that you do not want to have sex (no means no) but she insists and overpowers you, usually physically, and has sexual intercourse with you.  The fact that you allowed her to indulge in foreplay with you means you did not say no.  In the first place, would you dare say no to your girlfriend?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Why is it that most men wake up with an erection?  It shows that it can't really be controlled.  Studies have also shown that even when men are being sexually assaulted, they can also have an erection.  Also, it has also been shown that women show signs of sexual arousal when they're becme victims of rape.  It still boils down to the bottom line - No means no.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Dude, you've just been raped.  You may sound ready to be a father now, but what if the incident happened when you're not ready to father the child or any child for that matter?  The point is that you said no.  And no includes no to having a child.  Raping a man is no different from raping a woman.  It's not about penis or vagina; it's about the abuse power.  If you agreed to father the child, it would justify her actions and free her from her crime.  Protecting the child?  No, you're protecting the culprit.  No means no.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

They just don't want to have a partner to help raise the child that the man has somehow played a part in creating it in the first place (dripping sarcasm).  Some men know about it while some men don't.  I think if she came back a few years later asking (or demanding) for money, it's already too late.  You don't have a choice, do you?<br><br>However, I think we've got different definitions of the word 'responsibility' here.
