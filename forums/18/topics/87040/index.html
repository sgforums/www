            <div class='col-md body'>I was having my tea break at the canteen. Overheard a conversation of two beautiful gals sitting behind me. Both of them were exchanging views about the perception of "Good Looking" and "Ugly". Lets name both gals A and gal B.<br>Gal A said "If given a choice between 2 guys. One very good looking but work in a ship yard earning very little, the other being short, fat and ugly but very rich and successful in his career, which will you choose to be your husband?"<br><br>Gal B replied "All my elder sisters are very prett but they married a ugly husband. I'm also very pretty and I don't wanna ended up just like them. I want to marry a good looking husband. I'm not interested in money"<br><br>Gal A then said "We can't choose to have a face that we want before we are born right? Nobody wants to be born ugly, if every gal thinks like you, all those ugly guys will remain single. Is it really fair for them to choose only those good looking guys?"<br><br>Gal B replied "Yes...we can choose our face before we are born."<br><br>Gal A asked "How huh? Any scientific methods?"<br><br>Gal B replied "Simple, as long as both the guy and the gal is good looking, their baby will have a beautiful face. DNA will do the job automatically. Therefore since I'm pretty I'll definitely want to marry a handsome husband and our children will be born with a pretty face."<br><br>This seems to be an interesting subject for thoughts. Will the product of a couple with beautiful faces looks beautiful as well when the baby grew up? Does DNA works 100%? There are ugly looking couples having kids that are good looking as well and vice versa. Both the gals seems to be in their early 20s. Really scary that gals seems to have such thinking these days. They go for solely for looks instead of finding someone that their really love.<br><br>What's your views and opinions about this so called "Scientific Methods" of producing good looking man and woman to be our future models?<br><br>Talking Point.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Genetically it is best to mixup different DNA in order to get new and better genes type. If similar genes keep forming together it will reach a point where the genes pool is sterile and there will no longer be any improvement in the genes. I suppose that is if you keep mixing same smart and smart group, it will reach a stage whereupon the child potential will be limited by his parent genes. He/she will be only as smart as his parents, grandparent and etc but never reach any new breakthrough in his intelligence.</div>
