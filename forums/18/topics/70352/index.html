Or you might just be unlucky enough to end up spending the night locked up in the police station.<br><br>This was what happened to my boyfriend on Feb 12. We parted ways shortly before midnight, promising to call each other after we got home. His call never came and when I tried calling his mobile phone, it had been switched off.<br><br>It was only at 8am that I finally got a call from him and learnt that he had been locked up the entire night. His offence? He wasn't carrying any form of identification when approached by three police officers on patrol.<br><br>He was handcuffed, taken to the police station and locked up. His mobile phone was confiscated and requests to call someone to fetch his passport were turned down repeatedly.<br><br>My boyfriend is from China.

This is inaccurate.<br><br>On Feb 12 about 12.45am, police were alerted by a member of the public to a drunk man at the Toa Payoh Bus Interchange.<br><br>When our officers arrived, they found Ms Teo's boyfriend lying on the floor. He smelt very strongly of alcohol.<br><br>He was incoherent, unable to stand and care for himself.
