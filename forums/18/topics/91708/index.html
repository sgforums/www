The problem is that the hole is consticted by your rectal muscle. If she is tensed, the muscle is tight. She may be tensed because it is the first time.<br><br>Honestly, for myself, I have tried it many times with a few girls. Only those that were really relaxed and was not the first few times for them, were the ones that allowed my thingy to go in !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>the gays do it tat way only bec they have no other hole to use  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Anyway, the muscle around the anus (which is called the anal sphincter) its very strong but frequent anal sex actually loosen the muscle.<br><br>Now here is the bummer!  unlike the muscle in the virgina which can be strengthen to grip, the anal sphincter is I think what is called a smooth muscle and cannot be trained so once its loose I think other than surgical intervention, I am not sure that it can be tighten again.<br><br>Which is why my gay friends tell me that after sometime, once that muscle loosen up they actually find it difficult to hold things in... and always feels like going to the toilet to shit even when there is little to get out!!!<br><br>Dont mistake the anal sphincter for the butt muscle ie the PC muscle which you can voluntarily contract when you tighten your butt!  that muscle is not the one that closes the hole its the rubber band like anal sphincter that closes it.  even if you could use the PC muscle to close it... try this experiment... grip your butt muscle and see how long you can grip it tight.  Now imagine what happens when you become tired??? everything comes out!  But on the other hand smooth muscles dont get tired which is why you can hold shit in for days on end without having to control!<br><br>Sooooo why do anal?? a couple of minutes of fun each night but 24/7 of of inconvenience!<br><br>you go figure the maths and decide if its worth it esp if you love the person you are having sex with!</div>
