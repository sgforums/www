            <div class='col-md body'>'Not so pretty but...'<br><br>Some did catch pageant director Errol Pang's eyes with fresh face apeal<br><br>MISS SINGAPORE UNIVERSE 2004 SEMI-FINALS<br><br>By Jeanmarie Tan<br><br>IT'S supposed to be a beauty pageant. But at the Miss Singapore Universe 2004 semi-finals on Thursday, we were left wondering: Where is the beauty?<br><br>Even Mr Errol Pang, managing director of pageant organiser Derrol Stepenny Promotions and one of the judges, reluctantly agreed.<br><br>After admitting that they lowered the height requirement to 1.6m this year, he said frankly: 'Last year, we had taller girls who were striking and who stood out. This batch isn't as pretty.'<br><br>But he was quick to add that they have 'a lot of fresh-face appeal'.<br><br>'One or two have captured my eye,' he smiled.<br><br>That's one or two - out of 28 beauty queen wannabes, mind you.<br><br>Could one of them be 25-year-old Marilyn Tan?<br><br>Sources say that the 1.73m-tall Hanis Hussey look-alike has a shot at becoming the next Bernice Wong - that is, if she stops being a klutz.<br><br>HUGE COLLISION<br><br>She apparently caused a 'huge collision' during one of the rehearsals while she was 'crossing paths' with another contestant.<br><br>Marilyn, who is currently helping out with her father's chemicals business, confessed laughingly: 'I used to be the girl who couldn't walk like a girl.<br><br>'Everybody said I walked like a guy, because I couldn't do the catwalk properly. It's been a big challenge, but I've mastered it. Now, they say I walk like I'm going to the beach!'<br><br>Marilyn also left an impression because of her deep tan - she goes wakeboarding three times a week - and toned body.<br><br>Under the cruel white light at Indochine at Wisma Atria and beneath the show-all string bikinis, the majority of girls appeared so bottom-heavy, you'd think J.Lo was back in vogue.<br><br>Amid the meat market, there were slabs of orange-peel thighs, unsightly love handles and over-oiled legs.<br><br>One of the girls even had a flesh-coloured plaster slapped over her left butt cheek.<br><br>It didn't help that the air-conditioning was on at full blast, leaving some of them rather goose-pimply.<br><br>And what's a Miss Singapore Universe without its corny crowning moments?<br><br>What the semi-finalists lacked in beauty, they made up for in bad prose, when each had to introduce herself using one of four key words: Beauty, friendship, success and family.<br><br>We rolled our eyes at a rhyming couplet: 'As long as you're comfortable in your own skin, your natural elegance will shine from within'.<br><br>We groaned at the cliches: 'Friends are like stars - you don't always see them, but you know they're always there'.<br><br>We marvelled at the number of doggy-eared self-help books this person must have gone through to dig up this 'gem': 'Success is about building a foundation with the bricks people throw at you'.<br><br>Yet, as the evening went on, we were pleasantly surprised by the personalities - not prettiness - of others.<br><br>Even though Cara Chew's family is in Beijing where her father is posted, the 19-year-old NUS undergraduate takes comfort that their 'spirit' is with her.<br><br>She had spent her teenage years - aged 11 to 18 - studying at an international school in Beijing.<br><br>She now stays alone at her varsity hall.<br><br>'I interacted with two different cultures - the expats and the locals,' she said with an American accent.<br><br>Although Cara misses her family and friends over there, she didn't seem too heartbroken to leave China.<br><br>She frowned: 'There weren't many shopping outlets and there were no beaches.'<br><br>However, one thing Cara did miss was its four seasons.<br><br>ECZEMA BREAKOUT<br><br>That's because she's been getting periodic eczema breakouts on her face due to Singapore's humid weather.<br><br>Meanwhile, nothing seems to faze blithe spirit Jeyawati Ibrahim, 23.<br><br>For seven months, she worked as a motivational coach at a private centre.<br><br>She organised camps for children aged 6 to 16 who 'weren't doing well in school', and taught them how to 'believe in themselves' by sharing life stories and through sports like cheerleading.<br><br>Obviously, Jeyawati - who also did volunteer work for Action For Aids in 2001 - is a pro at motivating herself.<br><br>The cheerful half-Malay, half-Indian babe said in her best Anthony Robbins guru voice: 'It's best to accept mistakes, because the more regrets you have, the more they won't go away. Get rid of all the negative thoughts in your head. Step over all the obstacles and start anew.'<br><br>Jeyawati has since quit her job.<br><br>She and her best friend are setting up an online store selling affordable bikinis they designed using beadwork and embroidery.<br><br>And in what may be a first, there's one contestant who actually joined Miss Singapore Universe not to win a title or build self-confidence, but to meet more female friends.<br><br>Lively NUS engineering undergrad Sandy Chua, 19, explained that it's because she spends most of her time in a male-dominated environment.<br><br>She said: 'In my faculty, it's mostly guys. The girls there don't share the same interests. Their priority is studies.<br><br>'But I think there's more to life than that.'<br><br>Funnily enough, Sandy plans to join the police force in future because she 'wants to do something for society' and it's where her 'interest lies'.<br><br>And even though she claims she's not a tomboy, her interests also lie in ballistics.<br><br>She was in her junior college's air rifle club, and won the national championship twice in a row.<br><br>She said: 'It takes discipline. It's a mental game - staying calm is most important.<br><br>'I feel a sense of achievement when I wind back the target chart and I hit a bullseye. I like to be precise and accurate.'<br><br>Suppose gunning for the tiara more or less involves the same thing.<br><br>So take aim and fire away, girls!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say, even if the girls are pretty, Singaporean contestants NEVER have enough substance to boot and this is the thing that you exudes naturally, not sthg you learn. Most of the contestants can't speak properly and this is one thing that irks me. Is it so hard to get someone who can at least speak English like English. After all, this lady's gonna represent Singapore in the international arena and people know that English's our 1st language, not like Japan, Korea or China. With little looks, little poise and poor diciton of English, it's no wonder Singapore will probably NEVER win an international beauty pageant of such scale.<br><br>Besides, 90% of the contestants are aspiring ah-lians. And I can't believe the organizer said that Bernice Wong has set such a high standard last year, it's hard to follow. Oh please, Bernice Wong has got to be one of the most odd-looking (that's being kind here) winner in recent years.<br><br>Perhaps Singapore should just opt out of Miss Universe and Miss World<br><br>Oh ya, got to agree with Bollywood_Beng on the bit about Chinese gals. Essentially, they all look the same to the Westerners because usually the kind of Chinese girls they like are usually non-beauty pageants type, bigger-boned and rounder,<br></div>

The two 'blanga' gals as u so put it, were prettier than the rest of the contestants anytime. Jeya was def more eloquent than the rest, esp wif silly 'popiah' answers. Jessica deserved higher scores than the ones given to her. She def was better looking than some of the chinkys who got in. *sigh* This is why Singapore will never win international pageants. To the pageant organisers, please learn from the supermodel search. We sent an indian (Anetha aiyavoo) and we won the international crown. I think i have a point proven and wotever unitellectual jibberish u say after this will not alter the fact that we are a racist nation. Bullocks to racial harmony.  </strong><br></div>
