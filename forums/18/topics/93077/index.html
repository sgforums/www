That explains for the little wetness round the tip everytime.<br><br>Dont for one moment think that there is no sperm cells in there just bec you have not ejectculated.  there are!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> so even if you do not have full penetration and didnt ejeculate, the fact that your prostate will secrete more and more of these clear fluid containing some live and swimming sperms means that some will be deposited in her!  and yes, sperm cells can live upto 3+ days in a girl's womb.  <strong>So how lucky do you feel?</strong><br><br><strong>If you love her, respect her and she will love you even more.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">A girl will give her all bec she love and respect the guy.  the moment she looses that respect... you think she will still love him??? </span></strong>what do you think?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Incidentally, when a girl has an orgasm, the muscle contraction together with the secretion of fluid actually helps the sperm cells move upwards.. the contraction is actually in an upward motion.<br><br>Now how many sperm cells do you think there is in each ejaculation??? 10, 20 sperms?? 1 million? no not even close... try several hundred million.  so each drop of pre-cum so to speak already carries with it hundreds of thousands of sperm cells... yes much of the fluid will bec of gravitry flow out but that does not mean that there arent any left within and aided by the favourable conditions to swim upwards... yes there are chemical signals within to tell the sperms where to swim to... and all you need is 1 after all that is what you are made of 1 sperm and 1 egg... how luck do you feel??<br><br>Incidentally, I guess according to your physics calculations, all that is needed for assisted reproduction is to get a huge pump and inject sperm into the womb at high enough velocity to overcome friction and the likes and you should get one pregnant girl?? unfortuantely its never that simple!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
