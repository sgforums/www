            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is currently facing problem of low birth rate and aging population.<br><br>Therefore, by studying this thread, I present:<br><br>The solution to low birth rate! (How to get pregnant.)<br><br>1) Have sex.<br>2) Between male and female partners.<br>3) Ensure penis is completely inside vagina throughout ejaculation. If possible, maintain a tight seal around the contact point such that no fluid leaks out.<br>4) After intercourse, the female should lie in a reverse inclined position such that the sperm is assisted by gravity to find the egg. Such a position should be held for 3 to 4 days while the sperm still live in the uterus.<br>5) Repeat steps 1 to 4 every day so as not to miss the ovulation period.<br><br>Problems Encountered: Difficult to perform step 1 while in position described in step 4.<br><br></div>

Sperms have a flagellum for movement. the seminal fluid produced by the prostate gland will provide the sperms cells with nutrients and give them energy for respiration to occur. Energy released during respiration will enable the sperm to move its flagellum(tail) and allow it to "swim",usually upwards. According to the menstrual cycle, A girls most fertile days will be the day when the uterus lining is thick and spongy. This is the preparation for implantation to take place. An egg from the ovule is released around this time(when the uterus lining is thick and spongy). When the sperms swim upwards to the fallopian tubes and meets an egg, chances of fertilisation is very high. But the seminal fluid(transparent liquid ejaculated by the penis) does not contain the bulk of the man's sperm. As such, if you are lucky enough to pull away from the vagina while you are petting your gf, most of the sperms would not be able to enter the vagina. So chances are not very high that fertilisation will take place. BUT THERE IS STILL A CHANCE AS SPERMS CAN SURVIVE FOR AT LEAST 3 DAYS IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBES!!!! Next time, Use a condom AND apply spermicides on it to ensure that the chances of pregnancy are less than 1%.<br><br>Btw , you do not need gravity or external force for the sperms to swim upwards. The sperm is a living organism. It has a flagellum for movement and it moves in a random direction, this explains why Millions of sperms must be ejaculated, so that the chances of a sperm meeting an egg IN the fallopian tubes is higher.</div>
