Have these people offended you in anyway besides being who they like?Such intolerance only breeds more people like those in power currently, sadly to say, most people would ignore your factless and pueril observations.I'm an old boy of ACS, howver I do not defend my school without facts, as you can see in reply to your other posts elsewhere in this forum.You seem to have a problem with JC people and those from ACS, why, did they screw up your life?Please grow up and accept the world is a diverse place, which makes it interesting to live in.

Have these people offended you in anyway besides being who they like?Such intolerance only breeds more people like those in power currently, sadly to say, most people would ignore your factless and pueril observations.I'm an old boy of ACS, howver I do not defend my school without facts, as you can see in reply to your other posts elsewhere in this forum.You seem to have a problem with JC people and those from ACS, why, did they screw up your life?Please grow up and accept the world is a diverse place, which makes it interesting to live in. Cheers.</div></blockquote>Please, the things I say are not groundless. And please be accurate about the things you say yourself. I personally do not have a problem with JC people so to quote me as such is blatant slander on your part. My personal dealings with AC people is up to me to share with you and believe me, I know more about AC people than you do. I however have not touched on anything personal and the things I have said about ACJC or ACS ppl for that matter are things that can be seen by many. And I believe I do not speak for myself when I say what I say about ACJC or ACS people.<br><br>I hope you can be mature too and not blindly jump to your former-schools defense. Like you have said, the world is a diverse place so must accept that your former school isn't a perfect place either. I understand that the world is diverse which is why I speak out against what can be said is the perverse side of this diversity. There can no good without evil, but do we continue to advocate evil so that goodness is further defined? Not that I'm really out to change anything, but I just wish to point out, my opinion of them is not unique, and they are not flawless beings to begin with.<br><br>I hope you can understand these facts.</div>

You are smooth. Ha ha. Hope not to be misguided here but this fold seems to have a lot of black sheep. What I say may be a generilisation, but I am definitely not singling out a mere handful of people. My impression does not come from watching one small group of ACS people alone.<br><br>Baaa!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If there is one thing that I learned 11 years after leaving secondary school, is that while i am also guilty to certain sweeping prejudice against schools that my own alma mater traditionally have intense dislike for...i think it is better to judge a person by his/her own merits...while certain impressions that you already have of the school can then be further reinforced or weakened. I would like to state before hand that I am in no way related to the AC name of educational institutes but if I have it my way i would definitely like to send my son(If i'm gonna have a son) there in the future if I can afford it. I came from a all boys secondary schools and it represents one of the most wonderful period of my short existence on this planet, making wonderful friends and glad for the way my life was shaped in the process. However with ACS, its different, boys do not go to ACS to get an education...they go there to know the right ppl for the later stages of their life, the advantage of having a network of friends that are already half....make that a full step ahead when entering the frantic rat race by virtue of have a rich father can be tremendous. Face it.....as with another post here, life is getting tougher by the day for run of the mill Singaporeans in monetary terms. I will want my hypothertical son to have that advantage.</div>
