Post this thread just to listen to some opinions.<br><br>Another question is if your girlfriend share room with another guy by themselves in a hotel. Would you mind, guys? Some more opinion please... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>I think a hella lot of Sg guys would oppose to their gf sharing a room with another guy, and that guy being one of her good friends. Esp if you place them in a scenario, where its some exotic place like bora bora or the aspen seas... anyone would feel the romance in the air... and 4 to 5 days together, going sight seeing, having candle lit dinners over the open beach under the bright stars, walking together thru the lonely cold beach(sand gets in her eyes, you help her blow it out.... and.... )... Think you get the picture. &lt;- How many of you would still be agreeable?<br><br>Well if the ocassion was a romantic getaway... yeah I would be jealous. But if its a business trip or with another bunch of friends(I would say ask a gal to share the room instead), then its a-ok.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not easy not to do anything.<br><br>Personally I have experienced it before with a close female friend who asked me to go for a short trip with her to Genting and KL before she starts her new job. The problem is that I have a liking for her. Anyway, I asked if she mind going for overseas alone with a guy, sharing the same room and sleeping on the same bed if single beds are not available. She replied "Of course not. Anyway we are so close and I trust you"<br>The phrase "I trust you" keeps echoing in my mind during the trip whenever lusty thoughts came to my mind. Everytime there is an urge, I will go to the toilet to wash my face or take a shower. On the average, I shower 6 - 8 times a day. There were many opportunities that we came in close contact with one another. We went swimming, pubbing and enjoying ourselves like a couple. One night, she was so drunk that I have to carry her to bed. The whole trip was a pure mental torture.<br><br>After the trip, she said that she enjoyed herself and asked me to join her on a Bangkok trip and tried the massage in the room. I grinned and said to her "See first" and that was a few years ago and I have yet to take up her offer. No way am I going for a longer trip when 3 days was already enough to send me IMH. Maybe when I no longer have any liking for her will I go for the trip. As mentioned, it is a pure torture but I am glad that I did not betray the trust she had in me.<br></div>
