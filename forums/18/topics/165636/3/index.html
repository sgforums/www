            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you read the Da Vinci's Code and do some independent research on Pagan rites. You'll realize that originally, sex was considered a holy act and it was the only way that a man could communicate with God. Due to the sudden "blankness" that a man would experience after orgasm. This was considered the ideal time to communicate with God.<br><br>It sounds weird now and I guess staunchly religious people would denounce me as a heretic but its largely due to the New Testament and rising male dominance of the Church that propagated sex as the work of the devil, and made pagan into devil's worship.<br><br>And THIS is what has made our society into putting unnecessary pressures on being virgin which would symbolise chastity. It's just not the case, sex is a completely natural act and would we deny what is natural just to be "civilized"?</div>

So you spend so much time and money on her just to get to her pants rather than her heart?<br>I pity your life.<br><br>Sex is not a wrong thing but perhaps it has other implication too. So what exactly is wrong waiting for it after marriage? As if you will die from not having sex.  I'm sure there are still alot of people chooses to have sex after marriage comparing to only 10% of Singaporean does that. Even in the states the younger generation are growing to value virginity before marriage on a recent studies and sex after marriage is a growing statistic, after seeing the mess up, broken families it caused in the previous generation. Afterall studies had shown that having multiple sex partners before marriage tend to lead to a higher divorce rate. Not to mention about premarriage pregnancy.<br><br>Well why not take it as a test for your bf. If he truly loves you he is willing to wait till marriage. If not his just treating you like a amendities. If he could have asked this from you I don't see why he had not been asking sex from all his ex or probably all the relationship after breaking up with you.<br><br>BTW I'm not a girl and I think no matter religious reasons or practical reasons its always good for for the girl to restraint after all the girl has to lose more than guys. </div></blockquote>Hey dude.

Sometimes it is not just abt not having satisfying sex that leads to divorce, there are so many other factors involved. Like having made to do stuff beyond plain sex, perhaps bondage stuff, etc... something wic u are uncomfortable with. Or perhaps the other party has violence tendency, strange habit. Things that really put u off, beyond ur tolerance level. Itz a sad fact that u never realised all these before ur marriage. How irony, iznt it ?</div>

You'll realize that originally, sex was considered a holy act and it was the only way that a man could communicate with God. Due to the sudden "blankness" that a man would experience after orgasm. This was considered the ideal time to communicate with God.<br><br>It sounds weird now and I guess staunchly religious people would denounce me as a heretic but its largely due to the New Testament and rising male dominance of the Church that propagated sex as the work of the devil, and made pagan into devil's worship.<br><br>And THIS is what has made our society into putting unnecessary pressures on being virgin which would symbolise chastity. It's just not the case, sex is a completely natural act and would we deny what is natural just to be "civilized"?</div></blockquote>I think you had a pretty bad misconception about sex in churches. Sex is holy, a communion between two into one. It is what couples should become. And it is not wrong or unnatural if done after marriage. Rather it is fornication that is wrong. Got to get the facts right.<br><br>Perhaps for other religion which I better not mention who, suppressing sexual act seems to be the way of attaining holiness well then that's a totally different context then.</div>
