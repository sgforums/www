That does not mean those who wants sex is someone who is indecent. Moreover, like what Wendy81 says, Sex doesn't really means something that is negative. Well, it can be more than just a body language rather that what u assume 'LUST'. However, man should still respect any decision made by the girl as such thing only involve both party and not just one sided.</div>

So you spend so much time and money on her just to get to her pants rather than her heart?<br>I pity your life.<br><br>Sex is not a wrong thing but perhaps it has other implication too. So what exactly is wrong waiting for it after marriage? As if you will die from not having sex.  I'm sure there are still alot of people chooses to have sex after marriage comparing to only 10% of Singaporean does that. Even in the states the younger generation are growing to value virginity before marriage on a recent studies and sex after marriage is a growing statistic, after seeing the mess up, broken families it caused in the previous generation. Afterall studies had shown that having multiple sex partners before marriage tend to lead to a higher divorce rate. Not to mention about premarriage pregnancy.<br><br>Well why not take it as a test for your bf. If he truly loves you he is willing to wait till marriage. If not his just treating you like a amendities. If he could have asked this from you I don't see why he had not been asking sex from all his ex or probably all the relationship after breaking up with you.<br><br>BTW I'm not a girl and I think no matter religious reasons or practical reasons its always good for for the girl to restraint after all the girl has to lose more than guys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sex is one of the reasons that can maintain a relationship between men and women. This may be thought for as something not rational, but it's true. Of course, sex would be recommended after marriage or after the age of 18.<br><br>Think of it this way,<br><br>Without lust, there won't be any desire.<br><br>I'm not saying that sex is compulsory, but it plays a huge part. Women wants to be loved by the person whom they love. So does men, and the best method to prove it in a short term basis is sex. Long term method would include lots of time wasted, money going down for their accessories or their interests, etc.</div>
