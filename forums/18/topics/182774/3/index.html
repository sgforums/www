Worse still all they know what to say is to complain here, complain there, sue us etc..... please read the entire forum b4 u comment or better still read the SMA guidelines. Here we are trying to help u, cure u, make u feel better and u still wanna accuse us of something inappropriate. I do not deny the fact that there are 1 or 2 black sheep but do not make a sweeping statement just because u "THINK" the doctor's actions are inappropriate.</div>
