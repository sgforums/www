Here we are trying to help u, cure u, make u feel better and u still wanna accuse us of something inappropriate.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are 2 sides to the conduct of a consultation visit.<br><br>The expectations of the patient and the professional duties of the doctor.<br><br>The patient expects to get the best possible opinion of the doctor regarding her problems.<br><br>The doctor has to perform his duties as expected of the standard necessary to meet the expectations of the patient.<br><br>Rather than saying that you would always need a chaperone, which you should to shield yourself.  Doctors more importantly need to communicate their intentions and justify their actions to the patients.<br><br>Patients should also realize that in order to meet their expectations, the doctors had to practise the reasonable standard expected of them.<br><br>In the case of a "simple" upper respiratory tract infection, the physical exam should include the lungs, heart, throat, nose and ears, and neck.<br><br>The proper conduct of this exam would require adequate exposure of the patient. In order to maintain some degree of patient modesty, you may examine under clothes but if the undergarments are obstructing or reducing the audio quality you would need to disrobe adequately.<br><br>Patients (male or female) may have thicker chests (fat) or breasts, and even listening to heart sounds are impeded in the best of circumstances.<br><br>In professional exams (doctor tests) it is requirement to disrobe sufficiently and often-times this is more than what I typically see in a GP clinic in Singapore.<br><br>Our super short visits and what I think is a relatively under-developed culture (Singapore) of using exam robes impedes on what I think are inadequate exams in terms of patient exposure.<br><br>Listening to heart sounds and lungs through clothes are usually "immediate failures" in professional exams.<br><br>I would mark down a candidate during a physical exam test when I proctor at the medical school (USA) if they examine through the clothes.<br><br>As it is, we have move completely from "Victorian times", say in medical school exams where examination of the abdomen (belly) would require an exposure from the nipples to the knees, though it would dissuade patients who would come in to get an MC for abdominal pain/diarrhea.<br><br>Educating patients on the need for adequate examination which includes adequte exposure for a thorough physical, is the only way to reduce patient accusations of improper conduct.<br><br></div>
