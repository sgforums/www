            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with many of the posts here... its not just about the $$$ though nobody dispute that its important but there are more to life than making the max amt of $ you can.<br><br>Work as hard as you can when young, sure but you will not have lived as well.<br><br>Also, your maths dont show the whole picture...  first you assume that with 2 jobs you can get $3000 and whats more the type of job you get will generally (note I said generally not definately) likely to have little increase in pay year to year.<br><br>Also your assumption that the dip holder will not get more with each year as his experience increase so the fix pay is not accurate.<br><br>Leaving the maths and the assumptions aside its usually the case that the better educated you are the more future Income potential you have ... I can speak for many friendds of mine who did external degrees and are now way better off than if they had stuck to their original jobs.  I have serveral frens who did external law and 1 of them was working partime as a taxi dispatch radio operator while doing his part time law degree.  guess where he is now 7 years later?  a junior partner in the largest law firm. He must be clearing anywhere from $7.5 to just under $10k/mth! What about the rest?? they too are doing well.  some are not in law firms but working as high exec earning upwards of $6k/mth!  I have also other friends who did technical subjects in school... so instead of earning 1.5k or 2.5k as a technician, they became engineers and earn 4.5 to 7k??<br><br>sure the pay will sux when you start but that is only for a while.  You need to look longer term.  sure hardwork will reward but it will reward differently some will get much more and get further while others dont... part of that reason is unfortunately education and that stupid cert.<br><br>look around you... how many 2 job no qualification people do you know (esp if they are not their own boss) live in nice houses and drives?  And that is just looking at it from the $$ view.<br><br>The social and intellectual benefits and value of spending your student days having fun and knowing a great big bunch of friends who will keep you company for the rest of your life cannot be underestimated!<br><br>All I can say is that though the paper qualifications these days are not worth as much as before bec of the competition but it will still get you somewhere.  Instead of computing tillyou are 30, try stretching till you are 40 or even 50! and you will see that with the increase in yearly income bec of your certs will far outweigh starting work early.<br><br>Even if you dont managed to earn the bigger $$ later, but honestly, <strong><span style="color: red;">its a far easier life earning that $3 with the dipolma than it is earning $3k with 2 jobs</span></strong>... how long do you think you will last and who do you think will be happier at the end of the working day?  the dip can go for a drink you got to go to your second job!<br><br>so dont look at the $$ only and short term ya?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Supercharger is absolutely correct. You cannot possibly put a number on the opportunity cost arising from a diploma holder.<br><br>The diploma holder has many opportunites to continue to upgrade in terms of education wise and with that 'paper', he/she will be able to open more doors and opportunities out there.<br><br>And with a little bit of luck and with the right attitude, there really isn't a cap on his/her pay as his/her career progresses along. ie: the sky is pretty much the limit here.<br><br>Where as the 2 job holder, will reach a cap sooner or later and probably max out at S$4k. Of course there are exceptions and successful businessmen without education, but then again, there are a lot of more failures and people regretting not having proper formal education as well.<br><br>A non-educated KTV owner may be very successful. But I am sure, if a Harvard MBA graduate should open a KTV, he would be even more successful because of his expereince and knowledge, he will know how to grow his business and find ways to draw in the high net worth clients out there through his networking. He may also be able to draw in corporations as well.<br><br>There are always 2 sides to a coin, but one should always consider choosing the side where education comes first and upgrading and chasing that 'paper' as a necessity. It does sound crap , but the paper is how the world and society grades us and how much we draw each month (starting pay) stems from there.<br><br>Just my thoughts.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed... &amp; the pay diff b/w a grad (in this case poly) &amp; non-grad increasingly widens as the yrs go by...<br><br>Think there was a survey which shows how many more times a grad earns compared to his non-grad counterpart in a lifetime..<br><br>And this is only the monetary part... wat abt the "mental expansion", the net workin etc u get from an higher education.<br><br>Of course, 1 can always make frens, socialize at work... but i always felt frens made in sch are more innoncent, last longer too. FRens at work always seemed a bit artifical, political .. (jus my view)<br><br>And i read frm dun know wher a meaningful line--- Its not what u gt at the end of the goal, but what kind of person u become in the process of pursuing the goal.</div>
