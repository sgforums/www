In one post you go about trying to insult me about my supposed age, and the other you are saying how you understand my arguement. Just that the "Jealous" statement seems out-of-point.

Incredible in particular is more keen in insulting ppl rather than answering my point. Maybe you're just more pissed since I quoted you.

First i think he is old enough to know whats right and wrong. but he still chose to do it. Second do you think whatever we say here make a difference to him? I reckon NOT...<br>I think he just want to pour out his feelings over here and say something that he knows he is not allow to do in real life... as he knows alot of people are going to scold him pretty bad... and worse still those people might go and tell the two sisters.. that why i guess this is the safest place he can do so as no one will find out..<br>Sorry if i sound too long winded.. =p<br>but i just want to put to the point that we do not have to argue over what he  says i mean he does have his own freedom of speech.. =)<br>cheers man....<br>good luck as i think you do need a lot of luck....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
