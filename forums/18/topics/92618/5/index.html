But that's not the case with yourself right.<br><br>More life experience, seem to be enjoying some success at the workplace, but totally doing the OPPOSITE of what your head is telling you would be the RIGHT thing to do. Fren, why are you doing this?<br><br>Hear me out.<br><br>You are destroying a family. im sure this has crossed your mind, but you've chosen to ignore it.<br><br>Family ties are precious, do you agree? What right does anyone have to wreak such havoc on a family? Your girlfriend will be devastated, her parents will be DEVASTATED: both daughters treated in this manner.<br><br>Bro, you gotta ask yourself why are you allowing yourself to act in a way that will destroy somebody else's family?<br><br>Please don't take it like im preaching to you. I don't mean to come across as that in any way. Please think things through, alright.<br><br>I'm merely reminding you that we have to think of the people around us. I'm sure in many other ways you're a considerate person. But in this matter, i feel i have to remind you again that this is not going to have a happy ending and that<br><br>you are doing the wrong thing.<br><br>you are harming two young girls, and their parents, as this will no doubt leave an indelible scar in this family<br><br>you are harming yourself, by laying the foundation for future enemies. singapore is a small place, and bad reputation goes around.<br><br>Heck, why did i write so much also. If you've read other people's posts, then there should have been sufficient warning signs in front of you already.<br><br>Be a man, the gentleman that you know you can be, and do what you know is RIGHT. It takes discipline and willpower, but would you not respect yourself even more by doing it RIGHT?</div>
