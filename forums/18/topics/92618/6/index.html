YOu will find it harder and harder to love be truthful and faithful, no matter how beautiful and fantastic the girl is  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>why? Bec sex is more importantant then love, commitment, fidelity and faithfulness.  So these things means nothing to you anymore.  A girl in your head now is only good for sex, someone for you to poke.  <strong>You have become selfish and will exploit any girl that you fancy just to satisfy your sexual urges.</strong><br><br>So how does this impact your future??? your selfishness you will not allow you to be happy with that lovely and wonderful girl/wife, you will want more and more underground sex including visiting Pros!  Why? bec like you said.. its so trilling!!<br><br>I have never seen a person who cheated live a happy life.. no its not a curse it just plain reality.  They brought the pain and long term unhappiness on themselves.  All the heartaches and relational damage plus the inability to have a normal loving close and intimate with their spouse<br><br><span style="color: blue;">You do not know what love is and even if you did you have already lost the real meaning.  you have choosen to focus on yourself and yourself only.  You do not want love, you just want selfish sex.  Unfortunately all the cheap sex in the whole world will never fill and satisfy your longin for love and intimacy.</span><br><br>The above is just plain and simple psychology.  No rocket science.  I've talked to many couples and individuals over the years and again.... there is no happiness only DEPRESSION.  You have never tasted the joy of suffering from DEPRESSION... then continue to live this way and one day you just might get to experience the wonderful joy of DEPRESSION!<br><br>So what does all these mean?? Nothing!  why? bec you just want whatever it is that you want regardless of consequences.  the future and consequences means nothing to you.  future pain means nothing bec you have not felt it.<br><br>For minutes of fun you choose not to care about the person who stuck by you <span style="color: red;">does any of these things bother you??? no! why bec you never loved your gf and definately do not love the sis</span>... <strong>you only lust and love yourself and you want them around so that you can get cheap sex out of these girls by exploiting their weakness for you...<br><br>so having a place to poke your dick regardless of consequences seems more important to you </strong>so please poke away  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> Anyhow, like all things, the longer you are at it the more difficult it is to change... so congrats... keep poking!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh look its my first post. Decided to register and give my two cents worth.<br><br>First of all, it is pointless giving you advices and telling you what is right or wrong. You are definately old enough(but not mature enough) to know and handle the situation in the beginning. Sad to say, lust totally overwhelmed you and therefore leading you to a point such as this. It is definately too late to turn back, because you've already went too far(e.g making love to her) and allowing her to be your 'secret'(not a secret anymore, cause we all know about it) gf.<br><br>You jolly well know that you're gonna tear both sister's relationship apart, but i can't wait for that to happen. You know why? Cause blood is thicker than water. And i forsee you losing both of them. They will eventually see how worthless, useless, uncommitted and lustful you are. I'm sure that they will have some sense to think and realise that theyre both wasting time fighting over you.<br><br>You might say two years(with your gf) is a long time? well both sisters spent 19 years together. Which would they choose? a 19 year relationship or a worthless 2 years. I'll be glad if you're gf finds out about your secret relationship soon. Sooner the better. Enjoy as much as you can for now, because, in the near future, you will not be able to do so anymore. Like you've said, enjoy now and suffer the consequences later <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>:: Peace out ::</div>

It's called lust not love. U can continue to 'enjoy' the fun u r having now. But i hope u r prepared to bear any serious consequences which may happen.
