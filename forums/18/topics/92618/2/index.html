            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SnowFlag:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, that is the problem with pre-martial sex. The guy will look for other gal when he is "done"  with the present girlfriend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>You are right!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I agree with you.<br><br>Also, I was advised like this once by a wise older man... dont have premarital sex.. for xyz reasons but on top of that... should you and her dont get along and you and say the girls sister falls in love... the sex bit with the original sister will complicate matters too much to make it work!  I have not grasp the full implications but I can see some of the problems.<br><br>Also, when you have been with someone for a long time and getting married with all the usual nervous fears about the future etc and when someone comes along - younger sis or anyone else for that matter - the grass will always look greener!  that is for sure one! ask any guy!!! they will at some point ponder about this sort of thing.  But a true man will stay with his principles and brain and not follow his Dick.<br><br>Even if the above complications dont materialise... think about it... what are the chances of you being able to<br><br>a) dissolve the exisiting relationship without any hurts or ill feelins?<br><br>b) with the hurts etc... you still have face to go to the same house and meet the younger girl??<br><br>c) what makes you think that the sis will accept you?  even if she did.. I can tell you that at the back of her mind, she will not be secure. why? bec you left someone to go for her - even if she is persuaded by your colourful words that ya you did it for true love etc - she will always be under the haunting suspicion that you might do that to her in the future too and leave her for another woman since you did it to her older sis! that is the terrible cost of having someone desert you and be receiving a bf/gf under that sort of condition.<br><br>d) what about the parents?? yours and hers?  what the hell do you thnk they will think of you?  what sort of pressure will the younger girl get? even if she is for you... the pressure from parents, older sis and even younger girls friends will crack her!<br><br>e) you dont appear to know your own heart.  you follow your feelings and that is primarily influenced by the fact that the younger sis is pretty and you lust after her.  the feelings is unreliable and if you follow it you will be wrong.<br><br>Back to my good old fren.  He says that if ever such a thing happen, then if you really want to... you need to dissolve the relationship put some distance and time between you and her and family and after a long time then start over... then there will  be a clean break otherwise... all muddled.<br><br>So if the younger sis is really that nice... what are the chances that she will be available or be willing to wait (ini view of all the pain possible) for you?<br><br>And here is the wisdom about not having pre-marital sex above all the xyz reasons... if the younger girl knows or suspects that you have been banging her sis, what do you think  are your chances with her?  I'm not sure that sisters like sharing lovers! esp if she is very loving to her older sis and is a decent girl herself??<br><br>So basically, since you have come to this stage... better that you sort out your existing relationship and make it healthy through renewal which every relationship has to do every now and then to keep it fresh and going than try and turn your head and eat "return grass"<br><br></div>
