I can tell you what's gonna happen:<br><br>Your gf's sis is gonna be very embaressed that you rejected her outrightly and will be psycho bitch with you for the next 2 weeks or so. Calling you everyday even at odd hours, sending u lotsa sms and hounding you.  No matter whether you continue to reject her or be a bastard and sleep with her, within 2 month your gf's sis is gonna tell your gf (and probably ur gf's parents) that you tried to get fresh with her or that you slept with her or that you make her drunk and rape her.

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm actually looking out for a female version of this thread saying, "I fell in love with my sister's bf...how!"<br><br>cause i think that's happening here.  i've got a feeling that she's feeling the same way as you.  BUT, it's sticky and problmatic!  even if she does feel the same way, how are the both of you gonna face your current gf and their family??<br><br>....... anyway, a word of advice, listen more to advice from gals.  they are somehow more sensitive, though at the same time often overly dependant on the heart to make decisions.  in this case, it is a matter of the heart ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Errr I am not sure that ..."ending up with nothing:" should be your primary concern at this moment.<br><br>You obviously have an explosive situation here... but what the hell is wrong with your current gf?? you made so many reference to her being chio too!<br><br>What I see happen to people is this... when they have someone in their lives, especially a chio girl or guy, their confidence and ego goes up and they unconsciously starts thinking... I'm more attractive than I realise and bec of the ego boost, they become confident that they can attract another girl guy and UPGRADE!  no not kidding.  and that is why they are constantly on the lookout for someone more chio than what they have and they then try to get that new chio girl etc.<br><br>Fair enough that in your instance, you may or may not have had this upgrade mentality but by going along with the sis, you are playing with fire.<br><br>Whatever problems that you may have with your gf, sort it out.  There must be reasons why you love her as you said you do. focus on that.<br><br>If the younger sis wants to go on the love path or war path... let her do it... usual saying it takes 2 hands to clap... you stop encouraging her she will have nothing on you.  you may still be able to save what you have with your gf.<br><br>but what the hell, if you really want the sis, then dump the older and go for it. use next week as you said to express your "lust" I mean "love"... but guess where you will end up??? you think there is a future?  you think you can get married??? you think the parents will forgive you?  you think anything good can come out of this???<br><br>But again... the tot about "may end up with nothing" should not be the driving force behind your actions... that would be wrong bec if your gf is the wrong girl... you will still be the looser when you succeed to retain her.  What you have to do is to figure out yourself, why you love this gf and what are the reasons to carry on.<br><br>Whether you carry on after that... at least it will be for the right reasons.  as to whether you have a chance with the sis.... hmmmm just dont end up in jail ya!</div>
