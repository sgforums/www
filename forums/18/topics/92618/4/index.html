            <div class='col-md body'>Well, why don't you use the risk analyze software?<br>LoL..<br>Saw that in the movie "Along came Polly"<br>This may help!<br>Anyway, your gf sis maybe immature!<br>Now she may love you, other time, she may hate you!<br>Dangerous moves!<br>Hem.. I got two suggestion!<br>1) Sit down with your gf and your gf sis and talk it out in front of everyone.<br>The possible outcomes of this is You could get a slap from one of them and   the other will ask "are you okay?"<br>Or you may have both of them, if your gf agree la! Hehe.. Arent' that great! Two chio ladies!<br>2) You can choose to have a secret relationship with your gf sis and it is possible and it may last quite long too because your gf is always busy with works and stuff like that so even if your gf found out, you have a reason that she always working and go overseas while only her sister accompany you all the time so you have feeling for her also normal! Hehe..<br>In my opinion, you would want a piece of your gf sister and you don't want to let go of her but yet you are afraid you got nothing in the end! Well, as the saying goes "No pain, no gain" so why don't give it a try of my two suggestion! It may work out!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ! Best of luck!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forum Man<br><br>The grass is always greener on the other side. You now see ur gf sis unresistable. But can you imagine the other way round that you are now with the sis instead and your gf is trying to hit on u? Do u think you will still stay with the sis? You do not know the sis as much as you think u do. u must choose one and get it over and done with. To drag it on will cruel to all sides. Give yourself a deadline and make a decision before it all explodes and no grounds for negotiation. My opinion will be to stay with your current gf, you have been through so much up to a stage of getting married soon, the sis is only a test of your relationship. I believe there will be much more such tests after your marriage.<br><br>Your future is in your hands. Be sure and decisive, although it'sgonna hurt.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Sincere Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be greedy. Don't lose what you already have with your gf. Afterall, her sis is only 19. Girls like her nowadays have no idea what love and relationships are about. Treasure your gf, totally reject and shut the sis out. If you don't make a stand against her, she'll just keep coming back to you. You can try having both, one open relationship and one secret one, but it's going to take a toil on you. Emotionally and physically. Living double-lives is never a good thing.</div>

Suddenly u will be the bad guy who cant stand up to temptation.  Tread carefully nw..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
