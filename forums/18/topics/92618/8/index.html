I shall take a step aside and continue to see your 'wonderful' logic behind the red and in bold -'Jealously' word.</div></blockquote>Well no point being personal anymore is there? You guys are the ones begining to twist my words here. Personally I feel nothing wrong with Amulet's comments and she has a point, I'm just emphasizing what I said earlier.<br><br>Yes, I admit I did use the word, Jealous. You can consider it provoking on my part. I guess it's just like your comments about my supposed age or maturity?<br><br>Actually, don't you think using the word jealous has nothing to do with my age in any place? Wonder who are the siao ginas who don't get it. If I'm such a kiddo and greenhorn, how am I able to 'twist' Amulet's post and make it 'useless'?<br><br>To say I am the kid here is so absurd, when you two are the ones who failed to see the simple logic I'm trying to tell you both. Incredible in particular is more keen in insulting ppl rather than answering my point. Maybe you're just more pissed since I quoted you. Quite honestly, your own posts don't exactly prove the 'maturity level' of either of you too. Inspite of all the insults you two are trying to pull off, I hope you two can see the point that I'm trying to get at.<br><br>"Just because it doesn't happen to you, doesn't mean it doesn't happen to someone else."</div>
