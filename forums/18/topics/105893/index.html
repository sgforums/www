A man was shown threatening to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge.<br><br>The blonde bet the redhead $50 that he wouldn't jump, and the redhead replied, Â“I'll take that bet!Â”<br><br>Anyway, sure enough, he jumped, so the blonde gave the redhead the $50 she owed. The redhead said, Â“I can't take this, you're my friend. I have to admit, I saw this on the 5 o'clock news, so I can't take your money.Â”<br><br>The blonde replied, Â“Well, so did I, but I never thought he'd jump again!Â”<br><br>----------<br><br>Three blondes died and are up talking to St. Peter.

He asks the third blonde, "What is Easter?"<br><br>She says, "Oh that's when Christ died and they put him in a tomb and rolled a rock in front of it."<br><br>St. Peter smiles and urges, "Yes... go on..."<br><br>The blonde continues, "Then once a year we roll the stone away and he comes out and if he sees his shadow we have six more weeks of winter."<br><br></div>

When she laid down to sun her back, her bikini top fell off. She didn't care so much, though, because nobody ever came up to the roof anyway. Which is why she was surprised when she heard footsteps. It was the maitre'd from the restaurant.<br><br>"Ma'am," he said, "we were all wondering if you could put your top back on."<br><br>"Why? I'm not disturbing anybody."<br><br>"Ma'am. You're on the skylight."<br><br>----------<br><br>One day while jogging, a man noticed two tennis balls lying by the side of the road.

"That must hurt. I once had tennis elbow and the pain was unbearable."<br><br></div>

When the contractor came to her house they did a walk-through and he asked her what colors she would like. They came to the living room and she told him that she would like a nice, warm cream color. The contractor wrote something down on his pad, then walked to the window and yelled, ''Greenside up.''

They continue to her bedroom and she says, ''I would like a nice, cool, relaxing blue in here.'' The contractor writes something on his pad and again walks to the window and yells, ''Greenside up.''

            <div class='col-md body'>One day, a blonde's neighbor goes over to her house, sees the blonde crying, and asks her what happened. The blonde said that her mother had passed away. The neighbor made her some coffee and calmed her down a little and then left. The next day the neighbor went back over to the house and found the blonde crying again.

In order to raise some money, she decided to kidnap a kid and hold him for ransom. She went to the playground, grabbed a kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, ''I've kidnapped you.''<br><br>She then wrote a note saying,''I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north side of the playground. Signed, A Blonde.'' The blonde pinned the note to the kid's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents.<br><br>The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting beneath the pecan tree. The blonde opened up the bag and found the $10,000 with a note that said, ''How could you do this to a fellow blonde?''<br><br>---------------<br><br>A young ventriloquist is touring the clubs and one night he's doing a show in a small club in a small town in Arkansas. With his dummy on his knee, he's going through his usual dumb blonde jokes when a blonde woman in the fourth row stands on her chair and starts shouting: ''I've heard enough of your stupid blonde jokes. What makes you think you can stereotype women that way? What does the color of a person's hair have to do with her worth as a human being? It's guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in the community and from reaching our full potential as a person, because you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against, not only blondes, but women in general...and all in the name of humor!''<br><br>The ventriloquist is embarrassed and begins to apologize, when the blonde yells, ''You stay out of this, mister! I'm talking to that little jerk on your knee!''</div>
