            <div class='col-md body'>If u still think u are not at fault, the problems lies wif u liao lor. Me had same problem wif u, tried looking for a job too but can't get. Paper qualifications, I have but jobs can't find. Everyday quarell till siao. When u have no money, u have less confidence and u will to want to feel more secure by exerting control over her. Ego problem, bobianz. U stress ,she lagi stress. And someone is after her la, face it.

In ur case, i cannot give u 100% guarantee that ur gal is already thinking of leaving u and gave u all the possible ugly reasons but no other more sensible reasons (maybe she did tell u more sensible reasons but u din tell us here though). And u din say she told u she dun love u anymore. We cannot rule out the possibility shes fallen in love wif another men whos more practical in life and is more matured in thinking and further can provide her a better life, STILL we cannot rule out the possibility she wanna u to change and hopefully for the better and shes keeping herself for u till u had shown changes finally she will come back to ya? of coz by the end of the day maybe u had found a better gal we shall leave tt aside yeah? for now u juz look ahead of ya see wats to be changed and try again to reconstruct ur life. I understand its not easy to get a job now but at least a PT job can get u some money for survivor. unlike me i am on NPL and yet i cannot get a job outside coz not many ppl would dare to employ workers wifout CPF. GOod luck to ya and hopefully in ur next post u could post something much more positively dude! (i noe abit too long winded but suddenly i tot of ur situation the same as a fren of mine)</span></div>
