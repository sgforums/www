            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>1) NOT KISSING FIRST.<br><br>Avoiding her lips and diving straight for the erogenous zones makes her<br>feel<br>like you're paying by the hour and trying to get your money's worth by<br>cutting out nonessentials. A proper passionate kiss is the Ultimate form of<br>foreplay.<br><br>2) BLOWING TOO HARD IN HER EAR.<br><br>Admit it, some kid at school told you girls love this. Well, there's a<br>difference between being erotic and blowing as if you're trying to<br>extinguish the candles on your 50th birthday cake. That hurts.<br><br>3) NOT SHAVING.<br><br>You often forget you have a porcupine strapped to your chin, which you rake<br>repeatedly across your partner's face and thighs. When she turns her head<br>from side to side, it's not passion, it's avoidance.<br><br>4) SQUEEZING HER BREAST.<br><br>Most men act like a housewife testing a melon for ripeness when they get<br>their hand on a pair. Stroke, caress, and smooth them.<br><br>5) BITING HER NIPPLES.<br><br>Why do men fasten onto a woman's nipples, and then clamp down like they're<br>trying to deflate her body via her breasts? Nipples are highly sensitive.<br>They can't stand up to chewing. Lick and suck them gently. Flicking your<br>tongue across them is good. Pretending they're a doggie toy isn't.<br><br>6) TWIDDLING HER NIPPLES.<br><br>Stop doing that thing where you twiddle the nipples between fingers and<br>thumb like you're trying to find a radio station in a hilly area.<br><br>Focus on the whole breasts, not just the exclamation points.<br><br>7) IGNORING THE OTHER PARTS OF HER BODY.<br><br>A woman is not a highway with just three turnoffs: Breastville East and<br>West, and the Midtown Tunnel. There are vast areas of her body which you've<br>ignored far too often as you go bombing straight into downtown Vagina. So<br>start paying them some attention.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> GETTING THE HAND TRAPPED.<br><br>Poor manual dexterity in the underskirt region can result in tangled<br>fingers<br>and underpants. If you're going to be that aggressive, just<br><br>ask her to take the damn things off.<br><br>9) LEAVING HER A LITTLE PRESENT.<br><br>Condom disposal is the man's responsibility. You wore it, you store it.<br><br>10) ATTACKING THE CLITORIS.<br><br>Direct pressure is very unpleasant, so gently rotate your fingers along<br>side<br>of the clitoris.<br><br>11) STOPPING FOR A BREAK.<br><br>Women, unlike men, don't pick up where they left off. If you stop, they<br>plummet back to square one very fast. If you can tell she's not there, keep<br>going at all costs, numb jaw or not.<br><br>12) UNDRESSING HER AWKWARDLY.<br><br>Women hate looking stupid, but stupid she will look when naked at the waist<br>with a sweater stuck over her head. Unwrap her like an elegant present, not<br>a kid's toy.<br><br>13) GIVING HER A WEDGIES DURING FOREPLAY.<br><br>Stroking her gently through her panties can be very sexy. Pulling the<br>material up between her thighs and yanking it back and forth is not.<br><br>14) BEING OBSESSED WITH THE VAGINA.<br><br>Although most men can find the clitoris without maps, they still believe<br>that the vagina is where it's all at. No sooner is your hand down there<br>than<br>you're trying to stuff stolen banknotes up a chimney. This is okay in<br>principle, but if you're not careful, it can hurt - so don't get carried<br>away. It's best to pay more attention to her clitoris and the exterior of<br>her vagina at first, then gently slip a finger inside her and see if she<br>likes it.<br><br>15) MASSAGING TOO ROUGHLY.<br><br>You're attempting to give her a sensual, relaxing massage to get her in the<br>mood. Hands and fingertips are okay; elbows and knees are not.<br><br>16) UNDRESSING PREMATURELY.<br><br>Don't force the issue by stripping before she's at least made some move<br>toward getting your stuff off, even if it's just undoing a couple of<br>buttons.<br><br>17) TAKING YOUR PANTS OFF FIRST.<br><br>A man in socks and underpants is a at his worst. Lose the socks first.<br><br>1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> GOING TOO FAST.<br><br>When you get to the penis-in-vagina situation, the worst thing you can do<br>is<br>pump away like an industrial power tool - she'll soon feel like an<br>assembly-line worker made obsolete by your technology. Build up slowly,<br>with<br>clean, straight, regular thrusts.<br><br>19) GOING TOO HARD.<br><br>If you bash your great triangular hip bones into her thigh or stomach, the<br>pain is equal to two weeks of horseback riding concentrated into a few<br>seconds.<br><br>20) COMING TOO SOON.<br><br>It is every man's fear with reasons. If you shoot before you see the whites<br>of her eyes, make sure you have a backup plan to ensure her pleasure too.<br><br>21) NOT COMING SOON ENOUGH.<br><br>It may appear to you that humping for an hour without climaxing is the mark<br>of a sex god, but to her it's more likely the mark of a numb vagina. At<br>least buy some intriguing wall hangings, so she has something to hold her<br>interest while you're playing Marathon Man.<br><br>22) ASKING IF SHE HAS COME.<br><br>You really ought to be able to tell. Most women make noise. But if you<br>really don't know, don't ask<br><br>23) PERFORMING ORAL SEX TOO GENTLY.<br><br>Do not act like a giant cat at a saucer of milk. Get your whole mouth down<br>there, and concentrate on gently rotating or flicking your tongue on her<br>clitoris.<br><br>24) NUDGING HER HEAD DOWN.<br><br>Men persist in doing this until she's eyeball-to-penis, hoping that it will<br>lead very swiftly to mouth-to-penis. All women hate this. It's about<br><br>three steps from being dragged to a cave by their hair. If you want her to<br>use her mouth, use yours; try talking seductively to her.<br><br>25) NOT WARNING HER BEFORE YOU CLIMAX.<br><br>Sperm tastes like seawater mixed with egg white. Not everybody likes it.<br>When she's performing oral sex, warn her before you come so she can do<br>what's necessary.<br><br>26) MOVING AROUND DURING FELLATIO.<br><br>Don't thrust. She'll do all the moving during fellatio. You just lie there.<br>And don't grab her head.<br><br>27) TAKING ETIQUETTE ADVICE FROM PORN MOVIES.<br><br>In X-rated movies, women seem to love it when men ejaculate over them. In<br>real life, it just means more laundry to do.<br><br>2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> MAKING HER RIDE ON TOP FOR AGES.<br><br>Asking her to be on top is fine. Lying there grunting while she does all<br>the<br>hard work is not. Caress her gently, so that she doesn't feel quite so much<br>like the captain of a schooner. And let her have a rest.<br><br>29) ATTEMPTING ANAL SEX AND PRETENDING IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.<br><br>This is how men earn a reputation for not being able to follow directions.<br>If you want to put it there, ask her first. And don't think that being<br>drunk<br>is an excuse.<br><br>30) TAKING PICTURES.<br><br>When a man says, "Can I take a photo of you?" she'll hear the words" to<br>show<br>my buddies." At least let her have custody of them.<br><br>31) NOT BEING IMAGINATIVE ENOUGH.<br><br>Imagination is anything from drawing patterns on her back to pouring honey<br>on her and licking it off. Fruit, vegetables, ice and feathers are all<br>handy<br>props; hot candle wax and permanent dye are a no no.<br><br>32) SLAPPING YOUR STOMACH AGAINST HERS.<br><br>There is no less erotic noise. It's as sexy as a belching contest.<br><br>33) ARRANGING HER IN STUPID POSES.<br><br>If she wants to do advanced yoga in bed, fine, but unless she's a Romanian<br>gymnast, don't get too ambitious. Ask yourself if you want a sexual partner<br>with snapped hamstrings.<br><br>34) LOOKING FOR HER PROSTATE.<br><br>Read this carefully: Anal stimulation feels good for men because they have<br>a<br>prostate. Women don't.<br><br>35) GIVING LOVE BITES.<br><br>It is highly erotic to exert some gentle suction on the sides of the neck,<br>if you do it carefully. No woman wants to have to wear turtlenecks and<br>jaunty scarves for weeks on end.<br><br>36) BARKING INSTRUCTIONS.<br><br>Don't shout encouragement like a coach with a megaphone. It's not a big<br>turn-on.<br><br>37) TALKING DIRTY.<br><br>It makes you sound like a lonely magazine editor calling a 1-900 line. If<br>she likes nasty talk, she'll let you know<br><br>3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> NOT CARING WHETHER SHE COMES.<br><br>You have to finish the job. Keep on trying until you get it right, and she<br>might even do the same for you.<br><br>39) SQUASHING HER.<br><br>Men generally weigh more than women, so if you lie on her a bit too<br>heavily,<br>she will turn blue.<br><br>40) THANKING HER.<br><br>Never thank a woman for having sex with you. Your bedroom is not a soup<br>kitchen.</div>
