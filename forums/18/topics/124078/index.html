I'm not telling no matter what. I know that night with my friend is a mistake and i was in the wrong too i never deny it but i think if any guy in that situation will have sex too. I send her home that night and she wants me to come inside her house for a cup of drink and that's how the mistake starts. this is a good place for me to pour out so won't feel so guilty. i am making up for my wife later i am buying roses and take her out for a nice dinner and bring her out for a nice dinner. just hope everything stays in the way. the girl whom i slept with is also my good friend just pray to god nothing happens to my good friend or else my paper really cannot wrap the fire.</div>

I think that kind of situation is something we both cannot control but i know it's unfair to my wife and i don't feel so good either so i'm pouring out here. after that night, we agreed to treat as if nothing happen and we still good friends. if my wife knows abt this, i think most likely she will get a divorce and she will get the daughter and leave me. that night happen so naturally how to control the situation right. anyway, i know i cannot tell my wife abt this or anyone i know so i am pouring out here so i can sleep better at night. i don't mean to  </div></blockquote>wow you Fucking idiot, last time u have affair already, now again?!?! wtf??</div>
