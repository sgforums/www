You got responsibilities to ur wife and ur daughter.. and you are blaming ur wife becos she tell u off in front of ur friends when u are about to go drinking? -.- Pls do have a bit of responsibility towards ur family, it is more than just giving money  for the house hold expenses. Think of how much time have u exactly spend at home.Or even quality time spend with ur wife and daughter.<br>Talk about loving your daughter somemore. Instead of stepin on 2 boats and hopin that it will balance off in the end. I understand it is a happy situation for u, having two womans who loves u, but chances are it wont ast long. Before some tradegy happens,  i suggest u either make a clean break with ur wife or the other party. All good things come to an end someday. Although u might not believe in retribuion, sad to say, dun blame the world when something similar happen to u one day. KINDLY think through very hard what do u really want, sex? love or wat? if u love this woman more than ur wife and daughter, its a clear answer we can all see. If not, wake up ur idea a bit and stopped going to places like clubs etc. If u dun go there, and spend more time with ur family, this sort of thing will nv happen.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>last night had a very wonderful time with Mona. we had a very nice dinner in a beautiful resturant and the ambience was excellent with jazz music. it was very romantic and after dinner we went to the beach for a stroll holding hands, alot of kisses and hugs and joyride then spend a night in Mona's house but i used protection this time. Just came home a few hours ago after sending Mona to school.<br><br>when i reached home just now, i am very surprised that my wife did not even ask me where i go last night instead when i sit down to read newspaper, she gave me a massage on my shoulder and put water in the bathtub for me to bath. I noticed my wife's eyes were red like as if she cried or what. the eyes got blood treads. I wanna tell her please stop treating me so good just treat me like usual can liao. when i see her eyes like wanna cry, my heart started to melt and feel sorry. I've this feeling that she knows i've another women outside already but she is keeping quiet. i think it's too late you start to treat me so good instead you should have treat me well from the start. now it's a little too late. anyway i didn't talk to her much this morning because i know she knows something but how would she know about Mona right? Maybe i'm just being paranoid. After bathing, she even have a hot coffee for me and i say thank you in a very polite way and take the cup of coffee into my room, close the door and log in here liao. I don't know what she knows or what is she thinking. I feel like telling her i've another women outside already don't you think what you are doing is a little too late. But if i say this i don't know what is really going to happen. I gotta figure out things fast because i've a date with Mona this evening and most likely spending a night at her house again so i've to think of a good excuse by 7pm.</div>

You are indeed the classic example of a irresponsible father!<br>What you did, you never spare a thought for your own marriage and child. you never even attempted to salvage. Only thinking it is your wife's fault and saying it is too late..<br><br>You are just whining and complaining like a Fu_cking Child! Pushing responsiblilty and hiding from the fact in reality you have done something wrong and you are still continuing to do it to just seek that comfort that you are still right to do so. Satisfying a moment's joy and a lifetime of regret and mark these words well.<br>You will suffer.. and terribly..<br><br>I wonder what your parents will feel oh both side maybe if they knew about this.<br><br>God Damn MFCB Immatured grown up with a brain of a child..<br></div>

You are indeed the classic example of a irresponsible father!<br>What you did, you never spare a thought for your own marriage and child. you never even attempted to salvage. Only thinking it is your wife's fault and saying it is too late..<br><br>You are just whining and complaining like a Fu_cking Child! Pushing responsiblilty and hiding from the fact in reality you have done something wrong and you are still continuing to do it to just seek that comfort that you are still right to do so. Satisfying a moment's joy and a lifetime of regret and mark these words well.<br>You will suffer.. and terribly..<br><br>I wonder what your parents will feel oh both side maybe if they knew about this.<br><br>God Damn MFCB Immatured grown up with a brain of a child..<br></div></blockquote>this is the only place i can be so open and write excatly what i think and keep my identity secret. i'm not inmature like you. i'm already 33 this year and i know my wife for more than 18 yrs already and i think i had enough of her liao from sec 3 till now.</div>
