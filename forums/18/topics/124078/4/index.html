I think that kind of situation is something we both cannot control but i know it's unfair to my wife and i don't feel so good either so i'm pouring out here. after that night, we agreed to treat as if nothing happen and we still good friends. if my wife knows abt this, i think most likely she will get a divorce and she will get the daughter and leave me. that night happen so naturally how to control the situation right. anyway, i know i cannot tell my wife abt this or anyone i know so i am pouring out here so i can sleep better at night. i don't mean to  </div></blockquote>Woah, quite a baad thing you did there, not just to your family but your good friend.  I don't remember reading other DSB cheating confessions but this one ... a woman in this sorta situation is VERY vulnerable and chances are very high she's not thinking right at all especially if you've plied her with a coupla drinks. Worse, she's a good friend, she's upset and in need of consolation from someone she trusts. You knew the situation and her emotional state when you went out to meet her, I'm sorry to say it does appear you took full advantage of the situation even though I've tried to see things from your end - that it was something that happened naturally and something you couldn't control.</div>
