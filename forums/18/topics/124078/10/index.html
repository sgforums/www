            <div class='col-md body'>Oi Ding! I really have to say this again. Think through this carefully bec you have a daughter to consider. Mona's just out of a 7 year relationship and you've been friends all this while. Some women really need attention at this time to give their egos a boost. I'm not saying she's a bad woman or a selfish one but more often than not, you'll be what they call the rebound lover. No woman who's as upset as you say Mona was is going to hop into the next relationship so quickly and consider it a serious one.  She probably just needs someone to spend time with her so her mind doesn't wander in the direction of the guy who's just dumped her. Many women do this. It's the fastest way to get over pain.<br><br>Since you've come up with that little list, talk to your wife. I agree the sms thing can sound like quite a turn off but discuss things with her. If there's no communication, frustration with each other festers and becomes anger. But you might still be able to salvage the relationship. 18 years is not something to throw away on what <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">might well</span></strong> be a fling on Mona's part, and it is possible that bec of her current state of mind, Mona's unintentionally using you.<br><br>Give this some time. It's going to be a major mistake if you dump your family now over something you have no idea is even going to last 3 months.  Everything new is good, romantic, exciting and perfect.
