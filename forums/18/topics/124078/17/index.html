Mona is a teacher so she do body check up too and she is negative too. as for me, in my life i only got these 2 women so how can AIDS possibly come into the picture? I don't play around with other girls or ONS. only with the 2 girls tat's all. i am faithful to the 2 girls ok. as for now, everything is ok at home i only sometimes spend a few nights in Mona's house but after breakfast, i go to work then i will go home to be with my wife and daughter. my wife i think she is starting to accept me having 2 women in my life. she still treats me very nice, wash my clothes, do household chores, cooking, look after our daughter all these. when i didn't come home at night, at least i did tell my wife and i think she understands. why singapore cannot marry 2 women why why..? i really love both of them very much. I know my wife hates Mona to the core and the way she say is as if she wants to kill Mona and eat her flesh. tat's why i cannot allow my wife to see how Mona looks like. it's really difficult to be in love with 2 girls at one time.</div>

Mona is also very kind hearted she does charity work too and help those in needs and even want me to join her just that i don't have time or else i will join her. from what i know abt Mona is that she is a very gentle and kind hearted girl and it will be a real blessing if she is the girl i married. anyway, i am married so we just continue this kinda relationship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Mr Ding, you are the one who urge me to register and tell my story and this is my last time to reply your msg, as I feel this is truly ridiculous and useless especially toward a human like you. DonÂ’t use the nick Ding Shan Ben, heÂ’s a gd man and you are a disguise to be a gd manÂ… god bless you on that act.<br><br>=======================================================<br><br>As I said this is a true story and IÂ’m still alive kicking well, it make me to appreciate my life everytime I wake up. And make me hate people like you who are selfish been thinking about yourself and spare no thoughts to the innocent party.<br><br>I dun need you to feel sorry for me, in fact, I pity youÂ… youÂ’re an adult experiencing some much life around you... yet your story been twisting here and there to make perfect and I canÂ’t believe you are still alive. May god bless you to continue to be alive<br><br>I think you have brief knowledge on AIDS, it can be two ways. And first of all, as what everyone knows, it get transmitted by someone who carries it. However AIDS can be developed within someone who only have 2 sexual partner; how can it be rightÂ…. The gene in our body only accept ONE sexual partner and if you have many time casual in between two personÂ… the fluid you receive from 2 partner will get mixed up and hence if if biology not acceptable. It will get mutilate. And AIDS body checkup you need to do it every quarter months, itÂ’s not like one time you check and you are safe.<br><br>Anyway telling you this story is not to let you explain your process of how loving you areÂ… itÂ’s to let you know the consequence how it might caused to your loved one especially in a daughter point of view.  ThereÂ’s no way a woman can accept another woman sharing a husband with her otherwise sheÂ’s retard and unable to think clearly. YouÂ… have been twisting your story adding perfect hallucination to your reality. I donÂ’t think you really love your wife, at first place you have punish her by comparing her. In other way, you can still see her rudeness in other cute way but you just make your judgment by saying she mistreat you and prefer someone with gentle attitude. Do you know understand the word Â“communicationÂ”?? You simply deny your communication with your wife can choose here to vent your perfect hallucination. You guys can talk first before you make the judgement but you simply choose not and adding your Â“I think sheÂ” Â“I think thatÂ”, look carefully itÂ’s all your assumption towards her. Can you imagine a woman spending her whole life as huang lian bo and taking care of your daughter and what have you contribute?? An affair to tear your family apart? Bravo man! I salute your satan acts and your childish reply to the whole situation. A great man will think twice and accept his wife as what she is, appreciate her in other way to feel her love in other way (no need to be romantic or kind heart feeling).<br><br>Let your wife to have your daughter man, look carefully what she has lostÂ… a husband, a faithful heart and what worst you are about to snatch the only thing she feel it should remain to herÂ… her daughterÂ…. Kaoz, you are the one who is wrong and what makes you think you can have double happiness. Spare a thought to your wife donÂ’t torture her with your inhuman acts by bringing another woman into her life. BTW I donÂ’t think I would bother to reply you again, my story and this msg is to bring alert to people who read it and treasure your family. DonÂ’t create a child like me staying in this world thinking about what happen to myself and my parent, and also a immoral dad who starts all thisÂ…</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"I think you have brief knowledge on AIDS, it can be two ways. And first of all, as what everyone knows, it get transmitted by someone who carries it. However AIDS can be developed within someone who only have 2 sexual partner; how can it be rightÂ…. The gene in our body only accept ONE sexual partner and if you have many time casual in between two personÂ… the fluid you receive from 2 partner will get mixed up and hence if if biology not acceptable. It will get mutilate. And AIDS body checkup you need to do it every quarter months, itÂ’s not like one time you check and you are safe."</strong><br><br>the above is a big joke i think u need to study more on AIDS girl. AIDS cannot be transmitted or created magically if the girls you had sex with does not carry . i had sex wth both of them unprotected so does that mean 3 got AIDS liao what a BIG JOKE.

Why are u so draggy?<br><br>From wat i've observed, it seemed as though u dun really love her.. y? The reason for loving her is bcoz last time she was pretty and popular in sch. U feel good rite, by winning her heart, thats y u juz cant let go. Rite now, when u think tat she cant be as good as b4, u juz feel a bit Sianz.. BUT u cant let go coz u still wan pple to tink that u are a good father. As for ur daughter, u like her coz she's chubby and cute? Hey, wat if ur daughter turns out to be a bit abnormal? Say she has a big ugly birthmark on her face? Will u still wan custody of her? I see u as a v materialistic and selfish person. U only care abt urself and how others think of U.<br><br>If ur wife really that bad, juz divorce her. If u really care abt ur daughter and love her as u CLAIMED, u wont go out drinking wif ur frens and all the more, u wont stick to MONA and keep thinking of MONA...<br>Why would ur wife wana save $$? I think reason being: U r always spending money as seen frm ur action.<br>I'm sure there are lots of guyz who can treasure ur wife and provide a better life for her.<br><br>Imagine if u really leave ur wife for her,<br>Good wat, now u have 24hrs-7 days for ur teacher.<br>Mona Pt of view: If u really luv ur MONA, go to her. Do u think she can wait for u forever? Arent u being too naive? Do u think she will luv ur daughter like her own, even as much as ur wife? STUPID Ding..<br><br>As for ur 'little bro', if u really want it by all means.. u can go out and have fun. I'm sure those prostitutes will show u the best bed skills.. and perhaps, maybe u will stop comparing ur wife and MONA.. instead it will be MONA and 'them'..<br><br>The cycle will juz go on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Uncle, juz beware of STDS.
