            <div class='col-md body'>But Ding, even if you are 33 this year, grown man and all... grown men also got periods when they are unable to think clearly. This is a time of weakness for you.<br><br>While you remember all the unhappiness in your marriage, it also seems that you've ignored the times when you were happy.<br><br>Maybe I'm not fit to comment about how things work in a marriage, as I am unmarried. But I know a little about how things work in a family with children. A father who loves her daughter will not want her to grow up in a broken family. As a sidenote, also consider if YOUR father did the same thing... would you love and respect him?<br><br>Being the HEAD of the family, a father has to protect his family. I'm sure you feel the same way.<br><br>If you think about it, your wife is also hurting. She must be quite distraught when her husband doesn't come home. She also dun dare to question you why. Scared will push you too far.<br><br>Last time when she hurt you, you hold it all in. Now you hurt her, she also dun voice out. Both of you also keep suppressing it... there is a limit. You have reached your limit already.<br><br>You have to confess the hurt to each other. If you tell her she is hurting you... tell her "I was really hurt when you put me down in front of my friends." A woman who loves you will automatically stop. If you rem not so long ago, if your wife tells you she is unhappy, will you still keep doing the thing that makes her unhappy?<br><br>How come so easily, so fast think abt divorce already??? It doesn't make sense.</div>
