I think that kind of situation is something we both cannot control but i know it's unfair to my wife and i don't feel so good either so i'm pouring out here. after that night, we agreed to treat as if nothing happen and we still good friends. if my wife knows abt this, i think most likely she will get a divorce and she will get the daughter and leave me. that night happen so naturally how to control the situation right. anyway, i know i cannot tell my wife abt this or anyone i know so i am pouring out here so i can sleep better at night. i don't mean to  </div></blockquote>neb mind your wife and daughter probably did the same with other men abd boys coz they also cannot control it just come naturally we all humans <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Is she going to be very happy being under a single mother? Even if you ever gain custody, will she be happy learning that your divorce was because of your affair with another woman?<br><br>Have the courage and admit that you committed adultery with another woman and its solely your fault. Don't use your wife's shortcomings to justify your actions. You made a mistake, now admit it like a man instead of blaming it on your wife not giving face in front of other people etc.<br><br>Oh ignore the above post, if you are just a crapping, hormonal teenage boy who wants to post this for fun  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , and i will praise you for crapping for so long  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
