            <div class='col-md body'>This reply is to dedicate for ppls who thinking of having sex in casual way (No intention to reply Ding's msg):<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Anyone, anywhere, of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected, but you're at greatest risk if you:<br><br>Have <strong>unprotected sex with multiple partners</strong>. You're at risk whether you're heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual. <strong>Unprotected sex means having sex without using a new latex or polyurethane condom every time.</strong><br>Have unprotected sex with someone who is HIV-positive.<br>Have another sexually transmitted disease, such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea or bacterial vaginosis.<br>Share needles during intravenous drug use.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Aids developed</span></strong><br>Normally, white blood cells and antibodies attack and destroy foreign organisms that enter your body. This response is coordinated by white blood cells known as CD4 lymphocytes. Unfortunately, these lymphocytes are also the main targets of HIV, which attaches to the cells and then enters them. Once inside, the virus inserts its own genetic material into the CD4 lymphocytes and uses the material to make copies of itself.<br><br>When the new copies of the virus break out of the host cells and enter your bloodstream, they search for other cells to attack. In the meantime, the old host cells die. The cycle repeats itself again and again. In the process, more than 10 billion new HIV particles are produced every day. To counter this huge virus production, your immune system turns out as many as 2 billion new CD4 cells daily.<br><br>Eventually, however, the virus wins this race. The number of CD4 cells in your body progressively decreases, and you develop severe immune deficiency, which means your body can't effectively fight off viruses and bacteria that cause disease.<br><br></div>

At first I was scared.. first time i truly understand what's aids is and it can suffered my family... My dad stop contacting tat woman (worry he might transmitt the disease to her... wat abt my family?!) My mum like an angel treated him well without any complaint without any gruges... visited him everyday at SG CDCS, can you imagine a young girl like me visiting tat holy place every week and that woman where is she.... none of existence.. worst my dad pass away... what more worse, my mum is a victim... my dad pass AIDS to her, she's totally a victim truly worse victim ever... my family almost broken in term of emotion... financially and my upbringing (i was only 15 at that time)... a year later of my dad's death... my mum gone...

Didn't realise he having an affair with her for quite a while and my mum knows... so do I, tot you are smart to cover all your acts... you are wrong, we seem it in our eyes, it just a matter whether we wan to keep the perfect mood in our family therefore we are slience to what my dad's action... late coming home, hardly talk and alway lock himself in the room. Finally, paper can't wrap the fire, it was the chinese new year... suppose to be "yi jia tuan yuan", but my dad give a lame excuses... "sorry... My boss giving me tons of work" My mum, a kind hearted huang lian bo, spending her whole live being housewife educate me well... my mum bring me to "chun dao he pan" to walk around and feel the mood of new year... shit thing happens, saw my dad with this great figure gentle lady... with spec hug together standing in front of the "cai shen ye" Kaoz... my nightmare begins... my dad wanna divorce with my mum...  my mum thinking of the family and refuse to do so... and what happen.. he bring the woman home... Yes tat woman is a nice lady, gentle... sweet but everything is useless she's an angel with a knife tearing apart my family... my mum's faith for my dad.... GOSH, tats not the worst thing... my dad wants me to follow him, as in he want my custody... wah lau, you think i can tolerate that let my mum suffered... I can't lor... besides my dad image totally trashed, he makes me hate men and a conclusion men are just an animal who hunger for sex.<br><br>WORST THING HAPPEN, my dad diagnosis of AIDS, he become weaker and weaker as times goes by... At first I was scared.. first time i truly understand what's aids is and it can suffered my family... My dad stop contacting tat woman (worry he might transmitt the disease to her... wat abt my family?!) My mum like an angel treated him well without any complaint without any gruges... visited him everyday at SG CDCS, can you imagine a young girl like me visiting tat holy place every week and that woman where is she.... none of existence.. worst my dad pass away... what more worse, my mum is a victim... my dad pass AIDS to her, she's totally a victim truly worse victim ever... my family almost broken in term of emotion... financially and my upbringing (i was only 15 at that time)... a year later of my dad's death... my mum gone... (you know why my mum gone?? she can be alive with medical support but she choose not to be cos we are totally broke... can't even afford to eat $2 laksa at tat time.... and the cool part i heard from my aunt... tat woman also contact AIDS... she's gone after my mum's death...  what happen to me?! been moving house... no relative want me.. my cousin wanna cheat my mum's CPF, dude pls dun make your daughter follow my footpath... I have seen a broken family and trust me your daughter's heart will harden as times goes if you do this to her... harden no feeling to men no feeling to thing around her...<br><br>sibeh song right tot having new affair bring excitment to your life... comparing your love one and thinking this is your "yan fu" Mister... as a daughter point of view.. try being an adult and responsible to your act.. .I can't believe you been thinking you are the victim... the worst is not yet come and it comes... it totally trash your family... I would like suggest you give up on your daughter, let her follow her mother... dun make her think you are the worst kind in her life and dun let her follow your footstep...<br><br>=======================================================<br>conclusion from my personal view of you: you are an hopeless human and it's an insulting to call yourself human.</div></blockquote>Hi craser, i'm really sorry to see that happened to you. I hope you will be more cheerful now.. I was stunned when i read your story.<br><br>I hope the topic starter, you better think about your family instead of having sex with other girls. you will never know what will happen to u. Please think for your family, dont just think for yourself.</div>
