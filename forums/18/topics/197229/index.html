            <div class='col-md body'>Guys out here let's tell everyone what kind of cheapest girl you ever dated. I go first.<br><br>When I was still in my early 20's, I dated a girl called Jane ( Not her real name ). we were dating like abt a year and one day through one of my good brother who told me that he saw my gf hugging and kissing another guy at parkway. Ok end of part 1<br><br>here comes part 2<br><br>one day Jane told me that she is pregnant and the funniest part is I always used a condom and cut story short, She finally confessed that the baby belongs to the guy my brother saw. Cuz the guy is ditching her after knowing she is pregnant and the funniest part is she tries to push me to be the baby's father and even funnier part is she tried to borrow 1K from me for abortion which in turn I threw all her clothes and belongings onto the streets and one tight slap across her slut face. Guys, next time if gf runs up to you say she is pregnant, make sure the baby is yours and not others. Nowdays, girls are very good at this. Pregnant liao quickly make love with you then let you cum inside then you cannot run liao. For safety, bring her go DNA check. It's not abt a matter of trust liao even a normal girl nowdays will do that and you know something that happen to my friend? I console him and ask him to ditch the cheap girl. Cuz after so many years, my friend then found out the baby who he called Joshua is not his real son but another guy's one.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>If GF is pregnant, make her go for DNA check and if she refuse, ditch her and find another.<br><br>*** Why I bring my early 20's story up is because yesterday, When i was driving, i alight my GF at the bus stop to meet her mother and I saw Jane with 2 kids alone waiting for the bus. The husband is nowhere in sight. 1 of the baby is still in a pram. I wazs sitting in the car smoking while waiting for my GF and we saw each other and she did try to say hi but I pretend i never see her and continue to smoke.</div>
