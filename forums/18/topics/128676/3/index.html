Some may just treat sex casually.

            <div class='col-md body'>I had the same experience before but jus that i am in the girl's shoe while my ex was in your shoe. I had mixed feelings about her initially, and especially after sex which i feel was detrimental to our relationship later on but her persistance and patient with me moved me.<br><br>I dunno whether i pitied her or i really loved her but throughout the time with her, i was enjoying every min of it. She made me fulfill all my childhood dreams as a couple. We did the childish-est of things as well as the loviest of things. I sang her the silliest of songs yet she totally appreciates it, hows that for confidence boasting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But, how secure would u feel when ur gf is someone whom is willingly to be in a sexual r/s before a r/s is even there yeT. Just this thot terrifies me. It made me feel that if she can go to bed with me that easily, she could go to bed with anyone. Pardon my ignorance but i really regret feeling that way that time. My lack of confidence then cost me someone whom i truely thinks can be my one and only gf now.<br><br>If i can go back time, i would not hesitate to love her more than i did. Now that i heard that she is doing pretty well, i feel good for her.<br><br>How foolish now when we think back what we did in the past. So to coolfox, i hope that you must love this someone whole heartedly before going on to the next level (sexual). If not, this r/s may just be build on lust and not respect, which is truely the bedrock to a successful r/s.<br><br>Gd luck~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
