            <div class='col-md body'>Hello coolfox<br><br>I frankly do not understand what you asking in the topic.  First you say you are the one not into this relationship.  Next you say she is the one not into this relationship.  Question is if she want to be in this relationship with you, will you?  Mostly wont because you have say you are lack of commitement.  If that is the case why will you want to know? Or maybe it is what you want to know, like does she love you or you are just a spare?  If that is the case, why dont you go ahead and ask her?<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coolfox:</div><div class="quote_body">if a girl you have been dating (but she hasnt agreed to be your gf), have sex with  you, do u think she loves you?<br><br>Okay, this is about me. I have been dating this pretty girl for a few months, and things have been very good initially. But a lack of commitement is making me confused and i just don;t know what to make of this relationship.<br><br>And she is a nice innocent girl, who dun club or smoke. So is she insecure about me, and that's why she is not ready for a relationship? or is it because she is waiting for someone better? I really don;t know anymore.<br><br>Or maybe it is my reputation, cos i have attracted quite a number of girls in school, and among my social circle, but gosh, i have always been devoted to her. And i am sure i showed it thru my words and actions.<br><br>So what then is wrong? I think only girls can help me to really understand a woman's mind. ...<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

But actually he might not feel the same way. So he presents his view of the whole r/s thing and put the issue onto the girl that she is freely offering him s*x.<br><br>But then without know both parties, any further comments would be pretty useless.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys, hmmm altho i am relatively new to this forum in terms of contribution, but<br><br>1) I am certainly not imagining things in a private cell at woodbridge<br>2) I am certainly no pathetic guy trying to gain the empathy of gerls.<br>3) I am confused about the relationship with this girl. You can say we are modern age bf/gf, becos we don date anybody else, and we do all the couple stuff together, but unlike a real bf/gf, staying long term is something we have not confirmed yet<br>4) I am unsure whether she really love me enough to want to commit. she certainly likes me. but Love? i am not sure anymore.<br>5) I am perturbed because i am no longer sure about where this relationship is going.<br><br>Perhaps raising this in a forum, is a way to recoucile my inner thoughts. I dunno. And perhaps i am hoping that soemone in a similar situation can share abt it.<br><br>2 heads are better than one anyway.</div>

Of cos sex is excitingly good, but to me, the emotional part is even more important.<br><br>I had quite a no. of ex, and at this age where i'm graduating soon, i think it's time to be more settled down. I dun particularly enjoy flings anymore. </div></blockquote>no prob <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ur situation is similar to mine some time back.. though things didnt work out between me and him, i wish u luck..<br><br>look at it in this way, how do u measure love?? different pple have different ways of loving.. it may not seem that she loves u enough, but then to her, u might be her everything.. u have relationships before, u shld know that u will only know how much u love that person when u lose that person.. .. .. *ouch*<br><br>There's always  a risk in love, but if u dun try, u'll never know if it can be something.. Good that u wan to settle down, how i wish my ex was like that.. haiz.. out of point.. .. u are still young, there's still alot of things to see and explore. and seriously, the transition from student to work is very very big.. Work changes pple alot.. and i mean ALOT.. it's scary to see pple u know jus change without them knowing.. becoming bitter and cynic abt life.. what i'm tryin to say that u're in a transition phase now, it's good that u wan to settle down, but ur idea of settlin down might change as u get into the working world...<br><br>Still no pain, no gain.. jus go for it.. and look on the bright side (though not too nice), if it doesn work out, at least u had great sex :p not a great consolation but still better than nothing..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Coolfox, tompion has given some really sound advice. Just to reinforce, it's very true that if a girl gives you sex, you're more than a friend. Although not necessarily a bf, not yet anyway.<br><br>Very often in love you have to take risks. Take the emotional plung so to speak. You have to put yourself in a position where you may get hurt before you can truly love. Can't expect a girl to trust you emotionally either if your defenses are always up as well.<br><br>Take the chance and if you realise she's really not worth it, be glad that you gave yourself a chance to make it happen. At least you tried so no regrets. Just move on and be ready for the nest peson to enter your life.<br><br>And don't listen to some of the idiots here, they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Some of them are just jealous too and are just trying to put you down as they're losers with nothing better to do.<br><br>These idiots are people who don't realise that, <strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">"If it doesn't happen to you, it doesn't mean it won't happen to someone else."</span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi SumOne and Tampion,<br><br>Yes i am grateful for both u girls' advice ( Tampion is a gerl, but i am not sure about SumOne). I've been thinking about this issue lately, and today i decided to have a heart to heart talk about our relationship at the right opportunity and timing. Hopefully, it can clear away the doubts in my mind, and make things even better for us.<br><br>I am sure this will be better for her too. And although sex is always tempting, but  i am not going to be obessed about it because it is just not my style. I loved her and i want to continue to love her in the best way i can, provided i have a chance and she is really sure about me. I know she is unsure, because she is still have doubts about some differences. But I know i can become a good bf for her, i hope she just can be her old self again, the one i fell in love with. I just hope she can be a even more beautiful person on the inside, that i can love and cherish.<br><br>Then things will be wonderful. =)<br><br>Thanks once again =)<br><br>p/s: for those who have said less pleasant stuff about me and my girl, i just wish to say that i dont blame you for ur comments. Soemtimes, it just happen in the internet. But pls dun insult her, as my girl is really a pretty girl, and although we have sex, it is something we both wanted, and enjoy. It is not about being bad or wad, it is a modern choice, and we have made that choice.</div>

Put yrself in her shoes, she have sex with you, you doubt her feelings, motive, intention, char and you publish your story in a forum.<br><br>How would you feel???<br><br>I personally felt that you lack the respect for the ger, and therefore raises doubts and questions on yr feelings for her...<br><br>And for that, we feel that you are not responsible and you are just out for sex...<br><br>My opinion, my feelings...<br><br>I pity the ger...<br><br>Cherish her...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lunzbb, pls dun make ur own judgement if u dun see the whole light of the situation. if i say that i really love her wholeheartedly, would u believe me?<br><br>I am unsure, because she gives me mixed signals. I want the best for both of us, cos i cherish her happiness. And as i said before, i posted this here to seek better opinions. and most importantly, to put my own thoughts in words.<br><br>but anyway thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun think there's a HUGE problem in engaging in sex be4 being "official" in a reln, not that i advocate it. i mean... things have different ways of flowing, and it's not necessarily true that a couple that gets to know each other for 3 years, date for 5 years, marry and sex after that will be happy ever after.<br><br>i dun see a need to question "why like this?" but rather "what can it be?"<br><br>which is probably wat u're doing too i hope.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
