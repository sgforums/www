But as he was trying to hang himself in his South Yorkshire home, the police said his son walked in and stopped him.<br><br>Llyod was arrested and the police discovered a cache of more than 100 stilettos hidden in black bags under the floorboards of his office.<br><br>The police revealed that some of the shoes belonged to the women Lloyd attacked and suspect that he may have had several other victims who have not been identified.<br><br>Also in his collection were jewellery and personal effects, as well as hundreds of pairs of pantyhose.<br><br>Lloyd pleaded guilty in a Sheffield Crown Court to four counts of rape and two counts of attempted rape.<br><br>As he was led from the courtroom, one of his victims shouted out 'Rot in hell!', reported The Times.<br><br>A judge has deferred sentencing in the case, pending the completion of psychiatric tests. - AP.</div>
