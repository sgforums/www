            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.firstlight.net/~chythar/manawolf/articles/shavbar.GIF"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It seems only clean-shaven women are allowed to be beautiful. It is the height of unattractiveness to be the slightest bit fuzzy.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Your body naturally grows darkened hair.  It's a sign of maturity.  Only children have naturally light or transparent body hair, and everyone's body hair darkens or thickens to some extent with puberty.  It's a clear sign of growing up, of reaching adulthood, substantially no different from developing breasts.   But what does society tell women to do?  Shave it off!  And yet do so while wearing butt-high miniskirts and necklines that drop down to our bellybuttons.  What message could that possibly send?<br><br>I think all this results in a very strong, pervasive message that a mature woman can't be beautiful.  She has to be childlike to be sexually attractive.  And this societal restriction carries with it the implication that women are children, with all the disempowerment that implies.  (I do not see the same message implicit in male shaving becaus it is socially acceptable for men to do whatever they want with their facial hair, and should the same ever be said for women, I would no longer hold any objections, and cheerfully resign this page to archival status.)<br><br>Is saying all this going a bit far?  Perhaps a little.  But do try and tell me you DON'T see those messages in American culture.  It is perpetuated in media, by movie stars, by advertisements, by Barbie dolls.  Shaving is just another element of the oppression of women through societal brainwashing.  Now, I know that not everyone who shaves or perfers shaven women think this way, but from my observations and experience, that is the original mentality behind the practice.  If you prefer the aesthetics of smooth legs, that's one thing - I just don't want to be told that I'm not beautiful, intelligent or clean because I don't remove my natural body hair.<br>I don't ask that you be attracted to unshaven women, heavens no!  I'm just pissed off at the pervading cult of one type of beauty.  I have been known to defend people who draw childlike individuals expressing sexuality (Hi Taral!) - my objection is not that women, or that people in general should not be portrayed as childlike.  That aesthetic, while it bothers many people, has a beauty of its own as well.  My objection is when only one standard is acceptable or portrayed as beautiful.  Movies, magazines, television, advertisements - one vision of beauty, rejecting all others.  Men are subject to this as well - but not so far as shaving goes, not to such an extreme degree.  That is where this page steps in.<br><br>One of the things that bugs me the most is the implication/assumption that women who don't shave aren't clean.  The equation of shaving with good hygene is not only insulting to women, but insulting to the intelligence of the person who makes such a claim.  What is it about body hair that is unclean?  Clean men have body hair.  Why is it inconcievable that clean women should have body hair?  You can wash and brush your hair, use deodorant, dress nicely, manicure your nails, brush your teeth, etc., yet if you don't spend half an hour in the tub burning your legs with chemicals or scraping a razor over them you are suddenly unwomanly and disgusting.  Give me a proverbial break.<br><br>When in middle school (the bastardization of junior high and elementary, usually grades 6-8 ), I was ruthlessly teased for this independant practice, and somewhat ostracized.  This was probably partly due to the fact that not only did I not shave, but my natural body hair is very thick and dark.  I knuckled in once, then decided it simply wasn't worth the effort.  After that, I continued shaving my underarms, under the rationalization deodorant works better if you apply it directly to skin.  Then I learned better.  If you bathe often, as you should, odor won't accumulate enough so that shaving is neccessary (with exception for unusual body chemistry).  And besides, armpit hair can make pretty little swirlies once it's all grown out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I still suffer occaional ostracization, critical looks, etc.  I can't wear sleeveless tops to any professional work environment.  And yes, that's the choice I've made.  But I fight the single-minded ideal of beauty when I can.<br><br>If you CHOOSE to shave, that's your business.  I accept that smooth skin is an aesthetic all on it's own.  And I understand the peer pressure young women can be under; I won't begrudge a young lady the wish to avoid harassment in swimming class or the gym.  But it is an utterly bogus social standard.  You need to make your own decision.  Don't shave just because all the other girls do it.  Don't shave because it seems like you have no other choice.  Don't shave because all the pretty ladies on TV are shaven.  Look at what you're saying and what you're participating in when you reach for that razor.  Then, choose to shave or not to shave based on your own, personal reasons.<br><br>Of course, I encourage you to stand up against society.  Revel in your natural beauty!  Be a crusader for women's bodies au naturelle!  Feel the rush of pride when a stranger compliments you (it's happened to me), and comments on how few women have unshaven legs!  I've taken the rough road, and the rewards are many. </span><br><br><a href="http://www.firstlight.net/~chythar/manawolf/articles/shave.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstlight.net/~chythar/manawolf/articles/shave.htm</a></div>
