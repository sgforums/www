            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not an expert in getting drunk, or recovering from break-up, but I seriously think that all getting drunk will achieve is to give her a hammering headache. I think that what she needs now is to engage in activities to get her mind off the guy. Maybe you can bring her to movies, or arcade games, or even the Science Centre - things that will make her think, occupy her mind, so that she does not think about him. Additionally, you can encourage or bring her for swimming, jogging, cycling, etc. I think it's a wonder what some exerciese will do : give her a high, as well as help her sleep more soundly at night.<br><br>Maybe you can work out bringing her to the Science Centre in the morning, and then cycling in the afternoon. Next time, bring her to the arcade game and after that swimming, or something like that.<br><br>Personally, I thot that she would want someone to talk it over with, to listen to her gripes, heartaches, etc. However, since this does not seem to be the case, I therefore suggested Plan B above.<br><br></div>
