            <div class='col-md body'>Hello people, I'm new here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">-links removed-</span><br><br><blockquote>Comprehending Engineers - Take One<br><br>Two engineering students were walking across campus when one<br>said,<br><br>"Where did you get such a great bike?"<br>The second engineer replied,<br>"Well, I was walking along yesterday minding my own business<br>when a<br>Beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw the bike to the<br>ground,<br>took off all her<br><br>clothes and said, "Take what you want."<br>The second engineer nodded approvingly,<br><br>"Good choice; the clothes wouldn't have fit anyway."<br><br>Lesson: Don't bother to drop even the most obvious hint, they<br>can't<br>catch anyway.<br><br>(This is a reality! If you don't believe, test them!)<br><br>Comprehending Engineers - Take Two<br><br>To the optimist, the glass is half full. To the pessimist, the<br>glass<br>half empty. To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it<br>needs to<br>be.<br><br>Lesson: There is no philosophy to talk abt but calculations and<br><br>calculations...<br><br>Comprehending Engineers -Take Three<br><br>A pastor, a doctor, and an engineer were waiting one morning<br>for a<br>particularly slow group of golfers.<br>The engineer fumed, "What's with these guys? We must have been<br>waiting<br>for 15 minutes!"<br>The doctor chimed in, "I don't know, but I've never seen such<br>ineptitude".<br>The pastor said, "Hey, here comes the greens keeper. Let's have<br>a word<br>with him." "Hi John. Say, what's with that group ahead of us?<br>They're<br>rather slow, aren't they?"<br><br>The greens keeper replied, "Oh, yes, that's a group of blind<br>firefighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a<br>fire<br>last year, so we always let them play for free anytime."<br>The group was silent for a moment.<br><br>Then the pastor said, "That's so sad I think I will say a<br>special<br>prayer<br>for<br><br>them tonight."<br>The doctor said, "Good idea. And I'm going to contact<br>myophthalmologist<br>buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them."<br><br>The engineer, after much thought said, "Why can't these guys<br>play at<br>night?"<br><br>Lesson: No emotions please, only practicality works here.<br><br>Comprehending Engineers -Take Four<br><br>What is the difference between Mechanical Engineers and Civil<br>Engineers?<br><br>Mechanical Engineers build weapons; Civil Engineers build<br>targets.<br><br>Lesson: They build and build and build and build and... to<br>compliment<br>one another.<br><br>Comprehending Engineers -Take Five<br><br>Three engineering students were gathered together discussing<br>the<br>possible designers of the human body.<br>One said, "It was a mechanical engineer. Just look at all the<br>joints."<br>Another said, "No, it was an electrical engineer. The nervous<br>system<br>has<br>many thousands of electrical connections."<br>The last said, "Actually it was a civil engineer. Who else<br>would run a<br>toxic waste<br><br>pipeline through a recreational area?"<br><br>Lesson: All of them have their own theories. None for<br>believing!<br><br>Comprehending Engineers -Take Six<br><br>"Normal people believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br>Engineers<br>believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features<br>yet."<br><br>Lesson: They are complicated and twisted.<br><br>Comprehending Engineers -Take Seven<br><br>An architect, an artist, and an engineer were discussing<br>whether it was<br>better to spend time with a wife or a mistress.<br>The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife, building a<br>solid<br>foundation for an enduring relationship.<br>The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because of<br>the<br>passion and mystery he found there. The engineer said, "I like<br>both."<br><br>"Both?" "Yeah," replied the engineer. "If you have a wife and a<br>mistress, they will each assume you are spending time with the<br>other<br>woman, and you can go to the lab and get some work done."<br><br>Lesson: Gals, NEVER fall for an engineer!!!<br><br>Comprehending Engine! ers - Take Eight<br><br>An engineer was crossing a road one day when a frog called out<br>to him<br>and<br><br>said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess."<br>He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket. The<br>frog<br>spoke up again<br><br>and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful<br>princess, I<br>will stay with you for one week."<br>The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and<br>returned<br>it to the pocket. The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and<br>turn me<br>back into a beautiful princess I'll stay with you and do<br>ANYTHING you<br>want."<br>Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it and put it<br>back into<br>his pocket. Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've<br>told you<br>I'm a beautiful princess, that I'll stay with you for a week<br>and do<br>anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?" The engineer said,<br>"Look I'm<br>an engineer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a TALKING<br>frog,<br>now<br>that's cool!<br><br>Lesson: Once again, gals, NEVER fall for an engineer!!!!!<br><br>===============================================================<br><br>Now we know why so many engineers are single. ahahaha...<br><br>Engineers,<br><br>please don't be offended, this is just a joke, we all know you<br>are<br>GREAT<br>people. 8-)<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>Strange But True(EXTRACTED FROM THE WEB)<br>The two-foot long bird called a Kea that lives in New Zealand likes to eat the strips of rubber around car windows!<br><br>Most lipstick contains fish scales!<br><br>Scepticisms is the longest word that alternates hands when typing!<br><br>One ragweed plant can release as many as one billion grains of pollen!<br><br>It's illegal to drink beer out of a bucket while you're sitting on a curb in St. Louis!<br><br>The first product to have a bar code was WrigleyÂ’s gum!<br><br>No piece of square dry paper can be folded more than 7 times in half!<br><br>A group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; a group of geese in the air is a skein!<br><br>Over 2500 left handed people a year are killed from using products made for right handed people!<br><br>There are more than 10 million bricks in the Empire State Building!<br><br>If you counted 24 hours a day, it would take 31,688 years to reach one trillion!<br><br>Taphephobia is the fear of being buried alive!<br><br>A crocodile always grows new teeth to replace the old teeth!<br><br>The sun is 330,330 times larger than the earth!<br><br>Clinophobia is the fear of beds!<br>A 'jiffy' is an actual unit of time for 1/100th of a second!<br><br>Porcupines float in water!<br><br>Pinocchio is Italian for "pine eye"!<br><br>The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog." uses every letter of the alphabet!<br><br>The average life span of a major league baseball is 5-7 pitches!<br><br>The Mint once considered producing doughnut-shaped coins!<br><br>The only 15 letter word that can be spelled without repeating a letter is "uncopyrightable"!<br><br>The longest recorded flight of a chicken is 13 seconds!<br><br>The sloth (a mammal) moves so slowly that green algae can grow undisturbed on its fur!<br><br>Cat urine glows under a black-light!<br><br>The world's termites outweigh the world's humans 10 to 1!<br><br>The electric chair was invented by a dentist!<br><br>Windmills always turn counter-clockwise.
