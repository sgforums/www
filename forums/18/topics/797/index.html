Say pokie, never put in a few examples to show us  :p<br><br>HC hmmm, can't say much cos i haven't been going there for long long time liao...<br><br>ok, Geylang hahahaha, this is where i turned expert. Do rememeber mr hata-san here have part time there before, in one of the house. Can't say which one exactly as i might be banned for promoting vices here among impressionable youths.<br>Ok, a few reasons why Geylang is a good place to go if u want to relax and wind down after a hard day at the office.<br><br>a) Quality. Here, i m generalizing...but according to my working eperience there, the quality check is very stingent!! Aboslutely!!<br>First, the agent went straight to the import counrty and inspect all the goods personally.Both outside and inside aspect are taken into account. They make sure there is no broken and damaged goods...as well as goods with hidden baggages. When all QC measures are fulfilled will they allow the importing of the goods.<br><br>b) Fulfill the stringent criteria of MOH.<br>All goods went thru the medical examinations to ensure that they are non toxic and safe for consumption by the above 21 SG males. regular spot checks are conducted by the MOH personnels to ensure tip top condition and no prospect of diesase spreading. Any goods found infected will be removed from the shelf immediately. Ditto for the whole batch of goods found on the same shelf. Customers' safety is the buzz word in this industry.<br><br>c) satisfaction guranteed!!!<br>In this industry, customer satisfaction is taken to a whole new level. In the house, u are the master, nurse, dog, slave...choose ur pick. U are always correct and if the goods are found to be defective or unsatisfactory in someways, the agents there will be willingly to compenstate u. After all, regular customers make up the bulk of the business and they are given tip top service and complains are deal with promptly.<br><br>d) easy accessiblity.<br>ample parking space and spacious lounge in the house for inspection of goods. U can't miss the place and best of all, we accept advance booking and most credit cards. Dont worry, we practise discreet billings, for we understand that the customers always demand privacy of for their biz transaction.<br><br>e) E commerce. We are moving with the flow and heeding the advise of our PM. our website will be going up shortly and goods will be paraded online. We are thinking of having advance booking over the net and some other fringe benefits for our regular customers...like phone sex, amateur pics from local lians ands toilet or bathrooms voyuer shots. However, due to current law restrictions, we have decided to make this RA and install the Sexkey and Watch Nanny into our server. We do believe in up holding the morality of SG society and our services are only open to the discerning gentlemen who requires such specialized services.<br><br>Do check it out guys. U have my email address and interestd parties and contact me thru there.<br>P.S. hey terence, i need some help setting up my own biz. Interested in being a partner in my venture. I have bold visions and i promise we sure can make it big.<br>cheers.<br><br>"All writing is essentially bricks of plagarism secured in place<br>by the mortar of original thinking."<br>--William Dukane<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree to the enterprise in principle. a lot of details need to be worked out.<br><br>1. targeted customers/clientele:<br>if you want to operate from the internet, you'll restrict your potential market to net savy people. is the market big enough?<br><br>2. costumes and other fetishes:<br>we have to cater to all taste and inclination. hata-san, you'll have to make trips to costume shops for a variety of outfits - nurse, maid, air stewardess, leather cat suits, PVC suits, school uniforms, police uniforms (personal fave) etc. hata, you'll also have to make some business trips to thailand for handcuffs, whips, drills, dentist chairs, chain shackles, racks, chain saws and exploding candles etc.<br><br>3. delivery of service:<br>we can provide door to door pleasure but must bear in mind those who don't want to do it at home in case the wife finds out. as such we must have a stable of rooms available. i think your contacts at geylang will help here.<br><br>4. quality:<br>probably the most important. remember, not all men like their girls pretty - some have fetishes for the matronly-types, school teacher-types, ogre-types etc. you can 'quality check' this group, whilst i 'quality check' the conventionally beautiful ones.<br><br>5. fixing of rates and commission:<br>a bit tricky - by the hour? what about the door to door service - how much do we charge? must work out expenses. also, the touchy subject of commission - i think 40% is reasonable don't you? do we split the 40% 50-50?<br><br>6. transportation:<br>i don't think using my father's car will be a good idea. i want a mini-bus with a mini-bar with our company's logo painted on the side. the interior should be funky purple and seats of suede. cougar or tiger prints may be considered too. i think installing a disco ball with funky lighting will be a good idea.<br><br>7. company name:<br>several suggestions,<br>a. the fruit cupboard<br>b. shag-on-move<br>c. the red bed<br>d. a brim full of orgasm<br>e. dream cream<br>f. the net pet<br>g. ministry of pleasure<br>h. or just plain old T &amp; H Pte.
