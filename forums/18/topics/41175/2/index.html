Everyone has their own individual reason.  If older men can go to places frequented by young epople so that they may chat up to younger, nubile ladies, why can't older women go to the ame places to check out young hunks?  After all, if young women like you are not going there to touch the strappin' young lads, it's open season for them, right?<br><br>All right, dress sense may be a factor like you've mentioned.  But is that the key factor in going out?  So, it's down to respecting another person's reasons no matter what, unless those reasons are affecting you directly.
