            <div class='col-md body'>Haha NUS again, ever since i know their donation drive is mostly for NUS to get money to invest in itself, it has since turn me off so much, i have vowed nvr to donate to NUS.<br><br>Last time when i have bothered to ask what is the donation for, that freshie got the audacity to tell me, Oh it is to invest in our so future generation by building some new building in NUS inself. Sounded so damn proud of it as well as if it is NUS 's rights to do so. This is like robbing the poor to help the rich. Especially so at that time when it was made public that NUS has just brought Hitachi Tower for investment.</div>
