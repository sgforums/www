            <div class='col-md body'>Background: Small Library of a study institution<br>..<br><br>I met my classmate, she was the same module mate..I fondled my test papers again and again...I realized that the best surprises are those that are unexpected, so I took my courage and walk over to her to speak to her..she was photostating some documents..I walked past her desk, containing her things, and saw that she had too much nonsense stuck inside them.<br><br>I bravely got forward and asked her.."So is there any class today"<br>"Yes" she said, why not. She gave me a light smile with her eyes<br>through her small glass frames, before they flashed with a downward cast<br><br>"I like to show you something.." I said<br>"Show me what?" She smiled "I've seen it all before"<br><br>A sudden gush of blood ran through my face. I turned my headback<br>to see a stranger at his desk. She continued to smiled at me.<br>I took her hands and told her to follow me. The librarian wasnt<br>too concerned about us and my heart was beating very fast.<br><br>We walked out of the library and entered a staircase lobby.<br>I told her to show me her bra top. She pulled up her blouse<br>just to show me her decorative bra...<br><br>She told me to wait here alone in the lobby and I agreed. She<br>got out and took some tissuepaper from the ladies and hurried<br>to me.<br><br>She knelt down and opened her mouth..her hands grasping my groin<br><br>I thought to myself in chinese....IF<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This time round, I was in the classroom, it was the evening classes<br>again. The subject was interesting, the guys were thought-provoking<br>but there was one lady whom interests me.<br><br>I walked around, concerned about the subject, I asked about<br>her age, her job etc, saw her teethy smiles and I imagined myself<br>fondling her breasts..I realized that only mothers have lactating bosoms.<br>She shook her leg as she responded.<br><br>The lecturer had gone out for a while. Probably to escape the potential cries<br>of hungry men and women in heat. Strange pounding noises came<br>from a construction site just outside.<br><br>"Do you know integration?" ask the fella sitting on the back row<br>"I have forgotten about that already." I said. I pondered at his<br>handwriting when suddenly there was a loud beeping sound. A handphone<br>was ringing and it came from the young lady.<br><br>War? her lover? her parents? She picked up her phone and for a few<br>seconds and she seemed to be listening to a voice..then she switched it off.<br><br>The ceiling lights suddenly went off. It became total darkness.<br>A man's voice screamed in the air, I realized it was me.<br><br>Grumbling noises followed, surprise, humour, anxiety, were all<br>among there. I took a seat in the darkness when then I was grabbed<br>by someone...the next thing I know was that I was smelling something<br>that seems like a day's workload of sweat. My bottom was being touched<br>by two hands and before I know my groin was being molested by fingers<br>that went beneath my shirt.<br><br>I tried and tried to say something but it was too late, my face<br>was buried deep in someone's bosom and I completely froze.<br><br>The lights went up again..I was relieved, what was to my horror<br>was the person before me..it was the young lady.<br><br>I was absolutely surprised until I realised an old indian saying:<br><br>"A mosquito feeds on blood, and mosquitoes have more courage<br>than any man"<br><br>I pushed her gently away..somehow no one else seemed to care or<br>interfere. What was going on? Did she think that I was the moon?<br>I shoved her fingers away from my shirt, quickly adjusting<br>my attire with my thumbs..and then I understood an old taiwanese saying:<br><br>"Two mothers are like two thumbs, they allow communication"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bravo LIES &amp; MORE LIES by Exquisite Chocolate<br>============================================<br><br>My wife entered the room. There she took off her clothes. I sat on the bed and watched with sadness. I fiddled my wedding ring as she finally took off her bra. She walked over to me and pulled my underwear. "You know I dont like to do this alone" I told her. She looked at me with her beautiful eyes before her fingers grasped on my penis. I exhaled a sigh of relief. I felt vulnerable .. I closed my eyes and I began to think of many things. I slowly whispered her name when memories &amp; concerns flooded back into my mind - the children, her parents, my parents, my tiring job, the expensive car, the utility bills, the tv set, the laundry, the computer, the dust &amp; dirt, the noisy neighbours, the old newspapers, her bothersome brother, her friends, my friends, the horrible smoke from the wok, the insurance, the lonely evening studies, the blurry eyesight, the up &amp; coming festivals and events, the smelly rubbish from the kitchen dustbin, the government, the medicine, and also her silly religious worships - "You feeling warm?" she asked "yes abit", I realized I am on an equatorial island, "NANYANG" I realized. Its always warm, humid &amp; sticky. She let off a bitter smile as my stickly material went out.<br><br>For a brief moment, I felt so sorry for myself. After she cleanse herself and me, she asked me if I wanted a cold drink. I told her many times that I dislike cold drinks. I told her to prepare a cup of warm milk for me - (I was very concerned with my health &amp; studies) I told her my clothes needed ironing and the fan needs cleaning. Did she remember to water the plants? I was about to cry when she went over to my side and rubbed my groin again. "This is not your toy" I told her. She grined and kissed me on the neck. "Put me back on the wheel chair!" I yelled at her. She threatened me that I oughto wash my underwear and socks all by myself. I closed my eyes as tears dropped off..oh that awful traffic accident..<br><br>"Oh the multitude of things" She cried. "Why are there so many things to worry about"<br><br>"If you dont listen to me, I will betray this country"<br><br>"If you betray this country you betray me"<br>She told me<br><br>"You know there is no job security in singapore..so the only security we have is ourselves..forget that union thing..just get down to business..besides..it contains protein and its quite healthy for you.."<br>I told her<br><br>She sat on the sofa and drank her glass of milk. The Tv watches her. "Is it war already?" she asked me. I sat besides her and I dared to rub my cock.<br><br>"have you watched...Forrest Gump?"<br><br>"..give me the money" she whispered.<br><br>&lt;To be continued&gt;<br><br></div>
