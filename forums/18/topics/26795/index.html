            <div class='col-md body'>no need to find out lar.. i tell u all i know.<br><br>the pill is a pill that contains a hormone which let's ur body think u are pregnant. in that sense ur body will not ovulate. without an ovum there's NO WAY u can get pregnant. from a contraceptive point of view it is 100%, but obviously not from a safe-sex point of view.<br><br>as for the side effects, u'd wanna be sure that u get accurate information. there are different types of pills out there suited for different women. the doctor will recommend one that's best for u. most women are ok when taking it, but yes, some do have side effects which are disastrous. i dare say this is rare, becos the pill is a very very very common and popular form of contraption, in sg i dunno but definitely overseas. my university frens in australia were on the pill and didn't even have a bf! "just in case" they quip.<br><br>as for the "safe period" which is otherwise referred to as the "rhythm method" involves counting the days of your cycle. in a typical 28 day cycle, the first day is when u ovulate. the 14th day is when u menstruate.<br><br>obviously the 1-7th day is dangerous. however if u wanna be technical, on the first day when u ovulate, the ovum still has to travel down the fallopian tubes to towards the uterus. and sperm typically has a life of 3 days in a woman's body. 3 days is not enuff time for the sperm to swim up from the vagina to meet the ovum that starts travelling from the ovaries at the same time. even if the sperm can reach, they may be too weak to penetrate the ovum to fertilise it.<br><br>and of course if the ovum isn't fertilised within a certain time, it too, dies. this usually occurs 1 or 2 days b4 u menstruate. but as for having sex, u sometimes dunno when exactly u are gonna have ur period, so how do u know it's safe to do it 2 days b4 it?<br><br>the safest time is DURING menstruation all the way till ovulation. so that would make it day 15-28. those are the two weeks that are considered the "safest". if u are the kind that finds it gross to have sex while u are menstruating, then that leaves u one week.<br><br>from a "pseudo" contraceptive point of view it's like that. but then a woman has different "horny" periods during her cycle, and not surprisingly it's at it's peak when u ovulate. that's the most dangerous period. this different levels of horniness is due to different levels of hormones released at different points of the menstrual cycle. when there's more testosterone, u will feel horny. that's rite, a woman has testosterone in her body too.<br><br>dun ask me which exact days a gal is more horny etc. i'm not dr feelgood!<br><br>and of course take all the above with a pinch of salt. every woman's body is different. i had a gf with a 60 day cycle. when i found out i was like WTF? but she said her doc say there's nothing wrong with her. but i was stressed trying to figure out the numbers... but she never got pregnant so i guess i got it right!<br><br>and to throw a spanner in the works, sometimes u wanna get pregnant and do everything the opp of the rhythm method and u just can't... life is like that lar.<br><br>anyway the rhythm method is not a good way. it's just a desperate way to reduce the chances of having a baby. go see a doc about the pill. it's not as bad as wat all the heresay is.</div>
