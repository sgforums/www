            <div class='col-md body'>Like the topic said, cause my gf is really starting to become like that. checks my hp... sees what i'm always doing... gets jeolous and aks lots of question about a girl even though it's just a friend... I know it seems normal to girls sometimes but i find that it's alittle too much. She'll always asks me to promise her to never leave her which i never did because I didn't want to make such a promise to her knowing I'll never know what's gonna happen in future. i love her still but i can't make such promises. It really bugs me about it. We've seen eachother quite alot of times in a week and the very next day, she'll call and says she misses me already. I feel like we've just seen eachother the day b4 n u're already missing me? She calls me everyday but like nothing to say like that. Then I'll be very bored too. I'm really in a stat of confusion right now. Anyone out there have any clue on what's going on? Is it me or her?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. u got to talk to her man communicate.. tell her how her actions make u feel and all...give her the true reasons y u cant promise to her that you will nvr leave her...if she's going to have any ideas of being with you forever then she has to understand. You love her right? Then reassure her.<br>About the phone calling and nothing to say part... i experience that too..haha..but if ur gf's calling u and u got nothing to say. the onli gentleman thing to do is to find something to talk about..unless u are genuinely busy theres nothing else u can do. She is you gf and she's putting aside time to call you. So you do the same. or else..if you dont feel like putting aside time for her...then u are not her type..or not ready to have a clingy gf ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have the same problem as u, but there is also another thread about it, though there is not much info as to why she thinks she is possessive.<br><br>Anyway I told off my gf, and said dont talk to me for 3 days, today is the 3rd day liao, so far so good. Sometimes i feel u need to assert your right for some personal space. if not, she will think that whatever u say can be ignored, and wont take u seriously in the future. U need to show her u really mean what u say!<br><br>Good luck!</div>
