Both of them are just downright disgusting, sickening, uncalled for.  If she treasures me as a friend she will not treat me such.  This friend actually I have thrown her in the rubbish bin, but she came crawling back.  and I blame myself for being soft to take her back.  She is that sort who don't treat females well but she treats males very well, and is very protective over the males.    males can give her sex, so this explains her behaviour/preference!!<br><br>she is rather sick in her mind, when we were at festival market, she saw caucasians, and she was feeling high already and she said she just sense the sort of XZQF (can't remember the word she used) passing thru them and she feel so shiok about it.  she said she loves caucasians than any other race.  she will fucckk any guy that come to her!!<br><br>This sort of friend is not for keep!!</div>

She is very aggressive, woo guys and guys don't give a damn to her.  men are scare away by her, caucasian men included.  her beloved caucasian bf can't stand her broke off with her but did make it clear why the break up.  she slept with other man when she was with this caucasian.  He already told and showed her no feelings for her she still told him she will always love him.  AFter break up she kept harassing the caucasian man to the extent the man got to instruct the telecom company to bar her from calling.  he is one of the many men she went after.    don't think any men can take her nuisance as she is very aggressive, bossy, possessive, childish.  Men told her she is a child who refuse to grow up.</div>
