She's old enough to already know what all of you are trying to tell her as your advice. The thing is, she wouldn't admit it, even to herself.<br>She's just trying to find an excuse to her mishap by taking the easy way out, i.e. labeling all guys as something something. After she has established that all guys ARE bastards like she said, then she will start feeling ok about herself once again.<br>I think this is a typical sorry case.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well learn from this lesson. Never hanky panky with a guy u just met. Get to know him better before u even kiss him. It is a fact of life, there are many players out there, u  just have to learn to distinguish them from the nice ones. Also don't use sex to hook a guy. U only cheapen yourself. Guys will also know which type of girls they can fool around.</div>
