When you are unfulfilled in your sex life it can lead to affairs, alienation from our partners, and emotional problems in your relationships. Sometimes all it takes is a few changes and you can improve your sex life and maybe your whole relationship.<br><br>Communication<br>Communication is very important in any relationship but a lot of times we don't talk about our sex life. Talk to your partner and let them know if you are unsatisfied or bored. Be open and honest in what you say and listen to what they have to say. Tell them anything you would like to try or change. Do not accuse, ignore their feels, or complain. Have a real loving conversation about ways to improve your sex life<br><br>Time for sex<br>Make time for sex. Remember morning or afternoon sex is just as much fun and sometimes better then evening sex. Instead of taking a shower or bath alone ask your partner to join you and wash your back for you. If you have children hire a babysitter for the night. If time alone isn't possible then try cuddling or passionately kissing. Take the time to connect with your partner physically.<br><br>Flirting<br>Remember how much fun it was flirting in the beginning of your relationship? Flirt with your partner like you did when you first met. Give them little hints that show them that you are attracted to them. Accidentally touch when you walk by or give them long sultry looks. Make your partner feel wanted.<br><br>Something New<br>Try out something new in your sex life. It could be something as simple as new underwear or a different room. Try out new positions or even just new sheets on your bed. Do something different and new to spice things up. Don't let your sex become routine.<br><br>Set the mood<br>Atmosphere is very important for sex. Set the mood for a relaxing and sexy time. You can't really get in the mood if you are worried about everything around you or your worries from the day. Make sure your usual place for sex is a relaxing place, light some candles and set the mood. Turn off all electronic devices to make sure you are not disturbed. Nothing is a mood killer more than the phone ringing and or your partner watching the TV instead of you.<br><br>Getting away from the house<br>If possible try getting away from the house for a night or even for just a few hours. Sometimes a new scenery will help improve sex. Book a bed and breakfast or hotel room for the night. Maybe even sneak out during your lunch hour to meet up with your partner.<br>Go BackReply to Omy<br><br>Go To Main Menu<br><br>| Forum Home | Latest Posts | Hottest Posts | Terms for Use<br>Powered by singportal.sg  (C)Copyright (R)All Rights Reserved<br>Owner by Chua Lye Huat (Ex Outram Sec Sch 1986)<br>Inspired by Our PM, Mr Lee Hsien Loong<br>(by Ways of Contributing back to the Society, the myCommunity forum has contributed A $1000 each to Outram Secondary School and Yuan Ching Secondary School on 9th of Nov 07 for the Needy Student Fund and bunny, a User from this forum had also donated her $50 from her DIY Jounals from SPH to her Greenridge Primary School too and I urge more to continue, especially those who is once a student to his/her mothers' Schools.
