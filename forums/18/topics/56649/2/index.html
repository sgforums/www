If all fail - let experience take over the teaching instead.<br><br>finally, she overcome it. she told her ex to stop liao. after he said those hurtful sms to her, "horny sl ut", "fu ck other guys", i also cannot stand it when i saw those sms. i told her, even if she very desperate she still has a bf, what for reduce herself to a sl ut? if she does it with him, her reputation all gone. and he is not going to marry her if anything happens. at least her bf would.<br>Cheers<br><br></div></blockquote>Your early environment consitute heavily to your attitude and behavior towards love. She can't even see through this point of him and even considered his 'proposal' of a non-committment sexual relationship with him TOGETHER with the fact that she loves to fall for 'bad guy' (in definition, guys who treat her like dirt, don't appreciate or abuse her in some form) - this shows that she don't really love herself, as much and her family influence is probably towards the negative side.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Our partner is but mirror of ourselves. We attract mates from the characteristic that we demostrate. Therefore from the kind of partner we are with - it shows the (not neccessary conscious, sometimes its unconscious) side of you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She is a scorpio? Scorpio tend to undergo some tedious and intense relationship in their lives. Highly sexual, emotional and extremist in relationship. Anyway, gald that she managed to live pass this period. From what I see here, this guy's behavior is so repulsive and bast@rdy - without him in her life, she would be much happier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
