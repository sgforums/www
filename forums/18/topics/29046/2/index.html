The next day, he phoned his father to tell him the news.<br>"So, did you jump?" the father asked.<br>"Well, let me tell you what happened. We got up in the 'plane, and the Sergeant opened up the door and asked for volunteers. About a dozen men got up and just walked out of the 'plane!"<br>"Is that when you jumped?" asked the father.<br>"Um, not yet. Then the Sergeant started to grab the other men one at a time and throw them out the door."<br>"Did you jump then?" asked the father.<br>"I'm getting to that. Everyone else had jumped, and I was the last man left on the 'plane. I told the Sergeant that I was too scared to jump. He told be to get off the 'plane or he'd kick my arse."<br>"So, did you jump?"<br>"Not then. He tried to push me out of the 'plane, but I grabbed onto the door and refused to go. Finally he called over the Jump Master. The Jump Master is this great big guy, about six-foot five, and 17 stone. He said to me, 'Boy, are you going to jump or not?' I said, 'No, Sir. I'm too scared.' So the Jump Master pulled down his zip and took his penis out. I swear, it was about ten inches long! He said, 'Boy, either you jump out of that door, or I'm sticking this up your arse.' "<br>"So, did you jump?" asked the father. "Well, a little, at first."<br>[/b]</blockquote>I don understand... wat he mean by alittle at first???<br>Anyone care to explain???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

The 3 daughters were brought up in a prim-and-proper way and when they reached 20, they were still virgins.Years past, and it was time to get them married.<br><br>So, the parents found them the most suitable 'leng chais'. They got married and were preparing to set-off on their honeymoon. As 'concerned', Mr.&amp; Mrs. Ng were curious about their daughters' first-night experience. So, before the daughters went on their espective honeymoons, Mrs. Ng told them......" Your father &amp; I want to know about your 1st night encounters and whether you are satisfied. Write a letter to us, but as not to raise your husbands' curiosity...you all must use a code-name to describe your experiences". So, the excited daughters were off.<br><br>A week passed. Mr. &amp; Mrs.Ng got the first letter. It was from Elaine. They opened the letter and found the word STANDARD CHARTERED. They immediately took the newspaper and looked for Standard Chartered advertisement. Ah! here it is!!!!, exclaimed Mr. Ng. The motto f or Standard Chartered was...."BIG, STRONG &amp; FRIENDLY".... Mr &amp; Mrs. Ng were happy.<br><br>A week later, they got another letter.This time it was from Ena. The content was simple. "NESCAFE". So, again they took the newspaper and looked for the Nescafe ad. Ah! here it is...  'NESCAFE: PLEASURE TILL THE LAST DROP'.<br>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ng jumped in joy.<br><br>Another week passed. A month passed. 2 months passed. There was still no letter from Anele. The Ngs became worried. Finally, the<br>letter came. It was scribbled and could hardly be read, but Mrs.Ng<br>managed to figure it out. The code-name was "CATHAY PACIFIC".<br><br>Mr. Ng rushed to the nearest store and got a newspaper. He flipped the pages frantically.............ah! here it is!!! Mrs. Ng grabbed the page and read aloud. Before she could finish it ...... THUMP!!!!!!! .......she fell off her chair........... The motto<br>as..................." 7 TIMES A WEEK. 3 TIMES A DAY.

I still think this is a good adult joke...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>&gt; A junior manager, a senior manager and their boss<br>&gt; are on their way to<br>&gt; a meeting.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On their way through a park, they come across a<br>&gt; wonder lamp. They rub<br>&gt; the lamp and a ghost appears. The ghost<br>&gt; says,"Normally, one is granted<br>&gt; three wishes but as you are three, I will allow one<br>&gt; wish each"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So the eager senior manager shouted, I want the<br>&gt; first wish. I want to be<br>&gt; in the Bahamas, on a fast boat and have no worries.<br>&gt; "Pfufffff, and he<br>&gt; was gone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now the junior manager could not keep quiet and<br>&gt; shouted " I want to be<br>&gt; in Florida with beautiful girls, plenty of food and<br>&gt; cocktails. "Pfufffff,<br>&gt; and he was also gone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The boss calmly said,"I want these two idiots back<br>&gt; in the office after lunch<br>&gt; at 12.35pm"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Moral of the story is:<br>&gt; "Always allow the bosses to speak first"<br></div>
