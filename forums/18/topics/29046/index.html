            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt;An elderly couple is enjoying an anniversary dinner together in a small<br>&gt; &gt;tavern, the husband leans over and asks his wife. Do you remember the<br>&gt;first<br>&gt; &gt;time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind this tavern<br>&gt; &gt;where you leaned against the fence and I made love to you. "Yes" she<br>&gt;says,<br>&gt; &gt;"I remember it well" "Ok"he says, "How about taking a stroll a round<br>&gt;there<br>&gt; &gt;again and we can do it for old times sake" "Oooooooh Henry, you Devil,<br>&gt;that<br>&gt; &gt;sounds like a good idea." she answers. There's a police officer sitting<br>&gt;in<br>&gt; &gt;the next booth listening to all this and having a chuckle to himself. He<br>&gt; &gt;thinks, "I've got to see this! Two old-timers having sex against a fence,<br>&gt; &gt;I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.<br>&gt; &gt;They walk haltingly along, leaning on each other for support, aided by<br>&gt; &gt;walking sticks. Finally they get to the back of the tavern and make their<br>&gt; &gt;way to the fence. The old lady lifts her skirt, takes her knickers down<br>&gt;and<br>&gt; &gt;the old man drops his trousers, she turns around and as she hangs on to<br>&gt;the<br>&gt; &gt;fence, the old man moves in. Suddenly they erupt into the most furious<br>&gt;sex<br>&gt; &gt;that the watching policeman has ever seen! They are bucking and jumping<br>&gt; &gt;like eighteen-year olds. this goes on for about forty minutes. She's<br>&gt;yelling<br>&gt; &gt;"Ohhhh, God" he's hanging on to her hips for dear life. This is the most<br>&gt; &gt;athletic sex imaginable. Finally, the both collapse panting on the<br>&gt;ground.<br>&gt; &gt;The policeman is amazed, He thinks he has leaned something about life<br>&gt;that<br>&gt; &gt;he didn't know. After about half an hour of lying on the ground<br>&gt;recovering,<br>&gt; &gt;the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The<br>&gt; &gt;policeman, still watching thinks, "That was truly amazing, he was going<br>&gt;like<br>&gt; &gt;a train. I've got to ask him what his secret is." As the couple pass, he<br>&gt; &gt;says to them, "That was something else, you must have been having sex for<br>&gt; &gt;about forty minutes. How do you manage it? You must have had a fantastic<br>&gt; &gt;life together, Is there some sort of secret? " No, there's no secret "<br>&gt;the<br>&gt; &gt;old man says, "But fifty years ago that damn fence wasn't electric."<br></div>

The man turns to her and noticing that she is quite attractive, says with a wink, "Ma'am, if your heart is as soft as your breast, I know you'll forgive me."<br><br>She looks him up and down noticing that he is well endowed and replies, "If your penis is as hard as your elbow, I'm in room 436."<br><br>****************************************************************************<br><br>Two ladies were sitting at the bus stop smoking cigarettes one day when it started to rain. The younger one pulled out a condom, cut the tip of it off, put it over the cigarette and continued smoking her Camel, without the rain bothering her.<br><br>The older old lady was amazed and said "Wow, that's a great idea. What is that thing?" "It's a condom". Replied the younger one.<br>"Wow- where can I get one of those?" "Oh, you can get them at any drug store or grocery store." Replied the young one.<br><br>So the next day, the old woman went into a drug store. "Hi," she told the clerk. "I would like some condoms please." The clerk was surprised at such an old lady wanting to buy condoms, But tried to act cool and asked: "UHmmm, what size?" And the old lady did not hesitate "Oh, one that would fit a Camel, please!!"<br><br>****************************************************************************<br><br>It's shower time!!!

"Ladies and Gentlemen, we at Lufthansa have prepared for such an emergency and we would now like you to rearrange your seating so that all the non-swimmers are on the left side of the plane and all the swimmers are on the right side of the plane".<br><br>After this announcement all the pasengers rearranged their seating to comply with the captain's request. Two minutes later the captain made a belly landing in the ocean. The captain once again made annnoucement:<br>"Ladies and Gentlemen we have crashed into the ocean.All of the swimmers on the right side of the plane, open your emergency exits and quickly swim away from the plane.

If you look out of the windows on the port side, you will observe that the port wing has fallen off."<br><br>"If you look down towards the Atlantic Ocean, you will see a little yellow<br>life raft with three people in it waving at you.

Here you can also find almost all the ferocious creatures in the sea, there's the killer sharks, barracudas and many others. And now for &gt;the finale, please, stay calm and don't panic for both our engines are dead<br>and we are now going down into that ocean.<br><br>Please wear your life vest. We are going to crashland this plane into the water. In the meantime, I like you to follow everything I'm going to say, repeat after me:<br>"Our Father Who is in heaven...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A waitress walks up to the table of three Japanese men at a New York City restaurant. When she gets to the table, the waitress notices that the three men are furiously masturbating!<br><br>She asks, What the hell are you perverts doing?", to which one of the men replies, "We all berry hungry!" She responds, "But why are you whacking off?"<br><br>One of the three says, "Because menu say 'first come, first served'!"<br><br>************************************************************<br><br>Doctor Dave slept with one of his patients and felt guilty all day long. No matter how much he tried to forget about it, he couldn't. The guilt and sense of betrayal was overwhelming. But every once in a while he'd hear an internal, reassuring voice that said:<br><br>"Dave, don't worry about it. You aren't the first doctor to sleep with one of their patients and you won't be the last. And you're single, let it go..." But invariably the other voice would bring him back to reality: "Dave, you're a vet..."<br><br>************************************************************<br><br>Two men were exploring some jungle in Africa when they were caught by an unknown tribe. The tribe tied the captured men to a pole and after some hoo-ha, the tribal chief stepped forward and asked the first man, "Death or Wu-ga-wu-ga?" The first man didn't want to die, so he said, "Wu-ga-wu-ga." Upon his reply, the whole tribe cheered happily and immediately formed a queue behind the first man and took their turns to ****(assault) him.<br><br>By the time the 200th man of the tribe had finished his turn, the captured man was completely exhausted and half-dead.<br><br>The tribal chief then walked up to the second man and asked the same question, "Death or Wu-ga-wu-ga?" The second man, having witnessed the ordeal of the first man, did not want to go through the same experience. So, he bravely said, "Death." "Ok", said the tribal chief, "Death by Wu-ga-wu-ga."<br><br>************************************************************<br><br>During a routine checkup, a doctor told his patient that masturbating before sex often helped men last longer during the act. The man decided, "What the hell, I'll try it." He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn't do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe.<br><br>Finally, he realised his solution. On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck. Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to masturbate. He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to orgasm, he felt a quick tug at the bottem of his pants. Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, "What?"<br><br>He heard, "This is the police. What's going on down there?" The man replied, "I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted." Then came the reply, "Well, you might as well check your brakes while you're down there, you truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago."<br><br>*******************************************************<br><br>enjoy it over the weekend<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MONDAY</strong></span><br><br>A young man joined the army and signed up with the paratroopers. He went though the standard training, completed the practice jumps from higher and higher structures, and finally went to take his first jump from an aeroplane. The next day, he phoned his father to tell him the news.<br>"So, did you jump?" the father asked.<br>"Well, let me tell you what happened. We got up in the 'plane, and the Sergeant opened up the door and asked for volunteers. About a dozen men got up and just walked out of the 'plane!"<br>"Is that when you jumped?" asked the father.<br>"Um, not yet. Then the Sergeant started to grab the other men one at a time and throw them out the door."<br>"Did you jump then?" asked the father.<br>"I'm getting to that. Everyone else had jumped, and I was the last man left on the 'plane. I told the Sergeant that I was too scared to jump. He told be to get off the 'plane or he'd kick my arse."<br>"So, did you jump?"<br>"Not then. He tried to push me out of the 'plane, but I grabbed onto the door and refused to go. Finally he called over the Jump Master. The Jump Master is this great big guy, about six-foot five, and 17 stone. He said to me, 'Boy, are you going to jump or not?' I said, 'No, Sir. I'm too scared.' So the Jump Master pulled down his zip and took his penis out. I swear, it was about ten inches long! He said, 'Boy, either you jump out of that door, or I'm sticking this up your arse.' "<br>"So, did you jump?" asked the father. "Well, a little, at first."<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br>David Beckham is visiting a school. In one class, he asks the students if anyone can give him an example of a 'tragedy'. One little boy stands up and offers "that if my best friend who lives next door was playing in the street and a car came along and killed him that would be a tragedy." "No", Beckham says "that would be an accident." A girl raises her hand. "If a school bus carrying fifty children drove off a cliff, killing everyone involved..... that would be a tragedy."<br>"I'm afraid not." explains Beckham. "That is what we would call a great loss."<br>The room is silent, none of the children volunteer. "What?" asks Beckham. "Isn't there any one here who can give me an example of a tragedy?" Finally a boy in the back raises his hand. In a timid voice, he says "If an aeroplane carrying David Beckham was blown up by a bomb, that would be a tragedy." "Wonderful," Beckham beams. "Marvellous, and can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?"<br>"Well," says the boy "because it wouldn't be an accident and it certainly wouldn't be a great loss."<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br>A guy came into a bar one day and said to the barman "Give me six double vodkas." The barman says "Wow! you must have had one hell of a day."<br>"Yes, I've just found out my older brother is gay." The next day the same guy came into the bar and asked for the same drinks. When the bartender asked what the problem was today the answer came back, "I've just found out that my younger brother is gay too!" On the third day the guy came into the bar and ordered another six double vodkas. The bartender said "Jesus! Doesn't anybody in your family like women?"<br>"Yeah, my wife..."<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br>Two gay men decide to have a baby. They mix their sperm, then have a surrogate mother artificially inseminated. When the baby is born, they rush to the hospital. Two dozen babies are in the ward, 23 of which are crying and screaming. One, over in the corner, is smiling serenely. A nurse comes by, and to the gays' delight, she points out the happy child as theirs. "Isn't it wonderful?" Brad exclaims. "All these unhappy children, and ours is so happy." The nurse says, "He's happy now - But just wait until we take the pacifier out of his arse."<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br>A Celtic fan is walking home from a match in his Celtic kit. He fancies a drink, walks into a bar and found himself surrounded by blue and white. He's walked into a Rangers' bar. A deadly silence falls over the pub. Then the barman clears his throat and says, "In here, we give Celtic fans a toll of the dice. "If you roll one to five, we kill you."<br>The Celtic fan replies,"What happens if I roll a six?"<br>"You get to roll again."<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br>Jake was dying. His wife, Becky, was maintaining a candlelight vigil by his side. She held his fragile hand, tears running down her face. Her praying roused him from his slumber. He looked up and his pale lips began to move slightly. "My darling Becky," he whispered.<br><br>"Hush, my love," she said. "Rest. Shhh. don't talk."<br><br>He was insistent. "Becky," he said in his tired voice. "I.......I have something I must confess to you."<br><br>"There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping<br><br>Becky........"Everything's all right, go to sleep."<br><br>"No, no. I must die in peace, Becky. I.....I slept with your sister, your best friend, her best friend, and your Mother!"<br><br>"I know..." Becky whispered softly, "That's why I poisoned you."<br><br>ENJOY...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labour pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favour of it.<br><br>The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. As the labour progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.<br><br>The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and as amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him.<br><br>The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic. When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.<br></div>
