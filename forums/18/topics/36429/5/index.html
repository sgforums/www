But anyway, just to share some views now.<br><br>Well, I think those guys you met up with are too much. But I guess they are looking for just one thing - looks. Pretty girls have adcantage yes, but as a guy, if the girl is pretty but her personality really matters. She doesn't have to be evil, but it's important that I can face up to her for the rest of my life.<br><br>I believe that if you really have feelings for that person ( that aren't based on looks ), that person would be the one person you'd want to see any given day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personnal Sharing:<br><br>I used to like this girl. But she was definitely not the very popular type but she had a pretty face. Just that she was kinda overweight. I and my friends never did shun her coz we felt she was loads of fun and she was a great friend. Through some incidents I came to have feelings for her. After I knew I liked her, I naturally was just stunned the first time I went out with her. Probably coz what she was wearing looked good on her. I hadn't been so stunned by anyone for quite a while by then and for a long time after, nobody ever did have the same effect on me as she did.<br><br>I believe that's the kind of charm and feeling a person should look for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm... talking a lot. Hope you guys can bear with me.<br><br>Just want to share another 'case study'.<br><br>I know person (schoolmate lastime) who used to be on IRC quite often. And actually, he chats with and meets up with a lot of girls. I actually felt it was good for him coz he didn't meet up with much girls in real life. So maybe this avenune would provide him with a good chance to meet someone. So then, quite often he would go meet up with the girl and the girls are actually quite willing.<br><br>However, just coz the girl is not very pretty or too fat, he'd become very off to continue to talk to the girl. He'd actually call me up and tell me he's not talking to the girl. And usually I see the problem isn't that they can't talk but rather he just doesn't want to after meeting her.<br><br>I personally never quite liked what he did and in fact, I felt he was being very horrible. Never actually told him how much i detested what he did coz he never listened. Moreover, I felt it was too much of him to be expecting looks from someone else when he himself wasn't much of anything to offer.<br><br>Basically, I feel quality of time spent with the person should be above all else rather than how you think the person looks or anything else. I mean, your lifestyles could be different and maybe you like different things.But main thing is you must connect emotionally. But I felt that guy never had the chance to do so coz he was too busy focusing on her looks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Besides, even if the it isn't about finding the special someone, it's alright to be friends right? Why shun the person? I mean, you don't discriminate against your friends if they're ugly right? So why should you do that against this girl who has made the effort to come out to meet you and get to know you better.<br><br>To siam/shun/avoid a person is treating that person very cruely. Even if that person was a friend. It hurts even if that friend isn't close coz it hurts the person that you wouldn't want to talk or to meet him/her.</div>

Hope you guys can bear with me.<br><br>Just want to share another 'case study'.<br><br>I know person (schoolmate lastime) who used to be on IRC quite often. And actually, he chats with and meets up with a lot of girls. I actually felt it was good for him coz he didn't meet up with much girls in real life. So maybe this avenune would provide him with a good chance to meet someone. So then, quite often he would go meet up with the girl and the girls are actually quite willing.<br><br>However, just coz the girl is not very pretty or too fat, he'd become very off to continue to talk to the girl. He'd actually call me up and tell me he's not talking to the girl. And usually I see the problem isn't that they can't talk but rather he just doesn't want to after meeting her.<br><br>I personally never quite liked what he did and in fact, I felt he was being very horrible. Never actually told him how much i detested what he did coz he never listened. Moreover, I felt it was too much of him to be expecting looks from someone else when he himself wasn't much of anything to offer.<br><br>Basically, I feel quality of time spent with the person should be above all else rather than how you think the person looks or anything else. I mean, your lifestyles could be different and maybe you like different things.But main thing is you must connect emotionally. But I felt that guy never had the chance to do so coz he was too busy focusing on her looks.</div></blockquote>thanks for sharing tt meaningful post.. and wat u post has been happening between the virtual n the real world itself now... and its been hurting so many gals and guys... wonder when the majority will not do tt <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
