            <div class='col-md body'>My gf have a great figure. She works out twice a week at the gym and goes on weekly runs. As an example, she can do 76 sit ups in one minute.<br><br>Needless to say she got a great pair of legs and fantastic abs. Height is about 1.64 weight is 45kg. Slim and sexy is the word to describe her body. Face is above average but frankly not as stunning as the body. Long straight black hair that is about waist length.<br><br>She is faithful to me and we have a stable relationship.<br><br>She likes to wear nice clothes but doesnÂ’t really like splurge so much. I feel lucky to have such a gf. And I like to see her wear sexy clothes. She looks nice in them. I always encourage her to wear sexy clothes. I bought bikini-tops for her and encourage her to wear them. I encourage her to wear g-string with tight pants or tight skirts . Once I encourage her to buy a pair of tight white shorts but she refuse to buy as it will make her look cheap.<br><br>She does not like to wear makeup but I encouraged her to put and donÂ’t mind waiting for her when she takes too long to get ready.<br><br>I feel good when she looks good, I also noticed that guys and Â“girlsÂ” will also stare at her. There was once, she wear a almost bareback top with tight pants (with some criss-cross behind), got one girl (walking ahead of her bf) saw her back view immediately grab her bf and drag/distract him awayÂ… so obvious, after the couple is some distance away she immediately let him go. I feel good, when guys and girls admire her.<br><br>My question is, am I normal?? Do guys encourage their gf to wear revealingly and donÂ’t mind when guys look at her?<br><br>Are there guys who are like that? For girls, are your bf like that?<br></div>

But that still isn't an excuse to parade her success and sexy body. If people are smart enough, they can see that she is sexy no matter what clothes she wear.</div>
