            <div class='col-md body'>The Smart Farmer John lived on a quiet rural highway.<br><br>But, as time went by, the traffic built-up at an alarming rate. The traffic was so heavy and so fast that his chickens were being run over at a rate of three to six a day.<br><br>So one day Farmer John called the sheriffs office and said, "You ve got to do something about all of these people driving so fast and killing all of my chickens."<br><br>"What do you want me to do?" asked the sheriff.<br><br>"I dont care," said Farmer John. "Just do something about these crazy drivers!"<br><br>So the next day, he had the county workers go out and erected a sign that said,<br><br>SLOW: SCHOOL CROSSING.<br><br>Three days later Farmer John called the sheriff and said, "Youve got to do something about these drivers. The school crossing sign seems to make them go even faster."<br><br>So, again, the sheriff sends out the county workers and they put up a new sign that said,<br><br>SLOW: CHILDREN AT PLAY.<br><br>But that sped them up even more! So Farmer John kept calling, and the sheriff kept changing the signs.<br><br>Finally, Farmer John said to the sheriff, "Your signs are doing no good. Can I put up my own sign?"<br><br>The sheriff was ready to let Farmer John do just about anything in order to get him to stop calling every day.<br><br>He said, "Sure thing, put up your own sign."<br><br>And after that, the sheriff got no more calls from Farmer John.<br><br>Three weeks later, curiosity got the best of the sheriff and he decided to give Farmer John a call.<br><br>"Hows the problem with those drivers? Did you put up your sign?"<br><br>"Oh, I sure did. And not one chicken has been killed since then. Ive got to go. Im very busy." He hung up the phone.<br><br>The sheriff was really curious now and he thought to himself "Id better go out there and take a look at that sign... it might be something that WE could use to slow down drivers..."<br><br>So the sheriff drove out to Farmer Johns house, and his jaw dropped the moment he saw the sign. It was spray-painted on a sheet of wood:<br><br>NUDIST COLONY ***<br><br>Go slow and watch out for the chicks------------<br></div>

She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg. The priest had a look and nearly had an accident.<br><br>After controlling the car, he stealthfully slid his hand up her leg. The nun looked at him and immediately said, "Father, remember psalm 129?"<br><br>The priest was flustered and apologized profusely. He forced himself to remove his hand. However, he was unable to remove his eyes from her leg.<br>Further on while changing gear, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again Said, "Father, remember psalm 129?" Once again the priest apologized."Sorry sister but the flesh is weak."<br>Arriving at the convent, the nun got out gave him a meaningful glance and went on her way.<br>On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to retrieve a bible and looked up psalm 129.

            <div class='col-md body'>Something I found on Fanfiction....<br><br>Â“One day, at a bus stop there was a girl who was wearing a skintight miniskirt. When the bus arrived and it was her turn to get on, she realized that her skirt was so tight she couldn't get her foot high enough to reach to step.<br><br>Thinking it would give her enough slack to raise her leg, she reached back and unzipped her skirt a little. She still could not reach the step. Embarrassed, she reached back once again to unzip it a little more. Still, she couldn't reach the step.<br><br>So, with her skirt zipper halfway down, she reached back and unzipped her skirt all the way. Thinking that she could get on the step now, she lifted up her leg only to realize that she still couldn't reach the step.<br><br>So, seeing how embarrassed the girl was, the man standing behind her put his hands around her waist and lifted her up on to the first step of the bus. The girl turned around furiously and said, "How dare you touch my body that way, I don't even know you!"<br><br>Shocked, the man says, "Well, ma'am, after you reached around and unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we were friends.Â”<br></div>

When the bus arrived and it was her turn to get on, she realized that her skirt was so tight she couldn't get her foot high enough to reach to step.<br><br>Thinking it would give her enough slack to raise her leg, she reached back and unzipped her skirt a little. She still could not reach the step. Embarrassed, she reached back once again to unzip it a little more. Still, she couldn't reach the step.<br><br>So, with her skirt zipper halfway down, she reached back and unzipped her skirt all the way. Thinking that she could get on the step now, she lifted up her leg only to realize that she still couldn't reach the step.<br><br>So, seeing how embarrassed the girl was, the man standing behind her put his hands around her waist and lifted her up on to the first step of the bus. The girl turned around furiously and said, "How dare you touch my body that way, I don't even know you!"<br><br>Shocked, the man says, "Well, ma'am, after you reached around and unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we were friends.Â”<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Thinking he'd get the red carpet treatment for all his years of service to the Lord, the pastor skipped the queue and walked straight to greet Saint Peter, expecting to get escorted into heaven. However, Saint Peter just brushed him aside and told him "You wait.".<br><br>Then upon seeing the wreckless bus driver at the back of the queue, Saint Peter immedietly ran up to him and personally escorted him straight into heaven. The pastor was shocked to see this.<br><br>The moment Saint Peter came back, the pastor asked him "How come after all the work that I have done, I get no recognition for it, while this wreckless bus driver who risks the lives of people each day, gets all that?"<br><br>Saint Peter replied "It's simple.
