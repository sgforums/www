            <div class='col-md body'>Mr. Cikoch was a biology instructor at a snobby suburban girl's junior college. During class one day he asked his student, "Miss Simison, would you please name the organ of the human body, which under the appropriate conditions, expands to six times its normal size, and define the conditions."<br><br>Miss Simison gasped, and then said, "Mr. Cikoch, I don't think that is a proper question to ask me. I assure you my parents will hear of this. "With that she sat down red-faced.<br><br>Mr. Cikoch then called on Miss Hakar and asked the same question. Miss Hakar, with composure, replied, "The pupil of the eye, in dim light."<br><br>"Correct," said Mr. Cikoch. "And now, Miss Simison, I have three things to say to you. One, you have not studied your lesson. Two, you have a dirty mind. And three, you will some day be faced with a dreadful disappointment."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok.. NEW JOKE:<br><br>My girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? She was a dream!<br><br>There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome.<br><br>She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me." I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, "We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.<br><br>"The moral of this story is:"<br><br>"Always keep your condoms in your car."<br><br></div>

When he finally gets himself to the doctor, he says," How bad is it doc? I'm going on my honeymoon next week and my fiancÃ©e is still a virgin in every way."<br><br>The doc said , "I'll have to put your penis in a splint to let it heal and keep it straight. It should be okay next week." So he took four tongue depressors and formed a neat little four-sided bandage, and wired it all together; an impressive work of art.<br><br>The guy mentions none of this to his girl, marries, and on his honeymoon night in the motel room, she rips open her blouse to reveal a gorgeous set of breasts. This was the first time he had seen them. She says, "You'll be the first, no one has ever touched these breasts."<br><br>He whips down his pants and says, "Look at this, it's still in the CRATE!"</div>

"every clock represents someone on earth. each time he tells a lie, the clock will move by 1"<br><br>the angel continued. "there look at mother teresa's clock.. its only moved 2 strokes, meaning she only told 2 lies." "and look at gandi's clock. it moved 3 strokes. meaning he told 3 lies"<br><br>the angel noticed that the man was hardly listening, instead he was scrutinizing the wall and looking very distracted.<br><br>"what are u searching for?" he asked.<br><br>"oh sorry, i was looking for george bush's clock"<br><br>"ah u dont have to.. you wont find it" said the angel<br><br>"why?"<br><br>"its in jesus's office.. he's using it as a ceiling fan"</div>
