I know you don't believe me but I would.<br><br>I have personally PAID for my ex-bf's education, his clothes, watch, shoes, cellphone whatever and yes he is poor. I thought I will be with him forever till he started taking me for granted and putting me down. I was willing to invest in the future with him together, till he made me change my mind. I didn't mind taking public transport and I didn't mind that resturants were like a rare treat and I pay for the both of us I must say. I wasn't expecting anything in return except that he will love me and appreciate what I do for him.<br><br>This guy sounds totally responsible and unselfish and he is a much better person then my ex from what you said so far.</div>
