            <div class='col-md body'>my personal view is gloria is entitled to her opinions...the guy who expressed his love for her is basically a good guy but in this world not all good guys make suitable husbands...there's the financial angle...right now she feels he's not in a position to financially support her...and she's entitled to choose who she wants as her husband...if a girl accepted every offer for marriage from a guy, there would be a ratio of 5 husbands to each eligible girl...because the proportion of guys proposing to girls, as opposed to the other way round, is much, much higher...if she feels in her heart that despite his good intentions she's not ready to accept him, you can't force her to love him....she's only thinking of her future...the moral of the story is no matter how many korean love serials you watch on tv, the overriding consideration is always monetary based....i think we'll be deluding ourselves if we thought otherwise...so guys out there....better yourself then look for a suitable girl...take it as a motivating factor...dont worry, there's always the right one for you once you've achieved your financial aims...</div>

I realised your main aim is to get a guy who has looks and money and everything else but love. YOU ARE JUST CONTRADICTING YOURSELF.  YOU WANT SOMEONE TO TALK TO, WHO CARES FOR YOU, WHO LOVES YOU, IS RICH AND HAS THE LOOKS. You are just asking for the impossible. No wonder you are so frustrated. Also, I don't see why you can sleep with the guys who have money but not the looks.... and still upset that there's no one to talk to you.
