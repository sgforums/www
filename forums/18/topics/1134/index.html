            <div class='col-md body'>Of course, the guy will think of whether u will go back to the guy that u had sex with.  It is even worse if u still keep in contact with this person.  So my advice is don't tell him the truth, unless u cannot living with that feeling of not telling him the truth.  Most probably, u still have this attachment that u have sex with.  That is why it is hard not to blame the guy for being threatened for a "position" in ur heart.  Another thing is that if u are too attractive, he will also feel insecure and would want to stick with u often.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hypothetically speaking,even if my girl losst her virginity and she has been intimate with another guy before?I dun care,i dun bother about her past even if she was pregnant and had an abortion(a bit extreme here,as long she not guy go for sex change can liaoz,heehe).What's past is past,it can't be undone,so why do i wanna bring up the past and start thinking about what she did last time?As long me and her get to enjoy the present and plan for the future is what i am aiming for.So bottomline is i am not so shallow minded to care whether she is a virgin or not,as long as i love her and she loves me,that's more important</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Belle:  Sorry, actually u will be faced with this problem someday.  U are saying u are pure, simple and innocent...... hmm.... would u be asking these question if u are simple and innocent?  I am not trying to do some personal attack, but just answering ur thots.  Okay... I will use "one" if that makes u more comfortable.<br><br>Btw, if u girls out there are thinking abt whether u should be giving that "thing" to ur bfs, do really seriously think abt it.  A number of factors are important.  One factor is whether the guy is committed to the r/s.  Can be seen from his daily actions, the way he pays attention to u, whether he is attracted to the opp. sex when he is with u, whether he is matured in his thinking.  If he has all the above qualities, most probably u can give the "thing" to him as pre-martial sex is so common nowadays.<br><br>But be prepared to get really attached to this guy, girls.  Be it emotionally and physically.  Lastly, when u (girls) start the love-making sessions, most probably u guys will be doing it very often as sex is very addictive.<br><br>And last to top up, the guy will be looking for other targets (girls) if one give her V to him.  Physical and emotional aspects in guys can be differentiated easily.  E.g. he can have sex with a pros though he has no emotional attachments with her.<br><br>Guess I getting long-winded here.  Hope to answer some of the queries that are going in all the girls' mind.</div>

But the millennium guys as one of us here says do not mind abt the V thing.  It is not a big thing!!  But what I am saying once u gave ur V to the guy, it sort of "lower" ur bargaining power in the r/s.  UNLESS, u are so pretty that u can command that same level of committment from that guy.  The superficial one is in terms of looks and figure.<br><br>Moose:  Glad that u agree with me.<br><br>One thing I would like to ask the pple here, how come some of u guys are "members" but the rest of the pple like me are "junior members".  Thanks in advance for answering my queries.<br><br>Sometimes I am thinking whether I should be so frank abt issues of sex and love.  Maybe it can be quite a nice feeling if all of us go thru' the sweet and romantic start and be immersed in the feeling of being "loved" by someone.<br><br>Am I destroying the chance of pple of falling in love?<br><br>Hmmm....

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya,i do agree some girls are horny,but i believe that for guys,majoirty are hornier while for girl,it is the minority,think it has something to do with our hormones called testosterone,hheehe.I agree with you,Yoohoo to a certain extent regarding girls getting attached a lot,but falling in love only once??I think everyone here bound to have fallen in love at least twice.But if girls are going to get attached without falling in love,then i dun see the purpose of getting attach liaoz  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moose:  I agree totally with u.<br><br>Yoohoo:  Regarding that girls are hornier than guys, I think it is a minority.  But I felt that lots of girls are more attached emotionally with the guys b4 they can be attached physically to him.  Hence, if u are saying from that stage onwards, I think girls are hornier than guys.  Gals have to get past that "comfortable zone" b4 they are committed physically, u know what I mean?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you,Radius,gers tend to be emotional attached before attached physically,maybe that's why people says guys let their family jewels do the thinking while girls let their heart do the thinking,heeheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>
