Do u know that if a gal does not look good but she is quite okay in her figure, it makes her desirable too?

            <div class='col-md body'>Moose:  think of it this way.... if u are saying beauty is in the eye of the beholder then I must say that sometimes those contestants in beauty contest is also very subjective to the "eyes of the beholder" thing?  Nope I don't think so.  The thing is in general, there is some basic guidelines in beauty.  For eg. in this century, those pple that are skinny are also considered more beautiful than those pple that are obese.  But this is not the case in Yang2 Gui4 Fei1's era....... but my stand is that it is easier for a skinner (or slimmer) girl who is not good looking to get attached as compared to one that is good looking (pretty) but quite fat.  Hope u guys know what I am trying to drive at.</div>

One thing for me is that if u are average looking, u will tend to have low esteem in the "looks" dept than those pple who has the looks.  Of course, this can be made up with good character and a sociable character.  But somehow to tell u guys frankly, I cannot really look at a pretty girl whom I don't know and STARE at her for very long.  But after all this hype abt pretty girls and hour figure, I find that I will still settle a girl with average looks, sound character and also an average figure (not too fat).<br><br></div>

If you really love the girl, ask yourself do you really love her that much not to mind her past ? Love in my viewpoint is not about seeking the "perfect" woman so as to speak but rather to find a soulmate and dont bother to look up the dictionary about the meaning of that word...you dont need any kind of book to tell yourself you have found love, you just know it.<br><br>------------------<br>cheers,<br>Ray</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does virginity really matter?Hmm i think it's just one of the many issues blown out of proportion by us guys.<br><br>We cant insist on our partners being virgins if we arent one ourselves.Its pretty selfish and shallow.<br><br>For me, other aspects will be of more importance.I mean, do you people go around asking potential new partners,"Err excuse me. I think you are cute.However don't mind if i ask, are you a virgin??!!!"

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not sure about other guys but I don't mind if my girlfriend is a virgin or not, anyway the definition of virgin is no longer that clear anymore.e.g.( would you consider a woman who used to be a lesbian and had intimacy with her female lover a virgin or not...) What I am trying to say is at the end of the day what really matter is and the real  question is how much do you love that person.</div>
