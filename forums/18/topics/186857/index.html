            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: Touching Indonesian rape story<br><br>This is really a sad story......<br><br>My name is Vivian, and I am 18 years old. I have a<br>little sister and<br>brother. As a family we live in what is supposed to be<br>a secure<br>apartment. At 9.15 am, May 14th, 1999 a huge crowd had<br>gathered<br>around our apartment. They screamed, "Butcher the<br>Chinese! Let's eat<br>pigs! Lets have a party!" We live of the 7th floor and<br>we got a call<br>from a family on the 3rd floor saying that the crowd<br>had reached the<br>2nd<br>floor. They even chased some occupants upstairs. We<br>were all very<br>frightened.<br><br>In our fright we prayed and left everything in God's<br>hands.<br>Afterward we left our room and went upstairs to the<br>top floor, as it<br>was<br>impossible to go downstairs and escape. We got to the<br>15th floor and<br>stayed with some friends. Not long afterwards we were<br>surprised because<br>some of the crowd coming out of the elevators right<br>before we entered<br>the<br>room. We hurried into the room and locked the tightly.<br>At that time we<br>heard<br>them knock at the other rooms loudly and there were<br>some screams from<br>women<br>and girls. Our room was filled with fear.<br><br>We realized they could come to us. So we spread<br>throughout the room<br>hiding in the corners. We could hear girls of 10 to 12<br>years screaming,<br>"Mommy,mommy...mom...mom...it hurts." That time I<br>didn't know that<br>these<br>little girls were being raped. After about half an<br>hour the noise<br>diminished<br>and we had some guts to go out and check. It was<br>indescribable. A lot,<br>some<br>of them young girls, were lying on the floor. Oh my<br>God, what has<br>happened?<br>Seeing all of this we screemed and little sister<br>Fenny, screamed<br>histerically and hugged her father.<br><br>Tears started coming down from my eyes. With our<br>friends, a newly-wed<br>couple, we started going downstairs. Reaching the 10th<br>floor, we heard<br>a<br>scream for help. The scream was very clear and we<br>decided to go down<br>and<br>see. But as we turned we saw a lot of people. I saw a<br>woman in her 20s<br>being<br>raped by 4 men. She tried fight back but she was held<br>down tightly.<br>Realizing the danger we ran as hard as we could. But<br>unfortunately the<br>mob<br>caught Fenny. We tried to rescue her, but could not do<br>anything.<br><br>There were about 60 of them. They tied us up with<br>ripped sheets,<br>myself,<br>my father, my mother, Fenny, Donny, Uncle Dodi and my<br>Aunt Vera. They<br>led us to a room. Uncle Dodi asked what they wanted,<br>but they did not<br>reply. They looked evil and savage. One of them<br>grabbed Fenny roughly<br>and<br>dragged her to a sofa. At that time I knew she was in<br>great danger. I<br>screamed loudly but one of the mob slapped me in my<br>face. My father who<br>also screamed was hit with a piece of wood and<br>hefainted.<br><br>My mother has fainted when Fenny was dragged to the<br>sofa. I could only<br>pray and pray that disaster would not befall us. Uncle<br>Dodi kept<br>trying to stop them by offering money. His efforts<br>were fruitless. And<br>in<br>the end 5 people raped Fenny. Before beginning with<br>the raping they<br>always<br>said Allahu Akbar!(an islamic phrase in arabic meaning<br>God is<br>great!)They<br>were ferocius and brutal. Not long afterward, around 9<br>men came to the<br>room<br>and dragged me. I also saw them forcing and dragging<br>my Aunt Vera.<br><br>But at that time I passed out and everything blank. I<br>became<br>conscious at around 5 or 6pm. My head was hurting and<br>I realized I had<br>no clothing on my body. I cried and realized my family<br>was still there.<br>My<br>father was hugging my mother and little brother Doni.<br>I also saw uncle<br>Dodi lying on the floor and Aunt Vera was crying over<br>his body. I felt<br>so<br>weak and fainted again. The next day I was in the<br>Pluit hospital.<br>My father and mother were beside me.<br><br>With all the pains on my body I asked, "Mom, where is<br>Fenny? Mom?" I<br>felt a<br>stinging pain as I said these words. My cheeks were<br>swollen. My mother<br>cried<br>again and couldn't speak any words, while my father,<br>holding back his<br>tears,managed to smile at me. After 4 days in<br>treatment, my condition<br>has<br>improved. With a sad look, my father told me then what<br>had happened.<br>After I<br>fainted 7 people raped me. At that time my father<br>still couldn't see<br>well<br>after being hit with a piece of wood.<br>They raped me repeatedly.<br><br>Then my father said "Vivian, Fenny is gone..." I was<br>confused and cried<br>out,<br>"Why Dad?" My father couldn't answer. He told me to<br>rest and went out<br>of the<br>room. I cried over and over again,feeling that my life<br>had no meaning<br>any<br>more. A week ago, after I was released from the<br>hospital I was told<br>everything that had happend. When Fenny was raped she<br>kept on fighting<br>and<br>so he was repeatedly slapped by her rapists. The last<br>time she fought<br>Fenny<br>spitted on one of them. Offended, the man grabbed a<br>knife and stabbed<br>Fenny's stomach over and over again. Finally she died<br>with blood over<br>her<br>whole body. My father told me that uncle Dodi had the<br>same fate watched<br>by<br>Aunt Vera who was also raped. My aunt Vera now stays<br>with her parents.<br>She<br>is in shock. Her face is blank and refuses to eat.<br><br>Almost every hour my mother and I cry over all these<br>happenings. I can<br>never. These mobs of people are uncivilized<br>monsters.The scariest part<br>about all these is that most of the girls and women<br>were raped by<br>soldiers, whose jobs were to control the chaos. Some<br>were raped by<br>commoners, the rest by demonstraters (most of whom are<br>university<br>students).<br><br>Most of the victims were raped by a minimum of 3<br>men.The victims ages<br>ranged from 10 to 55. Most of the victims were raped<br>in front of<br>friends or family.Some were thrown into burning<br>buildings after being<br>raped (these were often witnessed by family and<br>friends). Most them<br>committed suicide. The rest of the surviving victims<br>are divided into<br>these sections, admitted into mental institutions,fear<br>of public<br>places,<br>fear of anyone male, did not report to authorities.<br>The list goes on<br>and<br>on.<br><br>Please forward this Yellow Ribbon to all friends<br>around the world to<br>show our soladirity and sympathy for the victims of<br>the riots and chaos<br>in Indonesia last May 13-15. Let us all remember them<br>in our prayers.<br>Because of their race, many Chinese Indonesian were<br>abused, tortured<br>and<br>killed. Their houses and stores were looted and<br>burnt.Hundreds of<br>Chinese Indonesian girls/women(aged 10-55)were<br>sexually harassed and<br>gang raped brutally.Some victims were even raped in<br>front of their<br>family<br>members or in front of inhuman cheering crowd. Some of<br>them were even<br>thrown<br>into the fire and burnt to death after being raped.<br>Yet, not many<br>actions<br>seem to have been taken to investigate all this or to<br>help the victims.<br>And<br>not every many people seem to know or care about what<br>happened. Please<br>pass<br>this ribbon around as the symbol of campaign.<br></div>
