She has no other alternatives, if not she will not choose the most drastic action of abortion.<br><br>Would you rather she kill herself to escape the realism of the real and cruel world? What would her family say when they finds out? She will be condemmed for life! The family will be disgraced, and her life will be ruined.<br><br>If you think she can find comfort in her baby than you are wrong. I don't think she is financially nor mentally prepared. If she chooses to give the baby up for adoption, the baby will never know who the real mother is!<br><br>Would you want to be like the child? I have a cousin who was adopted. But my cousin did not know about it. Until today. No one except the adults know. But i know because my mother's tounge slipped and she told me..

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place this topic has somehow being assumed as a intention of the topic starter to get abortion.<br><br>Secondly, it's posted in Bar Forum and not Aunt Agony Forum.<br>Kinda obvious that this person isn't really serious about it.<br>Realise people like <strong>sgboy2004</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  didn't even dare to post nonsense in this thread.<br><br>Thirdly, i think all those preachy posts scared our poor boy away.<br>So i suggest all forumites to mild down your replies and get the facts right first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
