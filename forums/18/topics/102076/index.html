            <div class='col-md body'>juz wanted to share something with all of u...<br><br>*********************************************<br><br>Peter and Tina are sitting in the park doing<br>nothing, but just gazing into the sky, while all<br>their friends are having fun with their beloved half.<br><br>Tina: I'm so bored. Just wish I have a boyfriend<br>now to spend time with.<br><br>Peter: I guess we're the only leftovers. We're<br>the only person who isn't with a date now. (both<br>sigh n silence for a while)<br><br>Tina: I think I have a good idea. Lets play a<br>game<br>Peter: Eh? What game?<br><br>Tina: Eem..It's quite simple. You be my<br>boyfriend for 100 days and I'll be your<br>girlfriend for 100 days. what do you think?<br><br>Peter: Oookay..Anyway I don't have any plan for<br>the next few months.<br><br>Tina: You sound like you aren't looking forward<br>to it at all. Cheer up. Today will be our first<br>day and our first date. Where should we go?<br><br>Peter: What about a movie? I heard that there is<br>a really great movie in theater now.<br><br>Tina: Seems like I don't have any better idea<br>than this. Lets move. (went to watch their<br>movies and sent each other home)<br><br>Day 2:<br>Peter and Tina went to a concert together, and<br>Peter bought Tina a keychain with a star.<br><br>Day 3:<br>They went shopping together for a friend's<br>birthday present. Share an ice-cream together<br>and hugged each other for the first time.<br><br>Day 7:<br>Peter drove Tina up onto a mountain and they<br>watch the sunset together. When the night came<br>and the moon glowed, they said sat on the grass<br>gazing at the stars together. A meteor passed<br>by. Tina mumbled something.<br><br>Day 25:<br>Spend time at a themepark and got onto<br>rollercoasters, and ate hotdogs and cotton<br>candy. Peter and Tina got in the haunted house<br>and Tina grabbed someone's hand instead of<br>Peter's hand by accident. They laughed together<br>for a while.<br><br>Day 67:<br>They drove pass a circus and decided to get in<br>to watch the show. The midget asked Tina to play<br>a part as his assistant in the magic show. Went<br>around to see other entertainments around after<br>the show. Came to a fortune teller and she just<br>said "Treasure every moment from now on" and a<br>tear rolled down the fortune teller's cheek.<br><br>Day 84:<br>Tina suggested that they go to the beach. The<br>beach wasn't so crowded that day. They have<br>their first kiss with each other just as the sun<br>is setting.<br><br>Day 99:<br>They decided to have a simple day and is<br>deciding to have a walk around the city. They<br>sits down onto a bench.<br><br>1:23 pm<br>Tina: I'm thirsty. Lets rest for a while first.<br><br>Peter: Wait here while I go buy some drinks.<br>What would you like?<br><br>Tina: Eem...Apple juice will be just fine.<br><br>1:43 pm<br>Tina waiting for about 20 minutes and Peter<br>havent return. Then someone walked up to her.<br><br>Stranger: Is your name Tina?<br><br>Tina: Yes, and may I help you?<br><br>Stranger: Justnow down there on the street a<br>drunk driver has crashed into a guy. I think its<br>your friend.<br><br>Tina ran over to the spot with the stranger and<br>sees Peter lying on the floor with blood over<br>his face and her apple juice still in his hands.<br>The ambulance came and she went to the hospital<br>with Peter.<br>Tina sat outside the emergency room for five and<br>a half hours. The doctor came out, and he sigh.<br><br>11:51 pm<br>Doctor: I'm sorry, but we did the best we could.<br>He is still breathing now but God would take him<br>away from us very soon. We found this letter<br>inside his pocket.<br><br>The doctor hands over the letter to Tina and she<br>goes into the room to see Peter. He look weak<br>but peaceful. Tina read the letter and then she<br>burst into tears. Here is what the letter said.<br><br>Tina, our 100 days is almost over. I had fun<br>with you during all these days. Although you may<br>be greedy sometimes and less thoughtful, but<br>these all brought happiness into my life. I have<br>realize that you are a really cute girl and<br>blamed myself for never taken the time to<br>knowing that. I have nothing much to ask for,<br>but I just wish that we can extend the day. I<br>want to be your boyfriend forever and wish that you can be beside me all<br>the time. Tina, I love you.<br><br>11:58<br>Tina: (sobbing) Peter. Did you know what was the<br>wish I made on the night there was a meteor. I<br>asked God to let us last forever. We were<br>suppose to last 100 days so Peter! You can't<br>leave me! I LOVE YOU, but can you come back to<br>me now? I love you Peter. I LOVE YOU.<br><br>As the clock struck twelve, Peter's heart<br>stopped beating. It was 100 days.<br><br>NOTE*<br>Tell the guy or girl that you love them before<br>its too late. You never know whats going to<br>happen tomorrow. You never know who will be<br>leaving you and never return.<br></div>
