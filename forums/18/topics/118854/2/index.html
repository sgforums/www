            <div class='col-md body'>This week was a very good week for me.<br><br>Wednesday was the first day of the good good gal's bday chalet.<br><br>We talked about it and we are very excited about it.<br>We had planned to brought our stuffs to work so that we can head straight to chalet after that.<br>However, she called me and said that she wanted to go back and have dinner and we set off from our house.<br>I think its a great idea too because we dont have to carry so many things to work.<br><br>However, after work, i called her house and realized she wasnt at home.<br>i gave her a call, no one answered and after that i called again.<br>The phone was off. I just got panicked and called her work place and found out that she had left her workplace an hour ago.<br><br>I arrived at the train station thinking and waited for her.<br>The funny thing was that.. i called her house once again to check whether she wasnt.<br>After a while i called her mobile again and she said that her phone's battery flat and so that's why.<br>Gosh.. she really scared me and i thought what's wrong?<br><br>I went to the good good gal's house and we set off together to the chalet.<br>We met her the other good friend of hers and i happened to know her because its the good good gal's best female friend.<br>She gave a surprised present and we chat over in the train.<br><br>At the chalet, we ate and drink. Gosh i really had a hard time because i was made to drink somehow.<br>My face red and they talked about me going drunk and teased me. We had a good time chatting and bbq.<br><br>After watching the VCD, my face was still red and before sleeping, the good good gal came over to me and touched my forehead and said dun go fever.<br>and i wished her good night and smiled.<br><br>As i was sleeping directly under the aircon, i can't really sleep. i woke up freezing and i approached the good good gal.<br>She woke up and i hold her hand. Her hand was so warm and i said very cold. After that i went to the toilet and tried to sleep again.<br>Shortly after that she covered me with a blanket i used it for a while and i returned to her, covering her,  and i went back to my sofa.<br>And i returned to my sofa. Kiss her on the cheeks - a fast one. Dun know whether she felt it or not.<br><br>When i woke up in the morning, i found myself covered with the blanket again.<br>i was so touched. i covered the blanket over her and kiss her cheeks. A fast one too.<br>and i went to bathe. After i bathe, i go to her and see how's she and i kissed her once more.<br><br>This time my lips are cold after the morning wash-up-a longer one.<br>She returned to sleep.<br><br>After that she got up and got prepared and we left the place together. The bday gal guided us to the bus stop.<br>When crossing the roads, i holded her hands. She didnt let go.<br><br>We arrived at her work place.<br>As it was still early we ate our breakfast together and i see her off to shop for work.<br><br>I really like the feeling of being with her. I love her <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Second day of chalet..<br><br>At work every thing seemed to be so dull..<br><br>The reason we are going back to the chalet was that the bday's gal is gonna to cut the cake and we are supposed to be there.<br><br>I called her during lunch and she didnt answer. I send her an sms saying that and advise her to go home after the chalet coz it will be a long ride for her tomorrow. However, she replied see how.<br>It got me real sick and leaves me more sick after work.<br><br>At about 6 plus. she left me a sms asking that whether i was going home to take my stuffs if we stayed overnight at chalet.<br><br>I called her and spoke to her. we had a good talk and i advise her sis to pack the stuffs for her so that i can collect it.<br><br>and i meet her at the west side of the shopping mall. She was window shoping and we recieved a call to buy some stuffs for the chalet. After that we bought the things and head to the chalet. In the shopping mall i didnt hold her. Its only when we travel to the train and i actually hold hers.<br><br>Along the way, somehow. i just said the three words to her again while holding her hands. and she like resist a bit and i said i dun let go.<br>Then along the way, we got more inmitate and looked like couple already and she told the terms and conditions for being her boyfriend. What a gal! hahaha I love her!<br><br>of coz.. she tease me.. and i just played along.<br><br>Of coz, she didnt agree to me and i didnt agree to her. She said she needs one mth time to clear and find the feeling then after that .. and i said jokingly.. i dun want.. and tightened the grip.<br><br>we sat at outside the chalet and sat togehter waiting for another friend to come. We talk and she keep saying what if one day we go separated.. i said unless i die..and she told me more terms and conditions.. haha.. and she told me that yesterday she was laughing coz her good female friend asked her what i was doing in the middle of the night. i hold her hand and kiss her.<br><br>Then at the chalet.. more ppl and this time i slept on the floor.. so cold. and i was beside her. she was on the sofa bed.<br><br>I did the same thing on day one. Kiss her on her cheeks and covered her with blanket. She did offer me the blanket but i returned to her.<br><br>In the morning, i sent her to work again.<br>Hold her hands once more as we parade from orchard to somerset.<br>of coz she said whether i remember the words she said.. of coz i didnt agree to her.. i know very well if i agree.. she will go .. so i was very firm this time..<br><br>she said i changed after i dyed my hair.<br><br>when i got back to office.. I sent an sms to her telling her that i dun know what happened to me and i dun care about the date you give me. i will woo you till you say yes.<br><br>After work. I called her. Twice no one answered. Shortly after that she gave me a missed call and i returned the call.<br><br>We talked and her friend besides her knows that its me and tease us over the phone. She even talked to me and tease me.<br><br>What a day!<br><br>These few days. we are somewhat close to each other...<br><br></div>
