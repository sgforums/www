Most of the gals go for pure fun...well most of the guys go there for SEX..so..the gals are pretty open minded, they dont mind one night stand right...so I conclude most of the gals are sluts... not suitable for long term relationship...they will wait for rich uncle to support them when the sluts want to settle down after failing to find ang moh or rich man or ah beng to marry her..<br><br></div></blockquote>This is so untrue. The girls are more open-minded, but they are NOT easy. Also, to say that they are just waiting for sugar daddies to support them is so untrue as well. This is just as far-fetched as the first post. And just because you go clubbing just for sex doesn't mean that the rest of us guys do. Don't brand all of us to be like you. You are totally stereotyping both the guys and girls who go clubbing.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

More of a working class ladies' mag. Maybe Teenage or Cleo more catered towards the younger ones.<br><br>Still, I figure these articles are featured from time to time in such magazines. For one, I don't think it severly affects the teenagers. Afterall, this kind of article is more gossipy than anything. So I'd say it's more of a story to read than anything. For one, I haven't read this particular article this time, so it also depends on how the writer has presented the facts. Sometimes writers would state that this isn't the norm, although they have chosen to highlight a particular story.<br><br>It also matters what are the writer's personal feelings about the stories he/she writes about. Is it right? Wrong? Or did the person just tell a story.<br><br>The story is ok actually, it really depends on how it is written.</div>
