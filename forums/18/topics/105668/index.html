            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I chanced upon this forum, and decided to open up my heart here.<br><br>I met my wife 9 years, and we got married 4 years ago. We were quite happily married, but I was hiding a dark secret from her, I was heavily in debt from stock market losses. My debts were rising quickly, till I had problems servicing it. Out of desperation, I took out some loans in my wife's name (means forging her signature). But no matter how hard I worked, never seemed to clear them.<br><br>In Oct this year, I finally had enough. I came clean about my debts. My wife was shocked. What was worse was that she found out I forged her signature before I can tell her. She was livid. She packed her bags and left home 2 weeks later.<br><br>It's been 2 months since she left home. She has told me that it is impossible for her to trust anyone again, and I have wasted her youth, and destroyed her dreams. She mentioned that we are finished.<br><br>I had apologised to her, her parents and have sought for forgiveness. That was the only thing I did wrong in the last 9 years, and i really regretted it. I only committed the folly out of desperation. Why can't she forgive me?<br><br>Also, she said that there was no chance for us to get back together, yet she is not taking any actions to serve me the divorce petition.. why is that so? Could that mean that there is a ray of hope for me?<br><br>I love her too dearly to let her go, but I know she has been hurt terribly. What can I do to remedy this situation?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I hope for some sincere sharing here...<br><br>Many thanks.<br><br></div>
