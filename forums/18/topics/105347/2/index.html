            <div class='col-md body'>NVM u all don't argue so much, we see which one can last longer<br><br>Taufik<br>SG IDOL, good voice and I can see why he won, no doubts about him, but can only sing english songs, don't think he would consider singing malay song, even he does, no market. As for english market, although its big, but you need to be either ang moh, ABC or William Hung, other than that, you can forget about it.<br><br>Sly<br>Don't sound so good, but his I dream is definately better than Taufik. Can sing chinese song. I know pple will say Taiwan so many singers blah blah blah, but are there many or any english singer from singapore out there who make it overseas and last? As for chinese singer, we have kit chan, tanya chua, mavis hee, sun yanzi, ah du, lin jun jie, huang yida and my fav rui en who make it big in the chinese market. Beside Sly is not bad singing chinese song so I don't see why he can't sing in taiwan</div>
