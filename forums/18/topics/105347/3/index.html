As for english market, although its big, but you need to be either ang moh, ABC or William Hung, other than that, you can forget about it.<br><br>Sly<br>Don't sound so good, but his I dream is definately better than Taufik. Can sing chinese song. I know pple will say Taiwan so many singers blah blah blah, but are there many or any english singer from singapore out there who make it overseas and last? As for chinese singer, we have kit chan, tanya chua, mavis hee, sun yanzi, ah du, lin jun jie, huang yida and my fav rui en who make it big in the chinese market. Beside Sly is not bad singing chinese song so I don't see why he can't sing in taiwan</div></blockquote>actually SLY is ok lar.... heard him sing 'when i look into your eyes" that's a pretty good rendition. he's just got a unique vocal. That song doesn't require any mid range tonal power to deliver and he deliver it well. I thought he would move up from there. Then he went to choose Jon Bon Jovi's song to sing. He really doesn't know "dead" how to spell. Some more trying to sing like bon jovi, that's rediculous. Best male vocalist when he was at his best. and in a heavy metal band, it's some thing. No play play one ok.<br><br>I think he should have work with the producer and rearrange the key and high notes to suit his range. All smart singers singing other people's song does that. funny thought he's a song writer with a band and he didn't do that.</div>

Tho u discriminated syl and im a big fan of him. I have to agree that taufik can sing but sylvester have his own good qualities too. Like he has his own strong fan base and his voice is good, he has proven on the Final showdown when he sang I Dream[can't really remember the song title]].. But we all know that, sylvester will have a greater future in his records than taufik like clay aiken..

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, i think both are loser but winners for the record companies n telcom...no doubt that TF has improved alot n sings better than Sly, he does not have a big market for youngsters nowadays, to let TF win is already even b4 the final competition start..becoz it looks more presentable and acceptable..although, it has been believed that Sly's votes and fans are more than TF. Singapore Idol, the title already means IDOL..not Talent/Singing/etc...idol to me, the person muz be attracted to lots of ppl who likes him/her..that's y althoug Lea. and Olin. are better in singing than Sly n TF, they still dropped out..tat's becoz they do not have as much supporters/fans as Sly n TF...<br>If Singapore Idol will to be strictly based on supporters n fans, Sly's on the advantage than TF...n that's y i believed that the Telcom refused to release the amount of votes that're been voted for this two finalists...i feel that Sly has more votes than TF....but since the title has been awarded to TF..they can't release the voting results..else..more news...<br><br>Y Sly has been given a contract? I feel that it's becoz he's attracted to lots of younsters which are a major market for record companies..whether Sly sings better or not...it doesn't matter that much...becoz he's a good product..record companies will make $$$ using him....rather than TF....not as much as Sly...<br>Sly can go into chinese singing industries....eg. Taiwan...juz like Ah-Du..frankly speaking..as someone has mentioned b4 earlier...Spore has 75% of Chinese population...targetting that Sly can sings chinese..it's already obvious that using him will make more $$$ than TF...<br><br>If Olin's slim n presentable, i believe that  she'll be the Singapore Idol...she has good vocal..but no looks...that's y she's out....that's the reality abt Singapore Idol programme...u dun need to sing very well...but ppl muz be attracted to you...<br><br>All in all...this year those who worked in the phone line and TCS companies will get a big bonus....</div>
