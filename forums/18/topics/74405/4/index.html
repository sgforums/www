You get such delusions only because you're sore and jealous after <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">being rejected too many times</span></strong>.<br><br>And what's with the perfect examples at Far East Plaza?

Do you spend enough time there to know everything about the girls there? Don't think you even know enough about singapore girls let alone girls in other countries. Beisdes, girls anywhere are the same, they don't know you, they won't be friendly with you. So it's not surprising <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>they reject your advances</strong> </span>, just like they would do to any other b*stard like yourself.

I just do not like the arrogance you've displayed.<br><br>If your observation was really casual, then why get so 'tu lan' about it?

I agree with you that you aren't the only person (don't profess yourself as a far-gort) who thinks that way, but none have spoken like you. And your retaliating against FI isn't helping.
