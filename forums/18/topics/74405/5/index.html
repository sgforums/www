            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>I made my debut here as Lucifer, Slky Lucifer. Seems to me that there is this Beauty and The Beast scenario happening lately... but for someone like me, do u think I give a damn? When I look at couples, be it on the street, the MRT, the bus or in school, the gals will usually take a second look at me. Standing at 1.8m and vital stat 40-30-39, they give me the kind of regretful look that they could have met me earlier. Yes, they can pretend to continue to be intimate with their hopeless boyfriend but one fact that never changes, is that I am better than them.<br><br>My next issue is wealth and appearance. Gals are basically attracted to these two basic factors. If you are rich but can't get a gal, try a hooker. If you are handsome but can't find a gal, try being a gay. The point that I am trying to get thru to all the thick skulls out there is don't talk about it, do something about it. If the ugly and hopeless bums out there can do it, I believe all of you can do the same!<br><br>Girls, my advice for you is that if you can find someone better than your current bum...drop him like an atomic bomb. Be fair to the more qualified guys out there.<br><br>I am not someone who always brag about myself...I always let my actions speak louder than my words.

Enjoy!!<br><br>[b]The Fox and the Grapes:</strong><br><br>One hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch. "Just the thing to quench my thirst," quoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: "I am sure they are sour."<br><br>It is easy to despise what you cannot get.<br>[/b]</blockquote>moral of the story is:<br>if the fox has a merc slk, sure can reach the grapes</div>
