            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, let's be objective here. There are chio and ugly people, as well as there are good and bad people.<br><br>So, there are good and bad guys, and certainly, there must be good and bad girls.<br><br>Agreed? Okay, let's proceed. Girls, I ask you one apparent question.<br><br>Let's face the big question:<br><br>Given a van delivery driver and an engineer, let's assume that both of them are equally good at heart, caring, and loving, who would you choose?<br><br>OF COURSE YOU WOULD CHOOSE THE ENGINEER! (MOST OF YOU WOULD)<br>You know what? Most foreigners would choose the van driver! (Now this is the difference between an English girl and an Asian girl.) If you ask me, I would say Singapore girls, especially those who are highly educated, are miles icier than English girls in making friends. English girls are more friendly, generous, and can maintain a conversation well. Those who are studying, or have studied, in Australia or England like me would know. Asian girls? Well I don't want to talk about it. Otherwise I'd be hantum to death here. Anyway, attitudes vary among people. I don't want to say that all chio bus are like that. I have also met chio bus who are very friendly towards people, while some of them have "eyes on their heads" (i.e. proud peacocks).<br><br>I'm just stating the facts here. I'm not blaming women or anything.<br>So next time, ladies, please think before you scold the hell out of anyone.<br>It's the nature of things and part of life for a lady to feel secure in life. We guys can understand. But to say that so and so doesn't have a girlfriend because he speaks like that is way out of courtesy. Everybody has the right to say anything here as long as it is not offensive.<br><br>Also, ladies, don't say you don't need men in life. Ask yourself first. When you are pregnant and you don't feel well, who takes care of you? Who runs the house? Do you dare 100% say you don't need men? Look, I'm not saying: hey, we always help you carry heavy things, so you need men. What i mean is: have a heart, ladies, we men are not any easy in life.<br><br>Moreover, I hate women talking all the time about being a super mum. So what's the real definition of a supermum? My definition is: A supermum is a mum who throws her childen to in-laws or parents and then goes to work, and after that comes back, seeing her children for a few hours and then goes to bed tired like a sack of potatoes.<br><br>If you think carefully, is that any "super" than a housewife? At least a housewife takes care of her family full-time! She sees her children wake up, eat breakfast, send them to school, comes back home and does all the chores, every minute of it is so meaningful. Again, I'm not saying that all women must be a housewife, but next time, ladies, if you want to say that you want to be a supermum, think first. There is no supermum in this world. I'd rather you call yourself a career women. Anyway, most ladies are career women nowadays. What I want to convey here is: you do what you want to do, and work hard for it. We are all humans, and are not perfect. But, do not get too idealistic. We are men and women, only mortals in this world. Don't tell me that you shower how much love to your children and all that crap - any parent shower love to their children. The point is are you with them all the time? Don't you know that children at a young age need parental love? You never read books? So, if you are toiling in the office while your children are with their babysitters, then don't come and tell me that you are a supermum. I want to vomit. Well of course, there is only one kind of job that allows you to be with your children while you work: toddler care centre.<br><br>So! Having said so much rubbish, it's time to sign off. Any further argument is welcome.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Goodness!!! you had to continue this thread??? Have you read the previous posts? I agree with what you say of course, but I find the preceding arguments by the thread creator absurd. You should have started a new thread...<br><br>I really can't stand people bragging about how rich and qualified they are... esp when they dun have it...<br><br>...blah blah I'm rich cos I stay in a high rise condo? I'm smart cos i dun even have a degree?</div>
