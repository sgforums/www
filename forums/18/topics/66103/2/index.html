Great figure, great looks, almost perfect sexual appeal, sensuality and such... With GREAT personality which really DRAWS you IN...<br><br>But the problem is.... She's a S|UT... Meaning she goes around flirting with other guys and OPENLY admits that she's one... Would you accept such a kind of girl? Ok... I know it's EASY to talk about all the MORALS and such... But if there's really such a 'heavenly' creature who's OBVIOUSLY interested in you... Would you give it a MISS?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Why...?<br><br>For girls, what if you happens to know a MALE version..? ie. A hunk, great gentleman, great looks, sexual appeal and ability, character.... Just like what you've always DREAM of.... A GREAT FLIRT and PLAYBOY... Then what?</div></blockquote>Sex and Dump. As if she bothers, since she is a sL.ut</div>
