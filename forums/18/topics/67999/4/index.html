I am rather fortunately that most of my family members know that I am extremely outspoken and I give regards more to reasons than to relationship. Many times, a man has to stand his grounds in face of the opposition from your parents. It might be helpful too, if you have siblings or senior relatives who can become your allies. Knowing why your mom dislike you gf helps too. Your gf has to try her best to win your mom's approval. However, all else falls, love for your gf should persevere. Afterall this is suppose to be the one that will walk you to your twilight. Parents ain't going to be around forever.... and they get unreasonable at times.<br>God bless you and your gf....<br></div>
