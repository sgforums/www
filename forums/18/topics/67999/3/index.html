I haven't have sex with her for a very long time already and I really feel like doing with her but she refused cuz she is afraid that might hurt our little baby . The max she goes is oral sex and mastubation that's all but no sexual intercourse till baby is born . My friends advised me to visit hookers to ease the urge but I vow on the day I married her to be faithful to her till the day I die . hmmm What else can I do I think just masturbate for a few more months ..even when I masturbate the girl in my mind is my lovely wife ..Control control the urge hm...never mind just letting out my stress that's all . But what can I do beside masturbation right </strong>?[/b]</blockquote>Im using my brother CPU, I just wan to tell u that it is very safe to have sex wit yr wife coz Im doing that too. My wife is a nurse. there are articles said that it is quite safe to have sex during pregnancy unless she has pain. you actually can try it slower and more gentle. another thing is that sperm cell can provide protein to yr wife &amp; baby. don be scare that the cell will dirty or hit the baby as the baby have womb to protect just like staying in the water balloon. I got my first child liao (18 month) &amp; my 2nd wan due in june 04 &amp; Im still doing it so don worry try to talk wit yr wife. 4got to tell u my 1st child is strong &amp; heatly.</div>

Can try to talk to her about my sexual needs too maybe she wouldn't mind having sex too ...anyway hopefully can talk her through into having sex . Now she seems to be in a very good mood watching TV ok I will go and try now . Thanks for your info pal</div>

We do quarrel sometimes but as I men , I will try to give in to her and of course sometimes she gives in to me too . In a marriage life , Give and take lah . She is pregnant now of course even if she is in the wrong , she scold me like mad , ignore me I can understand the pain she is going through so as her husband I just don't try to make her any angier .

Just want to let her still have the feeling like we just started dating or just married feeling though we been married for donkey yrs already . ( Sending roses trick are good to make an angry girl happy ) That's how I do normally when she is very very angry . Though I am not a rich man , I stay in HDB flat with my wife , own a normal car only but I feel even happier than a rich man driving Ferrari and staying in big houses</div>
