              <p>An interesting old article about the japanese society. While doing a sociology elective project i chanced upon this. This actually meant to be an informative topic (wanted to put in ChitChat) but i rekoned FireIce would shift it in Bar anyway because of the catchy topic haha... And also, some unique SGforumers would 'siang wai wai'.</p>
              <p>My question to all. Would Singapore one day become like this? We are always chasing material aspects of life and neglect our other half.</p>
              <p>I hope someone never post this before or it is forgotten. hahaha...</p>

              <li class="date">Monday April 4 2005</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Like many Japanese women, Junko waited until her early 30s to get
              married. When she and her fiance, an employee of a well-known firm,
              decided to tie the knot, she set her sights on making a home, putting
              away some money and starting a family.</p>
              <p>Fifteen
              years later, Junko and her husband are childless. It is not that they
              cannot have children; it is just that they have never had sex.</p>
              <p>The sexless marriage is one of several reasons why experts fear Japan is on the verge of a demographic disaster.</p>
              <p>In
              2003 Japan's birthrate hit a record low of 1.29 - the average number of
              times a woman gives birth during her lifetime - one of the lowest rates
              in the world, according to the cabinet office. The population will peak
              next year at about 128 million, then decline to just over 100 million
              by 2050.</p>
              <p>The 200 women a year who seek help at a clinic in the
              Tokyo suburbs have not had sex with their husbands in up to 20 years,
              and some never, according to Kim Myong-gan, who runs the clinic.</p>
              <p>"The
              women who come to see me love their husbands and aren't looking for a
              divorce," he told the Guardian. "The problem is that their husbands
              lose interest in sex or don't want sex from the start. Many men think
              of their wives as substitute mothers, not as women with emotional and
              sexual needs."</p>
              <p>Mr Kim's short-term solution is unconventional.
              After an initial 20,000 yen (£100) counselling session, he produces
              photographs of 45 men, mostly professionals in their 40s, with whom the
              women are invited to go on dates and then, in almost all cases, arrange
              regular assignations in hotel rooms.</p>
              <p>Mr Kim dismissed charges
              that his service was little more than a male prostitution ring. "The
              men volunteer and pay half the hotel and restaurant bills, so legally
              there is absolutely nothing wrong with it," he said.</p>
              <p>He had
              rescued hundreds of women from despair, he said, but his "sex
              volunteers" would do nothing to cure the malaise that afflicts the
              institution of marriage in Japan.</p>
              <p>The number of married couples
              is in rapid decline. In 2000 almost 70% of men and 54% of women between
              25 and 29 were unmarried. That bodes ill for the birthrate, as
              conservative Japanese society frowns upon having children outside
              marriage.</p>
              <p>A survey of 600 women found that 26% had not had sex with their husbands in the past year.</p>
              <p>"We
              are sort of room-mates rather than a married couple," one 31-year-old
              man, who had not had sex with his wife for two years, told the Asahi
              Shimbun newspaper.</p>
              <p>The government has introduced several
              measures to lift the birthrate. Fathers will be encouraged to take more
              than the 47% of annual paid leave they currently use, and their
              employers will be told to provide more opportunities for them to stay
              at home with their children.</p>
              <p>Local authorities, meanwhile, are
              devising novel ways to increase fertility. In the town of Yamatsuri
              women will receive 1m yen if they have a third child, and in Ishikawa
              prefecture families with three children will get discounts at shops and
              restaurants.</p>
              <p>The absence of children in so many homes is having
              an impact. Fun parks are closing and there are signs that the "exam
              hell" teenagers go through to secure places at top schools and
              universities is less of an ordeal because the competition is less
              fierce.</p>
              <p>The divorce rate has nearly doubled in the past 10
              years, with more women blaming their sexually inactive, as opposed to
              sexually errant, husbands for break-ups.</p>
              <p>"The men love their
              companies; they live for work," Mr Kim said. "Men don't even think it
              is a problem if they don't have sex with their wives. They have
              pornography and the sex industry to take care of their needs, but their
              wives have nowhere to go. They just suffer in silence."</p>

              <p>Actually japanese people believes in working more than sex and other stuffs. You see most of their entertainment stuffs there are for tourists. All they care abt is working, being a good boss, a good employee, providing good services and etc. They are hardworking and willing to adapt and change.</p>
              <p>Japan having a good porn industry doesnt mean japanese have high sex drive, its simply a business. Porn business makes lots of money yearly, and since they believe everything must be the best, porn is included also. If they want to do porn business, they must be the best, they must have the best porn that make the most ppl want to masturbate, if more ppl masturbate to their porn, means they have succeeded in achieveing the qualities they wanted bcos porn is their product, and they are the makers.</p>
              <p>Thats why AV actress all their acting are damn real and arousing, they have all kinds of theme to cater to all kinds of fetish. Compared to angmo, all u see is one big d1ck, one s1ut kena bang by that d1ck and "oh yes oh yes oh yes!" and cum and no more liao.</p>
