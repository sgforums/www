            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Justine &lt;3:</div><div class="quote_body">I had just gotten out of bed and was about to start my day with a well-balanced breakfast. I always have a good breakfast in the morning just before I leave for the gym. I had already poured my favorite cereal into the bowl and was about to cover it with some nice cold milk.<br><br>I made my way over to the fridge to find that my boyfriend had finished off the milk before we went to bed last night. I looked up and down the fridge and searched behind everything, definitely no milk in there! Now I was fucking pissed. I was so damn hungry and I didnÂ’t have time to run to the store without fucking up my whole day. I had almost decided to go without breakfast but, as I stood there starring at my bowl of dry cereal I had a great idea.<br><br>Since he hadn't left yet I knew he'd be able to help me out. He owed me anyway, I can't believe he drank the last of the milk without even letting me know. Anyway, I told him to bring his ass into the the kitchen because I had a plan to get my damn milk! I pointed to my cereal bowl and told him I needed some milk and I needed it now. I got a little more comfortable so I could help him get the milk ready for me. I thought maybe the sight of my big tits would get the milk production started more quickly.<br><br>I didnÂ’t have anytime to waste so I grabbed his dick and went right to work milking it. I wanted to make sure that his special milk would be chock full of protein so I gave him one hell of a cock sucking. It didn't take long before I could taste that precious pre-cum and I knew I'd be getting my special milk at any moment. I wanted to be sure and get every last drop on my cereal so I held my bowl right under his cock. His aim was perfect as he filled my bowl. Just in time too because I was so fuking hungry by this point.<br><br>I immediately filled my spoon with cereal covered in his special milk. Ummmmm, yummy, it tasted so good. In fact, I was so glad I didnÂ’t go to the store to buy milk because this "home-made" milk was so much better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div></blockquote>I didnt see this post....I just thought I did....I really didnt see this post.....</div>
