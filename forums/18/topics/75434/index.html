            <div class='col-md body'>Took a mrt train ride to the west side with my dear. Saw a couple board the train and there were 2 empty seats, each on one side of the cabin. The gal took the seat opposite where me and my gal was sitting.<br><br>She was wearing a short skirt. She was quite chio, but i didnt bother to go stare at her SKIRT, cos i was thinking of other stuff (I very troubled then). Then i heard and saw some gestures from the guy who was sitting oppo her. Then i saw her shifted her legs and use the mineral bottle (500ml) to place on her laps, and i guess the gal is just trying to cover her lap.<br><br>There were some 40+ guys, bangalah, china man, chinese men who kept staring at her. Later when i alighted, my gal say she chao gen, can see her skin color undies, and that the bf kept signalling to her to cover up, but she seems to be blur blur type, took too long to understand. And that the other peepers kept looking at her like eyes licking popsicles esp that bangalah and china man.<br><br>Dont ask me again why i never take photo, because my gf around and i wont be so daring like others to take photos of gals chao gen. Gals must really learn to take good care of themself leh. My gal and i went to nearby shopping centre to buy food also kana stared by alot of bangalahs, she was wearing shorts and pink tight t-shirt with a pony tail.

Saw a couple board the train and there were 2 empty seats, each on one side of the cabin. The gal took the seat opposite where me and my gal was sitting.<br><br>She was wearing a short skirt. She was quite chio, but i didnt bother to go stare at her SKIRT, cos i was thinking of other stuff (I very troubled then). Then i heard and saw some gestures from the guy who was sitting oppo her. Then i saw her shifted her legs and use the mineral bottle (500ml) to place on her laps, and i guess the gal is just trying to cover her lap.<br><br>There were some 40+ guys, bangalah, china man, chinese men who kept staring at her. Later when i alighted, my gal say she chao gen, can see her skin color undies, and that the bf kept signalling to her to cover up, but she seems to be blur blur type, took too long to understand. And that the other peepers kept looking at her like eyes licking popsicles esp that bangalah and china man.<br><br>Dont ask me again why i never take photo, because my gf around and i wont be so daring like others to take photos of gals chao gen. Gals must really learn to take good care of themself leh. My gal and i went to nearby shopping centre to buy food also kana stared by alot of bangalahs, she was wearing shorts and pink tight t-shirt with a pony tail. All those perverts kept looking at her boobs and fair long legs. Feel like poking their f**king eyes, esp those are hungry foreign wolves  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>foreign wolves or native wolves, they are all put to fire and the sword. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
