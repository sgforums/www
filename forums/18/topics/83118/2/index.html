It varies from girl to girl but usually "stabbing" at the opening with your fingers is the last thing they find arousing.<br><br>In fact, my gf and many other girls can come without any penetration at all. If you just caress the right parts of their bodies they get turned on.<br><br>When you get to down there just gently caress around and look for the clitoris. Her moans will guide you if she's too out of it to guide you with words. Massaging around the area and then eventually the clit itself - with a lot of effort at times - will make her come. When she plead with you to stop after the first wave you should ignore her and carry on. Within a minute she will come a second time. The second time is usually more intense than the first and will be a "near-death" shiok experience for them. Don't go for the 3rd one as it will really tire her out and her privates would be very painful by then.</div></blockquote>try not to diy la. get ur man to do with u. licking only to bring u near high. not to come. try to come together. enjoy.</div>

Then how can you justify your cause by calling the moderator names?<br><br>Well...if you really don't like the way this Bar forum works, you can always click somewhere else. Your mouse is working right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I think you are the one who is not supposed to be here because you are too sensitive. This is afterall, just a forum...and a public one to be correct. Nobody is obligated to please you, so don't feel so bad if you are pissed off about the behaviour of the forumites here. And by the way, I do not know the moderator at all...so not considered as her friend. I'm anonymous.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Another solution would be for you to go and set up your own 'Bar' type of forum and be a moderator of your own forum. That way you can then enforce whatever rules as you deem fits.<br><br>But don't forget...nobody likes to be restricted with rules...especially if it is too overbearing. So perhaps then you will understand the need to be relax the rules a bit sometimes so that people will be attracted to participate your forum.<br><br>Good luck and I would like to see the activity rating for your own 'Bar' forum.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

It varies from girl to girl but usually "stabbing" at the opening with your fingers is the last thing they find arousing.<br><br>In fact, my gf and many other girls can come without any penetration at all. If you just caress the right parts of their bodies they get turned on.<br><br>When you get to down there just gently caress around and look for the clitoris. Her moans will guide you if she's too out of it to guide you with words. Massaging around the area and then eventually the clit itself - with a lot of effort at times - will make her come. When she plead with you to stop after the first wave you should ignore her and carry on. Within a minute she will come a second time. The second time is usually more intense than the first and will be a "near-death" shiok experience for them. Don't go for the 3rd one as it will really tire her out and her privates would be very painful by then.</div></blockquote>so u r saying that if i mast, the second time i come feels better?</div>
