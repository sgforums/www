The main characteristic of guys suffering from this illness is sitting with their legs WIDE open when they are on the bus such that they will occupy the ENTIRE seat. If you do see any of such guys on the bus, please pity them because they find it really hard to shut their legs and most probably they need to rest their huge and heavy balls on the seat. Also, please do not insist on sitting next to them because an accidental push might crush those huge and fragile balls. These patients do not have much time left with their balls because their balls will explode when they reach the final stage of the illness. Your effort to show care and concern for guys suffering from this illness will be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Recent trends also show that both Singaporean guys and girls love and adore their bags SO VERY MUCH that they will make sure their bags get a seat next to them when they are on the bus. Oh! What a wonderful, loving world!<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>*PLEASE. IF THE SEATS ON THE BUSES ARE MEANT FOR 2 PASSENGERS, LET IT BE MEANT FOR 2 PASSENGERS!</strong></span></div>

The main characteristic of guys suffering from this illness is sitting with their legs WIDE open when they are on the bus such that they will occupy the ENTIRE seat. If you do see any of such guys on the bus, please pity them because they find it really hard to shut their legs and most probably they need to rest their huge and heavy balls on the seat. Also, please do not insist on sitting next to them because an accidental push might crush those huge and fragile balls. These patients do not have much time left with their balls because their balls will explode when they reach the final stage of the illness. Your effort to show care and concern for guys suffering from this illness will be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Recent trends also show that both Singaporean guys and girls love and adore their bags SO VERY MUCH that they will make sure their bags get a seat next to them when they are on the bus. Oh! What a wonderful, loving world!<br><br><span style="color: red;">[b]*PLEASE. IF THE SEATS ON THE BUSES ARE MEANT FOR 2 PASSENGERS, LET IT BE MEANT FOR 2 PASSENGERS!</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>Ya,I admit I take up almost 2/3 of the seat.Hey,I am almost 6ft tall,wait till you have my height and width,then you will realise it is like a can of sardines for me at times.That is why I always go for the last left seat on the bus.If on the MRT(which is very seldom),I have to lean forward...</div>
