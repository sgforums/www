Did she mind what you had done?<br><br>I think if you really love her... u should forget her past and carry on to create a new relationship and more stable one wif her... at least she wun need to choose the 10th one... and u the 4th one... give her more confidence pls... by avoiding kissing her will only make her feel more inferior and thus will lose the love for you. Why think of the other men who had kissed her and touched her pte parts b4? I think they had also held her hands b4 and kissed her hands and make her hold their penis b4 right?<br><br>Maybe for you its hard to forget her past but is it hard for her to forget your past too??.....<br><br>You try to let go and make her feel that you really love and treasure her by accepting her as what she is... and not accepting her coz of what she was... it will hurt her deeply.<br><br>Maybe coz of my past relationship i dare not accept any guy again as i was thinking the man will think like what you are thinking now....<br>She may have her regrets too dude... so give her and yourself another chance... tis relationship maybe the last u may not noe... and both of you end up for a long time?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Give it a try... move on...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  ALL the best ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
