Not physical lah.  God created us to be physically weaker than men, so ns omitted mah.  Because women are physically less inclined, how can they rape a man even if they wanted so?<br><br>FYI, i'm a 27 yr old woman and i strongly disagree that  women's sexual desire is only like 0.00001% and controlled.  We also have our sexual urge and mood too.  If we dun feel like doing, we hate to be controlled.  Likewise, when the urge comes, we will not hesitate to ask for it too!  As for the woman with higher sex drive after 30, i oso had came across it somewhere.  It's done by a clinical survey, not anyhow hum tam one.  I will let u know if its true after i reach 30.<br><br>BTW, my name is Oh_papillon, not oh_pavillon!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Not physical lah.  God created us to be physically weaker than men, so ns omitted mah.  Because women are physically less inclined, how can they rape a man even if they wanted so?<br><br>FYI, i'm a 27 yr old woman and i strongly disagree that  women's sexual desire is only like 0.00001% and controlled.  We also have our sexual urge and mood too.  If we dun feel like doing, we hate to be controlled.  Likewise, when the urge comes, we will not hesitate to ask for it too!  As for the woman with higher sex drive after 30, i oso had came across it somewhere.  It's done by a clinical survey, not anyhow hum tam one.  I will let u know if its true after i reach 30.<br><br>BTW, my name is Oh_papillon, not oh_pavillon!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote>Wah bo wei kong liao..heard from a real women &gt;.&lt;<br>ok im convinced liao<br>ur argument makes sense  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>got evidence somemore =/</div>
