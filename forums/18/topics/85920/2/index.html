Same applies for the girls I know.<br><br>Don't want gf also can. get a sex buddy. Free and relatively safe especially if you exchange sexual histories.<br><br>Anyway if you're going to want to have sex why look for a super conservative gf.

So being dumped does not mean one's views on relationships will change totally, although it's very likely a person gets dis-illusioned. I also feel your comments are assuming too much, there is nothing wrong with an attached guy saying what he has just said.</div>

It's not really about the singing and all, it's really about sex. From what you say, are you asking that he should find a girlfriend purely for sex? Maybe he's not ready for a relationship? Work too much, too stress? Thing is guys will have sexual urges from time to time, if for him the urge comes and he has no gf/wife, next easiest is paid sex lor. If not it's go for ONS or find a f*** buddy. If not? Rape? I'm not saying what he is doing is morally wrong or right, just feel that your suggestions are not directed at the main problem.<br><br>Sex industry survives because like any other trade there is demand and there is supply. Paid companionship or whatever you want to call it.</div>

Even if both are 'good enough', if one day just bored with sex how? And how many years can you keep having sex?</div>
