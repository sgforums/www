            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with the fact that love doesn't need possession and possession does not equate to love.<br><br>however i am a greedy bastard. i will have both, or nothing. i will not settle for half price. if i love her, i will want to "possess her"  and if i can't, then i will slowly stop loving her.<br><br>of course we now step over to the fact that true love never dies (or along those lines). perhaps wat i mean it not that love has died, but rather love will grow for someone else again. it's up to the individual to allow it to grow again.<br><br>so let's answer the question: do i hope to be with someone i love or will i be happy as long as she is happy?<br><br>BOTH. that i am with her, and she is happy becos she is with me and it is reciprocated.<br><br>fairy tale u think? only if u think you aren't worthy of such happiness.<br></div>
