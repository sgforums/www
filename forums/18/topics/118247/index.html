Yumm, gotta love those office babes.<br><br>Wearing a suit but inside I think its a tube top or mebe spag strap, quite low cut, revealing a bit of her juicy melons. I can't see the deep drain becuz my eye-level is lower then her busts but still can see them peeking out a bit.<br><br>She was carrying her briefcase in front of her with two hands, then the train got a little shaky and she lost her balance. Think she no choice have to lean forward, and quickly stretch out one hand to support herself.<br><br>WAH!! At that point, she was leaning over me, with her ripe melons hanging deliciously in front of my face. Can see quite deep into her valley and my my, what a gorgeous valley it was. Wearing a white, lacey push up bra. Felt like moving my face forward and smothering her t.i.t.s all over my face. Too bad its a tight push up, so cannot see n.i.p.p.l.e slip. But it made the 2 round globes really juicy. They looked like they were gonna pop out and greet me.<br><br>She regained her composure quite fast, much to my despair, then looked a bit embarassed and gave me those kind of "side glance but trying not to look" kind of look.
