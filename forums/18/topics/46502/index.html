            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there, this is something that has been bothering me all these years but just too shy to speak to anyone on it.<br><br>Well i have watch porn b4, have fantasies on girls and all just like a normal guy would. Thing is that my bro will erect from the sexual stimulation but it will just end there, i have nvr have any desire to Masturbate so as to release the sexual tension.From what i know, my friends will mostly M when they r in similar situation. Well i have tried to do it b4 but even after the gentle stroking and stuff, what i feel is only pain and not pleasure from this supposed further sexual stimulation.My bro also go like swollen after just a while like maybe only 3 mins. Dun know if real sex is like this since i m still a V.<br><br>What i fear is that, i will not be able to have sex properly later in life. Thus to summarize thru all these 6-8 years since puberty, whenever i have any sexual stimulation, it will just end with my bro erecting and it will end there. I have nvr have any desire to M or have actual sex to release the tension. Does anyone know if this is normal or is it that i just have too low a sex drive to begin with ?</div>
