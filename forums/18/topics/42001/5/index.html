And that is not knowing for sure whether or not itÂ’s happening to you. ....You feel sick to your stomach. You spend all of your time thinking about it. You probably eat even less than you sleep. The stress of it all can take over your life! You can continue living your life day to day on the brink of an emotional breakdown, being physically neglected and emotionally abuse by your partner. Or you can put an end to the hell youÂ’ve been living in by finding out for sure whether or not youÂ’re being cheated on.<br><br>Getting cheated on is miserable and one of the most devastating events that can happen in anyoneÂ’s personal life. IÂ’ve been there and I know. And not knowing for sure if itÂ’s actually happening makes it worse. YouÂ’re sick to your stomach, you feel emotionally exhausted, sexually neglected and your self-esteem is in the pits. You probably eat even less than you sleep.

I say u'd better admit everything to your bf and see what's his reaction. If he decides to preserve this r/s then jolly well, if he thinks he can't stand your Ã­nfidelity' then i guess you havta call it quits and move on.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">I think.. enough is enough. Perky should know what is right and wrong. The fact that everybody is trying to hand her advice is shows that it is only common sense. If you two-time, for what ever the reason, there is only one outcome. I am not trying to throw dagger @ you but in fact you are already disapproving of yourself in the first place by creating this "help" thread.<br><br>There is no right or wrong steps, just kind ones. Just remember whatever steps you take, it will affect you and the people around you, not only your current bf or the 2 guys. People in here can only advise what they think is going on in your life right now, but the best one to handle it is you.<br><br>Pls go decide a path and not ask us to advise anymore, it is like getting our approval and giving us responsilities for your actions. Regardless of your age, the fact that you can already distinguish what is right and wrong prove that you are mature enough.<br><br>Your current bf sounds fantastic, a gentleman in everyway, and yet you think you are not worthy of him. If he feels that way, you two won't be together in the first place! Most gals would die to have such a bf, what's wrong with u?!<br><br>I will not pity you nor am I flaming you even though it sounds that way, but I just don't see what is wrong in your relationship other than what is in your head. Let him love you. Don't reject his love otherwise you will never find peace in any relationship. Let his love heal your past wounds. It's that simple.<br><br>I will not comment anymore. People have given you too much respect by trying to help you, not me. Period.<br></span></div>
