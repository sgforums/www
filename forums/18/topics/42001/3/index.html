She is carrying her past emotional baggage into the relationship. I really suggest that she don't go too deep with her current bf to prevent hurting him. Even if she successfully gets the guy she wants and ditch her current bf, she will encounter problems in a new relationship. It is unfortunate that she was hurt in the past, but it is even more irresponsible that she is using others to ease her old wound.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  </span></div>
