            <div class='col-md body'>New secular study shows divorce may be greater threat to marriage than originally thought<br><br>Adam &amp; Steve<br><br>Just as Galileo's announcement that the earth revolves around the sun rocked the beliefs of the Church another more recent announcement is bound to have a similar astonishing affect in today's Christian communities. Among Christian intelligentsia it is understood that homosexuality and pornography are the primary threats to Christian marriage. Yet now, when the survival of the institution of marriage itself hangs in the balance, our traditional concepts of homosexuality and pornography are being challenged by devious secular nonsense. Dr. Lloyd Robertson of the National Institute of Health, in an official report, now claims the greatest threat to marriage is actually divorce.<br><br>News of the finding rumbled like shockwaves through Christian organizations after Thursday's announcement. Hasty meetings were called in Think Tank boardrooms as responses were crafted and talking points honed. Boardmembers in many organizations worked through the night.<br><br>Reverend Rayford Steele, commercial airline pilot and pastor of Circle Church in Orange CA, commented in an interview, "If divorce becomes the scapegoat for failed marriages people may become confused, they may no longer see homosexuality and pornography as the very real threats they are."<br><br>Indeed, theologians of all faiths are bracing for the aftershock of people led to believe they are responsible for their own behavior. "It's wreckless," complained Christian journalist Buck Williams, "wreckless and wrong. The lay Christian is just not sophisticated enough to identify the immoral forces that drive his or her behavior without the assistance of Christians trained in market analysis, nor should they have to be."<br><br>Using the divorce announcement as a rationale grandstanding liberal congressmen are taking potshots at the institution of marriage. Attacking the proposed Marriage Amendment to the U.S. Constitution Congressman Dick Bank is introducing frivilous legislation aimed at "ending divorce." But in a wisdom that is unfathomable to man God has, ironically, made marriage dependant upon divorce. What would happen if all of the Christian men and women whose marriages were destroyed by homosexuality and pornography could not get divorced? They could not remarry and millions of not-yet-existant children would be left without parents-to-be.<br><br>William R. Mattox, Jr. of USA Today writes on the real threat, "...'gay marriage' teaches that the most basic unit of human societyÂ—marriageÂ—does not need a woman to be complete." Mattox continued, "A man can't be expected to pick up another man's damp socks, remove the soapy hair from the bathtub drain, scrub a stained toilet, trim the errant hairs growing off the tops of his ears or any of the hundreds of nasty chores reserved for wives. Every marriage requires a woman."</div>
