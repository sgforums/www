Tell him he shouldn't worry too much about the sex issue yet cuz neither have tried it yet.  Things would be totally different afterhand.  However unless they are already into "it" and his gf's libido is low, then perhaps he has something to frown about.</div>

He can always try discussing about such issues to his gf (though not so directly). They can always have conversations about these...<br><br>The BIG question here I guess is whether would things really turn out to be the way he thought it would be? Asking a guy like him to have a gf with lower sex desire might be difficult for him.... But I have other questions which beg to be considered.... What if his gf has a NORMAL appetite for sex and he a 'hyperactive'? That won't meet up to his 'needs'? Would he still stray? What if his gf is not feeling well or not in the mood for sex when he needs it? Would he stray?<br><br>The question he has came up with is no doubt not totally groundless... BUT he should understand that the same kinda question would arise EVEN if he choose another girl to be his wife. And the potential 'problem'... Does it really lies solely in the hands of his gf only....?<br><br>Regards.</div>
