You can also<br>view the system info here.<br><br>-----------------<br>What are the peripherals availiable for the Xbox?<br>-----------------<br>Original Controller:<br><br>The Xbox controller is one of the most solid, comfortable controllers ever made. It has a very<br>sturdy, solid feel to it, while being the ideal size. The controller is black, with a clear<br>window that shows the Xbox logo on the top. It has 6 action buttons (A, B, X, Y, Black, White), start &amp; back buttons, a d-pad, and two analog joysticks on the face. On the bottom are two analog triggers, similar to the Dreamcasts. The two joysticks can be clicked in, resulting in 12 buttons total. There is also a built-in rumble feature in the controller. If you are interested in third party controllers, again, always make sure that they are officially licensed from Microsoft to avoid damage to your console. This controller only comes standard with the US version of the Xbox, however you can buy them seperately.<br><br>Xbox Controller S:<br><br>This is a new verion of the Xbox controller that Microsoft plans to bring to the North American<br>market in May. While being almost identical to the Japanese controller, there are a few<br>differences. The jewel on the controller is actually black and green like the one on the<br>original conrtoller, instead of all green like the Japanese one. The cord is longer than the<br>Japanese model, and the springs have more resistence, more like the original controller.<br><br>Japanese Controller:<br><br>Same as Xbox Controller S, except the cord is shorter, the Xbox logo is all green, and the<br>analog trigger springs are looser.<br><br>Memory card:<br><br>This memory cards are 8MB each , and is a supplement for game saves. Useful for taking your game saves to your friends' houses and sharing them.<br><br>RFU Adapter:<br><br>If your TV does not have regular composite video inputs, you need this. Use this connection only as last resort, as the quality is horrible. If you have $300 to spend on a Xbox, you shouldn't even need to consider this option anyway.<br><br>Standard AV Cable:<br><br>This is the cable that came with your Xbox. You can also buy this separately if something<br>happens to it.<br><br>Advanced AV Pack:<br><br>If you have s-video inputs on your TV, you will want to upgrade to this. These give the<br>video quality a serious upgrade when compared with the composite cables. You will need this if you plan on using optical digital audio.<br><br>Advanced SCART Cable:<br><br>The Advanced SCART Cable connects the console to TVs equipped with a SCART input terminal and enables RGB video signals for improved video output. This cable also provides a digital output for use with digital audio receivers. Better than S-Video, Composite and RF.<br><br>HD AV Pack:<br><br>When you want to connect your Xbox to a HDTV, you'll need this. Xbox games will all run with HDTV quality visuals. The Xbox supports 540p, 720p, and 1080i. This also has a optical digital audio port on the pack. A must have , if you have a HDTV with the supported resoulutions, as it provides clearer, sharper and overall prettier than the usual graphics that the standard and advanced packs provides. Also known as Component. Not supported in PAL Xbox system. Unless you use a PAL to NTSC output converter and a NTSC supported TV set.<br><br>Monster Cables also provides excellent cables for the Xbox. Try to find them at your local game-specialty stores.<br><br>Driving wheels/Joysticks/Light guns:<br><br>This are the various extra specialized controllers for driving games , fighting games and shooting games preferably. This can be found at your local Xbox dealer or any Console dealer.<br><br>DVD kit:<br><br>If you want to watch DVD movies on your Xbox, you will need to purchase this. It is basically a remote and an infrared receiver that you plug into a controller port. The $30 price includes the $20 that Microsoft has to pay to the DVD Consortium (every DVD player ever manufactured has this fee) and $10 for the actual remote. Progressive scan play is not supported by the Xbox. Whether Microsoft will offer an upgrade to support watching DVD's at HDTV quality is unknown. It may however be possible, due to the fact that the Xbox does support higher resolutions for the games.<br><br>Voice communication headset:<br><br>This comes with your Xbox subscription kit which must be bought separately from the standard package itself. It basically allows you to communicate with voice during online games. Must be supported by the Xbox live enabled game. Great for taunting and chatting.<br><br>Xbox subscription kit:<br><br>This is the kit you may want to look out for during the holidays, if you wanna play Xbox live. It is basically a one year subscription. It allows you to play Xbox live , and all the features that it offers. The latest US kit comes with Mech assault. Do look for this, if you wanna play online.<br><br>----------------<br>Why my Xbox cannot play DVD movies?<br>----------------<br>You need the DVD kit, you can find them in all good Xbox retailers. It costs about 49.90 dollars in Singapore , but may be subject to place and retailer.<br><br>-----------------<br>What region DVD movies can my Xbox play?<br>------------------<br>Firstly you need the DVD kit. The region stated on the DVD kit packaging does not mean you can only play that region's DVD movie discs, rather it depends on the first ever DVD movie you play in the Xbox , the bios will remember the region of that disc and lock it , preventing other regions' discs from being able to be played. Unless you mod it of course. (more on modding later in the next update)<br><br>Newer generation local Xboxes are now locked to see only region 3 DVD movies, as iam told. Please experiment by playing both other region movies and region 3 DVD movies.<br><br>As iam also told , this locking also applies to normal non-movie DVDs as well.<br><br>------------------<br>How do I connect my Xbox to a digital surround sound system?<br>------------------<br>You will need either the Advanced or HD AV packs. The pack has a Toslink style connector so you can connect it to your receiver. You will need to buy the optical cable separately. An optical cable comes in many lengths and is at average 24 dollars. Please look at the diagrams on the packaging to determine the right one, usually DVD players are the equivalent of the Xbox.<br><br>You must also set the digital surround sound in the Console dashboard interface. Try exploring the settings and test with some games like Dead or alive 3 , for example.<br><br>If somehow it cannot work , just connect your Xbox normally , then just connect the optical cable from your HD or advanced pack to the receiver/amplifier. It should work 90% of the time.<br><br>Also you might want to set the signal to digital on the receiver itself, please refer to the respective receiver manual. Please confirm that your receiver supports 5.1 Digital surround sound.<br>-------------------<br>Where can i buy the Xbox?<br>--------------------<br>B Arjan &amp; Co (Funan The IT Mall<br>Carrefour (Suntec City)<br>Challenger Superstore (Funan The IT Mall and Tampines Mall)<br>CK Tang<br>Comics Connection (Junction 8, Causeway Point, Clementi Centre, Rivervale Mall, West Mall)<br>Computer Etc (Funan The IT Mall, Causeway Point)<br>Cyber Active Computer (Jurong Point, West Mall, White Sands, Yishun Central)<br>E2000 (Funan The IT Mall)<br>E-Games (Orchard Cineleisure)<br>Green Domain (Sim Lim Square)<br>Harvey Norman (Suntec City, Millenia Walk, Hougang Mall)<br>Ouni InfoHighway (Sim Lim Square)<br>PK Computer (The Heeren, Funan The IT Mall, Suntec City)<br>Planet E+G (Raffles City)<br>Popular Book Co (North Point, Crown Prince)<br>South Asia Computer (Funan The IT Mall)<br>Toys R Us (The Forum)<br>Video-Pro.com (Sim Lim Square)<br>Comics Connection (Lot 1, Choa Chua Kang)<br><br>More places sell them , this is just a small list . Keep looking.<br><br>---------------<br>Why is the graphics still the same after connecting the Xbox to my HDTV with a HD pack?<br>---------------<br>Firstly verify if you have connected the right color coded wires to the respective color coded input and outputs. Secondly verfiy if the HD pack is tightly connected to your Xbox , always double check. If all else fails , please set the supported resolutions your HDTV supports through the console dashboard interface.<br><br>---------------<br>How do i know which resolutions my HDTV provides ?<br>---------------<br>Refer to your respective HDTV manuals, and set the resolutions through the dashboard interface. If you do not have the manual for your HDTV availiable, i heavily suggest doing trial and error with a game that makes use of HDTV capablilities. Most problems can be solved by trial and error , selecting the various settings and seeing what works for you.<br><br>Also it would be nice to set your HDTV to progressive scan or the numerous other scan schemes VIA your TV remote. Set whatever works best for you.<br><br>----------------<br>Why my TV got a Ghosting effect or Double screen effect?<br>----------------<br>The reason why some TVs have a ghosting effect , it's because after sustantial amount of game playing , will cause a 'burn in' effect in some non-LCD TV and HDTV sets. In some cases , it may be very bad , but in others, it may be nothing. To prevent such things, please read ypur respective TV manuals to see how you can counter that problem, or just make sure you don't use the TV for too long.<br><br>Burn-In is a premature, uneven wear of the phosphors in a CRT or Plasma display. LCD, LCoS, and DLP don't use phosphors, and are therefore immune to burn-in. The possibility of burn-in can be minimized through proper adjustment of the TV settings and common sense in the TV's use.<br><br>As for Double screen , some HDTVs (especially the earlier versions) does not support auto switch of resolutions during using HDTV video capability for Xbox . They need to be manually set correctly everytime. Failure to do so , will cause a double image on your TV screen during the use of your Xbox.<br><br>----------------<br>Why does my Xbox clock reset?<br>----------------<br>The clock resets after around 5 hours of disconnection from the mains. The reason is because the XBox uses a capacitor to store some currents in the set to keep the time. After 5 hrs, the charges dissipates and so the program resets to the default time when you boot it up after 5 hrs.<br><br>Plus there's a rumor that when you connect to Xbox Live VIA your dashboard interface , your Xbox's clock will be auto set to the correct time for your region. As for the validity of that rumor , i have yet to know and i will get to the bottom of this matter.<br><br>---------------<br>Why my save games all dissapear?<br>---------------<br>1. Either you must have reformatted the hard disk<br>2. Your hard disk is faulty<br>3. Data corruption<br><br>----------------<br>What are of these drives/partitions used for on my xbox hard drive?<br>----------------<br>Here are the drives/partitions and a brief description:-<br><br>C - 500 MB - menu code, graphics, sound, DVD player, etc (partition 2)<br>D - Dvd Drive<br>E - 4895 MB - Data - saved games and imported CD audio tracks (partition 1)<br>F - See below. (partion 6)<br>X - 750 MB - Game Cache - temporary data of a game for faster access. (partition 3)<br>Y - 750 MB - Game Cache - temporary data of a game for faster access. (partition 4)<br>Z - 750 MB - Game Cache - temporary data of a game for faster access. (partition 5)<br><br>The Seagate Drives are 10gig and have 1896 MB of unused, unpartitioned space. You can format this space and it will be your F drive. If your stock drive is made by WD, then the sizes are just as shown above. Also, when replacing the hard drive, all space outside of what is shown above is partitioned to the F drive. The only exception to this is with drives larger than 137gig. You then have the option of creating a 7th partition, "G drive" using the space above 137gig.<br><br>You cannot change the size of any the drives, they are left alone for compatibility.<br>Dont use drives X Y and Z for any kind of storage, there is a good chance that it will be deleted at any time.<br><br>----------------<br>Which routers are Xbox live compatible and which are not?<br>----------------<br>For the best results, Microsoft recommends the following brands and models:-<br><br>DLink:-<br>DI-604<br>DI-614+<br>DI-624<br><br>Linksys:-<br>BEFSR41 (v3)<br>BEFW11S4 (v4)<br><br>Microsoft:-<br>MN-100<br>MN-500<br>MN-700<br>MN-740<br><br>They do not recommend the following:-<br><br>DLink:-<br>DI-754<br>DI-764<br><br>Linksys:-<br>BEFSR11<br>BEFW11S4 (v2)<br>NR041<br><br>Netgear:-<br>MR314<br>RP114<br>RP334<br>RT311<br>RT314<br><br>SMC:-<br>7004VBR<br>7004WFW<br><br>Even if you are connecting to XBC (XBconnect) , try not to use unrecommended routers.<br>----------------<br>Some general terms we need to know<br>----------------<br>GENERAL:<br>TV - A display device with a built-in tuner.<br><br>Monitor - A display device wihtout a built-in tuner.<br><br>Display - Any device capable of displaying an image.<br><br>HDTV Monitor (HDTV Ready TV) - usually, a TV with a built-in standard definition (NTSC) tuner. To get HDTV, you'll need an HDTV tuner, like a cable, satelite, an over the air (OTA) tuner box, or another HD signal source, like an Xbox!<br><br>HD Television - An HD TV with a built in HD (ATSC) Tuner. The only additional equipment you need to display an OTA HD signal would be a standard set-top or roof-top television antenna. Chances are, it will also accept external HD sources, like HD cable boxes and Xboxs.<br><br>Aspect Ratio - The ratio between the horizontal and verticle measurements of the screen. Standard TV's are 4:3, Widescreen TVs are 16:9, Movies can be any ratio, but 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 2.35:1 are common aspect ratios for movies. If the aspect ratio of your source does not match the aspect ratio of the screen, you will get black bars above/below the picture (letterboxing) or on the sides of the picture (window or pillar-boxing).<br><br>Contrast Ratio - A ratio representing the range of brightness a TV is capable of producing, from the darkest black to the brightest white. Generally, the higher the better.<br><br>Burn-In - A premature, uneven wear of the phosphors in a CRT or Plasma display. LCD, LCoS, and DLP don't use phosphors, and are therefore immune to burn-in. The possibility of burn-in can be minimized through proper adjustment of the TV settings and common sense in the TV's use.<br><br>Scaling - The ability of a video component to change the format/resolution of a signal to another format or resolution. Though the Xbox can output different formats/resolutions (480i/480p/720p/1080i) based on what's coded, it CANNOT scale. This is important to understand, because there may occasionally be a scenario where the output of the Xbox won't match what the display can accomodate, and you won't get an image on the screen.<br><br>TV SIGNAL FORMATS:<br>Interlaced (as used in 480i/1080i) - A trick of TV broadcasting where the TV only draws every other line of verticle resolution at a time, then goes back and fills in the remaining lines. This happens fast enough that your eyes fill in the blanks, but many people still see some artifacts from the process, especially with computer-generated graphics.<br><br>Progressive (as used in 480p/720p) - Displaying a TV signal in a manner where every line of resolution is drawn, then the process starts again. Generally, this produces a smoother, crisper picture than 480i.<br><br>480i - Standard North American TV Format, also known as NTSC and Standard Definition (SD), consisting of 480 lines of interlaced resolution, where every other line is shown every other 1/60th of a second. All standard TV and all DVDs are in 480i format, as is the Xbox Dashboard. A very few Xbox games only support this resolution.<br><br>480p - A 'Digital' TV Format (sometimes called DTV), consisting of 480 lines of progressive resolution, where every line is shown every 1/60th of a second, generally considered to give a crisper image over 480i. This format is usually 4:3, but can be 16:9 as well. Most Xbox games support 480p. 480p is not generally considered a 'true' HD resolution.<br><br>720p - An HDTV Format, consisting of 1280x720 pixels drawn progressively. Some XBox games support this resolution, but not all HDTVs accept 720p as an input resolution.<br><br>1080i - An HDTV Format, consisting of 1920x1080 pixels drawn using interlacing. A few Xbox games support this resolution.<br><br>SDTV - Usually refers to the 480i format<br><br>DTV - Digital Television, usually referring to digital versions of 480i and 480p formats, as well as HDTV formats.<br><br>HDTV - Generally, the 720p and 1080i formats, or a television that is capable of acception and displaying the High Defintiion format material. 720p and 1080i are the most common HDTV resolutions.<br><br>EDTV - some televisions can accept SD and HDTV signals, but don't display them in 'full' HD resolution, but scale them up/down to another resolution, like 960i or 540p, or something else entirely. These TVs are sometimes called Enhanced Definition Televisions.<br><br>DISPLAY TECHNOLOGIES:<br>CRT - An image projection technology where an electron beam is projected on a tube, exciting phosphors that emit light. CRT are used in direct view, rear and front projection displays. CRTs generally still have the best overall image quality, mostly because they produce the highest contrast ratios. Drawbacks to CRT include larger direct-view sets get very heavy (because of the glass in the picture tube) and are limited to ~40", while CRT-based front and rear projection systems tend to have large, bulky projection units. Rear-Projection CRT TVs are generally enclosed in a full-size cabinet that sits directly on the floor. All CRTs will eventually fade due to the phosphors wearing out, but this can take many years of continuous use, and shouldn't be a major factor in your purchase, but rear-projection CRTs may need periodic tuning to maintain the best picture quality. CRTs, in general, are the cheapest technolgy for a display in a given size.<br><br>LCD - An imaging technology that uses liquid crystals as 'shutters' to pass light from a back-light onto a screen to create an image. LCDs are used in direct view, front and rear projection TVs. LCD shows great colors, but has a fairly low contrast ratio. LCDs will also fade out over time as the backlight wears, and some of the crystals can get stuck (and a few are tolerated in the manufacturing process of an LCD), resulting in 'dead pixels' on the screen, so they do have a limited life. Smaller LCD displays are very thin. Larger, rear-projection LCD TVs are much lighter than CRT-based rear-projection TVs, are much thinner than CRTs, and usually sit on a TV stand.<br><br>LCoS - A fairly new imaging technology similar to LCD that uses liquid crystals to pass light from a bulb through a transparent silicon wafer and project it onto a screen. Since there is a bulb, there are no worries about the backlight wearing out, you simply replace the bulb periodically. Dead pixels may still be an issue. Size factor for rear-projection is about the same as LCD-based sets.<br><br>DLP - An imaging technology that uses a chip with thousands of tiny mirrors to reflect light through a colored lens and onto a screen to produce an image. DLP is used in front and rear projection displays. Fading over time is not an issue, but the bulb will need to be replaced periodically. Form factor for rear-projection systems are generally table-top, less than 20" deep, and about the same size as a LCD or LCoS set. Generally considered to have good color and a better contrast ratio than LCD, DLP is a popular choice in larger screen sizes, though it is generally a bit more expensive than LCD, and much more so than a comparitively sized CRT.<br><br>Plasma - An imaging technology that uses phosphers to generate an image on a very thin screen - Plasma TVs can be only a few inches thick, regardless of size. Plasma displays show a very bright image, have good contrast ratios, but are very expensive compared with similar-sized displays based on other technolgies.<br><br>TELEVISION TYPES:<br>Direct View TV - Sometimes called a 'regular' or standard TV, a CRT TV with a tube that is viewed directly. Chances are, this is the type of TV you grew up with.<br><br>Rear Projection TV (RPTV) - A TV that uses a projector mounted behind a screen to display an image. The projector is usually mounted in an enclosed cabinet that includes the rest of the TV components. Rear Projection TVs can use CRT, LCD, LCoS, or DLP technology.<br><br>Front Projection TV (FPTV) - A TV that uses a projector and a seperate screen to display an image. The projection unit can use CRT, LCD, LCoS, or DLP technologies.<br><br>Flat-Panels - Thin, light displays that can be placed almost anywhere. These include the smaller, desktop LCD displays and Plasma displays.<br><br>VIDEO INPUT TYPES:<br>RF (Radio Frequency) Input - A type of input that is usually assocaited with a coaxial cable from an antenna or cable system. Generally regarded as the poorest possible conductor of a signal, so avoid using it to interconnect video components.<br><br>Composite Input - An analog video connection that uses a single cable with RCA connectors to pass a signal. Considered slightly better than RF. Can only handle 480i resolutions.<br><br>S-Video - An analog video connection that uses a single cable with proprietary S-Video connectors to pass a video signal. Considered an improvement over and preferrable to Composite. Only handles 480i resolutions.<br><br>Component Video / YPbPr - An analog video connection that uses 3 cables with RCA connectors to pass a video signal. Considered better than S-Video, and the best you can do with an Xbox. Also used with DVD players, HD Tuners, some cable boxes, and other video components, it is a requirement to use Component cables to display 480p/720p/1080i resolutions from any source.<br><br>VGA - The standard type of connection for PCs. The signal is actually the same as sent over Component cables, but in a 15-pin D-sub form factor connector.<br><br>DVI - A digital video interface that is becoming the standard to connect PCs, HD Tuners, and even some DVD players to a display device. To ensure compatibility with future devices, look for at least 1 DVI connection on any new HDTV you buy. Look for a set that also supports HDCP, a copy protection standard.<br><br>Firewire - A competing digital standard to DVI supported by some TV manufacturers.<br><br>----------------<br>What Xbox titles support HDTV and/or Digital surround?<br>----------------<br>007: Agent Under Fire<br>James Bond 007: NightFire<br>4X4 Evolution 2<br>Aggressive Inline<br>AirForce Delta Storm<br>Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction<br>All-Star Baseball 2003<br>All-Star Baseball 2004<br>Alter Echo<br>Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding<br>Amped 2<br>Apex<br>Armed &amp;
