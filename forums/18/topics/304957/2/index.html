            <div class='col-md body'>It's natural for men and women to crave for sex. It's like hunger, you will feel it three times a day. For me, I eat 5 meals so...but we have digressed!<br><br>The only issue is, there is this morality and fear of getting infected by contagious diseases that is holding us back. And after you are spent, you will probably feel 'remorseful' that you have done it. That you have succumb to the 'dark side' by going to a prostitute.<br><br>Now, there are ways:<br><br>1. Get a gf. Socialise. Meet more people. Join some group outings. Heard our  Singles club here's quite cool....this is the long term strategy.<br><br>2. While you are building your portfolio above, maybe can get yourself relieved by going to Health Spa. There, you can get assisted by 'helping hands.' Heard some massages are really quite good! Or you can help yourself like what you have been doing. At least you are safe.<br><br>3. If you decided to go all out for full service, think about it. And think again. We will not be able to tell you whether it's good or bad or morally right or wrong. All I can say is, your status will always be tarnished and you have to keep it a secret from your family and future love ones.<br><br>Prostitution is one of world's oldest profession cos we need it.  But there are also millions who live without sex for a long[er] period of time.<br><br>If you are gonna do it, at least not at Geylang. Good things dun come cheap and cheap things won't be good for long. You need to research more. Especially when you are only 23 and it's your virginity we are talking about here. At least make it premium la...but not that premiums pros are safe.<br><br>Also, do get a check up 6 month after you have done it. Do not go around infecting everyone (including the poor Pros). And make sure you wear protection when you finally have a GF or wife. Be responsible.<br><br>Assuming you get Aids (growing number in Singapore), you probably have like 10 -20 years before any serious complication kicks in. You are then 33 and you have to start your lifelong medication!!! Who's gonna take care of your parents and love ones?<br><br>Pray that they have a cure for Aids by then, man!<br><br>Also, if you DIY, great. If you pay per pop, you will be set back by $60 - $1500.  And since it's like hunger, it will be recurring. Imagine eating Ah Yee Abalone for every meal....you will burn your pockets.<br>\<br>Also, there is this diminishing 'excitement', like sick of old toys. So you go out looking for a particular model, the more you try, the higher expectations you have, the less you enjoy due to limited supply. So you end up paying more for pacific clams.....sianz.<br><br>I say stay within point 1 and 2 la...<br><br></div>

"<br><br>If your life is filled with so many fears , then why you bother to live at all? what a misery it would be isnt it. Dont let pple tell u wat to or not to do . Just do it but just make sure its your own choice coz then u will not regret your own choices.<br><br>The chances of dunno what aid virus getting thru condom is less likely than u getting hit by a lightning-struck pigeon  while waiting for a cab on the road.<br><br></div>
