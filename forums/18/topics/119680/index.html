And I guess a guy and girl just can't be friends in your eyes? So girls are just toys to you then, talk about lack of respect.<br><br>Sure, sometimes, there may be some secret wish that the guy will like her, or a fantasy if you would call it. They don't always expect for that to happen. Sometimes, if you really like the person, you just want what's best for the person, even if it means not being with you.<br><br>And it's also because you like the person, that's why you're willing to be a listening hear for that girl. You want to be able to help her in any way and to feel better. And if it means being the best you can be as a friend, what's wrong with that?<br><br>From what you say, you seem like the kind who will take advantage of an emotionally weak lady and cast her aside when your own selfish desires are fulfilled. If you are, then you are a real b@stard.<br><br>So what if the girl goes back to her boyfriend, it's important that she's happy right? No point being with you if you're a f*cked-up b@stard and she's unhappy right?<br><br>The girl treats the guy like a friend, so what's wrong with the guy being as good a friend as he can for the girl. She's not cheating him or anything. Some guys don't even have the chance to talk to the girls they like, let alone be a close friend. I can ascertain the girl appreciates what the guy is doing, and as a friend no doubt. What did you expect? You think the girl will say, "Oh thanks for listening to me talk about my problems, how about I let you screw me in return?" Wake up your idea man.<br><br>And if you really think such guys are wussy? Look at it this way, it takes more courage to endure the pain by staying as a friend. It's even more painful being so close to the person and never really being together with her. It's much easier to just walk away from it all. After being rejected, or knowing that the girl is with somebody else, it really takes courage to continue to be friends with that girl.<br><br><strong>Really think about it, which is easier, to just run off from the girl or continue to stay there as a friend for her?</strong><br><br>[quote]Originally posted by Stanley Ho:<br><strong>pls lah girl and guy how to be best frd ...let me ask you if that so call best frd of yours strip naked infront of you , don't tell you you are just going to choke your chicken instead of giving her a good bang dude</strong></div></blockquote><strong>You can never know for sure what others would do would you?

IF you care for a friend be it whatever the reason. You will listen to her because  are concerned, simple as that. what are friends for?
