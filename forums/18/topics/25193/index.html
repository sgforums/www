            <div class='col-md body'>Zeke is the name of this girl i knew on the net. We have to be together as friends for almost a year plus now. What would made a girl to withdrew herself from society and friends? She would avoid my calls, my sms. After i brought her in to my friends' co, working there for 3 months she just vanish. I tried calling her home, no one picks up. And when it did she just told me I'm not interested to tok to u at the moment. I'll return u the money i own u. And then she hangs up. I'm worry for her, she has a bf who is 2 years younger then her studying in jc whereas she is already working. She bought stuff for him, like spawn toys and models. There is even one time she loan money to her bf not just once but umpteen times. I know this is non of my business. She knows i like her. She knows i have feelings for her. I got rejected quite a number of times liao. Used to it that i just merely treat her as someone i care not someone i would see myself with in the future. There are times she told me about another guy who is trying to chase her, and i would get piss and started to tell her off. (Jealous since she could let other guys chase her and not me) I think she treat me more like a big brother. (which i really really hate) And now she just doesn't like to be disturb. I can't believe she told me she is not interested to tok to me afterall i done for her. (Introduce her a job which i earn alot in just 1 month, lend her money, support her emotionally, hear her cry alot of times, fixed her PC whenever she needs help.) I'm not being sympathetic towards her, just want to help her. I just want to tell her i care and i dun like to see her get hurt thts all. I was told by my friend, I'm being over protective as a friend she most girls dun like tht. I'm nt looking for her becos of the money, i looking fo her becos i'm worried for her. I was her before, low self esteem, inferior, dun like to tok to people. Just want to be alone. But after my friends introduce me to ADT (i believe u heard b4) I'm talking to all soft of people in my life rite now. So i tot it could happen to her also. But just after 1 month she cried (Bro commit su..., low on money and don't like to talk to people) I'm really confuse rite now. Guys and gals help me out here? Shld i just refrain from her as she told me, r shld i go up to her house and try my luck with her (talk to her lar, nt wanting to be her bf, i got rejected 10 over times i think) Need your opinion.

Guess time for you to move on...you cannot forever protect or shield her lor, she has boyfriend and she chose herself.  So you better get on with life and search for the correct gal.</div>
