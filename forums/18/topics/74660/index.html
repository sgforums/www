            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you to all those who viewed this thread and hope it'll change the perception of some...<br><br>1st, i would like to sincerely apologise to all females who were haressed or were outraged of their modesty.<br><br>2nd i would like to express my view on how males behave badly when trying to capture the attention of the opposite sex. I've realised that men have been pretty ambitious in their quest for lust, examples are asking of phone numbers, harassment, spiking of drinks, rape... I've heard alot of complaints from my female counterparts and i hope that these men would put a stop to such lewd acts as its hurting the image of the male brotherhood.<br><br>From the start of evolution, we have been going about our sexual conquests and haven't really spared a thought for the females. Thus we have projected a symbol on females as sex objects rather than human beings. Its depressing to hear how many rape/molest cases have been reported. Haressments and lewd calls/smes have also tarnished our male image.<br><br>Majority of guys have been known to oftenly offer help to pleasant looking females just for the sheer thought of lust... During flag days, those young boys would start going up to young pretty things for donations and older men would go up and make themselves noticeable/hook up with those office girls. I know its all a part of the courtship ritual but recently, men have taken a step too far for the sake of lust and not the continuation of the circle of life... I hope that these men would learn when and where to draw the line between lust and morals.<br><br>In clubs,swimming pools wherever, lustful males spike the drinks of females just to get a kick out of their lustful temptations. Its a serious shame to human morality. Even if the females do dress little, or maybe showing a hint or two that they're interested, doesn't mean that men should succumb to their temptations and outrage their modesty...<br><br>3rd, Majority of Singaporean men are very into lust. Not that we shouldn't be but we have lost our sense of romance and passion and even the meaning of love... Perhaps due to our surroundings and circumstances and our asian heritage, Pornography has been kept at bay by our governments and by our parents. This lead to the sudden thirst/curiosity of the birds and bees when we've come of age and just when the cyberspace age recently boomed and a sudden surge of "adult" materials were made easily available to all ages of Singaporeans. This may have sparked off our curiosity for lust and sexual dominance in this society, in turn the females were the victims of such an intrusion and outrage of sexual morality.<br><br>I hope that man would reflect on his actions as to what they've done to this world, to his environment, to the female sisterhood...<br><br>By the way, i'm a Singaporean male too... I pick up girls too, but i know when to draw the line. This is for C (I can't mention the name, many clubbers know her) and to all the females out there who have been outraged of their modesty in the past years... Sorry...</div>

Remember Sec4 where they ask all the guys to go out while they watch some "video"? Guess what? It still happened to them... I guess the media has the tool to truly educate the public on sex education regardless young or old as all of us have sexual needs...</div>
