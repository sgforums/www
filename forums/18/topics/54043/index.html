            <div class='col-md body'>well whoof....<br><br>here's your problem.... your friend still thinks she still loves the guy... she thinks as you can see... but anyway, people like her are always around... as they say, they're lots of sucka around....<br><br>I used to have a friend like that too... only worse becos she takes the bf beating her... the more you tell her to leave the guy, the more it disturbs you cos she'll want to stay with him more... worst still, the girl thinks that the bf is quite "poor thing" cos everyone dislikes him.... the more we try to wake her up, the more she starts to avoid us... (it might happen to you)<br><br>the only solution to this problem was that we started to bring her out and invite her to everywhere... introduce more friends to her, especially the guys.... those that we'll think eligible of cos... and one day she finally fell for someone... though we felt not that fantastic cos he's a nerd, but at least the problem is solved, he does not hit her...<br><br>so maybe you can try this too... you've gotta make sure you can afford the time though... don't wanna try and help her and creating more problem for yourself ya.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, from what i'm experiencing now.. i'm not attached, and my ex has a bf. but i'm always worried about her.. wad she's doing and is she safe and all. i can only care for her inside my heart. if i do go ask her "have u eaten" "are u back home".. she would feel.. "fan gan" or irritated. so, ya.. all these i can only just keep inside me.<br><br>everyone's telling me to just forget about her; its not my responsibility to worry about her anymore.. that sort of stuff. i can't, maybe i wasn't a good bf last time, thus the guilt or the willingness to be caring towards her now. or its because of our 3yrs of relationship, the amount of love within, that kept me constantly worrying for her.<br><br>and erm, i've learnt after this breakup that communication between the couple is very important. don't sweep problems that had happened under the carpet and forget about it. 1 fine day all these problems will add up, and the volcano will erupt.<br><br>am i off topic already? sorry if i am.. \=</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just be there for her to comfort her and dun ask or try to talk her out of leaving her bf as wat all the others had said *love is blind*<br>suport her and show there u r one true fren, and if she really sit down and think, she may understand or she may not but the path taken is hers. only she can say if she want to be happy or sad all the time. it's up to her really. and if she is studying, the best to is work hard and not get to sticky in BGR problems.</div>
