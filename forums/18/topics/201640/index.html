            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I am writing to let you know of an incident which happened at my house in July. I have been married to Debbie for three years. She is 24 and I am now 30. Since Our marriage, Debbie has refused to take the Pill and has insisted that I use a condom every time we have sex. I have not had one bare sex since our wedding day.<br><br>At the beginning of July, Debbie and I were invited to a Dinner and Dance in a nearby hotel. I do not like to dance, and spent most of the evening drinking  with two other non dancing friends. During the evening, a young man called Paul paid a lot of attention to Debbie, who was obviously enjoying every minute on the dance floor with him.<br><br>Every now and again she came to find me for a drink and by the end of the evening both she and I were fairly drunk. Paul volunteered to drive us home, to which I readily agreed. When we got to the house, Debbie invited Paul in for a coffee. All three of us sat around the kitchen table, Debbie and I had another drink and Paul had coffee.<br><br>I can recall feeling very drunk and trying to keep my eyes open, but the next thing I remembered was waking up with my head on the kitchen table in darkness. The door into the living room was slightly dark and, like a flash of lightning, I thought of Debbie and Paul. I immediately felt sober and went to see where they were, but before I even reached the door I could hear sounds. When I looked through the door opening I almost fainted - Debbie was lying STILL naked on the sofa, with Paul kneeling on the floor between her spread legs.<br><br>Debbie had her eyes closed and was on her back, as Paul knelt with his head on her thigh stroking her lips. I was rooted to tbe spot as I watched Paul lovingly run the tips of his fingers up and down my wife's inviting hole.<br><br>Debbie was in a state of ecstasy - she was moaning and pushing her pussy up to Paul. Suddenly Paul stood up with his back towards me, and frantically started to loosen his belt and take his trousers off. I felt as if I was having a dream when Paul got his trousers down - he had a cock which appeal erected dangerous<br><br>Debbie was STILL on the sofa, and, as Paul knelt down again, he lifted one of her hands and placed it on a cock she had probably only ever dreamed about. I heard her say "Please Paul, don't fuck me, and don't give me a baby," even as he was getting his cock into her.<br><br>Paul was telling her that he would be careful. Paul kept his legs wide apart as he pushed into Debbie. His huge balls were all that I could see as he drove his cock into her and rode her with long, slow strokes. I could hear Debbie moaning and murmuring to herself, and then she started to come. Suddenly, I noticed Paul's strokes quicken and, as he buried his cock into Debbie, I realised he was coming as well and he had no intention of pulling out.<br><br>Only then did I rush into the room. I do not know if I shouted or if he heard me, but I distinctly remember Paul falling back with sperms jetting from his huge cock. Debbie still lay spread, unable to move.<br><br>Later, when Paul had gone, I noticed sperms lying on the cushion where she had been fucked. Since that night I have not made love to my wife - I don't think she would have felt a normal sized prick after being serviced by Paul anyway. Debbie missed her period at the end of July and has now missed it again - she was obviously made pregnant by Paul, even though I interrupted him as he was filling her with his seed.<br><br>I don't know what the future holds, but I feel angry that, after three years, a young man can come along and ride my wife, without her even insisting that he used a comdom as she had done with me - life can be very unfair.<br><br></div>

When I looked through the door opening I almost fainted - Debbie was lying STILL naked on the sofa, with Paul kneeling on the floor between her spread legs.<br><br>Debbie had her eyes closed and was on her back, as Paul knelt with his head on her thigh stroking her lips. I was rooted to tbe spot as I watched Paul lovingly run the tips of his fingers up and down my wife's inviting hole.<br><br>Debbie was in a state of ecstasy - she was moaning and pushing her pussy up to Paul. Suddenly Paul stood up with his back towards me, and frantically started to loosen his belt and take his trousers off. I felt as if I was having a dream when Paul got his trousers down - he had a cock which appeal erected dangerous<br><br>Debbie was STILL on the sofa, and, as Paul knelt down again, he lifted one of her hands and placed it on a cock she had probably only ever dreamed about. I heard her say "Please Paul, don't fuck me, and don't give me a baby," even as he was getting his cock into her.<br><br>Paul was telling her that he would be careful. Paul kept his legs wide apart as he pushed into Debbie. His huge balls were all that I could see as he drove his cock into her and rode her with long, slow strokes. I could hear Debbie moaning and murmuring to herself, and then she started to come. Suddenly, I noticed Paul's strokes quicken and, as he buried his cock into Debbie, I realised he was coming as well and he had no intention of pulling out.<br><br>Only then did I rush into the room. I do not know if I shouted or if he heard me, but I distinctly remember Paul falling back with sperms jetting from his huge cock. Debbie still lay spread, unable to move.<br><br>Later, when Paul had gone, I noticed sperms lying on the cushion where she had been fucked. Since that night I have not made love to my wife - I don't think she would have felt a normal sized prick after being serviced by Paul anyway. Debbie missed her period at the end of July and has now missed it again - she was obviously made pregnant by Paul, even though I interrupted him as he was filling her with his seed.<br><br>I don't know what the future holds, but I feel angry that, after three years, a young man can come along and ride my wife, without her even insisting that he used a comdom as she had done with me - life can be very unfair.<br><br>any more?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
