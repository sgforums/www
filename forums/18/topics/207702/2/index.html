            <div class='col-md body'>Due to the influence of the american pop culture. Sex is deem to be a pleasurable form of exercise to many young brats. Love is no longer something that truly can last forever but girls are always so gullible to believe that their first true love will always be their one and only. When the tast the scare fruit they might be addicted to it. Western influence help to convince the girl that sex is nothing just pleasurable, this give them an excuse to caryy out their activities.<br><br>Truly the boys are to be blame too. The concept of love and BGR have chged so much from the believe that if u love someone u are deem to shield the person frm harm and misery ,just like how a mother protect her child, always and forever to something in which they let their homones control and guide them on their way of showing love. Worst some are into the relationship simply the get a tast of the first fruit.<br><br>Why have the thinking of both sexes change? The way in which the child is brought up plays an important role. In ancient china moral education come first compare to the learning of practical subjects(science). The first book they are taught are things like Dao de jin (a book of moral codes and condect). The society emphasis the difference between men and women. Most importantly there are harsh law that punishes ppl who are not married and have sex. The people do not just frown upon such actions, some even took matters into their own hands. But now, after modernisation thinkings change, perspective change, education chage, surely sexual patterns are expected to change too.<br><br>Inculcating strong morals value is the way to go to prevent the outspread of STD. The mindset of saving the first shld be welcome back if STD is to stop its spread. But i will be practical such a scenario is hard to come by again. I propose the teaching of Dao De Jin at a young age. Dao De Jin will surely complement the sex education in later years.<br><br></div>
