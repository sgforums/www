            <div class='col-md body'>Gay backlash<br><br>Some Christians react strongly to Govt's change in hiring policy<br><br>By                                                                                      M. Nirmala<br><br>THE Government's change of policy in hiring gays is causing a stir in the  Christian community. So far, it has prompted a meeting led by the mainstream National Council of  Churches of Singapore and an online campaign against homosexuals by another group.<br><br>The  Straits Times understands that the council, which represents Anglicans, Methodists and  Presbyterians, among others, met last Thursday and is expected to issue a statement soon.<br><br>The  council president, Methodist Bishop Robert Solomon, could not be contacted as he is  overseas.<br><br>Also on Thursday, a group of 20 Christians from different denominations, voluntary  organisations and professions, met and agreed on a plan of action for Christians to tackle 'a volatile  situation' that they said had arisen out of the policy announcement.<br><br>This point was reflected in  an e-mail signed by Pastor Yang Tuck Yoong, who is from the Cornerstone Community  Church.<br><br>He said that the Thursday meeting ended with a 'consensus to draft an immediate plan  of action that every pastor and church can adopt in our battle against homosexuality'.<br><br>He asked  Christians to 'express their concern' to their Member of Parliament, through letters or during  Meet-the-People sessions, and send their views to the Feedback Unit and write letters to the  media.<br><br>This group's reaction comes in the wake of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's recent  revelation that the Government is now employing openly homosexual people, even in sensitive  jobs.<br><br>When contacted, Pastor Yang said that his church was not officially involved in  organising the Thursday meeting, during which participants called on fellow Christians to act  against the 'homosexual agenda'.<br><br>'We are merely alerting our members to the importance of  speaking out on a matter of public policy - as individuals,' he said.<br><br>When asked how many  people the e-mail had been sent to, a spokesman said about 400 but later amended the figure to  more than 100.<br><br>The church in East Coast Road was started in 1990 under the Anglican church  umbrella but became an independent Pentecostal church in 1995.<br><br>In a July 20 message titled  'Don't keep silent', on the church's website, Mr Yang stated: 'We cannot stand idly by.  Homosexuality is a sin and it is far more rampant, militant and organised than most of us actually  believe it to be.<br><br>'The battle lines are now drawn and it is time for the Church in Singapore to  rise up and make a stand.'<br><br>The gay issue has been hotly debated in the media.<br><br>In a letter  published in Streats yesterday, Dr Thio Su Mien and eight signatories said 'we should not allow  our society to be slowly eroded by the growing agenda of homosexuals in our society'.<br><br>Expressing a different view, Reverend Yap Kim Hao, a Protestant, said in a recent letter to The  Straits Times: 'I applaud the stance of the Prime Minister in announcing that the Government is  more open to employing gays now.'<br><br>Sister Theresa Seow, president of the Inter-Religious  Organisation and a Catholic, said: 'It is not very Christian to provoke people to go against a group  of people who, I believe, would not want to be what they now are if they have a choice.'<br><br>Feedback Unit chief Wang Kai Yuen said that while groups have the right to express their views,  they should do so within certain boundaries.<br><br>'They must respect the views of others and  respect a person's right to be what he is,' he said.</div>

They now seek to de-legitimize any cause of justice whether it be global economic justice or freedom for the Palestinian people by opportunistically labeling them anti-Jewish. They attempt to prove that the Palestinian solidarity movement is Anti-Semitic by pointing to the small group of fascist right-wing ZOG supporters who opportunistically use mass demonstrations to promote their anti-Semitic views. The ADL refuses to differentiate between criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism. The ADL is also avidly anti-Muslim condemning any and all organizations that attempting to organize for equal rights for Muslims in the United States.  The ADL is also helping promote anti-Semitism the world over by discrediting the legitimate fight against anti-Semitism. .<br><br>ZOG (Zionist Occupied Government)- Anti-Semitic<br>ZOG is an anti-Semitic movement that seeks to explain the US support for Israel by saying that Jews control the United States Government, economy, and mass media.  ZOG supporters are effectively Anti-Semites who wish to spread their Anti-Semitic hate speech in more mainstream circles (as opposed to the crackpot neo-nazi and kkk circles) ZOG is a movement that is popular in far right Christian groups, and at one point even President Nixon proscribed to ZOG ideology.<br><br>NA- (National Alliance)- Fascist, Anti-Semitic, Anti-Muslim<br>The National Alliance is a small fascist neo-nazi group infamous for its losing battles with Anti-Racist Action activists.  The National Alliance is openly Anti-Semitic, Anti-Gay, Anti-Black, Anti-Hispanic, Anti-Asian, Anti-Arab, and Anti-Muslim.  In fact the only thing that the National Alliance does like is white people.  The National Alliance has been unsuccessfully attempting to hijack the Palestinian movement to spread anti-Semitism.  They have held anti-Israel demonstrations numerous times in Washington DC. Usually Palestinians and Israelis protest this idiotic and hateful group arm in arm.  The National Alliance also praised the 9/11 hijackers claiming that they supported them in their efforts to strike at "the Jews running America".<br><br>ZOA (Zionist Organization of America)- Zionist, Anti-Muslim<br>The ZOA is a right-wing Zionist organization dedicated to defending and supporting the Israeli government oppression of the Palestinian people.  This organization frequently makes sweeping inaccurate generalizations about Muslims and Arabs. In addition, this group opportunistically attempts to discredit the Palestinian solidarity movement by falsely labeling it anti-Semitic.  The hypocrisy of their anti-Semitic label was exposed when the Chicago chapter of the ZOA gave the anti-Semitic zealot Rev. Pat Robertson an honorary reward.<br><br>KKK (Klu Klux Klan)- Fascist, Anti-Semitic, Anti-Muslim<br>The KKK is a white power hate group notorious for its lynching of blacks and other minorities.  The KKK is openly anti-Semitic, anti-Arab, anti-Muslim, anti-Gay, anti-Hispanic, anti-Asian, anti-Catholic, and anti-Communist.  The KKK is mainly located in the south and does not draw very many members any more. The group praises Adolf Hitler and routinely carry swastikas and do Hitler salutes.  Their every action is usually met with determined protest by mostly everyone in society.<br><br>CCA (Christian Coalition of America)- Anti-Semitic, Zionist, Anti-Muslim<br>The Christian Coalition in America is one of the biggest Zionist supporters in the United States.  However this wholesale support of Zionism is not a support of the Jewish people.  It is evident that the Christian Coalition and many of it's supporters including Jerry Fallwell and Pat Robertson are avid anti-Semites.  It is most likely that the Christian Coalition and people like Robertson and Fallwell support Zionism because they see it as a way to make sure that all the Jews in this country pack up and move to Israel.  The Christian Coalition is also anti-Muslim and its leaders have often made inflammatory and false remarks about Islam that they have later been forced to apologize for.  The CCA is not as open about it's hate as some of the other organizations, but the hate is there under everything that they say and do.  Pat Robertson has written numerous anti-Semitic books including "The New World Order" which makes fabricated claims as to an "international Jewish banking conspiracy".<br><br>JDL (Jewish Defense League)- Fascist, Zionist, Anti-Muslim<br>The JDL is a Jewish terrorist organization responsible for the terrorist killings of at least 7 people in the United States, including the director of an Arab-American group.  The JDL targets Arabs as well as moderate and leftist Jews who dare to speak out against the actions of Israel.  The leader of the JDL was recently arrested while plotting to blow up a mosque and an office of an Arab-American congressman.  He then committed suicide before the trial.<br><br>WCOTC (World Church of the Creator)- Fascist, Anti-Semitic, Anti-Muslim<br>The World Church of the Creator is a white power fascist fringe group who want to start a "racial holy war" against people of color and Jews.  Their goal is to eliminate all non-whites and Jews from American society.<br><br>True Peace- Anti-Muslim, Zionist, Fascist<br>True Peace is a right-wing Orthodox Jewish organization that promotes racial hatred and intolerance.  True Peace member Zelig Krymko has made statements including "We should not call Palestinians Palestinians, we should call them ruthless Arab occupiers of Jewish land",  "Peace can be achieved only when we kill Arafat and 30,000 PLO members", and "all Palestinians who do not accept Israeli control over all of Palestine should be put on buses and expelled from their homes and lands".  The True Peace website also states "God gave Israel to the Jews, there is nothing to negotiate".<br><br>Nation of Islam (NOI)-  Anti-Semitic<br>The Nation of Islam is an organization that practices a perverted form of Islam. The NOI preaches that the woes of African-Americans in America is due to "Jewish Conspiracies".  The Nation of Islam believes that Elijah Muhammad is the last prophet of Islam, and that Black people have origins outdating the Garden of Eden and Islamic creation stories..<br></div>
