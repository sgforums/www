After all the fairest judgment is derived only after listening to all sides and views.  &amp; The firmest belief comes from an irrefutable strength of conviction.<br><br>Let there be openness!  By speaking out, every speaker reveals both good and bad sides of himself.  So public official statements from the church (or any other religious leader) actually reveals more varied aspects of the religion, both benign and insular.  &amp; That's a very good thing.</div>
