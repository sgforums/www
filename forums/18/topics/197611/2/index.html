You can close all the TN and massage parlour, they become karang guni women! You close down their karang nehneh business, they turn to home delivery services of all sorts...they're here to stay and we have to live with them.<br><br>Expect these whores to go out in full force to look for customers now that their illegal biz is being busted.

            <div class='col-md body'>it takes two hands to clap... PDMM provide lewd services because they see a market here. the supply of customers ensure that PDMM service is here to stay. BUT why did the PDMM want to capitalise on this industry? If they are that enterprising, they can still work something out that do not degrade their character. For godsake... They have children. i wonder if their children know what their mother are doing? Will such values pass on?</div>
