            <div class='col-md body'>Majority of these PDMM are into sex related trade like massage palour or those tui na center ( all are fake ). They come here wif their children ( really theirs??? ) and enrol them into local schools. High sch fees and our high cost of living bitting deep into their pockets. With no other choice, most end up working in tui na centers in order to survive. And whats going on inside those tui na centers, no one know  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  .<br><br>So, you pity them or hate these PDMM leh?<br><br>My own views on these china ladies, NEVER trust them. They know its very expensive to live in sg and yet die die borrow from loan shark in order to come to sg. Main reasons not to come here study or learn English ( in this case I refer to students ) but to earn fast cash. You really think Singapore standards of English so high meh???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> There are many institutes or centers offering English lessons in China. No need come Singapore learn.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PDMM is becoming a social phenomena or problem in Singapore. That's why the polices took actions these days. There are many reasons that why it is what it is right now. I believe most of PDMM are in Singapore for good intension. There must be something that we can do from both PDMM and the Government side to make the situation better.<br><br>Everyone - no matter ladies or guys, from China or from Singapore - wants to have a better life or create a better life for people their love. The ways they do it can be good or bad.  Many Singaporeans study/work overseas, and there are many PRC students are studying/working in Singapore as well. We also observed illegal immigrants/workers became a serious problems in many developed countries, e.g., US, Germany, France, Singapore. In the night, Girls from Thailand, China, Malaysia are all over Geylang, Orchard tower area. Among them, some are PDMMs. I believe, however, most of PDMM are coming to Singapore for good. There are many things in Singapore attracts them here. 1 of the most significant drivers is the better education system in Singapore, not only for language, but also for the opportunity going overseas and working in Singapore for future. They gave up their established life in China and came to Singapore with their kids.<br><br>As many early immigrants, many of they also believe they can find something to do in Singapore even they were told it is illegal.  The only thing, however, they could do in Singapore is the 'lowest level' job that Singaporean would not want to do, e.g., cleaning, massaging.<br><br>There are many of them are providing 'special services' for extra money. We definitely see a strong demand for this market. The government is doing the right thing now. The only worry that I have is whether those PDMM will start to do the same thing underground. Here are couple of recommendations that I would like to give both the government and PDMM:<br>1: Tighten the visa processes for PDMM, and set the right expectations for them<br>2: Allow PDMM to do certain kind of jobs for certain amount of time, especially those jobs that Singaporean do not enjoy doing<br>3: PDMM should get organized and help each other to live in a healthy life<br><br>I believe most of the people would not enjoy being harm to others as long as they have a proper living.  We all can make the society better by working together.<br><br>What do you guys think?<br><br></div>

The problem is that the ones making a honest living have been smothered by those who are here to do illicit business, and they do not speak out or attempt to correct that impression.<br>-----<br>Agree. A handful bad example can destroy the image of the entire group. I hope most of us can see what are the majority of immigrants are doing, not only those appearing on newspaper.<br>-----<br><br>Furthermore, they have not been seen to be able to accept tempered criticism of their countrymen who are not doing a honest living, and get all worked up.This is not the PRC, this is Singapore.<br>-----<br>Can you elabrate a little more on this? What's the diff between PRC and Singapore?<br>-----<br><br>We welcome immigrants and foreigners, but they must show effort to integrate into our way of life first and foremost, before attempting to inject what they want into our melting pot.<br><br>-----<br>Well. Understandable, but not completely agree. It is always important for immigrants to work hard for integrating into local culture. At the same time, it is also important for the local culture to take good things out of immigrants. America is a good example of learning from various culture.<br>-----<br><br>It also doesn't help that the State chooses to delineate racial relations and not propagate a single Singaporean melting pot identity which we all can subscribe to.<br>-----<br>Fair point. I beleive the goverment is working on this to create a singaporean identity. It is, however, a long term vision.<br>-----<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
