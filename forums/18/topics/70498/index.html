            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think gay men are people too leh so why they cannot get married huh?Nothing wrong with that what why so conservative and i find that in singapore,people find it hard to work with gay men and gey men are always leads them to think of AIDS . I personally know a few gay men and yes i was like the others before . See gay men run or siam as far as poosible don't get too close with them treat them like parasites but after you know them,they are actually normal paople just like us it's just that the majority like girls but they like the same sex . I noticed something too the singapore government also turn a blind eye to people suffering from AIDS.The singapore government does not give free aids medication the people suffering from aids are actually paying almost all their salary every month for the medicine so how about their food and lodging ? I think singapore should provide free medication to those suffering from AIDS and not suck their blood while they are suffering like hell everyday .  people suffering from aids are very chiam liao not because they sleep around some kena through other causes too. I think the government should change the law liao . In canada , gay men are allow to get married . why ? because this will make them stay faithful to one another so they aids will not spread like wildfire.Forumites correct me if I am wrong.If one is in the goverment service or private sector suffers from aids , will he or she be dismissed ?<br><br><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/em32.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Both islam and Christianity do not allow for ppl being gay.I'm not sure about the other major religons though.And while i do believe gay ppl are ok...since i do know a few and most of them are nice.Singapore culture is just not yet ready for this kind of thing.Even in Europe and the USA they are not allowed to get married.Well apart from that 1 city in the US and i think holland....not too sure abt that though</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well well well. gay rights? marriage?<br>let us examine what marriage means. according to the canadian courts (the only one so far in canada) who accorded marital status to the 2 gays, they assumed marriage to be just that -- a legal recognition that two people are in love and that they, like other people, should according to the doctrine of equality, be given status so that they can annouce to the world that they are married. what the originator of this column failed to mention (and started dissing singapore off as a conservative nation) is that there was a public outcry in cananda with majority of the people feeling that that should not have been allowed in the first place and this decision as to whether same-sex marriages should be allowed should have been left to legislature to decide. He also fails to mention the ripple effect that occured. tons of people scurrying over to that particular city to legalise their marriage, creating headaches for lots of legal problems regarding trusts, property division, children care, subsidies etc.<br>so what does marriage means to the average singaporean? the average singaporean i believe, according to statistics, will have a religion, believe in the scancity of marriage, that marriage is the bedrock of a family and procreation, that marriage is not merely formal proclamation to the world that you are in love. That being so, it is very difficult to understand why gays should have the right to get married. if britney's one day marriage caused such a public outcry what is wrong with the average singaporean being apprehensive to the thought of gay marriages. politicians merely instill the reflection of society's values in its laws. i am not being pro-government but hey, let's all rethink what our arguments are before accusing the government and the singaporean for being conservative morons.<br>There is every good in keepign the idea of marriage as a sacred one between man and woman. the idea of allowing marriage to be a symbol of just love or perhaps lust, and using marriage as an alternative to prevent gays from having free sex is repulsive. it is a ludicrious idea that promiscuious gays will, after getting married, suddenly decide that they would become chaste. if they truly loved their partners, they would have stayed faithful the minute they got together. stop using marriage as nothign but a mere signing of a formal document!<br>i dunno about you, but sometimes i feel that this gay issue thing is going too far. Are gays really born or made? i do not wish to see confused adolescents thinking that gay is the way to go, and that it is an alternative in event that they don't get a partner of the other sex.</div>
