Self praise is not true recognition of your abilities. I do not have a problem with people defending their own schools, but at least do it with some dignity and respect. Not by babbling and screaming nonsense as LazerLordz has pointed out. Doesn't matter what school it is, such comments only create an even poorer image of the school.<br><br>Besides, this kind is all gossip and i'd doubt anyone really takes it all as seriously as ting@ting has. Rumours and gossip is almost travelling ard abt any school. And please wadeva, I am not Coffe_O! Look carefully at the nickname. If you have a problem with Coffee_O's comments, then you direct you posts to him. Don't take it out on others! I'm sure you don't wish to be seen to be as silly as the rgs girl who has posted here.<br><br>There is nothing to be jealous about being in RGS or any other school. Pride and self-worth aren't determined by what school you are in. Being in a good school is perhaps an honour, but you do not go around boasting about how good you and your school mates are even if your grades are better. Wouldn't that be arrogance then? Btw, arrogance really ticks me off. And I'm sure I'm not the only one.</div></blockquote>i was not directing at you. -.-" u look at the fella's posts. all he ever wrote was. rgs only has ***** etc.</div>

A lot of them especially in Bar. More eager to insult than anything. Maybe more since activity here is higher. I don't always post nice-sounding messages myself although I try to. If you're going to come into bar, then be prepared this happens. Right or wrong, it happens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think people should not simply look at a only few students from rgs and determined that the rest are like that. We must look at this from different angles. Not all rgs girls are proud and arrogant, not all are smart. Critism can be made but they must be backed up by evidence. ting@ting was just trying to speak up for her school. Nobody like insults. RGS girls tried hard to get in there only to be insulted? Every school has rumours and the reason for this particular forum is perhaps because rgs is a famous school.</div>
