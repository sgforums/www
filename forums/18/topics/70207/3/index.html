            <div class='col-md body'>To wadeva:<br><br>Don't you know that self-praise is detrimental? Self praise is not true recognition of your abilities. I do not have a problem with people defending their own schools, but at least do it with some dignity and respect. Not by babbling and screaming nonsense as LazerLordz has pointed out. Doesn't matter what school it is, such comments only create an even poorer image of the school.<br><br>Besides, this kind is all gossip and i'd doubt anyone really takes it all as seriously as ting@ting has. Rumours and gossip is almost travelling ard abt any school. And please wadeva, I am not Coffe_O! Look carefully at the nickname. If you have a problem with Coffee_O's comments, then you direct you posts to him. Don't take it out on others! I'm sure you don't wish to be seen to be as silly as the rgs girl who has posted here.<br><br>There is nothing to be jealous about being in RGS or any other school. Pride and self-worth aren't determined by what school you are in. Being in a good school is perhaps an honour, but you do not go around boasting about how good you and your school mates are even if your grades are better. Wouldn't that be arrogance then? Btw, arrogance really ticks me off. And I'm sure I'm not the only one.</div>
