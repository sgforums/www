            <div class='col-md body'>Now come to think of it, maybe its a waste. But better be safe than to regret. One reason why I dismissed the whole thing is because I find it too sudden. Though we are very close friends, its too sudden. Of course, I have my fair share of seeing them zaogengs, which it seems obvious, but they dont really bother to hide.<br><br>Sometimes, they wear loose top and when they bend down, I can see wonders. I do fantasize over them, and that weekend was really a godsend. But I suspect that they have something up their minds. I do wear panties. I suspect that they might have seen me wearing. Why so? They pop me this question a few days back of how I think of guys wearing panties. I mentioned that its up to them to wear if they like it.<br><br>You might have guessed, yes, I was wearing panties that day too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Maybe they just want to see me in my panties.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know somebody who actually did masturbate infront of three girls before. The guy was a friend of one of them, but did not know the other two. The three of them actually asked the guy to do it totally out of curiosity, not out of lust. The guy had fun, but the girls were actually disgusted by the process, maybe because of the ejaculation.</div>
