I'm a black sheep. But there are some over at the boys side as well.<br><br>Good girls do exist. I have plenty of friends that are real good decent girls (I know that because I'm a girl too, they don't need to act good and decent to me) but they don't have bf. Not because they don't want or they shunned away from men. More because guys don't go after them because they are not much of a looker, plain Janes.<br><br>Even the plainest boys go for pretty babes(I know not all of them are that shallow), but looks does play a part too. Cannot deny the fact that if the girl is not a looker, you probably won't even notice her in the first place. You probably would notice the 'chio-er' girl beside her. What more to say to get to know her better and like her?<br><br>Then again, girls nowadays are getting more calculative, more materialistic and practical, just as boys still goes for the hot bod, sexy butt, great looker.<br><br>--&gt;checked: I admitted I'm not a saint. I'm a sinner. I am also guilty of some of the deeds mentioned.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
