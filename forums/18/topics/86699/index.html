            <div class='col-md body'>They may look pretty and colourful in their bikinis and swimshorts, but stars at the taping of the upcoming TV variety show Celebrity Telematch were shy to show off their bods - save for one male celeb<br><br>By Wendy Teo<br>teowyw@sph.com.sg<br><br>HE didn't mind showing off his bod, unlike most of the ladies, who were rather shy.<br><br>Actor Chen Hanwei, bared....well almost all, to give The New Paper readers a cheeky glimpse of the dragon tattoo on his right butt cheek.<br><br>Some of the female MediaCorp artistes at the first taping of the upcoming variety show Celebrity Telematch at DownTown East's Wild Wild Wet theme park were not so forthcoming.<br><br>Except for former Miss Singapore-Universe Jamie Teo and actress and slimming centre spokesperson Huang Hui, they were worried about the scrutiny of the camera.<br><br>Insecurities were abound as bikinis had to be worn and figures - perfect or not - had to be flaunted.<br><br>So while the more confident ladies strutted around comfortably in their sexy swimsuits, the insecure ones resorted to 'camouflage'.<br><br>Not so Hanwei.<br><br>The actor, who had his tattoo done last year, was game to flaunt his bod.<br><br>ART FORM<br><br>'I have always thought of tattoos as an art form,' he said.<br><br>The dragon is not Hanwei's Chinese zodiac sign, by the way. It's the rooster. He liked the design.<br><br>The 35-year-old paid a Japanese artists he met about $100 for the design, and shelled out another $100 for the tattoo to be done in a local tattoo parlour.<br><br>He decided on the unusual position of the tattoo because it could easily be covered up by clothes.<br><br>'I frequently play the good guy in dramas, so I have to make sure that the tattoo is not too visible. By putting it on my hip, the tattoo is for my eyes only,' said Hanwei.<br><br>But it was a painful experience, he revealed.<br><br>'The pain from tattooing is bad. It's the sort of pain that goes to your head. I don't think I can go through that again,' he said.<br><br>But back to the ladies.<br><br>But despite being the spokesperson for Royal Body Perfect slimming centre, Florence Tan was seen covering her tummy with a clipboard as she sat down.<br><br>Er, isn't she being paid to flaunt her flab-free assets?<br><br>The 27-year-old sheepishly explained: 'I haven't been visiting the slimming centre for nearly four months, because I have been away filming in China.<br><br>'I missed local food so much that I've been having second helpings during dinner.'<br><br>Florence had initially tried to cover up more by wearing a singlet, but had to take it off because it caused too much friction on the rides.<br><br>A more successful 'camouflager' was Michelle Liow, 27, who was surreptitiously hiding her 'big' thighs under a pair of beach bermudas. She had asked the wardrobe people for the longest pair of beach shorts they had.<br><br>'I'm very happy with my upper body, but not my lower body! My thighs are a bit big, so I have to hide them,' explained Michelle.<br><br>Ex-host Yvonne Yak (more popularly known as JiJi) was even more cautious - she wore a yellow spaghetti top over her bikini top and a pair of beach shorts.<br><br>Meanwhile, former Miss Singapore-Universe Jamie Teo's good figure - there was the slightest hint of a six-pack ab - was also getting high points from her good friend and host of Celebrity Telematch, Dasmond Koh.<br><br>Dasmond's praise was blunt: 'She is big where it matters.'<br><br>Jamie's figure is the result of much hard work. The 27-year-old does 200 leg lifts every night before she goes to bed.<br><br>Apparently, her motivation comes from her younger days of being a 'fishball'.<br><br>Exclaimed Jamie: 'I used to be so fat when I was young, that people called me a fishball. They kept comparing me to my sister, who was very skinny, and always asked me if I was stealing her food!<br><br>'So at the age of 14, I decided I should start looking after my figure, and I do my leg lifts every since.'<br><br>Unlike Florence, the other slimming centre spokesperson Huang Hui, was another confident babe like Jamie.<br><br>The Mary Chia girl had gone for a toning treatment just the day before, in preparation for the celebrity telematch.<br><br>CONFIDENT<br><br>Huang Hui, 25, said: 'I don't have a perfect figure, but as a woman, I should be confident of what I have.'<br><br>Perhaps that's why her Telematch team-mate Zzen, couldn't seem to keep his hands off her!<br><br>While trying to unlock an underwater treasure chest as part of the game, Zzen had almost tugged off Huang Hui's string bikini in the process, which earned him much teasing from his colleagues.<br><br>The 26-year-old insisted he was only trying to prevent Huang Hui from being swept away by the current in the wave pool, but he agreed that Huang Hui has an excellent figure.<br><br>'I've never seen her in so few clothes, so I never knew she had such a good figure until today!' he drooled.<br><br>But from an informal poll that The New Paper conducted with the male artists, veteran Carole Lin came out tops for the hottest bod.<br><br>Chen Hanwei, Hu Wensui and Brandon Wong all thought that Carole had a 'proportionate' figure, and was slim in a healthy way.<br><br>A very pleased Carole told The New Paper: 'I'm flattered! I must thank my parents for passing on such good genes to me.<br><br>'No matter how much I eat, I don't put on weight.'<br><br>Are we jealous or what?<br><br>All play and no work made it a wild, wet ride<br><br>IT was more like a fun excursion for the celebs rather than work.<br><br>At yesterday's filming of Celebrity Telematch, the 10 MediaCorp artistes were clearly having a wild time.<br><br>Split into two teams, they had to compete in games which included a relay match where they had to navigate against the current of the wave pool, and figure out the lock codes to underwater treasure chests.<br><br>They created such a ruckus cheering and jeering at the same time, it was probably a good thing that the Wild Wild Wet theme park was closed to the public.<br><br>But the Slide-Up ride (right, carrying Jamie and Hanwei), touted as the scariest ride in the park, did leave some of the celebrities green and stumped.<br><br>The two teams had to take turns to slide down the U-shaped ride in a dinghy, while trying to figure out Chinese proverbs from the hint provided on a placard held by the host.<br><br>Most of the girls couldn't stomach the ride.<br><br>Florence Tan's knees were visibly wobbly after her experience, while Carole Lin was in a state of shock after hers.<br><br>She said: 'The people up there were so naughty! They didn't count 1-2-3 before pushing us off, we were caught by surprise! I think I'll spank them!'<br><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-07-21/wematch-060401.jpg"></div>
