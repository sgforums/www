            <div class='col-md body'>Sleeping with another person during a r/ship with YOU = Betrayal<br><br>As I was reading the replies of many pple, I got really confused abt how pple think nowadays.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Coz how one may perceive things is based on the analytical ability together with one's beliefs &amp; values *shake head*<br><br>This issue isnt abt whole-heartedly loving the person's or juz after her body (a regular sex partner) though it may seem to be. That's confusion. It's abt the ACTION (having sex) of his gf a desirable move? Of coz, many may rebute that if he loves her alot, then he shld forgive her. Guess it's not that simple, a BETRAYAL is as good as destroying the trust btwn the 2 pple.<br><br>However, that's juz my opinion. Wo you jin sheng jie pi, theefore I can never accept. You maybe able to do so BUT if you are ready to do so, find out the REAL reason of why she still went ahead with bedding the guy. Izzit bcoz of U (problems existed btwn U2, this is an escapism for her?) or purely LUST (to me, unforgivable <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> ) Find out the reason whether to move on with her or to move on in a NEW direction <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

Remove the fluff and cut to the pure and simple facts:<br><br>1.  this girl had sex with other people before having sex with you.<br>2.  this girl had sex with another person when you are together and  nothing is wrong with your relationship.<br>3.  If you did not find out yourself about the situation, she would probably not tell you.<br>4.  She "repented" only after you found out<br>5.  She decided to stay overnight at another guy's house with nobody around... you think she expected to play monopoly?<br><br>This is a gone case ....<br><br>How many times do you want to get burnt???</div>

But never take revenge... there's no point.<br><br>And if you decide to leave her...at least you know everything about it.<br><br>I just watched Boston Public lastnite on StarWorld... they had an episode on one of the teacher's fiance being caught in bed with another guy...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You should ask her all what ive asked you to ask her...<br><br>Itll help in the long run... cause one day... u'll want the answers to all this question... and its better you get the answers now than later when all is forgotten...if she lies, she aint worth it. Tell her to be honest be with ya... because, what you need is all the facts to make a decision. Dont just go with feelings alone...<br><br>Well, if she really felt sorry about all that and she wants you back.. tell her not to be flirty anymore. As a man, i think you should have more control of her. Tell her you dont want history to repeat itself...<br><br>By taking her back.. you prove that you love her and willing to put history behind. JUST PRAY and HOPE she reads and knows your feeling.<br><br>If you love her bro... stay with her..swallow your pride and forgive her.<br><br>Good Luck Bro...<br></div>
