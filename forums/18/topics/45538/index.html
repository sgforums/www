            <div class='col-md body'>To the best of my knowledge, most girls will tend to have a higher sex urges before and during her period. Some girls dun like the idea of love making during their period as they believe that it is dirty and not good for the guy.<br><br>Certain days of the period will definitely be heavier flow (example the second and third days, not sure the exact coz different girl has different pattern). Avoid those days coz it will be really messy. However, preventive measures can be done like using a towel or two place under her butt if it's missionary style. Else try other styles like she is on-top horse-riding style. Avoid doggie at all cause, least manageable style. Else change location like do it in the toilet while the two of you bath together.<br><br>As for the smell, some girls have stronger smell than others. Some dun at all. Never insert your fingers during the period cause it is hyper sensitive and easier to get infection. And guys, dun juz think of ur sexual needs, think of the girls too.....wash ur dick first coz it is sensitive period, and easier to get infections.<br><br>So far, based on my own experiences, there should not be any pain at all, unless it is done with the girl being tense. But the girls will definitely be more sensitive and easier to reach climax. And most of the time, it is the girls who requested/initiated it cause they are hornier during that period. And it is the guys who mind more...but if as a guy, you dun mind, I would say it is an enjoyable experience to have. The feeling is different, soooo sensitive to you and to her.<br><br>Using condoms will cause the discharges to flow down easier and end up more messy. And technique is important. Dun straight away pull it out once you are done, coz the moment u pull out, the bloody stuffs will juz gush out.</div>

If both parties are agreeable to it, you might just go ahead and give it a try...? Some girls / guys would like it better while other might not.... Some things you would have to take care of is the CLEARING of the mess thereafter and also proper washing up facilities....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
