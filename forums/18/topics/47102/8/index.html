Perhaps,immediately upon their arrival,they should be educated and informed that after molesting our gals,they will get caned on their backside until the skin tears...Another suggestion is for the vendors of porn VCDs at Desker Road to lower their prices to make them more accessible to bangalas....<br><br>As for those equally sick bangalas with homosexual tendencies,I guess it is because they are desperate for sex,do not have the money for commerical sex and yet they do not dare to try anything funny on our gals.So no choice,they have to turn to their own kind...Sad hor? Ya Rite!<br><br>You know something? One of my north Indian friend don't like bangalas also for the same reason as all of us also!</div>
