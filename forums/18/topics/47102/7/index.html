Basically the real problematic issue here is not what they DO, but OUR attitudes towards them. Nothign can be more disturbing then the pure hate and contempt, msot of it misdirected, I see for them flowing out from our arrogrant high pedestals and mindsets.<br><br>What I see here is not righteous anger but rather using their supposed flaws (which are sterotyped anyway), of a very small proportion of the actual number working here, as a smokescreen for our own unadmited racist and discrimotary feelings towards them.<br><br>Why? Because if all of them were as bad as you'd say, we'll already have a very serious crime problem liao. The thing is, you arrogrant singaporeans wun even notice them even if they died infront of you, and the only time you all make noise is when they do something to offend you. And to lump the black sheep all together... is just utterly primitive and discusting behavior.<br><br>Hello, if anything, your attitudes demostrated here suggest you all are no more cultured them them. You may have gone from rags to riches (BTW, your grandparents were the very group of pple you now spit on and dispise) but apparently have not lost the rags mentality.<br><br>When I see the terms "black monkeys", "smelly","discusting" and such being applied to them, I just can't help but remember that back then in the old days, when our grandparents were immigrants to Singapore... weren't this the very lanugage and contempt that the British held for them? Prehaps some ang mo can set up a forum then on dirty chink immigrants? Doign all the things we do now? Insulting our grandparents? How would we like that? Pls lah, wake up your idea...<br><br>Sometimes I wonder who is mroe civillised... the Bangaladeshi who travels across to an alien land to support his family or the Singaporea who supposedly more civillised and advanced soceity and culture murders 14,000 of it's babies in abortions a year.

As demostrated already, some the attitudes here demostrated are to put it lightly, something a potential Adolf can easily use. Lack of tolerance, understanding, sterotype, dehumanization... Division of "them" and "us".<br><br>Basically, if you think the Bangalas' behavior is discusting, from the behaviour and attitudes expressed in this thread...
