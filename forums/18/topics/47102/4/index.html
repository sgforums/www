            <div class='col-md body'>haiz.. i seen all the posts and tot its really not that we wanna be racist but situations forced us to...<br><br>I can rem about all the ogglings at me as and when i go out but not touching of coz maybe due to the fact i oways stared at them back fiercely when they looked at me. But still the oggling is bad enuff to give us bad scares.<br><br>Eg is like when u leave in hall 3 hall 7 area near the construction site when they were buliding a new block for some science course. U can see them loitering around sometimes near the hall and esp on Sunday nites we take the same bus as them back to the campus. We haf fear that they will come to hall 3 blk 19 as there are bangala students also.. esp indians.. afraid they will come to look for their frens and den come up to the third level to oggle at the females esp our blk is not as open as the rest... the corridor has no way to run also if kanna cornered.<br><br>The 2nd level full of Chi-na and bangalas is the most smelly level. The smell can make u faint even or disrupt ur appetite when u walk past them which we oways haf to when we walk up the stairs to the third level.<br><br>Its their culture... so wat if they are educated they are not cultured .. esp they still oggle at gals even if they are in UNI... so if they dun deserve our respect we dun give them ours becoz they also in turn dun give us the respect as a living thing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well....sometime u also must be careful as they come in a large groups, rem one incident when i was on my way meeting my frends after work at Orchard. That day was christmas eve so there are those countdown thing going on that day, On my way there i saw two young guys around 18s those ah beng type  from far looks like scolding four banglas. The  banglas was also pointing finger and scolding them back, 5 girls was also with the guys and one of them also seems like scolding the banglas too, Suddenly across the road a group of 10++ banglas run across the road and join  the banglas who was being scold by the young guys. They immediately crowd around the 2 guys and was like going to beat them up, while a few banglas was trying to pull the girls away and they was shouting for help. When i saw this i quickly run to see what was happening or see what i can help. When i was almost there one of the banglas almost hit one of the guy. So i quickly shout at them ask them to stop, when the banglas  heard me they turn around face me.<br>I ask them what was happening, and what are they tring to do. Also ask them let go the ger and guy. They was like stare at me a few sec...until some of them notice my police uniform on my hand in the cover and told the rest of the banglas. I ask them to back off,  telling them also rest of the Officer coming on the way too....<br>Then they quickly run off..... And luckly no one was hurt.<br><br>SO DEAR FRIENDS PLS BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go read the papers and invariably a significant fraction of the crimes are committed by these stinking black monkeys or the equally smelly and cannot make it ah muds.These two groups constitute only a small percent of the total population yet the number of crimes committed by them are out of proportion to their numbers!<br><br>Anyway,relate to you people an incident yesterday.I was taking 97 to town area.That bus service also goes to Little India,coz its sunday,all those black monkeys took the same bus with me for their mass orgies at Bangala Land.By the time the bus was at Pasir Panjang area,the stench was unbelievable! I was at the upper deck and was surrounded by these black things...But I told myself,never would i share my seat with these smelly bangalas,so I sat in the middle of the seat.There were a few bangalas who came up and saw that I was sitting alone.You look at me,I look at you lor,so? I did not budge and shift my position.Yes,Mr Bangala,you expect me to let me sit with you?</div>
