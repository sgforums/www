            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Theballstopshere:</div><div class="quote_body"><span class="large">Let me relate my personal experience with Bangladeshis. </span><br><br>A few years ago, I used to work in a Chinese restaurant as a waiter during my schooling days. While working, I got to know a few Bangladeshis who worked there as dish washers. They work hard but get paid little, they are very prudent with money. They seldom buy lunch, preferring to cook their own small meals and share it amongst themselves. Whatever money they have, they will remit it back to their folks in Bangladesh.<br><br>These dish washers are usually reserved and quiet folks, who prefer to mix with their own people. And that is the reason why they are constantly bullied by the other workers from Malaysia and even Singapore. As a very young man, there was nothing I could do even though I feel sorry for them. The only thing I could do is to be friendly with them and make them feel better.<br><br>Slowly, I got to know these people better. They are actually extremely nice people if you know them well, hell, they are just like you and me. Some of them have degrees from their universities back in their country but are forced to work here in low-paying jobs because of the bad economic situation. Imagine, with a decent degree and the ability to speak some English, they are forced to face these unreasonable and unkind colleagues who discriminate them because of their race and colour. How would you feel if your in their shoes? Tell me...<br><br>Granted, there are those Bangladeshis who are nasty and get cheeky in large crowds. But come on, tell me how many local guys, when they are in a big group and in a crowded place, tend not to get their hands all around? There are local guys who do that do, but they get away with it because they are locals. When a Bangladeshi does it, he gets all the stick and bat. It just aint fair and not right.<br><br>Anyways, back to my Bangladeshi friends. After I started talking and joking with them, they slowly warmed up to me. Whenever I saw them eating, they will offer me their food. No matter how little they have. Well, I would loved to see Singaporeans do that. Remember, these folks have little to spend and very little to eat, and yet they offered me whatever little they have. Speaks volumes of them.<br><br>I realised they like to hold their friends' hands, and I asked them why. Well, some of you might be interested to know that it means they are real good friends. Only good friends do it. Its their culture. Yes, we find it weird and maybe disturbing, but did you know that many other cultures find us eating fish head as weird and disturbing too? So, get over it and learn to accept them.<br><br>We slowly became good friends, and whenever I bring the dishes to them, they will greet me heartily and joke with me. There were times I even tried to stand up for them when they were bullied. But that was only after I had worked at the restaurant for a while.<br><br>A few weeks later, they offered me sweets, which I politely declined. They insisted on me having it, saying that only give sweets to good friends and it is considered rude to decline them. I smiled at them and took it gratefully.<br><br>I have now lost contact with them. But they did took a picture with me saying they want to send it back to their folks in the hometown. I was touched and grateful that I got to know such simple and kind people. Sure beats many Singaporeans  that I know of.<br><br>The bottom line is, learn to see through face value. Take the bad with the good. Bangladeshis are just like us, they can be kind folks if you get to know them. Stop the name calling, you would not want an ang moh to call us chinese pigs right? I believe in one thing : Dun do onto others what you dun want others to do to you.<br><br>Dorian-X, and a few others here: I understand the rage you have for them. But please, stop these name callings, your behaviour borders on the extreme. You certainly dun want your children to grow up thinking like you, do you? There are many nice Bangladeshis out there, just like there are many bad Bangladeshis. Same goes with the local population. Maybe, one day, if you get to know a Bangladeshis will your mentality change. Think about it a Bangladeshis may have done nasty things to your girlfriend. But a local guy may have just been as capable of doing the same thing. Just like a Chinese worker or a Malaysian worker. I know of some good Malaysian friends, are they all bad?</div></blockquote>wow. well. i certainly hope most ppl can be as good as yr friends. haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
