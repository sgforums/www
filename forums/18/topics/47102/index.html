            <div class='col-md body'>yes i must say the situation is getting outta hand.large groups of aliens will gather ard on their off days,sunday.thais like to drink and then create troubles.bangras like to 'accidently' touch touch gals...<br><br>had many incidents many years back when i was still in sch,everytime sunday go orchard.at night take bus 64/65 to go home,the whole bus will be packed to the brim with bangras...and we will always be with a few gals,they always complain the bangras will rub here rub there if we were standing.and will bio until siow if we got seats,try to look down their tops and stuff....til we got so fed up,we will elbow all the bangras on the bus when standing.AND hear this,draw out our hunting knives to play with when we seated...no more bangras problem after that.but i dun suggest u try it nowadays,some of them are armed to the teeth now.i think its becos there are more of them these days...some of them even try to play gangsters here....jux imagine,farmer job in their own frigging country earns peanuts back there.we give them a job here,and now they are gangsters....lol</div>
