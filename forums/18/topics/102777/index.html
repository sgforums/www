            <div class='col-md body'>Apparently having a degree &amp; working in an office has given some women the illusion that they are "smarter".<br><br>But when it comes to marriage, it's not about who's smarter but who's willing to show more commitment to the marriage. And in that sense, SG females are failing miserably.<br><br>The local feminist-infested media creates a false impression that most foreign brides are from poor villages who just want a PR. Reality is that many SG men are marrying foreign brides with degrees and some who even own their own businesses. There's been an increase in the number of Singaporean men marrying Japanese women. But you will NEVER read about such foreign brides becos the local media is infested with petty feminists.You will only read about the taxi-driver/hawker/store assistant types who marry village girls but NEVER about the doctors/engineers/lawyers who marry foreign women who are lecturers/UN translaters/biochemists. The reason you won't read about it is becos local women in the media cannot handle anything positive that happens to local men. (In contrast, you'll constantly read gushing, over-exaggerated stories of local women marrying FTs).<br><br>But, truth is, many of these local men-foreign woman marriages are with partners who are highly educated.<br><br>What sets these foreign women apart from the local feminist filth is that these foreign women, despite being highly educated, are more family-oriented. They are more willing to spend $$ on their kids tuition than on the lastest prada handbag. Local men know only too well that the foundation of a society is the family unit. That's why they choose foreigners over locals. It has nothing to with being "smarter". It has do with a willingness to be more commited to the family. And that's all local men want.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I have dated local and foreign gals and I realised that local gals are arrogant and materialistic as compared to foreign gals.<br><br>All the gals I date all have tertiary education, they all come from rich families. But foreign gals dun expect the world to revolve round them, they dun say things like, "I only see a future with you only if you have a good job, a nice suit and a powerful car" (her words exactly)<br><br>Foreign gals are more concerned about their partners and they are also more confident in a different way. Local gals are confident in bitching about others, confident in their jobs. Foreign gals are confident about themselves (ie. they dun want to marry into money. They want to earn lots of money. Many local gals want to marry into money).<br><br>You can raise any statistics, international surveys or state any article from the local media to disprove my claims, but I have done field tests, albeit a small sample, but still very drastic differences.<br><br>Soon the trend will be towards local males marrying FTs too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can't be helped. Also at the risk of sounding MCP, its because SG girls are getting too smart for their own good. Even a certain LKY last time did mentioned he regreted it a bit for pushing female education so high. But truth be told, I am happy to see SG girls make progress.<br><br>I do agree that they are sometimes a bit too materialistic compared to foreign girls. Which is what puts off successful men sometimes.<br><br>The sad thing I guess is that they are so focused on breaking their stereotype that they try too hard to become a MAN. Thus losing their feminity. Regardless of whether its MCP or not, I guess most guys like their gf or wife to be more lady like, gentle, demure and supporting. Want to get treated like a woman. Fine not a problem. Then act like one.<br><br>The last interesting point to take note of is the fact that most ladies from other countries do not have this issue. They can be successful and yet be womanly at the same time. Singapore seems to be the only country with this current problem.<br><br>Well like one lady reader wrote. I guess unless he really is Prince Charming with everything( money, power. manners etc) they really would rather settle for a cat or dog!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm just so sick and tired of topics like this.<br><br>Yeah yeah, the media focuses on SG men marrying villagers and such by female feminist. But they also focus on the women who think of their careers and having a money tree for a husband instead of of sharing, caring and helping to nuture the kids.<br><br>There are many SG girls here who do not marry for money or place themselves on a pedestal and proclaim they know it all. Many successful SG women still find time for their kids.<br><br>There are many SG women with degrees and masters who marry a sg guy with a diploma or less.<br><br>I'm one of those and so are many of my friends. In fact, one of them has a Masters and her husband only have an 'N' level cert. Do we look down on our husbands in anyway? No we don't because success and HAPPINESS is not measured by how much one earns and how far you climb up the corporate ladder!  I don't see the problem with the guy earning less because I can earn my own keep! As well, as long as he is not a moocher and has a good charcter, I don't see the problem.<br><br>You can be successful in your career but your family life is in a mess! Anyways, if we wanted to complain about SG guys, trust me, the list is also a mile long.<br><br>Seems that SG guys love to nitpick on SG girls to me so far!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Every country has their share of Intelligent and less intelligent people (or gals for this matter). SG Gals may be educated, but I will not be so sure about them being smart. Same thing for other countries actually. Seen too many degree holders who failed to understand even simple concepts (both guys and gal). In fact, I was recently "kindly informed" by a Taiwanese that they have 90% entry rate into University over there. And same thing, I will not be sure about if they are really more "intelligent".<br><br>The education, culture and it's effect on SG gals to a very much extend has the same effect on the guy population as well. So, if there is a problem, then the problem lies with not just SG gals, but SG guys as well. This is because they go through pretty much the same education system and exposure to the same culture, media etc.<br><br>The overemphasis on material is not a gender issue, but a national issue whereby the teachers, the media and the people themselves always measure others in terms of exam results, materials they have and money they earn. So, it is of no surprise that when it comes to selection of a life partner, a number of people starts is choose in this same way.<br><br>For both men women who are interested in looking for something more than just material expectation, then that is when both genders needs to look harder and perhaps look oversea for potential candidate of a lifelong spouse. Are they right to do so? Yes, each individual has his/her right to look for what he/she think is best for him/her. And if the local are not good enough, then looking oversea cannot be excluded, though one may need to consider the possibilty of cultural differences and acceptance.<br><br>In this respect, one cannot blame people for choosing a Vietnamese wife who may be able to fulfill the role of a obedient housewife, a French wife who may provide a more active sex life, a Shanghai wife who may be more seductive, a New Zealander who may provide a more outdoor kind of lifestyle and etc....<br><br>I rest my case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess most of us SG guys are at a disadvantaged. We are shaped into our mould by our environment for economic purposes and are valued for that. But at the same time, we are penalised for it too. Life is never perfect.<br><br>Thats true about the external part to a large extent I think. Why else they go for guys with car, money, high education etc? If you are from an elite family or rich then don't say lor. I think Elindra mentioned not all girls are like that. I of course agree that that is true. But the question is how many % are not like that. Not a lot. And with the increasing stance on materialism and girl power here, I think it will get even worse. Of course these applies not to the elite or rich people hor<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sidestep1984:</div><div class="quote_body">sigh....<br>its really hard to get a gerl be interested in a guy becos of himself rather than all the external factors...<br><br>i'd rather marry a gerl with an ITE cert knowing that my children would having a loving mother than a genious who is so bz with her career over the children's upbringing...<br><br>i guess i am too old-fashioned...guess i am too simple...but i really agree that gerls are too smart for their own good nowadays...simple things seems to be the easiest solutions so help me god...</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Well I am hearten by the posts that people are not blindly branding the sexes<br>and there are always exceptions. But I feel to compare is difficult... like comparing apples to oranges. The similarities end at that these are all fruits.<br><br>I felt its the kind of society we grow up with, we are driven by fear, ie fear of not having enough $, job, food, shelter and whatever because we know that if we fail to get these basic necessity on our own, no one will help.  So people get trapped and start thinking of ways to get security and for some, its in the form of material goods. Society, culture, upbringing and everything plays a part. It cannot be concluded exclusively.<br><br>I would say to some people that they cannot choose their family, at least choose their future spouse carefully. Some times, people make bad choices and then assume the rest will be the same case - Tar Brush Effect. Then if they had a successful instance of a new item, then the assumption is that all the rest are also good - Halo Effect. For guy or ladies who met with lousy grabage, hey get a move on, and dump that burden. If you know such kind of garbage, don't entertain any longer and waste time cause if the guy/lady cannot get things right in his/her head, he/she never will.<br><br>I can only say, of the negative comments I've heard about the singapore ladies, the same I hear from Malaysian Ladies about Singapore guys. The comments revolved around immature, childish, shallow, not gentlemanly, no social skills and etc. Most foreign ladies more or less condamn local guys and even the foreign guys whom I've spoke to also mentioned the quality of local guys is so poor, they understood why the local ladies choose to marry out, or stay single.  (don't shoot the messenger)<br><br>However, as I lived my brother's ex-housewife who is a taiwanese. She's worse than most local girls here in terms of shallowness, materialism and laziness. She bankrupt my unemployed brother, made a maid out of my mom, and is now stating that my father (a 70 yr old hawker and scrap collector) has to help his son pay her alimony and she is fighting to get her child whom she abandon so that we pay her more money. Actually she wanted to boot my parents out of the house and get cash for it and regretted not having been able to get more money out of my family. Foreign brides better?<br><br>I have a vietnamese friend whom I had worked in 2 projects with. To other people, she is nice and say all the nice things. Behind your back, its another story. With the husband and people who work with her, she's a nic-picky bossy bit.ch you want to tear her face out. But because she looks sweet and easy, people thinks she is being bullied and she admitted she always is the one bullying people. She only wear expensive and branded stuff only and talks about the same shallow stuff as any sg girl. And she's also married to some extremely rich bloke in singapore. So, is foreign women not power, money, materially hungry. I think people have not meet up enough people from other countries.<br><br>Anyways, relationship is a two way effort. The guys who think the girls should be nice, sweet and submissive got to come to terms with the 21st century. The girls who think the guys should provide materially and pamper them all the time also have to come to terms with the 21st century.<br><br></div>
