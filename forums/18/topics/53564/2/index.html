            <div class='col-md body'>shaun, t-711 &amp; striker... nothing personal.... but I think the confused ones are you guys...<br>this topic is posted by whoof... advise is to go to her.... but you guys are giving me your advise? wake up man... If you ain't got nothing better to write...then don't waste our time.... keep your comments to yourself if you think its not going to help the situation..<br>thats why girls always think we men are insensitive... here's one classic example. When someone needs the consoling and advise, you guys add salt to the wound by commenting on other people and forget the host.</div>
