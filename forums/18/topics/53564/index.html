And when u are angry, words tend to fly out from ut mouth without u knowing it urself wats coming out. It does not mean he has no feeling for u. IF he doesnt, why will he treat u so good? He din mention it after it happened mayb becos he dun wan it to affect u and dun wan u to think of it anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Hmm.... y not take it as an arguement broke out and scolding is normal? well, like i said he propably dun wish the incident to hurt ur rls, tts y he dun mention. But if u hols on, its going to turn fr nth into another arguement le... so, try to take it easy.... let time make u forget it... I believe tt if u wan to forget it, u can.. and if u wan to rem it, u will... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Then understand that your BF is also human and has his own frustrations.

This is also not endorsing that him using vulgarity is good and right, cos it'll become a habit. But the most sensible way and thing to do is to talk it out. First admit your fault for your temperament, then explain to him that you're hurt about the vulgarity he used. If he loves you, he'll understand and try not to repeat that. Also, repeating that cannot only mean that he doesn't love you.... Your tolerance can be until unless he raises his hands...then that is really a NO NO!<br>Whoofwhoof... using vulgarity is just a show of his frustration.. it could have been started off by you... would you rather him using violence to show his frustration?......<br>take care...</div>
