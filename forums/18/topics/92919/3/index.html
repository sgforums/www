Though there would obviously be some sort of smell which is different from person to person, but when it smells fishy.. that is a possible indication that something may not be right down there... some type of infection perhaps?  Best that she go see a doctor bec not only is it not a pleasant thing as you have discovered but that there could be some health issues too.<br><br>Dont treat this lightly.<br><br>Below is an extract from an article...<br><br>[b]Candidiasis or thrush is caused by an organism that normally lives in or on your body (skin, mouth, gut). It is a type of yeast called Candida albicans. When your body is healthy, candidiasis is kept under control. Sometimes it grows and multiplies. This is more likely to occur if you are pregnant, wear tight clothes, are taking antibiotics, have diabetes, are unwell or have sex with someone who has it. It is treated with cream and medication.<br><br>Bacterial Vaginosis occurs when bacteria that normally grows in small numbers in your virgina multiply. The treatment is a short course of antibiotics or cream.<br><br>Trichomoiasis or TV is caused by a tiny parasite that is occasionally found in the virgina and urethra. It is possible to have it without having symptoms. You can contract it by having sex with someone who has it. The symptoms (unusually coloured discharge, <span style="color: blue;">a fishy smell</span>, soreness or itching around the virgina) starts between 4 days and 3 weeks after you have had sexual contact. TV is treated with a short course of antibiotics.</strong><br><br>By the way... if she does have any thing... it may have been you who have given it to her ok... not necessary as someone has suggested that she had been unfaithful.  Of cos if you had neber poke anywhere then the answer is obvious. but otherwise, dont jump to conclusion.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Wow pei fu pei fu... U know a lot ah.</div>
