I mean, it is not like happening recently.. since our grandparents' days, it is a norm for rich old man to marry 2 or 3 wifes who are much younger..<br><br>if you mentioned abt the 40 year old uncle marrying the 20 year old girl in GET REAL! erm.. that one i cannot agree...<br>that uncle was my teacher in SIM..  Mr Sunny Goh, and his wife is his student.<br>A few times i saw them in school behaving rather intimately, which i cannot accept...<br>maybe i am just too conservative...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a real-life story.  A friend of mine married a 24 year old woman when he was 45 year old.  A year later his wife gave birth to his daughter who is now in Primary 4.  Two years later when he was 48 year old his wife gave him a son who is now in Primary 2.  Soon after that his wife divorced him on the grounds of unreasonable behavior.  I ask the chap what sort of unreasonable behavior has he been gulty of and he told me that shortly after the birth of his son, he became impotent.  He couldn't sustain an erection no matter what he tried and that his wife soon hooked up with a man who was in his early thirties.  Following the divorce, his wife got custody of the children and she moved in with the other man.  My friend has to pay his ex-wife $1600 each month for child maintenance as well as give her half of the proceed from the sale of the matrimonial home.  He is now living in a rented flat, depressed and alone, being allowed to see his children once a fortnight.  He spends his hours after work loitering around his ex-wife's &amp; her lover's residence hoping to catch a glimpse of his children.  He does that from 6.30pm to 10.30pm each evening when the lights of his ex-wife's residence go off.  Once he confronted his ex-wife's lover and they got into a fist fight which resulted in him with a broken finger.  His ex-wife's lover made a police report and the case will soon be heard in court as he is being charged for assault.  All this is a result of his impotency and his inability to satisfy his young wife's sexual needs.   Want to marry a woman 20 years younger that you?  Better make sure you're sexually up to the challenge although most men are sexually potent right up to 60 years of age and beyond.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casefan:</div><div class="quote_body">This is a real-life story.  A friend of mine married a 24 year old woman when he was 45 year old.  A year later his wife gave birth to his daughter who is now in Primary 4.  Two years later when he was 48 year old his wife gave him a son who is now in Primary 2.  Soon after that his wife divorced him on the grounds of unreasonable behavior.  I ask the chap what sort of unreasonable behavior has he been gulty of and he told me that shortly after the birth of his son, he became impotent.  He couldn't sustain an erection no matter what he tried and that his wife soon hooked up with a man who was in his early thirties.  Following the divorce, his wife got custody of the children and she moved in with the other man.  My friend has to pay his ex-wife $1600 each month for child maintenance as well as give her half of the proceed from the sale of the matrimonial home.  He is now living in a rented flat, depressed and alone, being allowed to see his children once a fortnight.  He spends his hours after work loitering around his ex-wife's &amp; her lover's residence hoping to catch a glimpse of his children.  He does that from 6.30pm to 10.30pm each evening when the lights of his ex-wife's residence go off.  Once he confronted his ex-wife's lover and they got into a fist fight which resulted in him with a broken finger.  His ex-wife's lover made a police report and the case will soon be heard in court as he is being charged for assault.  All this is a result of his impotency and his inability to satisfy his young wife's sexual needs.   Want to marry a woman 20 years younger that you?  Better make sure you're sexually up to the challenge although most men are sexually potent right up to 60 years of age and beyond.    </div></blockquote>how come never try viagra?<br></div>
