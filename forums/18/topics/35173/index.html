            <div class='col-md body'>that has to do with japanese culture<br>he's your superior so he can treat you as someone younger, and some contact on shoulders or back is ok. butt is suspicious liao<br><br>forget about educating them about local culture if you are in a jap firm with jap bosses at the top level. there is a glass ceiling that local managers cannot break through, and because they keep a gap between their own and locals, there is no way they are going to bother about what you think. what they think is way more important.</div>
