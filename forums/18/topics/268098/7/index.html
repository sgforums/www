            <div class='col-md body'>I think you should stop feeling sorry for yourself and concentrate on living in the present or the future.Sure, this little action of yours may eat you alive from the inside but that depends how much attention and energy you are willing to spend on it.<br><br>Also, stop letting your bf treat you like carpet. Your problem is you invest too much without much return. Voice your concerns with him, and if he dosent do anything, just dump him. Actions speaks louder than words. Then if he changes, you can go back to him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by guilt-stricken:<br><br>I thought of this too, like come up with a story then finally ask him," What if i did this to you?"<br><br>Actually i know he won't leave me, just like if he did that to me, i won't leave him... despite the character clash, i know there's love...<br><br>But the issue is trust.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Trust, as you know, will never be whole again once it has been broken... One part of me tells me that i'd broken it, so i should confess and build the trust with whatever i can again..<br><br>But one part of me knows very well that trust is not something that can be built with efforts over time once it's been damaged... </span> Trust is a natural essence between 2 people, you can earn more trust from neutral, but it's almost impossible to go from negative to even neutral again... <span style="color: red;">People forgive, but hardly forget... if you get what i mean... </span><br>If there's anything i can do to have his full trust again after i tell him about it, believe me, i'd do anything, kowtow 1000000 times also can... Name it, anything...<br><br><span style="color: brown;">But the scary thing is when there's nothing I can do at all... and the relationship will just remain broken with only verbal forgiveness but a knot in his heart forever....</span><br><br>Erm... not sure if you understand what im trying to say...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></blockquote><span style="color: blue;">Although trust, once broken, is never the same again, it is possible to bring it to a high level that doesn't exist before it's broken.<br><br>It is possible for couples who have had affairs to come together again to rebuild a better relationship, let alone your case, which is hardly an affair.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Although people do forgive but don't forget, the important goal to forgiving is to rebuild the relationship, and the important goal of not forgetting is not to revisit past hurt and grudges, but to bear in mind one's responsibility towards not making the same mistake again. In that sense, not forgetting is a good thing. Hope that makes u feel better.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">That's where you may be glad you are wrong. In a way, if you love him enough, your actions would show, and he would forgive you eventually, although it's hard, and sometimes we tend to take the easy way out. Relationships are an ongoing thing, we must always bear that in mind. It's not static. You underestimate your own powers of enriching the love in your relationship. Sincerity and love can move mountains. </span><br><br>I'm going to search out that article, and msg it to you. I couldn't find it yesterday. Give me some time..<br><br></div>

He served a couple of months and is released recently.<br><br>And he is remorseful and tells you he's determined to make good.<br><br>There would be people who will tell him "Great, I'm glad you will make good in life. You sound truly remorseful".<br><br>And there would be people who would tell him "You're junk. A thief is always a thief".<br><br>The common thing between these types of people is they don't condone stealing. The big difference is their heart, and their kindness, compassion towards others, or the lack of it.<br><br>At 18, I think you and your peers are concerned with self-expression and although, you may not be aware or it, are concerned with putting people and their behaviors into boxes and compartmentalizing them.<br>"He's a good student, and tries hard in life" - RIGHT<br>"He's a buaya, and flirts with all girls" - WRONG<br>"She's a good and kind person, who helps friends in homework" - RIGHT<br>"She's a bf-stealer" - WRONG.<br><br>And it may very well be that the above pairs of statements describe the same persons.<br><br>The truth is life is a complex process, and everyone has different roles in life, which he/she may not achieve excellence (moral/academic/sporting) in. I am sure you know of some fellow student who is excellent in studies, sports , well-liked by teachers, but somehow you think his attitude sucks.<br><br>Having said that, my point is that one should be compassionate towards others, and not condemn them for their past mistakes. You may rightfully say that "they never change, they don't learn", but who are we to judge their level of remorse?<br><br>I am not sure if the above thinking is acceptable to guys your age yet.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. After reading through the thread, i would suggest that you reconsider the relationship.<br><br>You mentioned you tried to date him but he puts his game before you, with zero effort of repaying your understanding by not planning another date out.<br><br>As much as i love computer games,(i clock 17-hour-gaming days before i had my gf.) i believe Girlfriend &gt; Computer Games.<br><br>Your bf is childish and self-centered. That's coming from a fellow gamer who is the same age as him. Also, is he working ?<br><br>Questions.<br><br>Do you really love him or do you love the stability he provides? (I mean a hardcore gamer wont really bother about flings outside.)<br><br>Or you just cannot bear to waste all the efforts that you have put into the relationship ?<br><br>An ideal relationship is, in my opinion, one which satisfies both parties, which both can derive happiness from.(I would gladly sponsor a vibrator to my gf if i am a poor performer in bed)<br><br>You are 25, time waits for no one.<br><br>I say you either wake him up or leave him in his bloody World of Warcraft.</div>
