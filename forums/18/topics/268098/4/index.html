But u will have to keep it as a secret for the rest of ur life and nvr do it again that is u if u wanna keep this relationship as it is. Rmb Not only ur relationship with ur bf but ur bf relationship with his good friend will also be affected if u tell him.<br><br>But then if u tell him, the relationship may take a turn for the worse or it maybe better. The worse case senario is that he could not take it and break with u and u will nvr see him again. The better senario is that he could have taken it in a diff way. He will maybe get pissed at u for a long period of time till he could finally accept the fact that u did it cos he couldnt satisfy u and reconcile with u, maybe he will work with u on his premature. That is a more positive thinking but it would take a very gracious bf to do it.

But u will have to keep it as a secret for the rest of ur life and nvr do it again that is u if u wanna keep this relationship as it is</span>. Rmb Not only ur relationship with ur bf but ur bf relationship with his good friend will also be affected if u tell him.<br><br>But then if u tell him, the relationship may take a turn for the worse or it maybe better. The worse case senario is that he could not take it and break with u and u will nvr see him again. The better senario is that he could have taken it in a diff way. He will maybe get pissed at u for a long period of time till he could finally accept the fact that u did it cos he couldnt satisfy u and reconcile with u, maybe he will work with u on his premature. That is a more positive thinking but it would take a very gracious bf to do it. A broken vase will still have hairline cracks no matter how well u super glued it.<br><br>Thats all i can say to u.</div></blockquote>not for her to chose but for her bf to.<br>i don't care about what the outcomeis,justice still have to be served.<br>wrong acts=punishment</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The crux of the matter is that your secret is already in a very shaky position.  Two people know the secret, you and W.  Although you can answer for yourself, who knows whether W will leak out the secret in the future many years down the road over a few cans of cheap beer.  Will this destroy your marriage?  Assuming you intend to get married to your current bf that is.<br><br>Another thing is that there is no chemistry in your relationship with your bf.  Hence the itch to stray.  What you are probably feeling now is that you owe your bf something.  Love isn't about obligation or whatever...it is supposed to be a happy thing.  You're happy together with the person.  You do things together.  Housework, playing computer games, hanging out or going shopping.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rather i believe the crux of this isse is about telling the bf what she has done.<br>she might lose her bf in the process,creates more complexity and tarnish her image but so?<br>When one does something wrong,they should say admit their blunder and not make excuses like what if he leaves me,what if friendship between the 2 friends are lose.<br>These don't matter.<br>Only thing that matters is your boyfriend has been given justice.<br><br>I can imagine her bf still in the dark and being with a friend who had tried to take advantage of his gf and also being with a gal who has been touched.<br><br>now where's the puke smilies?</div>
