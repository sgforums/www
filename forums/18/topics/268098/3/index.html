            <div class='col-md body'>seriously here...some of my female friends have cheated on their bfs. AND THEIR REASON IS ALL THE SAME. "Never bring me go out, never sent me home, all he does is just work, come home play his games/watch soccer, everytime go his house accompany him, sick of it"<br><br>Those girls need a freaking slap to wake them up. Don't tell me when your bf was wooing you, he didn't wait for you, send you home, pay for everything and stuff?<br>Some girls just itchy backside, like the feeling of being wooed all over again. Girls, don't say you want a stable relationship. Cuz stable=mundane. Does any one of parents here go dating? Movies? How many of parents hold hands when their out? Yet do you see them having affairs? Okay maybe some do, but that's a diff story. The main point is, that's what a real stable r/s is about.<br><br>At the rate of this kind of thing happening, does that mean i have to worry about my gf cheating on me? After all i spent most of my free time at home playing my xbox, rarely go town with her, and she comes over to accompany me on her own accord.<br><br>To TS, yeah your bf plays his games all the time. At least it's better than he goes out and gets up to no good.</div>

I am pretty ok with W and we just kept each other company as friends at first, coz all our friends are either attached like super glue or married with kids...<br><br>Then last night, i let him fondle my bre*sts and pusssy, but he didn't put his finger in... We didn't kiss, neither did i touch him... It happened like it was 2 lonely souls doing something they know they shouldn't.<br><br>For me, i was longing to have great sex again before i forget how sex feels like, but i am glad it didn't happen. We stopped right there and he just gave me a peck on my forehead. It was like a silent," yeah, we shouldn't". But still, intercourse or not, this is still cheating...</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">And now:<br><br>I'm here all by myself with this dark secret and i hate myself so much. No matter how boring my bf is or how selfish he was not to mind what i like to do, i still shouldn't have allowed another man to touch me, not even holding my hands, let alone personal parts...<br><br>I am so guilty and i smsed W how i feel and this is the worst thing i have done to anyone behind their backs...<br><br>I tried to push blame to my bf, telling myself that he's partly responsible for all these to happen.... but no matter how i push, i still feel that i have no excuse at all... I feel cheap and sick... I feel like W and I deserve stones thrown at us.<br><br>Yes, i will still feel sexually deprived by my bf's 30 secs skills, but NO, i will not try to be funny like this again... I always pictured myself to cheat on him sooner or later coz i was feeling unsatisfied...<br><br>But now that i had really sort of done it, the only feeling is have is guilt, so strong that it makes me feel sick inside out... And it doesn't make me happy at all, i destroyed a friendship i had with W and feel like the worst girlfriend in the world... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>And ironically, right now, all i can think of is my bf getting food for me when i'm hungry, pick me up and send me to places, hugging me tenderly to sleep...<br><br>All i can say is," Cheating is nothing fun, that's if you have a conscience. It just eats you up."  </span></span><br><br></div></blockquote>u did the right thing not to cross the boundary. but one grave mistake u made was...<br><br>u smsed W "how u feel and this is the worst thing u have done to anyone behind their backs..."<br><br>if W is a gentleman, he will move on n delete those msg, forget those incident. but what happen if he became sore n use the msg u sent to him to threaten u to show ur bf just to have another 'fun nite' wif u?<br><br>i afraid this kinda huff-huff r/s might not have a full-stop yet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

It is just that few voice it out ... lol<br>But, u really have to consider what zeny states... Can u really tahan him for the next few years or next few decades??? The faster u break up, the less pain it will inflict on both of u...<br><br></div>

He doesn't like to do things with me (shopping, beach, pubs), and we only do things he does (TV, PC games, PS2). I got fed up coz while i'm willing to play games with him, whats wrong with going places i like to go with me?<br><br>To top that off, he comes in 30 secs in bed, that now i go zzzz in my head during foreplay coz i know there's nothing to look forward to...</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">The senario:<br><br>My Bf has been away for a month now for work and one of his close friends, "W" just got hurt badly by his gf (now ex). I am pretty ok with W and we just kept each other company as friends at first, coz all our friends are either attached like super glue or married with kids...<br><br>Then last night, i let him fondle my bre*sts and pusssy, but he didn't put his finger in... We didn't kiss, neither did i touch him... It happened like it was 2 lonely souls doing something they know they shouldn't.<br><br>For me, i was longing to have great sex again before i forget how sex feels like, but i am glad it didn't happen. We stopped right there and he just gave me a peck on my forehead. It was like a silent," yeah, we shouldn't". But still, intercourse or not, this is still cheating...</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">And now:<br><br>I'm here all by myself with this dark secret and i hate myself so much. No matter how boring my bf is or how selfish he was not to mind what i like to do, i still shouldn't have allowed another man to touch me, not even holding my hands, let alone personal parts...<br><br>I am so guilty and i smsed W how i feel and this is the worst thing i have done to anyone behind their backs...<br><br>I tried to push blame to my bf, telling myself that he's partly responsible for all these to happen.... but no matter how i push, i still feel that i have no excuse at all... I feel cheap and sick... I feel like W and I deserve stones thrown at us.<br><br>Yes, i will still feel sexually deprived by my bf's 30 secs skills, but NO, i will not try to be funny like this again... I always pictured myself to cheat on him sooner or later coz i was feeling unsatisfied...<br><br>But now that i had really sort of done it, the only feeling is have is guilt, so strong that it makes me feel sick inside out... And it doesn't make me happy at all, i destroyed a friendship i had with W and feel like the worst girlfriend in the world... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>And ironically, right now, all i can think of is my bf getting food for me when i'm hungry, pick me up and send me to places, hugging me tenderly to sleep...<br><br>All i can say is," Cheating is nothing fun, that's if you have a conscience. It just eats you up."  </span></span><br><br></div></blockquote>u not clone of a clone right?</div>

I guess many would agree that communication is important in a relationship. I am wondering if it would be better for you and him to sit down and talk over some of these things that are bothering you a lot (exclude the first post part). Perhaps both of you would be able to come out with a compromise.<br><br>Waiting for Andrew's views...</div>
