For example if he plays games and instead of joining him, i sit there and complain whole day that he's playing game and not keeping me company...

It's to give unconditionally... maybe subconsiously, or even consiously, when i go into his world and do the things he loves because i know they make him happy, i also expect him to do the same... apparently, not everyone can adapt to changes very well, and he could be someone who prefers to remain who he is with a take it or leave it style...<br><br>But....... easier said than done... i've been learning for near to 3 yrs, still in kindergarten.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

My bf only brings me out with his group of friends to do the things they do, he doesn't like to go out with me alone... haha, dun ask me why, coz i dunno :p Thus we always hang out together and in the past, W will always call me to ask me for romantic ideas to do for his now-ex-gf... and he's also my shopping kaki...<br><br>But after this thing, i think we can never be the same again... now the thought of him makes me feel dirty... though i allowed it to happen, but still, i feel er xin....<br><br>I called this an affair coz to me, it's not the length of time, it's the fact that it happened... one night stand to me, is an affair... with or without intercourse... i wouldn't think of it as nothing if i see my bf holding hands with a girl, even if he tells me," i hold her hands for one min only, then u caught me liao".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>It's funny that in the past when i pictured cheating on him, i thought of it as something that isn't that wrong coz he's the one who refuses to work on our differences...<br><br>But now when it really did happened, i couldn't find any excuses to support my scandal... Every excuses i used to play in my mind all seem terribly invalid now...<br><br>And well, if i were smarter, i would have known better the theory," Do not unto others what you do not want others to do unto you."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Pitot:</div><div class="quote_body">I am still puzzled as to the fact that you are so certain he is the one for you?<br><br>I mean, you can disagree with him and even think abt cheating behind his back, but now you are willing to change for him?<br><br>is this you being guilty or otherwise?</div></blockquote>I have always been trying to change, this is why i learned to play PC games when i couldn't even function the W A S D keys very well for directions... I'm a game idiot... when i played CS, i didn't even know i died when i was looking at things horizontally... and still asked him to adjust for me LOL... (well, this is just one of my dumbest moments in game)... And now, i have a rather powerful character in world of warcraft (but still a noob in disguise :p)... i know how hard i tried to play as well as him so that we could have fun together...<br><br>And when a new show is on screen, i suggested going for it and he will very lovingly tell me he'll get the dvd for me when it's out... i also dunno whether to laugh or cry... To him very sweet la, to me i want to die.. wahahah..<br><br>To ans your qns,<br><br>All along, ive been trying, and when he doesn't try, i feel resentful and thus the thought to cheat. I'm not trying to push the blame back to him, just to let you know why i had those thoughts... i thought that by having someone to fill in the blanks might work, i could have the things i want and come back home to him... But...... Cheating really not easy... now i know...<br><br>No doubt i'm terribly guilty now, but it's not guilt that makes me want to work harder, but an acknowledgement that if i can feel so lousy now, it means that he means a lot to me, more than i thought...<br><br>I thought i could do it guilt free coz i was on verge of strangling him everytime he refuses to bring me on a date.. (Even my b.d cake is cut at home lol)... And i thought i would come home a happy girl... But apparently, it wasn't what i thought... When i was being touched last night, i was more guilty and uncertain than enjoying the process... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

I don't make friends with guys when i go clubbing and stuff... and i keep conversations casual all the time if i do talk to anyone... and i always say i have a boyfriend and can't give numbers... this is why i never had any such encounters...<br><br>For W, i guess it's a familiar feeling, I don't know how to put it...<br><br>As for your next qns, filling up the gap is one reason, but you got it right, it's more of a out to spite him case... i'll be telling myself, he doesnt want to do it, there are many guys who would want to do it... i dun wanna look like a total loser to him that without him, i have no choice but go out alone or to get stuck at home... (Though many time i lied that i was going out with frens, but i was in fact out shopping all alone... )<br><br>But everytime when im out with W or other girl/guy friends, i wished he were there with me... when i see pretty things, or found a new cozy place, first thing that comes to mind is i wanna bring him there.... but next moment i just snap at myself," He won't come."<br><br>And finally, yes... i am totally remorseful and can't imagine doing this ever again... This is really the worst thing i had ever done to anyone in my life.... Scary.....<br><br></div>
