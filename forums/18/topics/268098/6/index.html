I am sorry and by telling him, i know that things will never be the same again... It's a very sticky situation regarding to tell or not to tell...<br><br>We all know that honesty is the best policy, but how many can deny that sometimes, honesty can break you too...<br><br>I am not trying to justify my decision to keep it from him, in fact, i really have the urge to kneel down in front of him to say im terribly sorry...<br><br>But i have already hurt him (silently) with what i had done, i really don't know how to hurt him further with the cold hard truth... (Ok i know <span style="text-decoration: underline;">someone's</span> going to say im trying to sound like im doing my bf a favour by keeping it from him...)<br><br>Like i said, it would be so much easier if i had a change of heart and don't want to be with him anymore... Then perhaps i can just admit it and even get away with a nonchalent manner," So what? You can't give me so i get from someone else lor..."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div></blockquote>TS, putting your problem into a long-term perspective...<br><br>And I can see you are really apologetic about this cheating thing....<br>Keeping silent about this is going to hurt you, and if you cannot forgive yourself, it might be bad on the relationship (we are talking about years down the road, when you have kids and all that).<br><br>Why would it hurt the relationship?<br>Firstly, because it's a lie that you've been keeping... You may take this secret to your grave, but you would always feel guilty, and you may compromise on the quality of the relationship e.g. sex. and harbour alternating feelings of resentment/guilt.  For e.g. you might feel upset at his lack of sexual prowess, but instead of working together amicably to solve the problem, you feel "sorry" for ur bf, and the problem remains as it is.<br><br>Secondly, if he learns of it (via you, or that friend) accidentally or intentionally, he's going to blow. Very often, it is not the act itself (after all, it's only fondling, and no sexual intercourse) but the very act of keeping from him. He would feel like the stupidest person on earth, especially if the "adulterer" is his friend, whom he may like to confide in/do things together..<br><br>You can say the above 2 points apply to the present state of your relationship. And that you cannot risk losing him because u love him. Well, I would say it's a choice of a "weak relationship" or none.<br><br>Much as it is difficult, I would think that telling him the truth, and asking him for forgiveness may be the most sensible solution. But I don't know your situation enough to say that that's the best action for you to do. Because I don't know your threshold of losing him.<br><br>One big positive I think your bf can get out of this, is that he would be forced to confront the fact he's not a good lover in bed, and he may just jolly well start to open his mind to improving himself.<br><br>I have read an article somewhere on infidelity, and how the woman feels that she's not sorry for it, and in fact, it has helped her marriage. Will PM you tat article.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br></div>

So do I and many people.<br><br>Since we are not super saints, we can do wrong anytime (due to moments of weakness), right?<br>If that's right, will you accept harsh insults and punishments and not feel hurt?<br><br>I don't know about you, but I rather not.<br>And therefore even though I believe in justice, I will try to be compassionate and understanding to those who has fallen by the road because I believe that they, like me, believe in justice but are fallible.<br><br>In that sense, we are all the same, aren't we?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Everyone has a personal code and feels that it is right.<br>I agree that all of us need personal codes that acts as moral compasses to guide us in this world.

I think you get my point...</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">You may seek or even beg for extreme punishment, but your loved ones around you, especially your parents, would hope for leniency. And because you don't want to let your loved ones down, you might want leniency as well</span><br><br>Since you haven't been in the army before, I think I can give you some advice on there. Self-righteousness is a bad trait to have in NS.<br><br>You may not get killed literally, but if you step on the wrong toes, you get into real trouble.<br><br>Let me give u one example, during guard duty, you might want to check that you are assigned 5 bullets. But if someone sabo you, and take one bullet away, you're in for 7 days of Detention Barracks.<br>So even if you don't like ur buddy for him cheating on his gf and boasting to the platoon mates for it, you keep your opinion to yourself.<br>Don't dish out your own brand of justice. It gives u more enemies than u can guard.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys...<br><br>I'd really like to thank all of you who had come close to my heart and understood my emotions and struggles... I really appreciate it a lot, and given that we are strangers and we don't even know each other in real life, i'm really thankful for all the support, (not in what i do, but in my broken emotions...)<br><br>For those who believed i am really sorry, i thank you for feeling my innermost remorse, and for that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">someone</span></span> who doesn't, i'm sorry that i caused so much anger in you for 4 days of your precious time..<br><br>I received comfort from all who forgave me, advised me and defended me... and most of all, believed that i'm truly remorseful...<br><br>After all, i didn't start this thread to make enemies, i just needed to let it out... I might keep this secret forever, or i might collapse and confess, i don't know...<br><br>But i just want to say a really big thank you to all.. Coz no matter what you posted, in CAPS or no caps, you were there for me, typing on your computer screen when i was all alone with a dark secret in my room...<br><br>Your presence, whether constructive or destructive is greatly appreciated... Truly....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boka</strong>,<br><br>All along, i never thought you were wrong at all, the only thing that bothered me was your attitude... Noticed that i didn't say anything when people posted s.lut or biatch? I know my deed is shameful, and those are the right words to use, but it's a matter of attitude...<br><br>You didn't really care to understand how i felt at all and you just began to attack me with full force... and you started using caps and questioning my upbringing when i didn't even say anything to rebuke you in the first place...<br><br>For your info, my parents are nice people who taught me the correct values, it was me who failed to be someone more upright, and not that my parents failing to guide me... I love my parents and i reallly hate it when you said that twice...<br><br>All men are fallible and everyone would have moments when they have fears in admitting their mistakes due to consequences, But nevertheless, if you could be someone with all the values that you mentioned, i will be very proud of you, and you might just be that special one in God's eyes... You will receive lots of blessings from Him...<br><br>Lastly, as much as you are mad over our posts now, 10 years down the road, when you look back, you might understand what we are trying to get across to you...<br><br>Til then, don't get so worked up anymore...<br><br>I'm only human...<br><br>Peace mate <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Sometimes its better to keep the truth then to tell them. Everyone has secrets. Its is totally impossible to be honest and not keep anything. Diff solution is being used for diff problems. In this case u have to be flexible and keep in mind wad the TS wants. She wants to keep this relationship and by doing that she has to keep it, cos she dont knw how her bf will react to it. It may be a positive reaction or a negative reaction. so the best way is to not to tell. i nvr said it is acceptable to hide one's wrong aslong as it goes unnotice.<br><br>Ts: why not u try to say the prob to him in a third person way and see how he will react to it. then decide.?</div>
