The idea of punishment is not so much about the pain it inflicts, but rather to act as a deterance. It would appear Boka is placing a large emphasis on the pain itself rather than on the idea of reformation itself.<br><br>Also, two wrongs don't make a right. Being as vile, mean and crude as the people you speak out or try to make a stand out against makes you no better than them.<br><br>When you punish someone, the person has to know and understand for what he or she is being punished for. What is the reason behind being punished and not being punished for nothing. On top of that, punishment has to fit the crime. Being too severve or extreme in your punishment is not the right way to go either.</div>
