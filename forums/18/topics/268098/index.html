            <div class='col-md body'>sigh... what's done is done... tell urself u wun do it again... You feeling guilty will mean, hopefully, that u hv regretted it deeply, and thus will not do it again.<br><br>Either you<br>1) tell your bf what u had done, and expect him to give a big uproar.<br><br>You should then try your best to assure and pacify him u wun do it again... It's hard to do I know.<br><br>or<br><br>2) keep it a secret forever and<br><br>face being guilty or face the worst if he ever finds out by himself (hopefully he doesn't)<br><br>Perhaps u shud tell ur bf to give u more foreplay or let u reach a high before he gets his. This way, both shud be satisfied.<br><br>P.S.

He doesn't like to do things with me (shopping, beach, pubs), and we only do things he does (TV, PC games, PS2). I got fed up coz while i'm willing to play games with him, whats wrong with going places i like to go with me?<br><br>To top that off, he comes in 30 secs in bed, that now i go zzzz in my head during foreplay coz i know there's nothing to look forward to...</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">The senario:<br><br>My Bf has been away for a month now for work and one of his close friends, "W" just got hurt badly by his gf (now ex). I am pretty ok with W and we just kept each other company as friends at first, coz all our friends are either attached like super glue or married with kids...<br><br>Then last night, i let him fondle my bre*sts and pusssy, but he didn't put his finger in... We didn't kiss, neither did i touch him... It happened like it was 2 lonely souls doing something they know they shouldn't.<br><br>For me, i was longing to have great sex again before i forget how sex feels like, but i am glad it didn't happen. We stopped right there and he just gave me a peck on my forehead. It was like a silent," yeah, we shouldn't". But still, intercourse or not, this is still cheating...</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">And now:<br><br>I'm here all by myself with this dark secret and i hate myself so much. No matter how boring my bf is or how selfish he was not to mind what i like to do, i still shouldn't have allowed another man to touch me, not even holding my hands, let alone personal parts...<br><br>I am so guilty and i smsed W how i feel and this is the worst thing i have done to anyone behind their backs...<br><br>I tried to push blame to my bf, telling myself that he's partly responsible for all these to happen.... but no matter how i push, i still feel that i have no excuse at all... I feel cheap and sick... I feel like W and I deserve stones thrown at us.<br><br>Yes, i will still feel sexually deprived by my bf's 30 secs skills, but NO, i will not try to be funny like this again... I always pictured myself to cheat on him sooner or later coz i was feeling unsatisfied...<br><br>But now that i had really sort of done it, the only feeling is have is guilt, so strong that it makes me feel sick inside out... And it doesn't make me happy at all, i destroyed a friendship i had with W and feel like the worst girlfriend in the world... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>And ironically, right now, all i can think of is my bf getting food for me when i'm hungry, pick me up and send me to places, hugging me tenderly to sleep...<br><br>All i can say is," Cheating is nothing fun, that's if you have a conscience. It just eats you up."  </span></span><br><br></div></blockquote>Its going to happen sooner or later since you already have this mindset of cheating on your bf.  The best thing you can do to ease your guilty conscience is to confess and make a clean break with him.<br><br></div>

You just need to deal with it (your bad conscience).<br><br>Dealing with your bad conscience includes deciding if you should tell your boyfriend about it.<br><br>Telling your boyfriend about it has consequences too.

You will probably ease your conscience but you now transfer the problem to him and if he does not break up with you, he has to carry this burden with him.<br><br>I am not here to preach to you and so what I am doing is help you be aware of the consequences of your actions and inaction.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eagle:</div><div class="quote_body">Edit: Shouldn't this be in AA?</div></blockquote> She is smart to put it in BAR.

            <div class='col-md body'>sexual compatibility is important between couples. It is not to say it is the most important thing, but to neglect that area is to open up a can of worms for later.<br><br>Perhaps I'm pragmatic. You have done something you shouldnt but hey move on. If making this mistake helps you to treasure your relationship more, it is good. Tough that the guy you did it with is his good friend though. Sometimes we need a shake up to see who is important to us. Though once you open this door to experimentation, it will take a lot of discipline not to fall into temptation again - everytime you are lonely, everytime you quarrel with your bf, everytime you happen to be alone with this guy.<br><br>However, let's hope this guilt won't make you feel like you owe it to him to stay in a relationship with him. If you really don't feel happy with him - well i feel it is always easier to break it up than remain in a rship that is a farce. I don't think anyone wants anybody to 'stay' attached cos of guilt.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since you have acknowledge the mistake, i think you should move on and treat this as a lesson learnt. hopefully.<br><br>But, hey.. If intercourse is a major part of the relationship to you, i suggest you consider what is on the table for both of you and whether, he is the one for you.<br><br>Can you accept someone just because he is good to you?<br>Or what you really want is someone who is good to you and does well on bed.<br><br>Temptations dont just disappear overnight. You need to work it out before you can truly say you have learnt your lesson.<br><br>And i think you should rethink your position of trust and relationship between W.<br></div>
