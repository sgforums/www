            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>First of all, deepest respect for icyprincess for making sound arguments to defend the female sex/gender. I just want to quietly observe whatever being said in this forum but I decided to take part as I thought this is interesting. I'm a male, so don't flame <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The position of women in western societies has changed in the last century.  Gender equality and freedom have became accepted as normal.  This was not always so.  Today, the position of women around the world is a major factor in poverty, child death, war, violence, and other human suffering.  If human societies are to progress in the 21th century then it will have to be the century of women.<br><br>Women have always had lower status than men, but the extent of the gap between the sexes varies across cultures and time (some arguing that it is inversely related to social evolution). In 1980, the United Nations summed up the burden of this inequality: Women, who comprise half the world's population, do two thirds of the world's work, earn one tenth of the world's income and own one hundredth of the world's property. In Leviticus, God told Moses that a man is worth 50 sheikels and a woman worth 30.<br><br>Put aside the facts and figures, I feel that both women and men have got their own strengths and witnesses - Studies show that men can read smaller prints and women can hear better. I feel that sexism must be eradicated. We all see great women rise up to the occasion - Joan of arc and Hua mulan, yea? Natural order requires both sexes to be maintained. Without women and men, the world is not possible to function.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Winson See</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Playstation Didi ah...<br><br>Do you know what you say here is definitely bringing disgrace to the male species. No doubt you claim the male species are far more superior than females, but in every posts between you and icy princess, one can definitely see who the winner and loser are.<br><br>After reading your post, I understood shit about what you are trying to say. If you are so good, your english should have been far far more articulate than that of icy`s. By the way, do you understand what articulate is?<br><br>It is very very obvious that you are denying the fact that women are fast rising for success in terms or career. You, dear didi, is just too busy with you Playstation 2 at home to even want to study and learn proper English. It's because of people like you, most women wont ever fully trust a man.<br><br>If you claim a country is better run by a man, could you please explain the current President of the USA, the former president of Indonesia Suharto, Joseph Estrada of the Phillipines, Saddam Hussein of Iraq? Give me sound concrete transcripts of what good they have all done so I will shut up and leave. Heard of Megawati Sukarnoputri? No... Let me tell you then, she was the President of Indonesia before the current president won in the elections. Obviously you have not done your research before going on to babble `No country has ever been run by a woman`.<br><br>I agree that I do really pity your mother. Try telling your mom what you have said here in SGforums, and see how she will react... cantonese (sei zhai pao). Religion wise, there`s Virgin Mary, who`s treated with high regard, and then there Guan Ying. Are you a christian or buddhist? If you are either one, do not tell me you never worship them.<br><br>Lastly, if you are one of those who just discreetly discriminate against women, then you are a loser. If you do so openly, you are a bigger evident loser. Guys, there`s no offence as to what I am about to say, it`s just my way of giving advice to Playstation didi here.<br><br>'You`re just like a male's public toilet bowl. Ok when you dont open up your mouth. But once you do... you are full of shit.'<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Fire Ball kor kor</div>
