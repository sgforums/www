Someone said to me before that to generalize when you have not collected data from everyone is a very dangerous thing. I do not know how many girls you have met in your entire life, but you have definitely not met all of them. So you can't say all girls depend on guys for a living, there are some out there that I know are very independent and don't give a shit about having a guy in their life or not. For me, I think I do want a guy not so that he can support me, but I will be with him once I know he is the one for me, as in personality wise. Money has nothing to do with it.<br><br>So here's one girl to disprove your statement  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>i.c.y</div>

You see 99% of the girls will only go for guys who must be more powerful , higher educated or earn more money than her. and in the mindset of the girl is , even if I out of job one day, my hubby can support me. Have you ever seen a university grad girl maybe with PHD or whatever relevant find a guy who fry chao gou tio in hawker centre or toilet cleaner earning very much lesser than her...if you ever find, this will be an interesting topic to straits times. But I doubt you will ever find one.<br>As for guys, guys are born to be the more superior than women. Guys earn the money and bring home to feed the wife and child..it's actually very much like the animal kingdom. If a guy does not work and rely on the wife to support him what do you think people will say and will people ever say anything if girl does not work and let the hubby support her.  don't think so. This is a topic I bring up just to tell the girls to shut up and don't pretend to be strong no matter how strong you think you are , male are still the dominate species and this is how god created us. Think abt it</div></blockquote>Now 21st century liao leh, girls are now financially independent. Some even can support their husband and ask them stay at home and look after the kids...</div>
