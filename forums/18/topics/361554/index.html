              <p>NUS students enjoy gay sex and rapes the mouths of innocent teenage boys in HDB lifts.<br> <br> <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking...ry_373074.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_373074.html</a></p>
              <p>A NATIONAL University of Singapore undergraduate who allegedly molested<strong> three teenage boys</strong> in Housing Board lifts near their homes appeared in court yesterday to face charges.<br>Andy Lee Kee Liang, 24, is also charged with performing oral sex on one of the boys, and forcing him to perform the same act on him.<br>Lee claimed trial to five charges – two each of aggravated molestation and unnatural sex and one of attempted outrage of modesty – committed in August and September 2007.<br>He elected to remain silent when Community Court Judge Roy Neighbour called for his defence, claiming he was of unsound mind at the time of the offences.<br>In a statement of agreed facts, Deputy Public Prosecutor Isaac Tan recounted Lee’s acts.<br>The first victim was a 14-year-old boy, whom Lee followed from an MRT station to his block of flats on Aug 30 that year.<br>At the lift lobby, Lee exposed himself to the boy, then got into the lift with him.<br>He positioned himself in front of the victim, put his hands on his shoulders and <strong>kissed him on the lips</strong>. He also <strong>groped his private parts</strong>.<br><strong>Filled with fear, the victim struggled</strong> and tried unsuccessfully to free himself. <br><strong>Lee then knelt down and performed fellatio on the victim</strong>. <strong>He continued molesting him and stopped only when an elderly man entered</strong> on the eighth floor as the lift was going down.<br><strong>Lee then followed the victim out</strong>, held onto his shoulder and led him to a <strong>staircase landing where he directed the boy to perform fellatio on him</strong>.<br><strong>Five days later, he struck again and molested a 15-year-old boy by similarly kissing him in a lift. </strong><br>Lee subsequently<strong> pulled down his shorts and exposed himself</strong>.<br><strong>A week later, another 14-year- old boy </strong>was walking home from the same MRT station when he sensed someone following him.<br>Lee followed the victim into the lift, but failed to molest or touch the boy, who managed to push him away.<br>As a result of investigations, <strong>Lee was arrested at his home three days later.</strong><br>Judge Neighbour granted the prosecution’s application for the victims’ names and details to be withheld. But he dismissed an application by Lee’s lawyer, Mr Foo Cheow Ming, for his client’s name not to be published.<br>Objecting, DPP Tan said the order – under the Subordinate Courts Act – was usually made to safeguard the interests of certain witnesses, in particular young and vulnerable victims of crime, such as those in this case.<br>“Clearly such an order is intended to prevent undue embarrassment for the victims or to heap additional trauma on them,” he said.<br>There was no reason, he added, to preclude the particulars of Lee from being disclosed. Furthermore, his name had been published previously in media reports.<br>A defence psychiatrist will take the stand today to testify on Lee’s state of mind at the time.</p>

              <p>how can u say he enjoyed the sux? the poor boy who was only 14 yr old, only sec 2 leh, he was forced to sux his LJ..the perpetrator is much older and i'm sure therefore was stronger in size. the boy was probably afraid, timid in character compared to the third boy who fought the NUS gay off.. so he complied with the NUS gay's orders.. i bet he was so traumatised.. poor boy.. do you know that many of these victims of gay rapists also became gay due to the trauma?

              <p>My school last time got teach us gals how to prevent rapist, we carry whistle, mist spray and also electric shocker, we were taught on how to use and how to look for suspicion males. At that time, most of our class boys laughed at us, look like they have to learn it too.</p>
