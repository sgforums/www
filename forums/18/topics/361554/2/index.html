              <p>What? Gay people aren't trying to convert straight people to become gay. They're trying to convince you to be more tolerating. For example, they want the same rights as straight people, and they don't want you to discriminate against them because they're different.</p>
              <p>Okay, so it's tragic that a few gays raped some boys. However, don't you think there have been more straight adults that raped girls? You can't turn a blind eye to what straight people do and then when gay people do the same thing, you use it to say how homosexuality is wrong.</p>
              <p>Maybe it's because Singaporeans live in such a conservative, homophobic community that they don't see how untolerating they are. It saddens me, but at the same time makes me glad that although I live in Singapore, I'm not apart of its culture.</p>

              <p>oh! u are condoning homosexuality? if everyone on the planet was homo, the world would have ended centuries ago. fact is homosexuality goes against evolution and natural selection. that is a fact. homos have been playing the evolution card to discredit religion which condemns them but they are ignorant that natural selection is their greatest enemy!!!!</p>
              <p>Natural selection means only those who have the attributes to perpetuate will survive, and those who do not get weeded out. So how can a gene that is unable to procreate stand up to the theory of natural selection hahaha?</p>

              <p>Are you saying we should discriminate against mentally retarded people and let them roam free and get themselves hurt, because that's what evolution dictates? The human race is a civilized species. Therefore, we help people in need. You can't condemn homosexuality to extinction.</p>
              <p>Now, do mentally retarded people find mates and have babies? No.</p>
              <p>Likewise, do two homosexual people reproduce? No. In fact, if homosexuality is genetic and gays are encouraged to stay in the closet and have a relationship with someone of the opposite sex, wouldn't that create more generations of homosexuals?</p>
              <p>You shouldn't discriminate against someone because they are different, period.</p>
              <p>You obviously don't understand natural selection anyway. Natural selection is when organisms with certain "unfavorable" traits cannot find mates, and therefore do not reproduce. By condenming someone's myopia, you can't make it go away. You also can't make a gay person straight, much like you can't make someone who was born without eyes able to see again. Evolution occurs when organisms reproduce; not during their lifespan.</p>
              <p>Who knows; maybe one day, after people finally accept homosexuals and they are encouraged to come out of the closet, that trait won't exist anymore.</p>

              <p>Homophobia is similar to racism in the 20th century, particularly with White/Black people in the US. There were seperate drinking fountains, Black people were forced to sit in the back of the bus, etc. Eventually, racism became considered politically incorrect, but more importantly, morally wrong.

              <p>Also, from your previous post, I interpreted it to say that homosexuality is genetic, since you were talking about evolution and natural selection. Personally, I don't know what causes homosexuality, but I don't think it's a choice, much like how straight people don't choose to be attracted to the opposite sex. </p>

              <p>genetically, it is true that Homos are genetic, but some are from influences and environmental condition. Childhood is a very important stage of sex understanding, some boys may go sway inward and become gay as they hv no interest in facing gals.</p>
              <p>i am not worry about gay boys/men, my worry is those bisexual, can both play with men and gal. Some of the aunties who talk to my grandma, i overheard that their husband are bisexual, wha lau, hope i dun marry a man who is bisexual</p>

              <p>People like you disgust me far more than any gay man ever could. Your statement of gays wanting to turn Singapore into 'Singaypore' is a sensationalist exaggeration as they merely want equal rights and not to be shunned by bigots like you.</p>
              <p>Your suggestion that gay propaganda causes people to be gay is completely unfounded as homosexuality isn't something you can be convinced to practice, it's decided at birth and there is a lot of scientific evidence to support that. Furthermore, since when has rape automatically entailed homosexuality? There is just as much, if not more heterosexual abuse. Does that mean that heterosexual influences in society are causing rape? No more than homosexual 'propaganda' does.</p>
              <p>The real problem lies not with homosexuals but with intolerant bastards like you.</p>
