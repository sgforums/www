Come on, who the fuck cares about your privacy when you don't even show the basic respect to your gf?<br><br>take note, this is a forum where everyone has the right to say what they want. if you don't like it, either you ignore it, or you don't even come here at all. so what if you tell your friends not to visit this website? do you think they bother? why not try telling them about what you did here, perhaps they would be more interested than disgusted.<br><br>well quit trying telling the mod to delete your pic. since you sound as if you are so great and you have the guts and balls to face the music, why request for it? Put on a brave front and wimper at the end? you are just making a joke of yourself and being allowed to be made fun of. your desserts.<br><br>i think your gf would br quite disgusted by you. i doubt you are not having sleepless nites. and if your gf breaks up with you over this matter, even better for you. not cos you are horny, cos you are a brainless coward. a gal doesn't need such a guy like you around her.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> sounds hurtful? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome to sgforums, Alvin and Jelena. I assumed that you don't post in forums much and hence do not know some things that will help make your stay more pleasant in here.<br><br>Here are the tips:<br><br>- In the "Profile" link on your left, you shall select "yes" for the following options:<br><br>i)Hide E-mail address<br>ii)Hide Personal Details<br>iii)Hide Online Status<br><br>- Never reveal too much details about yourself. Since this is a forum frequently supported by Singaporeans, you might be caught asking or saying something you don't want those you know to find out. This is not about being forefront with your identity and particulars, but to protect yourself. After all, whatever infomation you revealed will be pounced on naturally. That's just how the way goes in this forum.<br><br>Have fun posting. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to say something about this posting picture business. You might laugh at other people when they have their pictures posted and thought this will not happen to you, but once it did, and people start to make sarcastic and untrue comments about it, you won't be laughing. I know this is a forum, we can do whatever we like, but sometimes it is better to be considerate? Because this is something that can happen to everyone and anyone, you might be the next victim. I am not trying to flame anyone here, don't get me wrong...just my opinion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I assumed that you don't post in forums much and hence do not know some things that will help make your stay more pleasant in here.<br><br>Here are the tips:<br><br>- In the "Profile" link on your left, you shall select "yes" for the following options:<br><br>i)Hide E-mail address<br>ii)Hide Personal Details<br>iii)Hide Online Status<br><br>- Never reveal too much details about yourself. Since this is a forum frequently supported by Singaporeans, you might be caught asking or saying something you don't want those you know to find out. This is not about being forefront with your identity and particulars, but to protect yourself. After all, whatever infomation you revealed will be pounced on naturally. That's just how the way goes in this forum.<br><br>Have fun posting. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Thank you CoolMyth.<br><br>I really learn a lot from your advice.
