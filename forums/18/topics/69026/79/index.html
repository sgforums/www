I will advice but prefer not to share my stories.<br><br>Always chase a girl with a "hack care mind". Always think, if she likes you, then its her good fortune, if not, then too bad for her! At all times, believe you yourself is the best, the one and only. You got better things to do than chase girls. Chasing girls is only a part-time hobby.<br><br>Since you are online often, why don't you IRC? It is a good way to practice chasing girls. Just go into #tp #sp #np #nus #ntu #smu and you will be able to chat up with lots of girls. *Pretty face and brains not guaranteed.</div>
