            <div class='col-md body'>The situation goes like this:<br><br>We went out together with a group of friends, at the eve of this new year to celebrate till dawn. It was the happiest day of the year.. of course.. haha.. First day of new year.. After for not seeing her for two days, I decided to let her know that I like her, although I know that at this moment I was not ready for any relationship..<br><br>She did ask me what to do.. so i suggest we see each other more often..<br><br>The second time I met her was that she told me she was sick that Monday Morning.. so I accompanied her to lunch and to Doc and send her home... Very nice job.<br><br>After that.. things were pretty smooth, we met each other more often and just plain sms/call every day if we didn't meet.<br><br>I did let her know that I like her in the form of letters and sms too.. Even told her i like her twice .. The first time.. was late 3am .. after telling her i ran off. Too shy. The other time was in the park. But she changed topic so i accommodate her.<br><br>However, after my overseas trip from the Chinese New Year, every thing was not that good..We contact less often.. Its only when I wanted to pass her gifts from overseas then I got another excuse to see her.<br><br>There 3 things I feel about her:<br>1) Everytime I met her, I will feel very happy the whole day.. Whatever thing is good on that day.<br>2) If she can't meet me due to her busy schedules then  I will be sad.<br>3) When she not around, I tend to think of her.<br><br>I had plans to confess this V day but came to know that last Sat night that she was attached as I was with her.<br><br>She squabbled with her BF over a small matter so i encouraged her to patch up.. I even encourage her... looking at the bright side of life. She said quite a lot of time the same thing happenned: squabbled and patched.. All her friends around her wants her to break off with this guy as they don't like the way he treat him or whatever stuffs..<br><br>During last sat night.. she did asked me what i want to tell her the last time.. i was like .. huh.. my god. How can i say again knowing that she was attached.. She did asked me whether I had any relationship before.. and I said no..haha<br>.<br>From the way she talked to me, I know that she like her BF very much although they just started two weeks ago.<br><br>Therefore.. whatever things i want to say to her are kept deeper and deeper in my heart.<br><br>Its like a mixture of happy and sad feeling. Happy for her as she found her Mr Right.. Sad because I haven't even start but lost the courtship. From whatver movie/drame.. the title BF or whatever doesn't means much to me as I feel that as long she's happy and its alright and I will be happy too.<br><br>Same like last time.. we just stayed out till day break and I send her home as usual.<br><br>This time round ... I wasn't getting that kind of happy feeling back home.. I tried to sleep but the tears just rolled. I don't even want to cry or is just came like the rain. I just felt terrible.<br><br>Right now, she said that I will be her good sister, good friend..haha<br><br>I think i was like suffering from a curse or some sort..<br>It always takes me a lot of time to like a gal,, then every time when I want to carry out my plans, she's somebody else.<br>Then I will continue to spend time holding back to any new chances of relationship for a long long time.. The previous one, I held back for two years before I can move on, although she's single now, we're still friends. Tha's all.<br><br>So gals out there, if you want to find your Mr Right, i can try to like you.. 2 years later.. and then .. tada... your Mr Right will come..haha.. jokes aside.<br><br>Haha... I want to laugh and cry ...smile and remember and forget<br><br>Any comments?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you should tell her your true feelings. yes she will be upset in the begining, but let her know as long as she is happy with the new guy you will honor that relationship.  if she happens to break it off with him you want a chance to see if it will work between the both of you.  at this momoent in time may not be ridht for the both of you, but that does not mean 6 months from now is wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm.... strange but true. i once was in somewhat similar situation like you. But are you really ready to give up her? Ask yourself that question. If you really are then make sure you do. Even though you might feel its very painful you must stick to it. And mind you its not easy. Believe me. If you still have some doubts, i suggest you stay clear before you might do any damages to her current relationship.<br><br>I believe in loving is not possession but to see her happy. i do not know about you.</div>

I am very impressed by your sincerity.. if i am that girl.. I would give you a chance..<br><br>Since you say this valentine is the 1st time the two of you are together, you must perform well..  come on.,, if the gal goes out with you on V day, then you're more than 50% successful.<br><br>I know I don't have the right to advise you on this because my situation isn't that good either.<br><br>The scenario you describe.. very much alike to me last sat<br><br>(i have encouraged her to patch up with her ex,helped her think of situations to get close to someone she likes...she achive her aim being with someone she love..she is overjoyed..she shared her joyful moments with me,and again... we share the same feeling being happy for her,and sad for ourself.. everytime listening to some songs really make me tear like what u experinced.)<br><br>haha<br><br>Now I asked myself.. is it really that good to keep her as my GF.. what's the difference? So what if we are BF and GF and not seeing each other. I really don't know what gals think sometimes..<br>She can tell me how bad this guy is but she says when she comes to him, she wouldn't mention it to him as she has just accepted him as he is. She said perhaps that true love.. forgiving his bad points and make his weak points as plus points.. Perhaps love is all blinded. Now I am becoming to understand this statement. She said he touch her heart by saying things(I won't disclose) to her.<br><br>From what I read, woman like man with confident..<br>Perhaps we lack of that.. so I never say want I want to say to hear and make any promises to her.. Maybe Haha.<br><br>I think ..... this Vday, you should be confident since that she is the only one you like and love.. anyway it is since the two of you are being together for so long. it cant be wrong.. Touch her heart. Really. She must be moved by what you say.. but don't over exaggerate saying is you are the stars , I am the moon that kind..   or she think this man is flower-hearted.. can say such things.. haha<br><br>Since you and her are together this Vday.. get her to smile alot and happy. at the end of the day.. tell her that you want to be with her every Vday.. you love her... and your feelings.. go on.. don't retreat back to the good friend status. Don't say something like.. its ok we are good friends and if you don't agree we still can be good friends..-&gt; No confident statement..<br><br>Best of luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So.. my situation... haha.... I will need your advise since you are more senior than me.. know the gal for so many years.. haha<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
