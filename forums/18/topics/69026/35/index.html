Frustrated? Angry? or... jealous??? Will this cause a relationship problem??? Think abt it...<br><br>Thus, u hv to walk away unless u got something very important to notify her... or unless she called u... got it??? As for leaving her.. luv means letting someone go in search of her own happiness instead of clinching onto her... got it?</div>
