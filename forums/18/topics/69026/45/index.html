            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by sleepycat:<br><strong>Though I'm a gal, I still want to say that nightyoung's love interest is responsible for causing him such confusion too. If she has discovered that he's the first one to deliver 2 chicken wings to her doorstep, she'd have no problem feeling flattered how overpowering she is to him and how amazingly interesting that he's still at her beck and call though she's committed to another guy now.<br><br>I had a long disussion with our pal here and he knows what and why I say the above and more. Those who're sharp and weathered would agree with me that it's hard to tango alone.<br><br>The biggest problem is nightyoung can't think clearly or sensibly and he always fail to see beyond his feelings for her. Perhaps, he has even failed to see the 'real' person in her. Yet, she's certainly &amp; doubtlessly happy to have nightyoung making her happy &amp; satisfying her demands while she makes yet another guy (her bf) happy.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I'd love to read that one day, her conscience &amp; <span style="font-style: italic;">[b]real</span></span></strong> feelings get the better of her and she takes a 2nd look at our pal here.<br><br>anyway hi again, everyone and thanks wes brown for attempting to show nightyoung that there're other (perhaps, better) gals alive.<br><br>However, blinded eyes can't see. [/b]</blockquote>Dun tell me you going to do something to us that night.. pls don't i beg..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi young man,<br><br>This is my first posting although I have been following you diary for a few months already.<br><br>I somehow feel that you have missed out (subconciously I hope) talking about her the-other-half ----- boyfriend.<br><br>Pardon me for asking some direct questions, which I believe will help you have a better grasp of the situation.<br><br>-Who is he<br>-What does he do<br>-What is his nationality<br><br>-What is his attraction<br>-Why is he more attractive than you are to her<br>-Does she love him<br>-If not, why is she still with him<br>-If yes, why is she hanging out with you<br><br>-What is his hold over her<br>-Does she owe him something<br><br>I suspect that she is beholden to him. He must have something over her that makes / force her to stay in the current situation / arrangement. Perhaps you can come into the picture and play a role. Can you help her? (I am not taliking about fixing some lousy player here...) But what is it? Go find out!<br><br>At the same time, I am sure you should be aware of the fact that they are farking each other a few night a week. Can you accept it? Can you take it? Is it an issue? Imagine you are drowning your sorrows at home one night, while she is being sent to seventh heaven by her boyfriend in her room, on her bed. Painful? Cruel? But you have to face it. Ask yourself again, can you take it?<br><br>Dont be angry with me for asking such questions. I think if you can at least think about the above questions, you may be able to come to some decision whether if you should stay or go.<br><br>I know how you feel, friend. Good luck. It is going to be very painful.<br><br></div>
