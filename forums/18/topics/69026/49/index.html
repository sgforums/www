            <div class='col-md body'>Hey bro .. i am caught in the same situation as you lately ... not say i am promoting such activities but i have drawn an invisible line between me and her because she have a boyfriend already ...<br><br>All i asked was .. are you happy with your boyfriend and she said 'Yes' .<br><br>Imagine you have that crush on her like 5 years ago and that feeling surfaces again somethime ago? esp when my buddy was a friend of hers(unknowingly) ....<br><br>we contacted thru MSN and then eventually went out together ... watch movie and chat over the phone .. sometimes when she is out with her friends i offered to send her back ... when i am bored at home in the nite we will go for a spin aimlessly around singapore ... i admit i am quite young to splurge on petrol on the car (please dun flame me for this) i know is kinda stupid ... we spent time together at the beach and such ...when her boyfriend calls and she deny that she was with any boy everytime i was with her.<br><br>I was so engrossed with her, everything about her ... she chatted with me about almost everything under the sun and said that she feels more comfortable with me then her boyfriend ... think if it in my shoes, you will be more then over the moon if you hear that from a gal that you have a crush with for 5 years!<br><br>After that, i did a reality check ... i have nothing that i could offer her, i have no looks , i have no money , i have not much education like her boyfriend does , i have no stable job as a freelancer , i have no assets (not body assets) and her current boyfriend has almost all of those things i mention above. I just feel inferior when she mention about her boyfriend ...<br><br>sometimes is what i want to do is just to place a smile on her face thats all ...<br><br>I just dun know what to add. All i wanted to is just post this to share my thoughts and my personal experience that i am having now with Bro Nightyoung ... whom i think is in the similiar situation as me ...<br><br>I am trying hard now to get over her ... My head is telling me to but my heart is weak ... so i am trying to indulge myself to other things ... like sailing or hanging out with good friends ... is a temporary remedy to the pain, but i believe time will heal ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

Love is strange, ain't it? my heart was broken and i have broken others' hearts.. in the end, i still come back to square one in the game called reality that nothing in the world is perfectly ideal or ideally perfect.<br><br>i can't have my strawberry cake and eat it.<br><br>at times, i imagine the scenario that if i did eat my cake, what'd happen next? will i really be happier and happily so ever after?<br><br>will the cake  be such a miraculous elixir that'll rocket me into the eternal realm of bliss forever? <strong>haven't those who've weathered the storm said that love only begins when feelings fade away?</strong> if this be true, then it doesn't really matter who we love as the person who ignites the flame in our hearts will still pale in time to come in the vicious game called reality.<br><br>hmm.. heavy thoughts for a thursday, and i wish myself &amp; all here a good day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dearest NightYoung, i just spent hours reading through all the posts! incredible feat to do seeing how a simple thing become so complicated. i won't be sharing my experience but it threads along with yours. but i think i have the best solution for you. oh btw, you know yourself that the 31Dec deadline won't even work...<br><br>ok, how do we start? let me get the facts straight first. you admire/like/love this good good girl for very long time (years). been rejected once or twice, but with some soft confession from your part not helping matters. can't forget her and like to be with her. finally, wishes that she be your gf and in future, your wife. the only problem, she has a bf and you respect that! good enough so far?<br><br>let me tell you first the problem with 3rd party view. WE don't really know the gal that well to give your suggestions or solutions. i'm sure plenty will agree with me here... hence, what my suggestions/solutions for you is more of what you can do and really need to do!<br><br>here is what you need to do...<br>1. tell her your feelings, yup, everything! from day 1 til now.<br>2. tell her your sufferings, yup, all the pain and tears.<br>3. tell her what you hope/wish for... yup, the gf and wife thing.<br>4. give her time to decide...<br>5. wait for answer. your misery starts here, the waiting and all....<br><br>ok, it doesn't end there...<br>IF she decided to leave the current bf for the better YOU. bless you my friend!<br>IF she said that she loves the current bf and wishes you to be by her side as friend, pls read on...<br><br>now, i would like to say that gals are easy man! if you think easy, they are really easy. i understand the sh!ts and stuff that you wanted to leave but this and but that and miss her and think of her and worry of her, etc. love requires 2 side. apparently, she loves her bf AND loves your friendship. the question we ask ourselves is 'friendship cannot be lovers?' the hard truth is, most girls (80%) would say CANNOT. why? because girls afraid when break up, cannot be friend liau! for guys, that is BS. for us, the more we complement each other, it's better. why? it's male instinct that we don't like to make adjustments in our life. while female instinct is always to be safe than sorry.<br><br>ok friend... remember my words and master them. it will teaches you that gals are indeed easy. enough of theory and back to solutions...<br><br>6. now you're in miserable state, zombified, etc.<br>7. get yourself a GF!!! pretend if you have to... be warned that this is the ultimate test. the best step would be ask this 'good good girl' the recommend. this is the killer move.<br><br>back to my theory just now. i hope you're smart enough to know what i'm trying to do. that's right, MAKE her do the adjustments! why must the male be the one doing it in a relationship. it's TIME to take charge my friend. step 7 might take a while and next step is very much depended on your progress and what's her reaction. pls use your BRAIN to win the battle of will, not just for feeling sorry for yourself. stand up and be THE man!<br><br>8. wait and analyse her reaction. pls make it clear to her that you're hunting for love partner! not just friendster....<br><br>btw, there's a good reason doing this. she won't get hurt in anyway. if she jealous enough, she will make adjustment. she will not feel safe anymore. she will consider YOU! you might get lucky and forget about her. can even double date if gf is intro by her. it's good in short term and better in long term... everyone wins!<br><br>please feedback with comment if any.<br>thanks!</div>
