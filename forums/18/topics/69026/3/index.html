            <div class='col-md body'>Love, cannot be defined i guess, cos everyone seems to have different views to it. I feel that love is, even when you've gone through your life with many other people and different relationships.. yet at the end of your journey, the person you'll be thinking of is him/her. That's love i guess, cos no matter what you do, the person somehow still finds a place in your heart  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>and of cos, love is being self-sacrificing, you maybe in pain all the time, but you are just happy when he/she is happy, so your whole life devotes to making him/ her happy i guess. but plainly feeling sad when she's not around and happy when she's around doesn define love, becos this can be so in cases of like, crushes, admiration, infatuation.<br><br>love is true to, means that in front of the person you love, yu show ur true colours, and not appear to be someone else. you are to be true to the person too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
