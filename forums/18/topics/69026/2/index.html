Yeah.. for my case, I know that her BF is very possessive of her.. whenever someone calls her.. he will get very worried about who's calling.. I think whenever I send her a SMS and if I don't reply..

            <div class='col-md body'>Ditto here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Girl liked me 1 and a half years ago. I was stupid and i did all the wrong things. She eventually lost interest.<br><br>Don't know why, i seem to feel something special when with her. So i decided to try again after 1 and a half years and see if the feeling can rekindle. Gave a few gifts to start off. Tried smsing and calling, gotten a bit of response. One fine day, she started telling me about how much this other guy also like her and was feeling confuse about who to choose. Seeing her in that dilemma, i decided to give up for the sake of her, cause she dropped some subtle hints that preferred me to back off a little. I won't confirm the hints but according to her friend, she did say that she have true feelings for the other guy. Naturally i feel hurt, but at least now that she's attached, and me gave up on own accord, she is happy with that guy.<br><br>Was feeling real down for the next few days but i eventually picked myself up and now, i'm alright. Continued to maintain friendship with her. Chats on MSN. But deep down inside, i know i still have that special feeling. Did something for her this V day. Don't know how she will respond.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Anyway, i'm no love guru and i don't have much experiences to share. But would like to say that all is fair in love and war. So long as she haven't really decided on a life partner, you still stand a chance. Try to inch forward slowly from the friendship that you had already established after all, its easier to go from there. Hopefully, she realises that you're the one that stood by her all the time and you're the one for her. Good luck to you.<br><br>Best wishes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Nightyoung,<br><br>I can't really picture a timeline, cosh from wat u'd written here, she went out wif u on New Yr's Eve, then after u went overseas, she got herself attached &amp; has been quarrelling wif her bf eversince.  Perhaps u cld elaborate a little more on tt?<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nightyoung:</div><div class="quote_body">The situation goes like this:<br><br>We went out together with a group of friends, at the eve of this new year to celebrate till dawn. It was the happiest day of the year.. of course.. haha.. First day of new year.. After for not seeing her for two days, I decided to let her know that I like her, although I know that at this moment I was not ready for any relationship..<br><br>She did ask me what to do.. so i suggest we see each other more often..<br><br>The second time I met her was that she told me she was sick that Monday Morning.. so I accompanied her to lunch and to Doc and send her home... Very nice job.<br><br>After that.. things were pretty smooth, we met each other more often and just plain sms/call every day if we didn't meet.<br><br>I did let her know that I like her in the form of letters and sms too.. Even told her i like her twice .. The first time.. was late 3am .. after telling her i ran off. Too shy. The other time was in the park. But she changed topic so i accommodate her.<br><br>However, after my overseas trip from the Chinese New Year, every thing was not that good..We contact less often.. Its only when I wanted to pass her gifts from overseas then I got another excuse to see her.<br><br>There 3 things I feel about her:<br>1) Everytime I met her, I will feel very happy the whole day.. Whatever thing is good on that day.<br>2) If she can't meet me due to her busy schedules then  I will be sad.<br>3) When she not around, I tend to think of her.<br><br>I had plans to confess this V day but came to know that last Sat night that she was attached as I was with her.<br><br>She squabbled with her BF over a small matter so i encouraged her to patch up.. I even encourage her... looking at the bright side of life. She said quite a lot of time the same thing happenned: squabbled and patched.. All her friends around her wants her to break off with this guy as they don't like the way he treat him or whatever stuffs..<br><br>During last sat night.. she did asked me what i want to tell her the last time.. i was like .. huh.. my god. How can i say again knowing that she was attached.. She did asked me whether I had any relationship before.. and I said no..haha<br>.<br>From the way she talked to me, I know that she like her BF very much although they just started two weeks ago.<br><br>Therefore.. whatever things i want to say to her are kept deeper and deeper in my heart.<br><br>Its like a mixture of happy and sad feeling. Happy for her as she found her Mr Right.. Sad because I haven't even start but lost the courtship. From whatver movie/drame.. the title BF or whatever doesn't means much to me as I feel that as long she's happy and its alright and I will be happy too.<br><br>Same like last time.. we just stayed out till day break and I send her home as usual.<br><br>This time round ... I wasn't getting that kind of happy feeling back home.. I tried to sleep but the tears just rolled. I don't even want to cry or is just came like the rain. I just felt terrible.<br><br>Right now, she said that I will be her good sister, good friend..haha<br><br>I think i was like suffering from a curse or some sort..<br>It always takes me a lot of time to like a gal,, then every time when I want to carry out my plans, she's somebody else.<br>Then I will continue to spend time holding back to any new chances of relationship for a long long time.. The previous one, I held back for two years before I can move on, although she's single now, we're still friends. Tha's all.<br><br>So gals out there, if you want to find your Mr Right, i can try to like you.. 2 years later.. and then .. tada... your Mr Right will come..haha.. jokes aside.<br><br>Haha... I want to laugh and cry ...smile and remember and forget<br><br>Any comments?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nightyoung,<br><br>RP seldom advises others to hold back or to give up.  But in this instance, I'm sorree, I'm gonna tell u to stop, for ur sake.<br><br>Thgs were starting to dev. before u went overseas, yet, she was attached by the time u returned to SG.  Obviously, she wasn't into waiting for u <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Going out wif her &amp; seeing her will only make it more painful for u, &amp; u risk ur feelings running even deeper...  Listening to her bf woes may oso give u false hope, &amp; it doesn't look like she's gonna give him up any time soon...<br><br>Pls take a step back, enjoy ur life, &amp; think abt thgs...  When u've sorta gotten over it, then u can be frens wif her again.<br><br>Gd luck, Nightyoung.<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nightyoung:</div><div class="quote_body">The situation goes like this:<br><br>We went out together with a group of friends, at the eve of this new year to celebrate till dawn. It was the happiest day of the year.. of course.. haha.. First day of new year.. After for not seeing her for two days, I decided to let her know that I like her, although I know that at this moment I was not ready for any relationship..<br><br>She did ask me what to do.. so i suggest we see each other more often..<br><br>The second time I met her was that she told me she was sick that Monday Morning.. so I accompanied her to lunch and to Doc and send her home... Very nice job.<br><br>After that.. things were pretty smooth, we met each other more often and just plain sms/call every day if we didn't meet.<br><br>I did let her know that I like her in the form of letters and sms too.. Even told her i like her twice .. The first time.. was late 3am .. after telling her i ran off. Too shy. The other time was in the park. But she changed topic so i accommodate her.<br><br>However, after my overseas trip from the Chinese New Year, every thing was not that good..We contact less often.. Its only when I wanted to pass her gifts from overseas then I got another excuse to see her.<br><br>There 3 things I feel about her:<br>1) Everytime I met her, I will feel very happy the whole day.. Whatever thing is good on that day.<br>2) If she can't meet me due to her busy schedules then  I will be sad.<br>3) When she not around, I tend to think of her.<br><br>I had plans to confess this V day but came to know that last Sat night that she was attached as I was with her.<br><br>She squabbled with her BF over a small matter so i encouraged her to patch up.. I even encourage her... looking at the bright side of life. She said quite a lot of time the same thing happenned: squabbled and patched.. All her friends around her wants her to break off with this guy as they don't like the way he treat him or whatever stuffs..<br><br>During last sat night.. she did asked me what i want to tell her the last time.. i was like .. huh.. my god. How can i say again knowing that she was attached.. She did asked me whether I had any relationship before.. and I said no..haha<br>.<br>From the way she talked to me, I know that she like her BF very much although they just started two weeks ago.<br><br>Therefore.. whatever things i want to say to her are kept deeper and deeper in my heart.<br><br>Its like a mixture of happy and sad feeling. Happy for her as she found her Mr Right.. Sad because I haven't even start but lost the courtship. From whatver movie/drame.. the title BF or whatever doesn't means much to me as I feel that as long she's happy and its alright and I will be happy too.<br><br>Same like last time.. we just stayed out till day break and I send her home as usual.<br><br>This time round ... I wasn't getting that kind of happy feeling back home.. I tried to sleep but the tears just rolled. I don't even want to cry or is just came like the rain. I just felt terrible.<br><br>Right now, she said that I will be her good sister, good friend..haha<br><br>I think i was like suffering from a curse or some sort..<br>It always takes me a lot of time to like a gal,, then every time when I want to carry out my plans, she's somebody else.<br>Then I will continue to spend time holding back to any new chances of relationship for a long long time.. The previous one, I held back for two years before I can move on, although she's single now, we're still friends. Tha's all.<br><br>So gals out there, if you want to find your Mr Right, i can try to like you.. 2 years later.. and then .. tada... your Mr Right will come..haha.. jokes aside.<br><br>Haha... I want to laugh and cry ...smile and remember and forget<br><br>Any comments?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
