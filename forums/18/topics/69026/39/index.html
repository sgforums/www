            <div class='col-md body'>Today we met again.<br><br>it was in the afternoon.. and we went to woodlands .. we wanted to go for movie and libary as planned yesterday.. and i was right everytime.. this week she so free because her bf is not in Singapore.. that's why i get to see her 4 consecutive days..<br><br>i went to woodlands first after she said that she needs to do some housework.. so i said i will wait for her at Woodlands. I was trying to get my sis-in-law bday present.. and i went ahead.. after i bought it.. i met my sis-in-la coincidentally and passed the present to him.<br><br>It was raining heavily, and i went back to the mrt near our house and waited for her.. so that we can go together.<br><br>we went shopping as usual but this time she persuaded me to get some clothes for myself as she knows that i dont have much casual clothes in my wardrobe.. and yes we always look like couple and always being mistaken as one.. but its ok..we both knew that its not.<br>We went to shop to shops and finally we settled down in a restaurant and had our early dinner.. she always eat a bit more than me and i always like to dine with her.. over these four days.. i realized that i like her even more and more .. like to being with her more and more.. to a stage where i really dun care whether she got bf or not.. i just want to be with her and spent our time together.  i felt sad everytime coz i knew i will leave her after the 5 things are completed and i cant help it.. my heart hurts and i keep telling myself.. just be happy now with her.. so i cheered up.<br><br>After that she said that she didn't had a chance to catch a movie in Woodlands so we went up to see the traliers. She knew that i can't watch movie with her coz i had to go back early for bday dinner.. then while we were watching the tralier, my phone rang and the dinner was called off.. they already dined and told me to go ahead with the dinner. A bit sad and happy.. after that we bought the tickets for a movie and went shopping again.<br><br>After a few shops we decided to head to the library to relax and wait for the show to start.<br>We read some magazines and i turned my watch a bit faster than the usual time.. when she asked me what time is it, i told her the time and she's very excited and we dashed out of the library.. halfway there.. i told her to look at the time on her phone and we laughed..<br><br>we sneaked some food stuffs in and we eat and enjoyed the movie.. [Celluar] nice one.. catch it!! we enjoyed the movie and after that we left to the night market and bought some stuffs back.. and yes.. she was making a phone call to her bf.. i knew his number as well.. that moment... my heart really sank.. i cant help it.. at that every moment.. when she called her bf or when they sms.. my heart just sank.. i got no total control over it.. just stare in daze for a while .. and after that told myself i just want to be with her.. that's all.. maybe to a stage she got a bf now.. maybe husband, maybe she got children that time... but i know .. after i completed the 5 things, i will go. i cant help but feel sad about leaving.. but i just cherish the time with her everytime...<br><br>while going back, we chat and recap about what we did on 31st Dec to dawn and yes she asked what the first movie we saw and i replied correctly.. i fished out the 2 tickets I bought the last time and gave the other half to her (Signfies ending soon).. i told her to keep well.. coz that one couldn't be brought with money.. the ticket title "Paycheck" dated jan 10... wow time files and i am still crazy over her.... cant help..<br><br>The last message in this thread will be the time i completed the 5 things and i will add<br>[her name], I love you.<br><br>Like what snowbear said.. i love her too much that i had to walk away<br><br>then i will not touch this thread anymore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
