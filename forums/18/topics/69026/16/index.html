This is not love, this is not even a one-sided love story if you think this is what it is. This is the story of a sorry man who thinks he sees an angel in a materialistic, manipulative woman who has no qualms whatsoever just playing you around. This is the story of a man who is too stupid to see for himself what is going on. All the times that you are thinking of her and missing her, she is probably with her bf, doing what is only limited by your imagination, but here's a hint, they are not just holding hands. Everytime you wonder what she is doing she is probably holding her bf in her arms, or her mouth, or where else again up to your imagination. You are nothing to her. She dun give a damn about you. She dun miss you. She dun care about you. You are just a stupid idiot she can use on the days when she is really really bored. I dunno her and i dunno you. But i am so sure i am dead on right.<br>Please man,  this has nothing to do with me. But to see another man be so gone case i just have to kapo a bit.<br><br>Please. Wake up.<br><br></div>

But know that i am saying this out of love......<br><br>You Are Blardy Pathetic.<br><br>Please go to a church and tell the pastor to lift the spell casted on you. This is not love, this is not even a one-sided love story if you think this is what it is. This is the story of a sorry man who thinks he sees an angel in a materialistic, manipulative woman who has no qualms whatsoever just playing you around. This is the story of a man who is too stupid to see for himself what is going on. All the times that you are thinking of her and missing her, she is probably with her bf, doing what is only limited by your imagination, but here's a hint, they are not just holding hands. Everytime you wonder what she is doing she is probably holding her bf in her arms, or her mouth, or where else again up to your imagination. You are nothing to her. She dun give a damn about you. She dun miss you. She dun care about you. You are just a stupid idiot she can use on the days when she is really really bored. I dunno her and i dunno you. But i am so sure i am dead on right.<br>Please man,  this has nothing to do with me. But to see another man be so gone case i just have to kapo a bit.<br><br>Please. Wake up.<br><br></div></blockquote>everyone is untitled to their own opinion. if he is the kinda guy who has to talk abt stuff and let it out then let him lah. respect that of him. and advise him has he walks his path. everyone has to learn on their own how to handle and manage their own feelings and wat to do with them. we are all not saints.</div>
