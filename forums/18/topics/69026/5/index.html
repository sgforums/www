            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Bro Night Young,<br><br>I`ve been in sgforums reading their articles for a very lon time already. But i`ve yet to reply to any posts. I`ve seen ur article qute a few mths back. But after seein the 1st post i`ve decided not to carry on reading, cuz ur story shares so much similarities as mine.<br>And I did not want those memories to come back.. but today i`ve seen til this last post of ur I really felt that I need to help u from this terrible torture.. allow me to give u a v simplified version of my story 1st.<br><br>As it begins,<br><br>The whole incident happened abt 6-7 yrs ago when I was still in my sec sch days.. I saw this wonderful lookin junior of mine.. I could haf called it love at 1st sight or wat..<br>I was immediately attracted to her.. i`ve lived as an observer for a very long time until my frens helped me make up a lame excuse to borrow notes from her. Thus a chance to make frens w her..<br><br>After knowin her officially, I begin to find out all the other gd aspects of her. Then this feelin of like became love.. the feelin grew stronger, and soon we became the bestest of frens.. we talked abt anything and could be on the fone for hours yet we still haf so much to talk abt..<br><br>The times spent w her were really fast.. soon i`ve take my o lvls and haf to leave the sch..<br>Afraid of losin her to other ppl I popped her the golden qn. Yes I was rejected, the reason she gave me was tt she was not really prepared for any relationship rite now.. so I wait for her to fin her o lvls the nxt yr. then I poped  the same qn to her again.. again she said she`s still not ready.. okok.. I tink I shouldnÂ’t force her if she`s not ready..<br><br>The real prob came when she entered JC.. I was in J2 and she was in J1.. dunno why but juz the same sch.. ok there was this guy in her class tt I know of.. I felt that healso haf some feelins ofr her.. that guy really knows how to make her laugh and I felt that she`ll be happy with that guy.. so i`ve decided to back out in her life.. I no longer call her and ask her to go out again.. u can say I `m actually avoidin her.. but do u know that i`m realy feelin damn low at that time.. i`m suffering form the same day ?nite syndrome.. any sad song from the radio would bring tears into my eyes.. i`ve no appitite for any food.. As time passed I tot i`ll forget her gradually<br><br>6 months passed, when one day her mama called me.. She asked me where was I for the passed few mths.. later she broke out a news that had made me regret leavin her..<br>the so called NICE guy tt I had perceived was actually ill treatin her and bullying her.. askin her to cary this and doin tt.. then she was very sad, and so was I.. how could I haf left her alone when she needed me most.. so I called her out again.. we talked abt the whole incident in a very mature way. Soon I found out that they were only normal frens, but the guy did in fact express his love to her. But her rejections had made him very angry. Her life was very miserable as the guy makes things diff for her.. since then we called each other more often and in no time, our relationship became wat it was a few mths ago.. theing were plain sailing til the time I had to go to the army?<br><br>As enlistment date draws near, I was getting more nervous. I was afraid that the history will repeat itself. So I ask her the same old qn again.. this time she still give the same old reason.. she wanted to conc on the studies 1st.. and so it goes?i`ve failed again..<br>With a very broken heart I went to tekong for my BMT..<br><br>Time in the army was very busy.. I had very little time to talk to her.. and much less to go out shoppin together..<br><br>And so it ends?<br><br>Dear Night Young, I do not wish ur case to be like mine.. as u see.. my story is a very brief acc of my love life..<br><br>If u observe carefully, our love come in a full circle of diff stages<br><br>Stage 1?<br>You make frens w her..<br><br>Stage 2?<br>You becomes good frens.. then the so called likin becomes love<br><br>Stage 3?<br>She leaves you for some reason.. tt`s when our hearts breaks the most.<br><br>Stage 4?<br>U missed her so much.. u decided to call her back and u go back to stage one<br><br>I`ve experienced this cycle for countless times w her.. then i`ve decided tt I need to break free of this torture.. I choose exile.. so far i`ve not seen her for abt a yr.. but tionks tt she`s still single..<br><br>Pls  take a day and sit down to tink clearly abt wat u really wanted out of ur relationship..<br><br>Ps i`ve some Quotes for u..<br><br>``to love is not to own``<br>``if u love someone, set her free, if she comes back, she`s urs``<br><br>and also.. i`ll like to introduce this very nice song by westlife..<br><br>If  I Let You Go<br><br>Day after day<br>Time pass away<br>And I just can't get you off my mind<br>Nobody knows<br>I hide it inside<br>I keep on searching but I can't find<br><br>The dare is to show<br>To letting you know<br>I've never felt so much love before<br>And once again I'm thinkin' about<br>Takin' the easy way out<br><br>But if I let you go<br>I will never know<br>what my life would be<br>holding you close to me<br>Will I ever see<br>you smiling back at me<br>oh yeah<br>How will I know<br>if I let you go<br><br>Night after night<br>I hear myself say<br>Why can't this feeling just fade away<br>There's no one like you<br>To speak to my heart<br>It's such a shame<br>We're worlds apart<br><br>I'm to shy to ask<br>I'm to proud to lose<br>But sooner or later I've gotta choose<br>And once again<br>I'm thinkin' about<br>Taking the easy way out<br><br>But if I let you go<br>I will never know<br>what my life would be<br>holding you close to me<br>Will I ever see<br>you smiling back at me<br>oh yeah<br>How will I know<br>if I let you go<br><br>If I let you go, oh baby...<br><br>Ooooh<br><br>And once again I'm thinkin' about<br>Takin' the easy way out<br><br>But if I let you go<br>I will never know<br>what my life would be<br>holding you close to me (close to me)<br>Will I ever see<br>you smiling back at me<br>oh yeah<br>How will I know<br>if I let you go<br><br>But if I let you go<br>I will never know<br>(oh baby)<br>Will I ever see<br>you smiling back at me<br>oh yeah<br>How will I know<br>If I let you go<br><br>Pls take care of urself and not to be like me.. i`ll be lying if I say I don miss her..<br>BaByBoY<br></div>

Whenever I go her with her.. i treat her like a close friend of mine... or maybe sister,,, she too... as long we are happy .. that's it... no pt into a relationship and have so many problems to settle..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nightyoung- I think the girl is 2-timing, u should forget her. If she is serious abt her bf, she shouldn't be seeing u &amp; messaging u knowing how u feel abt. her. It looks like she is holding on to both guys &amp; not fair to u. Stay away from her, don't let her use u as a substitute. My advice to all u guys going into army, don't go into a relationship right now. Do it after u finish your NS. Very few relationships started  in sec. sch/JC can last. At this young age, the girls will not want to commit. Once in U, they will meet the older guys so u end up heartbroken. Don't waste time pining over her, there are many better ones out there</div>
