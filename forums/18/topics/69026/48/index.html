            <div class='col-md body'>someone out there will surely say why can't a boy and a girl be just purely friends?<br><br>I shall not comment from a guy's point of view....<br><br>As a girl, i think i really had to agree that when we meant friends, we mean it!!! sometimes, no matter how hard we tried, there is just no chemistry... not the kind that we wanted to hug with, to kiss with, to bed with... BUT just the kind that we talk with, laugh with, hang out with........FRIENDS!<br><br>a good good girl should not be take advantage of others... if i knows that someone is so deeply in love with me but i can only treat him as friend, i will be very honest and let him know how i feel (that i dun love him) and it's entirely up to that guy if he wishes to contiune such a friendship with me....and one simply thumb rule... we are just friends, no more than friends... and he should not be expecting anything things from me like i will love him after 10, 20, 30 years..... if that's the case, it's a torture to be his "friend"!!!<br><br>Your this so-called "good good girl" is not treating you as friend at all... she is just taking advantage of you, of your love to her... if you think that i'm pointing the fingers at her, then let's point it at you! She had made it clear that she had chosen her bf... she just treating you as her friend! Stop doing stuff for her and expecting her to be touched and love you in return! She does not need it! No body will be touched just becos of an sms saying how much you missed her! she have a bf to help her to repair the vcd! she wanted her bf to tattoo her name more than you! just a simply line: SHE DON"T NEED YOU!<br><br></div>

She might not be as innocent as you think she is...in fact it is totally wrong to continue to do this to you when she already has a bf, it is unfair to both her bf as well as you...<br><br>leave her. dun wait until 31st dec. i know what will happen on that day cos i have been thru this before...i promised myself i wud leave my ex crush after my florida trip but instead it dragged on for a few more months before I finally had the courage to let him know how I felt and finally let go after he rejected me. so tell her how you feel if it will make you feel better but accept the fact if she rejects you.<br><br>Time to move on le. There are better girls out there who deserve your devotion. You can't see them because you can only see her.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
