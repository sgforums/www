            <div class='col-md body'>666 = Haha! I broke it!!<br><br>This one is nice.. I like this story very motivating...<br><br>Let this story remind you that you can do it!!<br>Anything!!<br><br>THE PEBBLE STORY<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;Many years ago in a small Indian village, a farmer had<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;the misfortune of owing a large sum of money to a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;village moneylender. The moneylender, who<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;was old and ugly, fancied the farmer's beautiful<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;daughter. So he proposed a  bargain. He said he would<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;forgo the farmer's debt if he could marry his<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;daughter.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;Both the farmer and his daughter were horrified by the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;proposal. So the cunning money-lender suggested that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;they let providence decide the matter.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;He told them that he would put a black pebble and a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;white pebble into an empty money bag. Then the girl<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;would have to pick one pebble from the bag.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;If she picked the black pebble, she would become his<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;wife and her father's  debt would be forgiven. If she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;picked the white pebble she need not marry<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;thrown into jail.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;All the villagers were standing on a pebble strewn<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;path in the farmer's field. As they talked, the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;As he picked them up, the sharp-eyed girl noticed that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;pebble from the bag. Now, imagine you were standing in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;the field.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;What would you have done if you were the girl? If you<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;had to advise her, what would you have told her?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;Careful analysis would produce three possibilities:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;1. The girl should refuse to take a pebble.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;2. The girl should show that there were two black<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;cheat.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;3. The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;herself in order to save her father from his debt and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;imprisonment.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;Take a moment to ponder over the story.  The above<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;story is used with the hope that it will make us<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;appreciate the difference between lateral and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;logical thinking.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;The girl's dilemma can not be solved with traditional<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;logical thinking.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;Think of the consequences if she chooses the above<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;logical answers.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;What would you recommend to the Girl to do?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt; Well, what she did was :<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;became lost among all the other pebbles.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;"Oh, how clumsy of me," she said. "But never mind, if<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;you look into the bag for the one that is left, you<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;will be able to tell which pebble I picked."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;assumed that she had picked the white one. And since<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;the money-lender dared not admit his dishonesty,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;the girl changed what seemed an impossible situation<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;into an extremely advantageous one.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;MORAL OF THE STORY: Most complex problems do have a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;solution.  It is only that we don't attempt to think<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Impossible is a word only to be found in the dictionary of  fools.<br><br>Thanks everyone in this thread!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got a great touching but sad story to share too... maybe u guys hv read it b4 somewhere...<br><br>&gt;&gt;Peter and Tina are sitting in the park doing<br>&gt;&gt;nothing, but just gazing into the sky, while all<br>&gt;&gt;their friends are having fun with their beloved<br>&gt;&gt;half.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tina: I'm so bored. Just wish I have a boyfriend<br>&gt;&gt;now to spend time with.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Peter: I guess we're the only leftovers. We're<br>&gt;&gt;the only person who isn't with a date now. (both<br>&gt;&gt;sigh n silence for a while)<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tina: I think I have a good idea. Lets play a<br>&gt;&gt;game<br>&gt;&gt;Peter: Eh? What game?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tina: Eem..It's quite simple. You be my<br>&gt;&gt;boyfriend for 100 days and I'll be your<br>&gt;&gt;girlfriend for 100 days. what do you think?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Peter: Oookay..Anyway I don't have any plan for<br>&gt;&gt;the next few months.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tina: You sound like you aren't looking forward<br>&gt;&gt;to it at all. Cheer up. Today will be our first<br>&gt;&gt;day and our first date. Where should we go?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Peter: What about a movie? I heard that there is<br>&gt;&gt;a really great movie in theater now.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tina: Seems like I don't have any better idea<br>&gt;&gt;than this. Lets move. (went to watch their<br>&gt;&gt;movies and sent each other home)<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Day 2:<br>&gt;&gt;Peter and Tina went to a concert together, and<br>&gt;&gt;Peter bought Tina a keychain with a star.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Day 3:<br>&gt;&gt;They went shopping together for a friend's<br>&gt;&gt;birthday present. Share an ice-cream together<br>&gt;&gt;and hugged each other for the first time.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Day 7:<br>&gt;&gt;Peter drove Tina up onto a mountain and they<br>&gt;&gt;watch the sunset together. When the night came<br>&gt;&gt;and the moon glowed, they said sat on the grass<br>&gt;&gt;gazing at the stars together. A meteor passed<br>&gt;&gt;by. Tina mumbled something.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Day 25:<br>&gt;&gt;Spend time at a themepark and got onto<br>&gt;&gt;rollercoasters, and ate hotdogs and cotton<br>&gt;&gt;candy. Peter and Tina got in the haunted house<br>&gt;&gt;and Tina grabbed someone's hand instead of<br>&gt;&gt;Peter's hand by accident. They laughed together<br>&gt;&gt;for a while.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Day 67:<br>&gt;&gt;They drove pass a circus and decided to get in<br>&gt;&gt;to watch the show. The midget asked Tina to play<br>&gt;&gt;a part as his assistant in the magic show. Went<br>&gt;&gt;around to see other entertainments around after<br>&gt;&gt;the show. Came to a fortune teller and she just<br>&gt;&gt;said "Treasure every moment from now on" and a<br>&gt;&gt;tear rolled down the fortune teller's cheek.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Day 84:<br>&gt;&gt;Tina suggested that they go to the beach. The<br>&gt;&gt;beach wasn't so crowded that day. They have<br>&gt;&gt;their first kiss with each other just as the sun<br>&gt;&gt;is setting.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Day 99:<br>&gt;&gt;They decided to have a simple day and is<br>&gt;&gt;deciding to have a walk around the city. They<br>&gt;&gt;sits down onto a bench.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;1:23 pm<br>&gt;&gt;Tina: I'm thirsty. Lets rest for a while first.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Peter: Wait here while I go buy some drinks.<br>&gt;&gt;What would you like?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tina: Eem...Apple juice will be just fine.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;1:43 pm<br>&gt;&gt;Tina waiting for about 20 minutes and Peter<br>&gt;&gt;havent return. Then someone walked up to her.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Stranger: Is your name Tina?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tina: Yes, and may I help you?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Stranger: Justnow down there on the street a<br>&gt;&gt;drunk driver has crashed into a guy. I think its<br>&gt;&gt;your friend.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tina ran over to the spot with the stranger and<br>&gt;&gt;sees Peter lying on the floor with blood over<br>&gt;&gt;his face and her apple juice still in his hands.<br>&gt;&gt;The ambulance came and she went to the hospital<br>&gt;&gt;with Peter.<br>&gt;&gt;Tina sat outside the emergency room for five and<br>&gt;&gt;a half hours. The doctor came out, and he sigh.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;11:51 pm<br>&gt;&gt;Doctor: I'm sorry, but we did the best we could.<br>&gt;&gt;He is still breathing now but God would take him<br>&gt;&gt;away from us very soon. We found this letter<br>&gt;&gt;inside his pocket.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;The doctor hands over the letter to Tina and she<br>&gt;&gt;goes into the room to see Peter. He look weak<br>&gt;&gt;but peaceful. Tina read the letter and then she<br>&gt;&gt;burst into tears. Here is what the letter said.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tina, our 100 days is almost over. I had fun<br>&gt;&gt;with you during all these days. Although you may<br>&gt;&gt;be greedy sometimes and less thoughtful, but<br>&gt;&gt;these all brought happiness into my life. I have<br>&gt;&gt;realize that you are a really cute girl and<br>&gt;&gt;blamed myself for never taken the time to<br>&gt;&gt;knowing that. I have nothing much to ask for,<br>&gt;&gt;but I just wish that we can extend the day. I<br>&gt;&gt;want to be your boyfriend<br>&gt;&gt;forever and wish that you can be beside me all<br>&gt;&gt;the time. Tina, I love you.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;11:58<br>&gt;&gt;Tina: (sobbing) Peter. Did you know what was the<br>&gt;&gt;wish I made on the night there was a meteor. I<br>&gt;&gt;asked God to let us last forever. We were<br>&gt;&gt;suppose to last 100 days so Peter!
