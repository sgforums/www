She called to ask me to go to the movie.. but i said i've seen the movie and she thought that we can see together with her friends..<br><br>She said she will have to wait for a long time for her friends to show up and its good that if i can accompany her..<br><br>Haha.. anyway, i meet her in somerset since its been a long time i've seen her... I met her friends and chat with them as well. i've seen her friends before but just that a new guy i never seen before. When the movie is about to start,  I sent them to the movie hall area and left.<br><br>As i was walking i keep thinking whether i should wait for her or not.. but decided to leave.. but on my way, i saw an ambulance and the police.. dun know what happened.. then i thought its better that i stayed on..<br><br>At the bus stop, my night rider bus went by and i was sitting rooted to the concrete chair. It was like movie. I saw all the flashbacks... all the happy moments we spent the last time after a movie at the bus stop - same place. After a while, my mum called -game over and i headed back to my house with the next arrival of my night rider bus.<br><br>At home, i didn't sleep but waited for her sms... She replied.<br>and suggested for supper.. its was 4am.. i sneaked out of my house and met her. After the supper, we spent about 30 min to shop for grocercies and other stuffs... the feeling was so different..... i never shopped with a gal before to buy grocercies except for my parents.. i felt like we were already husband and wife doing our weekly grocercies shopping.. it was fun too.. we played with the weighting machine and printed our own price tags for the groceries since no one weighs for us... very fun<br><br>After that i sent her back home and help her to unpack the grocercies and she gave me an orange she bought earlier on.<br>It was a super big orange.. haha.. i look strange with that orange in my hand. Later, I wanted to get the newspapers in 7-eleven but its still early and they are still arranging so i just bought a bread loaf,  mayo tuna and coffee for me and family. Sure enough i was approached by one person asking me where i got the orange.<br><br>I smiled and said that it was new and big so i bought one and try it out.. its the opposite supermarket...haha..<br><br>Back home i placed the orange on my shelf and swore that i never eat the orange... cause it will bring back happy memories<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by lolsuck:<br><strong>hi there,looking at your stories.. and than thinking back about mine,im less less fortunate than you,dont have much intersting stuffs like midnight going out,call for movie.. my girl here more of hm.. cant leave home too late i guess<br><br>quite sorry for you that the situation you are now,kinda stuck not sure what to do right? me too.<br><br>recently a pr-sch friend of hers decided to flirt with her through msn messenger,she feel irritated and dislike him for being a flirt. often paste what he told her to me.. what is she trying to tell me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>anyway each time she paste that,i would hint her about me still liking her,talk more sweet stuffs to her,am i doing right?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>###----&gt; Try not to..... dun think its good to paste sweet stuffs to her in MSN..<br>or she thinks you like the other guy? I know i am in no position to speak.. but<br>If you can stay with her everytime she's feeling down... This gal always think of me first when she's helpless or sad.. she know i always there for her...<br></span><br>mine is single without boyfriend pics in wallet and other stuffs, yours with good close relationship wwith the former or present bf in the wallet.. both u and i sad.<br><span style="color: red;"><br>###-------&gt; It hurts me a lot to continue like that... but it hurts me even more when i don't see her at all.. Time will tell everything..... If on the wedding day, she decided not to marry the guy then she will come back to me.. and i will want to give her joy and happiness....<br></span><br>i might be more fortunate as she indirectly telling me i got no chance at all? so she doesnt treat me as nice as yours? i might be wrong!<br><span style="color: red;"><br>###-------&gt; is it? i dun know.. spend more time with her... she will naturally miss you when you not around and not there for her.<br></span><br>i might be less fortnate as she doesnt treat me like how your girl treat u? no idea<br><br>man im sick up there sigh~ </strong><br><span style="color: red;"><br>###---&gt; same situation..haha.....  but i am afraid i cant hold on.. i am very built up.. ready to say how i feel to her anything... just need another chance in the park.<br></span></div>
