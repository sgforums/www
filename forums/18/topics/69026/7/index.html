            <div class='col-md body'>my thoughts,<br><br>Love is no charity. If you see someone you love/really like, go for it. This crap about Â‘true love doesnÂ’t mean being with the person but wishing the best for themÂ’, this is the worst advice anyone can give. What are we running here, the community chest? Do you want someone you really care to be having another guyÂ’s baby? So if she means so much to you, go grab her.<br><br>I miss out on one lady that means the world to me and now I have to live with the fact that she Mrs Â‘Â….Â’ instead of Mrs Kwek.
