WE don't really know the gal that well to give your suggestions or solutions. i'm sure plenty will agree with me here... hence, what my suggestions/solutions for you is more of what you can do and really need to do!<br><br>here is what you need to do...<br>1. tell her your feelings, yup, everything! from day 1 til now.<br>2. tell her your sufferings, yup, all the pain and tears.<br>3. tell her what you hope/wish for... yup, the gf and wife thing.<br>4. give her time to decide...<br>5. wait for answer. your misery starts here, the waiting and all....<br><br>ok, it doesn't end there...<br>IF she decided to leave the current bf for the better YOU. bless you my friend!<br>IF she said that she loves the current bf and wishes you to be by her side as friend, pls read on...<br><br>now, i would like to say that gals are easy man! if you think easy, they are really easy. i understand the sh!ts and stuff that you wanted to leave but this and but that and miss her and think of her and worry of her, etc. love requires 2 side. apparently, she loves her bf AND loves your friendship. the question we ask ourselves is 'friendship cannot be lovers?' the hard truth is, most girls (80%) would say CANNOT. why? because girls afraid when break up, cannot be friend liau! for guys, that is BS. for us, the more we complement each other, it's better. why? it's male instinct that we don't like to make adjustments in our life. while female instinct is always to be safe than sorry.<br><br>ok friend... remember my words and master them. it will teaches you that gals are indeed easy. enough of theory and back to solutions...<br><br>6. now you're in miserable state, zombified, etc.<br>7. get yourself a GF!!! pretend if you have to... be warned that this is the ultimate test. the best step would be ask this 'good good girl' the recommend. this is the killer move.<br><br>back to my theory just now. i hope you're smart enough to know what i'm trying to do. that's right, MAKE her do the adjustments! why must the male be the one doing it in a relationship. it's TIME to take charge my friend. step 7 might take a while and next step is very much depended on your progress and what's her reaction. pls use your BRAIN to win the battle of will, not just for feeling sorry for yourself. stand up and be THE man!<br><br>8. wait and analyse her reaction. pls make it clear to her that you're hunting for love partner! not just friendster....<br><br>btw, there's a good reason doing this. she won't get hurt in anyway. if she jealous enough, she will make adjustment. she will not feel safe anymore. she will consider YOU! you might get lucky and forget about her. can even double date if gf is intro by her. it's good in short term and better in long term... everyone wins!<br><br>please feedback with comment if any.<br>thanks!</div></blockquote>the last time i met her female colleague.. while going back with her.. she said her female colleague of hers is very the 'quai' type.. of coz.. i can see that.. sweet and gentle.. but i laughed and shook my head..<br><br>it hurts me when she says that to me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
