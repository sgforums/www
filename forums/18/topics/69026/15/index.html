            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmm nightyoung, if u're often and always too readily available at her beck and call, that won't stir her to be serious and do something about the situation. Right now, she's the one who needs to decide which way she wants to go with either you or the other etc.. I reckon there're many things she need to sort out and it doesn't help if you get all soft-hearted and wishy-washy cuz you're not helping her and yourself. It's not about dishing ultimatum, it's really about gaining her respect even if things don't work out your way. Remember, you don't want her to see you or remember you as someone who can't control his emotions completely, you don't want her to know you as a doormat right? From a girl's point of view and frankly so, no girl would really love any guy they can't respect. Strangely, girls learn to respect guys who don't make them the priority of their lives. nightyoung, there're times to be thoughtful to her feelings but there're surely times to be elusive and stay controlled. All the best again..</div>
