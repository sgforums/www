            <div class='col-md body'>She is just seeing which option works out for her.<br><br>If she and her current bf can work things out, you will be left out of the equation. But if she and the bf don't work things out, then she might just consider you....but on a rebound...which is kind of dangerous. I think you should just cool things down alittle...and let your life return to normal and don't let it revolve around her cause if she stops seeing you, you got to learn to live without her...thats a fact. Why don't you try to let her live without you...see how she feels, if she don't feel a thing....then I guess theres no point in carrying on with her....</div>

Does she really love you or she just enjoy you to love her and dote her and accompany her when she needs you? i dont know for you to find out bro.I hope she really loves you.</div>
