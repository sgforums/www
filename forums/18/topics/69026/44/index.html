            <div class='col-md body'>Though I'm a gal, I still want to say that nightyoung's love interest is responsible for causing him such confusion too. If she has discovered that he's the first one to deliver 2 chicken wings to her doorstep, she'd have no problem feeling flattered how overpowering she is to him and how amazingly interesting that he's still at her beck and call though she's committed to another guy now.<br><br>I had a long disussion with our pal here and he knows what and why I say the above and more. Those who're sharp and weathered would agree with me that it's hard to tango alone.<br><br>The biggest problem is nightyoung can't think clearly or sensibly and he always fail to see beyond his feelings for her. Perhaps, he has even failed to see the 'real' person in her. Yet, she's certainly &amp; doubtlessly happy to have nightyoung making her happy &amp; satisfying her demands while she makes yet another guy (her bf) happy.<br><br>I'd love to read that one day, her conscience &amp; <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>real</strong></span> feelings get the better of her and she takes a 2nd look at our pal here.<br><br>anyway hi again, everyone and thanks wes brown for attempting to show nightyoung that there're other (perhaps, better) gals alive.<br><br>However, blinded eyes can't see.</div>
