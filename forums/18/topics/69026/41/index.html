            <div class='col-md body'>Written by: RobbiethestudAnderson<br><br>What a question to ponder! I have tried writing this essay many times and have realized that this is a very difficult topic. Â“Is it possible to love someone too much?Â” If you look at the question you first must define what love is and what it means to you before you can determine if it is actually possible to love someone too much.<br><br>The Webster Dictionary defines love as Â“profoundly tender, a passionate affection for another personÂ”. In my opinion, to love someone is to care not only about them as a person but also about their well being. You can love a person even if that individual does not feel the same way about you, or if the person just doesnÂ’t understand why you are feeling this way toward him or her. ItÂ’s like when youÂ’re a little kid and your parents tell you all the stuff not to touch, not to do, and they keep on reminding you over and over again. TheyÂ’re reminding you constantly, not to get on your nerves, but because they donÂ’t want you to get hurt. They love you, and because of this strong feeling of love, they want to make sure you are safe.<br><br>To love someone is to have such strong feelings, so deeply felt that your life would not be complete or the same without them. You would do anything in the world to be with them and you will do absolutely everything for them because it feels good and right. This reminds me of a song by Canadian artist Brian Adams Everything I do I do it for you. He sings of a strong love in this song. A love that everything he does makes him feels so good and it feels so good because he is doing everything for her, the one he loves. The same feeling is described in the poem The Faultless Painter. In this poem there is a man named Andrea who will do anything for this girl whom he loves very much, but this feeling is not mutual. He makes promises, paints pictures and gives her the money to give to her lover because of gambling debts. This is what he means when he says: Â“IÂ’ll work then for your friends friend, never fearÂ” Â“More gambling debts to payÂ” Â“While hand and eye and something of a heart are left me, workÂ’s my ware, and whatÂ’s it worth? IÂ’ll pay my fancyÂ”<br><br>His fancy is his love for her for a little while.<br><br>Sometimes love means that for every waking moment you want to be with that person, having them by your side. When youÂ’re in love everything you do feels better and easier because there is someone there with you and for you. Some people may say that being there every waking moment is too much but if it feels good and right then why not? You may not be doing anything but as long as you are with them it feels right. In the poem The Faultless Painter we see examples of the feeling of love. Love can make you do things you wouldnÂ’t normally do. In the poem the painter just wants the girl to sit with him for half an hour holding hands, he also says with her love, his paintings would be better and make more money that he could spend on her.<br><br>Â“Should you let me sit here by the window with your hand in mine and look half hour Fiesole, both of one mind, as married people use, quietly, quietly the evening through, I might get up tomorrow to my work cheerful and fresh as everÂ”<br><br>Â“If you should sit her thus by me every night I should work better, do you comprehend? I mean that I should earn more and give you more.Â”<br><br>Also when you are in love, when your loved one is hurt you hurt. When she or he is in pain you are in pain. You are in pain because sometimes there is nothing you can do for them. It is hard to see someone you love hurt or in pain.<br><br>In conclusion I would like to say that I do not believe that it is possible to love someone too much. Love is something everyone feels at one time or another in their lives. Benjamin Franklin once said Â“If you would be loved, love and be loveableÂ”.<br><br>It seems much too difficult to fully love someone so I must say that it is impossible to love someone too much. Since love is unique for everyone how is one able to love too much?<br><br>I think love makes someone a better, more complete person. Thus it seems unreasonable that anyone in love, regardless of how much; can be too much in love.<br><br>And remember<br><br>Â“It is better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at allÂ”.<br><br></div>
