            <div class='col-md body'>hello...<br><br>new person here, but been lurking arnd for quite some time liaoz... been reading this thread a lot cuz well it's a lot like wat i'm going thru now...<br><br>hope no one minds i share my story...<br><br>me - young naive boy of 18 yrs<br>her - classmate of mine<br><br>i told her i liked her during late July... she was still attached... and her bf was not the nice guy type lah - always mistreat her, always make her unhappy... she was constantly vexed over him, everytime wondering if she had got into the relationship too quickly wif him.<br><br>for me... well, she was my 2nd best fren in the entire sch lah... so i kinda knew all of this... she also knew abt my problems, and my previous crushes... even tried to help me with them...<br><br>essentially i felt that she knew who i am, and accepted me completely without running away from my darker side... and i slowly fell in love with her...<br><br>blurted it out during july... she said she was confused over me too... eventually we began to go out, she kissed me, we held hands, essentially dated...<br><br>her bf broke up wif her sometime mid august... it was the day before chem prac prelims, so yes it was very bad for her... stood by her side all the way, cared for her, made her happy...<br><br>then she went back to him...<br><br>was devastated, but eventually i got myself into the black hole again, kept on calling, laughing, went out, etc...<br><br>in about a week's time, he broke up with her, again. this time over some rumours that was spread. not too sure abt the details either - but she was pretty mad at him for doing so...<br><br>again, i played the mother hen... this time however she said she needed time alone to think abt wat she wanted... gave it to her while watching her ex still go out wif her everyday...<br><br>no surprise, they got back together<br><br>she told me she still does love me. she told me we could be as we were - still calling, chatting. yet she told me she got back together because she wanted to try again with him - to not break up with him like that. yet she said tt she doesn't think it'll work out wif him...<br><br>no logic - if i was still arnd, they'd never work out their differences!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  but as it is, i tried the arrangement... only made me feel worst and worst... made me feel like i was a third wheel, a 1900 number if u will (someone to call and chat only if she was bored)...<br><br>she tells me she loves me, but i dun feel that...<br><br>today i told her all of that... she told me she still loves me, but she can't show it for obvious reasons. i really wanted to stay, and wait for her... the sheer idea of a chance wif her... even now still is very powerful...<br><br>but i told her i don't want to become a burden... i don't want to make her unhappy. if i did i'd rather go. she told me that i made her confused abt her situation wif her bf... but there was a reason behind the confusion...<br><br>still... she said i should go...<br><br>and so here i am, after reading abt all ur experiences, sharing mine...<br><br>i know, mine seems trivial. after all i'm only 18, not even shave head serve country yet, trying to talk cock abt love and shit... still... it hurts inside lah...<br><br>it makes me wonder if those months spent wif her... did she ever love me? even in the end... did she care? i know i still do care abt her... but at the same time, like u guys said - pple cannot be supporting actors all the time... must find their own show to act in...<br><br>if she finally breaks with him, should i still be there? should i start going after her properly again?<br><br>i left cuz i dun wanna cause trouble for her... and while it hurts, i know i can remove myself completely from her life... already deleted her number, sms, msn... only thing left is a journal i've been keeping...<br><br>sigh... can't help but feel like i've wasted my time...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> sighz...<br><br>shrug - yeah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> my story...</div>
