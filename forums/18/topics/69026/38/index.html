Your intentions are indeed quite honorable but you must realize that you cannot take on the problems of the world. You may think that you have people's best interests in mind, but you might just be afraid of rejection if you stand up for yourself Â…and have you truly considered your own best interests? The only one suffering from hardships is you. If you continue to soften the blow from under people when they fall, they will never learn to protect themselves. And, unless you plan on being a glutton for punishment for the rest of your life, you need to accept that people have to learn to take responsibility for their own actions. Start by learning to say "no" occasionally; not only will you become a valuable friend to those whom you say "no" toÂ…you will also become a better friend to yourself!<br><br></div>
