I refused to say n keep it within my heart. However, after a period of time, I can't bottle it anymore n told her my true feelings... it was a major relief for me.. I felt like a reborn during tat time even though I knew tat she will not reciprocate my luv for her.<br><br>Actually, bro nightyoung, I'm pretty sure that she noes that u like her... but she may still wan to be very good friend with u... not bf... she may feel tat u r the best person to turn to whenever she's down n sad... u r always there for her... but she may not find u suitable to be her bf due to some other reason (only she noes).<br><br>My advise to you... let her noe of yr true feeling but tell her tat u both can still be gd friends n u shld encourage her to cherish her current bf... then... u will feel happier and both of u can be the best of friends again....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
