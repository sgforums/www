I have seen pple going ard in circles but u are one of the few who can bring pple to go round in circles with you, lookin at the no. of posts in this forum...<br><br>All your previous 'self' promises of a clean break, puttin things behind u etc. (see previous pages e.g. Pg 51). Have u forgotten all about them? Now it seems, u are realli back to square one again.<br><br>Move on n stop lookin back. What is urs, is urs. What isn't, no point wasting ur time. Time shld be spent to look for what is urs n not to snatch or wait for what isn't.<br><br>Jus my 2 cents worth.</div>
