I approached the nurse and realise that we had to take a queue number! Gosh it was like.. we have to queue all over again.. but i really dun mind as i was spending time with her..we laughed... hahaha<br><br>then after that we went back to the receptionist to claim the MC .. the nurse says... its a 2.30pm MC cert while my watch showed 5.30pm.. hahaha.. the nurse must be wondering why we took so long to collect the MC...hahaha<br><br>we laughed again - only we knew what happened<br><br>I think i will remember this event for life... and i will never forget till my last breathe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This time i was very happy to be with her again.. i just can't spell it out exactly why even though i made a point to forget her as i know that she's attached and i know that I be there for her when she needs me.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Err.. remember to take queue ticket at the pharmacy unless you want to spend more time with someone there...hehe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After a few days of not seeing each other and i ended the sms greetings yesterday morning.. I sms her good nite.. i was lying on my bed waiting for my phone to beep but it never...<br><br>so feeling uneasy about 40 min later.. i told my mum i wanted to buy something.. but exactly it was just an excuse..<br><br>i went to the place where we sat last saturday and didn't see her so i thought she must be sleeping..<br><br>then i went over to the 24 hour coffeshop.. surprise i saw a familiar gal.. then i take a closer look.. 99% its her.. with her boyfriend!!<br><br>WE looked at each other for about 2 seconds before she turned away to her boyfriend.. I wasn't dare to approach her because i knew that if i do that she will be unhappy as she doesn't want her boyfriend to misunderstand anything..<br><br>Anyway.. if she want to acknowledge.. she could just wave to me but she didn't...<br><br>so i went back home.. finishing my bottle of drink..  okie.. good to see them happy again.... haha.. as for me...... I felt better when i reached home if not i keep thinking how's she.. etc.. okie.. i still will accompany her if she's sad in future...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
