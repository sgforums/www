            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks everyone for your replies! Just to note, I would NEVER have an abortion. If I were to get pregnant me and my boyfriend are both old enough and mature enough to handle it, but it would make things a lot easier if we waited a few more years. He did pull-out in time. I know it is not very reliable becuase there are mistakes but there was no mistake and I have heard so many differnt views on whether or not precum can acutally get a girl pregnant. It is hard to use protection every time since we are in a long and serious relationship and we know we are both STD free. Believe me I am the most pariniod person when it comes to STD's. In the mean time, I will TRY not to think/worry about it, but it is easier said than done</div>

I also understand in a long-term relationship, wan to use condoms is a difficult thing..then use some other ways of contraceptives lor....you rather prevent an accident rather then wait for it to happen liao then see what yo do rite?</div>
