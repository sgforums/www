            <div class='col-md body'>July 18, 2005<br>Sugar and spice<br><br>By Sherwin Loh<br><br>BENEATH the sweetie pie image of Priscelia Chan is something of a spitfire.<br><br>Despite being typecast on Channel 8 as the sweet girl-next-door, the 1999 Star Search finalist doesn't mince words when she tells you she is tired of such roles.<br><br>'To be frank, I hate it. There should be more dimensions to a role,' the bilingual actress says.<br><br>And that is where Channel 5 is providing her the chance to stretch her acting chops.<br><br>She is currently starring in two shows on the English-language channel - as Patricia Mok's timid daughter in the comedy My Sassy Neighbour and as Lisa Gan in cop drama Heartlanders.<br><br>It is the latter that has got her heart racing - and it has nothing to do with kissing on-screen beau Vincent Ng.<br><br>As the rape victim who gave birth to a son, Chan, 26, plays a single Mum bringing up a defiant kid.<br><br>She relates to the Lisa character due to the death of her mother on the eve of Chinese New Year this year.<br><br>Her mother suffered from a year-long illness that caused her to have fits-like seizures.<br><br>Chan channelled her pain of witnessing her own mother wither away into playing the character on-screen.<br><br>'My Mum held two jobs, did the housework and managed to save money, so she was always very stressed out, and I took that part of her and put it all into Heartlanders,' she adds, looking sober.<br><br>It was that experience that has also made her more vocal, she says.<br><br>The effervescent actress, who graduated in 1998 from Temasek Polytechnic with a diploma in accounting and finance, freely admits that it has been difficulty finding popularity at Channel 8 given the competition from other young actresses.<br><br>But she also maintains that the move to Channel 5 was not because she was unhappy or wanted to look for greener pastures.<br><br>She will be returning in the second season of My Sassy Neighbour.<br><br>But Channel 8 fans can still catch her on the Chinese channel. She plays a villain in the sequel to the Chinese drama serial, Portrait Of Home, which will air in October.<br><br>Another reason for not making the full crossover to Channel 5 is a practical one - the higher ratings of Channel 8 and the exposure she gets from it.<br><br>As she says frankly: 'You cannot put all your eggs in one basket.'<br><br>Catch Priscelia Chan on Heartlanders on Channel 5 at 8pm and on My Sassy Neighbour at 8.30pm on Tuesdays.<br></div>
