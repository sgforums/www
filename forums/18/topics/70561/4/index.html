            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, subudei, calling you twisted was over the top, and I do apologise.  I got you mixed up with the other idiots that have posted baseless nonsense.  If you wish to discuss media theory, I'm happy to go with that.  Let me see if I can get this on the right spin.<br><br>It strikes me that your argument is open to questions of what is cause and what is effect, and also to the reasons behind the representation of Chinese stereotypes.<br><br>First, like I said, the implication of your assertion is that Chinese women are dating men of other races because of the influence of movies.  I question if this is indeed the case.  Could it not be that the fiction following the fact, and that women have their own individual motivations for choosing who they date?<br><br>Second, I'm not saying that it's all right to represent racial stereotypes.  I was pointing out the fact in the context of it being a commercial imperative to sell an easily recognisable product.  After all, Hollywood is driven by its box office figures, and they will do what it takes to sell tickets, even if it means taking cheap shots.  I'd personally take that as the reason behind the stereotypes, rather than some deliberate attempt at maintaining prejudice.<br><br>Hopefully that clears things up.<br><br>By the way, it's not a psychological appraisal, subudei - I charge for those. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

There have been many arguments against this theory since it was introduced in the 1930s, mainly in that it does not account for choices between competing concepts within a category.  Certainly the notion does make intuitive sense, but if you dig deeper into it, there are so many external factors involved that the case fails to hold water.<br><br>One key factor is the gender attitudes held by some Asian men, where they take a propreital attitude towards women.  Look at the threads involving dating across cultures - how many guys on this forum have expressed the notion of "our women"?  Look at the reactions to women who go "I'm not anybody's property" - they're immediately hit with the sweeping derogation of SPG, if not something worse.<br><br>If you were a woman, would you like somebody to claim you as their property based entirely of the coincidence of race?  Would you like to be exposed to loutish behaviour simply for making your own choices?<br><br>The Singaporean male has been seriously misrepresented by a group of bigoted mysoginists.  If you want to get angry at anybody, get angry at them - they're the ones giving you a bad name.</div>

They'll compliment you but phrase it rough terms to make it clear that they're not kissing up to you.  That can be very easy to misinterpret.<br><br>Most certainly, Australia is not the most genteel of countries.

Lots of aussies here can identify him having watched CTHD in the Aussie cinemas myself. Is he a sex object too? HEhehe.. Michelle yeoh a sex object..if she was a sex object, she would have been bonking Sir james bond every second scene. HHahaha.. Then jackie, chow and Jet are invisible or vaporations? Oh or maybe O'ren Ishii is a sex object as well? I'd hate to think of what remains of the caucasian that would dare to go near her.<br>And if Bai ling wants to walk around looking like a hooker on Grey Street, St Kilda, that's her choice not cos she's forced to by these big white guys. It's cos she wants publicity and knows that's how it's done.<br><br>I don't think it's a stereotype, they stereotype themselves by their choice of movies.

Even he is subjected to the pitfalls (this is before his sad political career)<br><br>Hhehehe.. then everyone of them with caucasian boyfriends must be thinking.. Oh my god, i must be seen with a caucasian cost aht will make me so cool..   Most of the asians i meet in Chinatown are with a chink boyfriend. Have you been here to study yourself Dude?<br>Have you seen how the asian students dont' talk to anyone else but their own kind?

Even my loser aussie friends get marriage proposals there. Uh huh.. you know why.</div>
