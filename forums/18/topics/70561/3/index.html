It's not so much a racial stereotype as pandering to the lowest common denominator to deliver a product that is easily recognisable and can therefore be sold without need for too much interpretation.  Like you said, we'd have to question how much Hollywood movies can be counted as art.<br><br>And you're saying that Chinese women sleep with men of other races because of what they see in the movies?  I can't say that speaks too much of your view of women's intellect.<br><br>it appears that your racial views are driving the way you process tha facts - you're assembling things in a very twisted way.</div>

Personally, after 10 years in Australia, I've never had anyone laugh at my height or size.  If anything, whenever spoke to me about being Chinese, it was to discuss the culture - these weren't just uni students either, but also people I've met at work, in pubs, restaurants and other places.  It was all very civilised, and I neither shied away from the locals or went looking for a fight because there was no need to.<br><br>Then again, it could be a regional thing - which part of Oz did you go to and how long were you there?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It would be obtuse to say that just because Hollywood misrepresents Germans, Italians, Russians etc, that situation necessarily justifies its misrepresentation of Chinese as well. I.e. just because they do it to others, it doesn't mean that they can do it to us, too.<br><br>And even so, these days there are far fewer instances of misrepresentation of Germans, Italians, etc than there are misrepresentations of Orientals, especially Chinese.<br><br>I've already noted that Chinese women are portrayed in the West as sex objects perpetually bedded by white caucasian men - no one has yet contested the accuracy of this view.<br><br>Gedanken, I've refrained from resorting to crude personal attacks and unwelcome amateur psychological appraisals of other forum members thus far, I'm most disappointed that you had to stoop so low and lower the bar on this discussion.<br><br>Then again, there seem to be a number of SPGs on this thread, which is something I hadn't looked too closely at before but can see now. These SPGs have readily and repeatedly resorted to the crude personal attacks I mentioned above, instead of keeping things civilised. Perhaps a case of the lady protesting too much? Indicative that they may be aware of the precariousness of their position, and are so desperate to defend it that they lose sight of even the niceties of courtesy? Yep.</div>
