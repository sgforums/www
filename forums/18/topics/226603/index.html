            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Yawning like a wild lion, I awoke the next day feeling a greater than normal enthusiasm for life. I sat up and propped my pillow against the head of my rickety old bed of too many years and turned on my laptop, hoping to have an offline message from her.<br><br>Unfortunately, Yahoo dashed my hopes sitting there with nothing showing up. Oh well, what was I expecting? It was only a hug, possibly a friendly one and I was making it look like she was getting me all riled up for a night of hot, passionate and supremely orgasmic sex.<br><br>Shutting the machine down, I got out of bed and made preparations for work, humming a little tune to myself. Come to think of it, it was that irritating tune from the McDonaldÂ’s advertisement Â– IÂ’m loving itÂ’.<br><br>Life seemed to have made a U turn last night as I found myself unusually polite and courteous whilst on the way to work. The CTE, as usual, was jammed packed with vehicles heading into the city. I made a conscious effort to give way for every other driver who wanted to turn into my lane. If only the traffic police would see me now, they would either give me an award for road courtesy or even pull me over for road hogging. Yes, I was really going slow and still feeling good about it!<br><br>Work wise, it was the usual routine. I kept checking Yahoo if she had come online so I could get a little chat going. My heart was yearning for her company, even if it was online, when she was in another country altogether. Sadly, she must have been really caught up at work. I had to keep myself from sending her an SMS but decided against it as I did not want to look too Â“stickyÂ” in a new born relationship. There I go again, it wasnÂ’t official yet and I was thinking as if I had found a new girlfriend already.<br><br>As the day wore on, more urgent tasks were presented to me that had to be attended to in the soonest time possible and I got entrenched in a deep pit filled with work that just had to be done somehow. Putting aside my romantic thoughts for the time being, I kept going at work with a gusto never before experienced. Even the old maids felt that I was a changed man and came over and asked if I was ok and if I needed any help.<br><br>Sometimes, the effect of another person in your life may just do the same to you. At this juncture, it certainly felt that I was falling in love with her; a remarkable woman that IÂ’ve only met the night before but had tons of chat logs to re-read and fall head over heels all over again.<br><br>Nearing the end of the day, Jack, a good friend of mine, sent me an SMS. The message wrote, Â“Yo bro, wanna go 4 a drink?Â”<br><br>It had really been a long time since I hung out with Jack. I havenÂ’t been doing much socially since taking on the new position and an invitation for life catch ups over a few beers was definitely very welcome.<br><br>We met at our favorite waterhole Â– The Axis Bar at the Oriental Singapore in the evening and were just making small talk about work, life and his favorite, women.<br><br>I think itÂ’s only fair that I provide a little background information on Jack. JackÂ’s a very adept and resourceful software engineer. Most people would relate to a geek or a nerdy person when it came to IT but not when theyÂ’ve met Jack. Back when we were in National Service, the gang, as we used to call ourselves, including the other buddies, would frequent Zouk whenever we had our allowances released from the Government.<br><br>Built like a fighter pilot with good looks to boot, Jack would almost every time bring home a woman for a romp when we left the club. Till today, Jack still has kept himself looking as young and handsome that he always has been. Despite his good looks, JackÂ’s bane is that heÂ’s very alcoholic (at least by my standards). He drinks relentlessly, never stopping even after heÂ’s certified drunk by the people around him. And when he gets drunk, the male ego takes over and he will absolutely do anything you ask of him.<br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>Previous &amp; Current stories at <a href="http://storytellingtime.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">storytellingtime.blogspot.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The boring days passed with me focusing on the never-ending tasks that were piling up at work. We still kept very much in touch via Yahoo but nothing worth mentioning as it was mostly small talk. No reference was made to the wondrous hug she gave and I resigned myself to the fact that it was just a gesture of friendship and nothing more.<br><br>Still I was keen on more meetings with her as somehow, I could not manage to get her off my mind.<br><br>I did have an inkling that she was too occupied with her career and did not push my luck about asking her out again. Looking back now, she seemed like an exact replica of me during my heydays. I could see myself in her, full of unending energy and ironclad resolve, living the life of a successful executive. How I wished life would be a little more forgiving and let folks who have fallen into the abyss a little push when they are trying to climb back up from the rut.<br><br>Alas, that would be my side of the problem and not a tale for this blog.<br><br>Â“Keep on going!Â” That would be my motto for now as I kept up at work, with my rowdy Â“brosÂ” and also keeping this blog updated, whilst at the same time, opening my ears and eyes wide for any new positions available that I could eke a living out of.<br><br>It was almost a religious ritual now to wake everyday and start up the laptop, seeing if there were any messages left to me by her or any of my friends. It does not make any substantial improvements to life I reckon, but it does give me a few minutes to fully clear any grogginess left in me from the nightsÂ’ rest.<br><br>It was also a pleasant surprise one day to sit up in bed, with Yahoo logged on and finding the message she left for me.<br><br>-Begin Chat Log-<br>Her : grim<br>Her : i read ur blog over last 2 nites<br>Her : u really drive me crasy with those stories<br>Her : simply makes me fantasize more , making love to u<br>Her : muacks<br>Her : then i came up with notti ideas, pick me up over lunch and make out<br>Her : haha<br>-End Chat Log-<br><br>I never expected the monotonous stories to have any effect on anyone. They were only written as a reminiscence of encounters that I had experienced. I was stupefied for a moment, thoughts running wilder by the minute with what I was reading.<br><br>Shutting down the laptop, I went through the daily motions of preparing for work. I firmly decided to eliminate any form of shyness and cowardice (possibly from the fear of rejection) when I chat with her next and be a little more forceful to ask her out again.<br><br>It wasnÂ’t long after I reached the office that the opportunity presented itself. She started another chat session and there we went, catching up with the latest news from each otherÂ’s lives. No reference was made to the message she left but we agreed to wrap up work early tonight and meet up for dinner as well as a walk along the beach so we could bask in the sea breeze and basically relax from the rigors of working life.<br><br>She looked very much like a young schoolgirl when I met her at Paya Lebar. Since it was a Friday, she was dressed casually in a black polo T with a blue denim skirt. Her jet black hair, shoulder in length was let down, framing a youthful face. As we chatted in the car on the way to Changi Village, I would steal glances at her as we spoke, heart melting whenever she would smile beautifully at me, longing to run my fingers along her cheeks and neck.<br><br>Her smooth legs were also a distraction as I drove, as she constantly adjusted in the seat, crossing and uncrossing her legs. The simple action of that made me take my eyes off the road a few seconds now and then as my eyes, seemingly aloof to my control, glanced cheekily towards the passenger side of the vehicle. Though we chatted, my mind was fantasizing about the hidden treasure that lay where the legs met, and if I would one day be the treasure hunter to unlock it. I just hope when that day happens, it would not be a PandoraÂ’s Box that will be opened but an unimaginable beginning of a fantastic journey in my life.<br><br>----------------------------------------<br><br>The previous chapters and the continuation of this chapter is -&gt; <a href="http://storytellingtime.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://storytellingtime.blogspot.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just published Chapter 5.  Here's a short snippet.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>ChengÂ’s Seafood Village at Farmart Centre was one of my favorite places to hang out at. Traditional outdoor eating with the freedom to smoke away without any restrictions coupled with delicious seafood such as Chilli Crab and Seafood Hor Fun never failed to appease the glutton in me.<br><br>Her company was complimented by a wonderful dinner tonight as we sat and chat even after all the plates were cleaned up. The occasional touch of her hand on my arm as we kept sharing stories and telling jokes was slowly driving my desire to be as close to her as possible. The exposed area of the polo T rewarded me with a deep cleavage armored within her white colored bra whenever she lay against my arm as she giggled at another one of the tales I was telling.<br><br>It was euphoric when someone whom you really care about is happy. Nothing else matters when smiles and laughter from a loved one infects oneself. I tattooed this unforgettable night and secretly wished for more days and nights like this. IÂ’ve never felt so at ease and so free to be myself without holding back some of my behaviour which might have made other women find inappropriate.<br><br>The food places at Farmart closed early, probably due to the fact it was an out of the way location and not so well frequented. The manager of the restaurant hinted that closure by coming over to take Â“the last orderÂ”, she claimed. That was just a subtle way of telling us to pay up and go. In any case, the night was still young and we could be at many other places to spend the evening, thus we paid up and left.<br><br>I took a left turn after exiting the car park. This was her first time here and she was slightly intrigued at where the road would lead to. On our way here, we saw a few agricultural farms and some metal scrapyards. Since sheÂ’s never been to this area of Singapore before we drove around to see what else we could find.<br><br>As we neared a large compound, supposedly a Prison or Civil Defense building, I saw a long dark road and immediately swerved in. Â“LetÂ’s explore here ok? Looks like deserted.Â” I explained and slowed down as there were only a few street lamps lit.<br><br>Â“I wonder if got people who come here to make out or not. Maybe we can spot them.Â” She giggled again. There wasnÂ’t any car in sight for the entire stretch of this road. I Â“doubtÂ” anyone would drive all the way here and have sex.<br><br>Little old mischievous me finally found the spot I was looking out for. A spot between two unlit street lamps where it was especially dark, and on top of that, a deserted road in the middle of nowhere. I stopped the car and left the engine running. Changing the channel to Class 95 on the radio, when I knew there would be romantic love songs being played at this time, I put my hand on her lap and turned to face her as I gave her upper thighs a soft squeeze.<br><br>Muttering as I pulled her closer, gently giving her a kiss on her beautiful lips, Â“Thanks for having dinner with me today. I think itÂ’s very romantic here under the stars.Â”<br><br>I think it will take a long time to get over the intense passion of our kisses. Our lips seemed to be comfortably locked against one another, whilst the tongues play catch relentlessly. I could feel the warm touch of her hands as they went under my shirt and started to rub as well as pull me closer. The confined space of the car wasnÂ’t cooperating much but I tried to get my body as close to her as possible.<br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>The rest and the previous chapters are at <a href="http://storytellingtime.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://storytellingtime.blogspot.com</a><br><br>Feel free to drop by to have a read. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Signature lush greenery welcomed me as I swerved into the tranquility of the Shangri La hotel. Renowned as a botanical haven, the main building of the hotel stood majestically amidst beautiful flora. After haphazardly parking the car, I entered the main lobby, unconsciously walking hastily, half wanting to see her as soon as possible, the other half was seemingly powered by pure lust.<br><br>The friendly doorman, a tall, well-built and royally dressed Singh greeted me heartily with a wave as I breezed past him, myself managing only a weak smile.<br><br>I had an inkling that he had subsequently verbally insulted me silently with some Hokkien expletive served with a pinch of Â“Singh-lishÂ”. Taking no heed to anything else other than meeting up with my baby, I entered the hotelÂ’s grand lobby and called her.<br><br>Â“Coming down dear!Â”, she sounded chirpy and excited upon knowing that I had arrived. My heart warmed and beat stronger in anticipation of what was going to come. A room, a bed and the two of us together. A perfect recipe on a perfect day, not to mention a perfect hotel. It was truly a blessed feeling to be me. Finally, after a hideous long time of not getting laid, I was within the grasp of making out with someone, someone who recently triggered so many emotions within me.<br><br>I thought about days past where we were only Yahoo pals and some of the more memorable chats we had. Fast forward to the first meet up cum date when I sent her off to the airport for her business trip. That first magical hug. The subsequent dinner date and the unforgettable kiss that we shared. If this wasnÂ’t love, then what would it be?<br><br>The seconds ticked past, never to be had again. It seemed that I was waiting for an eternity for her arrival. In that short span of time, I actually looked at the time thrice, wondering if this was all a scam and she would be hiding behind a wall or pillar, staring at me, laughing at me as I stood here waiting for her, anticipating a good hot afternoon filled with unending orgasms.<br><br>My worries were unfounded as I suddenly felt two familiar arms going around me from the back and her warm presence as I was hugged tightly from behind.<br><br>I turned around and held her, our eyes locking. Her smile exuded the purest form of happiness as we embraced for a short moment. Â“You are so late. Looks like I have to punish you.Â”<br><br>Kissing her forehead, ignoring the stares from the rest of the people around the lobby, I feigned a hurtful look at her statement. Â“You are so beautiful today, punish me all you want.Â”<br><br>She took my hand and led me away to the lift lobby, both of us knowing what was to come and without skipping a beat, rushing hurriedly to our love nest. She told me on the way up that her sisters were spending the night with her as the room reservation was a Â“get-awayÂ” they planned for. I was invited to have dinner with the girls but for now, we had some quiet time on our own.<br><br>Â“Dear, before you came over I was surfing your blog again and was reading your Domestic Affair. It was really driving me crazy with all the naughty thoughts.Â” She stood close and held my arm so that I could feel the soft mounds of her breasts and inhale the marvelous scent that was uniquely hers.<br><br>She was dressed casually today, in a pink tube top that only served to accentuate her figure in ways one could only imagine. Her thin maroon colored bra straps had the effect of her wearing a spaghetti top. A yellow and pink casual shorts complimented the top. I found myself staring lovingly at her smooth and slightly tanned legs, legs that I would soon be running my hands over. As there were no one else in the lift, I inadvertently put my hands around her waist, slowly moving downwards to pat her butt as she laid her head on my shoulder.<br><br>We had only a couple of hours and I wanted it to be special for us. Although I just ejaculated this morning due to my own doing, I felt ready for another round and even more so wanted to impress her in bed. Though many do say that true love does not encompass great sex, I beg to differ. Great lovers and even greater sex will propel a relationship to even greater heights as sex is a fantastic way to open up, to share and to make a couple bond closer and harder.<br><br>As we made our way to the room, we held one another so close as if we were newly weds on our honeymoon. Â“Dear, do you want to take a shower?Â” She asked mischievously.<br><br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Get the rest at my blog - http://storytellingtime.blogspot.com</div>
