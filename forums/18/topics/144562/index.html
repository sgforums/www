            <div class='col-md body'>G-SPOT Stimulation<br><br>Manual penetration is a prefect way to find woman's G-spot. The G-spot is another name for urethral sponge, the spongy tissue around the urethra, the tube that leads from the bladder to the hole woman pee through. The G-spot is located about one itch inside the vagina &amp; towards the front of her body, &amp; u can feel the sponge through the vaginal wall. The G-spot swells as a woman gets turned ON, so it becomes more prominent &amp; easier to find.<br>G-spot stimulation can vary, as a general rule, it must be firm &amp; deliberate. Many ppl like the "come here" technique, where u insert a finger or twowith ur palm facing upward, then curve ur fingers towards u as if beckoning someone to ur side. Continue this motion as u firmly press against the G-spot. Others prefer a pulling motion, where u locate the spot, then move ur fingers in &amp; out slightly as if trying to pull it out of her body.<br>Another trick is to use ur forefinger &amp; middle-finger, &amp; alternate ur strokes between the two, as if ur fingers are "walking" on her G-spot.<br>A lot of guys will take their fingers &amp; sticks them straight in, but man who knows what they are doing curve their fingers to aim owards the G-spot. Most woman say that they feel like they have to pee when their G-spot is stimulated, which makes sense since the tissue around the urethra is very sensitive, and triggers a reaction in the urethra. For some, an urge to pee or a full bladder feeling is extremely pleasurably once they get turned on. For others, no matter how aroused they are, G-spot stimulation is more annoying than anything else. So like everything else, ask her if she like it , &amp; if she say YES, inquire some guidance; after all, she knows her body best. If ur partners n-joys G-spot stimulation, u can also try curved dildos or vibrators designed specially for reaching that special spot. Vigorous G-spot stimulation leads to female ejaculation in some woman.<br>Good luck man.....</div>
