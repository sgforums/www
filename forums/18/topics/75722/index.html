            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm innnteresting. All very good points. Yes such behaviour doesn't show much hope of prolong survival.<br><br>yes its all based on intentions. and yes. we should not be blind sheeps and just follow cause everyone's following it.<br><br>lets talk about tolerance then. How many of you would tolerate it if someone close to you stepped out of the closet?<br><br>What if the child consents? Unlikely...but still we can't ignore the possibility of that happening. Yea laws are in place to protect them from sexual abuse and all, but i dun think there's a law that states that a grown up and a child are not allowed to fall in love. K sex is a component of any romantic relationship, that i don't deny. But since the child prob hasn't got his or her sexual reproductive organs developed yet, on top of that, i believe any couple REALLY in love has the self control to "tahan" till the right moment, should such relationships still be condemned?<br><br>I was thinking about this and it struck me that a relationship between a child and an adult would obviously not be the same as that between two kids or two adults. For eg, both of them might share the same admiration, respect, trust blah blah (components of love) for each other when the child is young. Therefore, love is bred at an early stage but neither of them realise it as our mind tells us that paedophilia is taboo. however as the child grows older , those feelings are realised and voila...they end up getting married despite the huge age gap. I've read that in a book...never seen it or experienced it myself hahaha (i personally dun wish to)<br><br>i'm not an advocate of such behaviour... but should they be accepted as human beings with feelings as well? Should we condemn them just because we don't understand what THEY are going through.<br><br>One last eg (which i know i'll get slammed by). King of Pop MJ! i love the dude... his music rocks but his behaviour is def not desirable... But could this adnormal behaviour stem from society condemning his "abnormal" love for kids? If society accepted MJ for his "exceptional" love for kids instead, would he even commit the alleged acts?</div>

It has only been since the rise of religious societies dominated by fundamentalism that such things became taboo.

Yes such behaviour doesn't show much hope of prolong survival.<br><br>yes its all based on intentions. and yes. we should not be blind sheeps and just follow cause everyone's following it.<br><br>lets talk about tolerance then. How many of you would tolerate it if someone close to you stepped out of the closet?<br><br>What if the child consents? Unlikely...but still we can't ignore the possibility of that happening. Yea laws are in place to protect them from sexual abuse and all, but i dun think there's a law that states that a grown up and a child are not allowed to fall in love. K sex is a component of any romantic relationship, that i don't deny. But since the child prob hasn't got his or her sexual reproductive organs developed yet, on top of that, i believe any couple REALLY in love has the self control to "tahan" till the right moment, should such relationships still be condemned?<br><br>I was thinking about this and it struck me that a relationship between a child and an adult would obviously not be the same as that between two kids or two adults. For eg, both of them might share the same admiration, respect, trust blah blah (components of love) for each other when the child is young. Therefore, love is bred at an early stage but neither of them realise it as our mind tells us that paedophilia is taboo. however as the child grows older , those feelings are realised and voila...they end up getting married despite the huge age gap. I've read that in a book...never seen it or experienced it myself hahaha (i personally dun wish to)<br><br>i'm not an advocate of such behaviour... but should they be accepted as human beings with feelings as well? Should we condemn them just because we don't understand what THEY are going through.<br><br>One last eg (which i know i'll get slammed by). King of Pop MJ! i love the dude... his music rocks but his behaviour is def not desirable... But could this adnormal behaviour stem from society condemning his "abnormal" love for kids? If society accepted MJ for his "exceptional" love for kids instead, would he even commit the alleged acts?</div></blockquote>Abuse of trust. Very much like what bear has said... Young children.... Are they thinking the right way? Or are they just misguided?<br><br>My own stand. I usually won't care much. Unless... Hmm... Shall see?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea bear.... i guess playing safe works. And...unless u can give me a term to replace paedophile and incest, i want to state that i use this words with their meanings sans sex and sans the obsession.<br><br>hmm...should write a tragic story about this kinda relationships<br><br>oh yea u said something about incest sans sex....yes  its possible... look at AA...a couple of them (whether true or not i dunno) have come out to profess their love for their cousins.<br><br>but i'm sure you all have to agree about one thing with me... the world today is just to sex-driven. i've been going about asking my friends what they think about this, apart from suspiciously eyeing me, they all needed an explanation that i was refering to the relationships sans sex. doesn't anybody retain shards of decency around here??? haha</div>
