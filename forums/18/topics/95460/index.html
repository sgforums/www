Maybe cause you kerna groped a lot of times (chio mah right)? I've never said that they should abolish molest or anything like that. Nor did I say to let guilty ones get away, just to spare a thought for the innocent ones.<br><br>Which is why i said refine. Law at the moment is relatively imperfect, so it could be improved. Prince has done very well in pointing out that investigation procedures could be changed.<br><br>Besides, just as it is with any crime, if the victim doesn't report or press charges, there's nothing the police can do. Unless it's a murder case or something that severe.<br><br>Girls should be educated that they should not allow themselves to be taken advantage. But they should also be educated not to abuse the law meant to protect them. There are women who know very well that the law protects them and gives great power to women as individuals, so much power that some abuse it. Resulting in some innocent guy suffering and being miserable.<br><br>I have no issue with the punishment dealt on those guys who are guilty, but for the innocent ones the amount of distress they go through is uncalled for. I think it would be right to suggest that girls who make such false claims should also be dealt with harshly under the law.<br></div>

Ok thanks very much.<br><br>IMO, The law is really on the women's side. Even in schools, a single word frm a gal is likely to be unfavourable to a guy. I remeber in sec2, this fat gal twice my size pick a fight with me. She slapped my face and nearly kicked me in the nuts. So I had to defend myself-but she got a swollen ankle in the process. In a written statement, she mentioned that I kicked her while she was on the floor and I stpped her repeatedly on the ankle. And guess what? My word against hers was not valid! I had to gather like 3 witnesses to make an assertion that she was the one who provoked a fight in the first place.</div>

Ok thanks very much.<br><br>IMO, The law is really on the women's side. Even in schools, a single word frm a gal is likely to be unfavourable to a guy. I remeber in sec2, this fat gal twice my size pick a fight with me. She slapped my face and nearly kicked me in the nuts. So I had to defend myself-but she got a swollen ankle in the process. In a written statement, she mentioned that I kicked her while she was on the floor and I stpped her repeatedly on the ankle. And guess what? My word against hers was not valid! I had to gather like 3 witnesses to make an assertion that she was the one who provoked a fight in the first place.</div></blockquote>girls can never win guys in fist fights or stuff,so why did she provoke a fight with you?</div>
