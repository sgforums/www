In less than 5 mins and hardly before you seats warm-up, they'll pull you to the "Garden".... try to get your "stuffs" out and move on.... these are places I hate going...<br><br>Dynasty is a good place too... gals there are more cultured... the most famous sleazy joints of cos are "Bai Tian Er" , "Chateau De Cognac", "Egos"....<br><br>In short... KTVs these days are the "papaya-land"...men go there to pluck papayas and try to collect "raisins".... </strong></div>
