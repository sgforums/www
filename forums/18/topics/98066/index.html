In this case, I think you juz like a mature man who is much older than you. It is normal at your age.<br><br>If a guy who likes a girl, after the first dating, he will continually sms/call you or tries to have more dating with you. There are only few reasons why he won't reply instantly :-<br><br>1) He is too busy to reply you (acceptable, but depends on what kind of work/job)<br><br>2) He seldom use sms/call someone (??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> , may be he doesn't bring his hp always.... may be he turns off his hp during working hours.....I have no comment)<br><br>3) He juz treats you as a cyber friend as he treats same way with others online (depends on what is his priority for you in his heart/life, so don't expect something)<br><br>4) He might has gf liao or he is with other girl when he receives your sms(whether you like it or not, juz be careful)<br><br>p/s - Anyway, don't judge a book by its cover, try to know more about him including his friends and his lifestyle (of course keep a distance with him first before having closer relationship with him)<br><br>Hope you will take more considerations before making any decision for further development of relationship. Good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
