            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>Its me again. Regards to Zacky's posting we oreadi discussed it much earlier. So pls check out the earlier posting.<br><br>Regarding how is the figure available? Well I think its quite simple check out the chc website It is available there. The average age of CHC is 23-25. So its not really about teenager. You may think becoz there are elderly there. BUt infact there are more children in the children church than the elderly church. THere is also the chinese church with mostly middle age to senior ppl. And also an indonesian service where these indo chinese expriatate attend. If you still refuse to believe try visiting all the service in chc and you will understand. Otherwise there's nothing else can be explained to u as u wouldn't believe in anythinig.<br><br>Toking about the number of ppl attending her concert. They are measure thru the decision slip when an alter call is given. Becoz preaching is only done oversea in her concert but nothing singapore and ironically its the singaporeans are the only one ranting over this. Statistically 80% are non Christians which is release by the church. There's also alot of campus concert remember? If one would expect the oversea frens to support her album I think its not logical unless she is really very very good even those oversea supported her. Try asking ur oversea frens to buy 10s of cd per person and u'll noe why. It's hard rite? How about Hong Kong? She is also popular there. There are indeed some ppl who buy few of her cd to give out. But how many actually does that? How many did you see? As far as I see there isn't more than 5% around me that I noe of. More likely is that the entire cell group are buying together. That is more common. Believe it or not up to u.<br><br>Perhaps its the facts and the look at it superficially make every assume in another situation. BUt I think never assume confirm.<br><br>And regarding her talent I think She sang very well. Her voice is really good. And her song is nice. Other than that I'm not commenting. If you think her talent is not good, I think its ur preference.<br><br>Regarding the sue. I think Sky_drew is sayign it for the reasons of reminding you ppl. Remember the previous case, where few ppl said aobut the church on newspaper. The fact is ( this is the real truth) THe person is not sued. the church was toking him eventaully he decided to apologies willingly. And till today I believe his still in this church. She reserve the rights to sue if what u said had cause idemnity damages unto her. For instance slander cause ppl to believe that she really force ppl to buy her cd etc etc and its not true, u can be sued. Not by her probably, I think the person more wanting to sue u is her record company in order to preserved her commercial value. And u think u can escape? Government has a great ways to find out who u really are. Just like saf. Tat's how they track prank mails to nkf etc.<br><br>Anyway my advise is put down ur anger and start findig and thinking what is happening.</div>

But how many actually does that? How many did you see? As far as I see there isn't more than 5% around me that I noe of. More likely is that the entire cell group are buying together. That is more common. Believe it or not up to u.<br><br>Perhaps its the facts and the look at it superficially make every assume in another situation. BUt I think never assume confirm.<br><br>And regarding her talent I think She sang very well. Her voice is really good. And her song is nice. Other than that I'm not commenting. If you think her talent is not good, I think its ur preference.<br><br>Regarding the sue. I think Sky_drew is sayign it for the reasons of reminding you ppl. Remember the previous case, where few ppl said aobut the church on newspaper. The fact is ( this is the real truth) THe person is not sued. the church was toking him eventaully he decided to apologies willingly. And till today I believe his still in this church. She reserve the rights to sue if what u said had cause idemnity damages unto her. For instance slander cause ppl to believe that she really force ppl to buy her cd etc etc and its not true, u can be sued. Not by her probably, I think the person more wanting to sue u is her record company in order to preserved her commercial value. And u think u can escape? Government has a great ways to find out who u really are. Just like saf. Tat's how they track prank mails to nkf etc.<br><br>Anyway my advise is put down ur anger and start findig and thinking what is happening.</div></blockquote>seems tat u r pushing the blame 2 the cell groups nw... so b4 u try 2 straight things out here with us... y don u spend ur time taking care of the cell grps first... cos it nw seems tat nt onli 1 person heard tat ppl in CHC r pressurised 2 buy the albums but quite a number of ppl heard tat... there could b some truth in it...</div>

I think in this world cd sales has nothign to do with ur background and martial status. Its weird asking this. duh... Talent to u she may not haf but not to others. People might like her singing. Just as the whites dun like durian, does that means u wouldn't like durian? Ridiculous stand. And btw I think her voice is great. My questions is that like many of stars like such in the western countries even in asia they too are married etc etc and yet they are accepted by ppl. He yao Sun is not the first and difinitely not the only one, why is it not possible ppl would buy her cd? You buy the cd for the song, admiration of singer etc? or her protrayed innocent background?<br><br>2: I think it might be the packaging and probably determined by the record company. BUt in my point of view she is still the same to my understanding. And what has this contributed to u in disagreeing with her being a artist? Hmmm... try something more solid perhaps. So what has a change if there really is so, got to do with her record sales, her church etc??? Is repackaging assuming personal style is just ur preference, is repackaging not an option?<br><br>3: Then how about you proving that the church had bought a substatial amount of cd which causes her to get no. 1 ranking. If you read my previous posting you should understand. To get her in no.1 ranking not only in singapore but also taiwan and etc. It is illogical, not-economical and definitely mathematically very hard to achieve. Just explaining how it is possible before you ask this question again. So in conclusion her getting no.1 by her church's effort is difinitely not substantial. Pls explain to me how is it possible that my shear numerical is the church able to bring her top 1 even in asian and taiwan esp with the consideration of the mix in the church.<br><br>Finally, u can relax I dun think anyone would sued just as i had said so many times. The company reserve the rights to do so but he may not. And it is possible btw. Try pick up legal books and read. I studied little law before.<br><br>Anyway finally I think what she did had helped more ppl through her sales and etc (pls read my previous postings) than those that rant mindlessly in this channel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do u know why music companies won't sign up <strong>new</strong> singers tat were old, ugly, doesn't have great voice and married ?<br><br>Firstly, if u r old, u have a limited time before u retired. If the recording companies spend a lot of money to bring up a star who can only work for less than 10 years, it is not worth it. And the truth about entertainment is young women r more attractive. Can u deny tis fact ?<br><br>If u notice in entertainment, idols tend to remain unmarried, or secretly married. When it is an established fact tat they had married, their fans lose interest and their popularity drops. Tat is why newcomers to show, music and modeling business r single. They need a 'momentum' to moltivate people to support them.  Can u dispute tat fact ?<br><br>About her voice, u say it is great. True, better than normal folks like u and me. But is there any character or style in her singing ? Since she is in the entertainment world she had to be compared to professional singers. Can she beat them ? I believe if her songs were given to other singers they can sing equally well, if not better.<br><br>To SoliDeoGloriaGal, don't u find them suspicious ? Why will she get a chance to be signed up ? Everything happened for a reason. Recording companies aren't nitwits.<br><br><blockquote>I think it might be the packaging and probably determined by the record company.

Is repackaging assuming personal style is just ur preference, is repackaging not an option? </blockquote>For point 2, in short she is acting cute. If u r 30 and act like 20, u r acting cute. Since she doesn't behave like tis before her album cutting days, she is proven to act cute. If u r mature, act mature ! Don't pretend to be like anime female character faking a voice everytime she talks. Tat makes people sick. Tat explains why people don't like her.<br><br><blockquote>3: Then how about you proving that the church had bought a substatial amount of cd which causes her to get no. 1 ranking.

To get her in no.1 ranking not only in singapore but also taiwan and etc. It is illogical, not-economical and definitely mathematically very hard to achieve. </blockquote>Why do u refuse to divulge out the figures I given to u previously ? It is a common knowledge tat u people bought in SoooOOoo much CDs tat make us feel u all had lost all sense of logic and economic. People r seen snatching 10 over CDs at on go and pay for it. People r seen distributing her CDs free to their friends. Can u deny tat ? Do u think tat is logical and economical ?<br><br>U guys buy a lot of her CDs, tat is true. Whether if it is a substantial amount, u cannot say until u have the figures in your hands. From wat we see, u guys had at least boosted the sales by 20-30%.<br><br>City Harvest is influence is not in SIngapore only. It has links in australia, taiwan, indonesia, malaysia india and US etc. ANd there r already 6 churches in india, 4 in indo, 1 in KL. If the taiwan counterpart r as crazy as singapore ones, tat will be a great booster for her sales<br><br></div>
