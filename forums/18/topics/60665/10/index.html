            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If all the members during the christmas party is true, and if all money gather from the members contribute only and only to the General and Building Funds ( I believe there is a further tilthe and donations funds + donations to charity which was not included), then on average each person actually contributed $120 per month. From the statistic, only 53% are salaried members. Thus one can expect that this portion of people had to contribute much more money to counter the additonal young children and old folks. Pardon me for saying, tat is nearly about 10% of the total income they earn.<br></blockquote>53% means? salaried members which I believed his toking about full time working adulted if you read the entire passage. He is catarising that that way. I'm wonderign why is this still a argueable subject. Unless the person is trying simply to twist and pick on the language. 10 % hmmm. Christians around the world recognised the understanding of the word in giving tithe it is not only in chc( giving of 10% of what ur gross earning). But is a practiced adopted by ALL Christians, Catolics and Judalism. WHereas muslim give 3%. But most other churchs only around 10-30% of the members practices that but that doesn't mean the bible doesn't have it. Many ppl like to use this subject to debate but Let's that a look. If you think chc building itself is grand yea that becoz its grand in a different piloshophycal region like asia. If you look at other countries esp western countries, these would never had happened. Churches are one of the grandest buildings in the world. It is one of the riches architecture in the ancient world and represents changes in trends for many centuries. For instance the dome shape architecture. But why issit so different between western countries  and middle east compared to asian ( excluding korea and japan)? Is the biblical teaching different? Simply not. Or the bias and perjudice of the people? More likely is the thinking of ppl. Beside the tithe which is coincide with the word. THe building funds are encouraged but not compulsory or anyhow? ( you may still say its peer pressure, pls lah if you think its not right in giving money away, you think just by peer pressure you would doing it?) Whereas the cds. Just by peer presure??? Well I think I had never seen anyone in chc doing that buying 10s of cds for her out of peer pressure simply becoz there isn't so many ppl willing to do that. No peer where got pressure? You seen it? why not report it? If you managed to find them that an entire cg buying 10s of cds, then I believe you? I'll willing to put my life on it tok is cheap.  Especailly in 3 album striaght. I did bought something for my fren but its a chinese bible for my chinese frens. But hmmm??? a cd with secular songs? is the evangelistic value there? Perhaps you should show me the figures where most chc member buys the cd. (Stop argueing why it is possible etc etc and all the assumption in the world. Find me prove, evidence and ppl who does that!)<br><br>This is question 1<br><br>Question 2.<br><blockquote>I am saying before she start to cut album.

I think u should understand the church has nothing to do with him apologising lor by reading the website. I think u guys think too much conspiracy liao. He said he leave the church and never returned. If that's the case why don't he report police he got threatened? WHy issit another church pastor advised him to apologies etc etc. And since you believed so much why don't you report police and dismantle the church??? Don't tell me ur can't etc etc , its none of your biz. Do you noe you can sue the church as cult church or what etc etc. Read the case on the person who sued CCC as a cult church. THey won. You can do it one. Trying doing it if you got such solid prove. ANd relax the church wun sue u in return one.<br><br>Third question<br>You all had yet to ans me with all the figures on who issit possible for her to be top one with her church alone as support.<br>You mentioned  averagely one person pay 10% which is $120 each cd $20 which is aroud 6 and 6 x 13000 (not 17000 coz tat easter svc alone many new comers are here, the regular core member attendance is only around 12000++ let's say 13000 x 6. only 78000 cds. Hmm still not enuff leh. Perhaps tat's only enuff for Singapore but how about asia? Taiwan? hmmm. Care to enlighten me? And somemore this is the 'IDEAL' situation. But in true fact u think everyone pays 10% of their gross pay in addtion to 10% of tithe for 10 cds to be given away? Who is the pastor to them? Further more only 90% of the members tithe faithfully? IS she above God???<br><br>Questions four<br>About the wedev ask about what cgl and your gf??? Firstly I don't understand what it is secondly Its not I quote one. WHy ask me?<br><br><blockquote><br>To big bird<br><br>Lets assume she really did put in all her profit into charity since u guys believe in it so much.<br><br>First, why don't u people donate the money to the charity directly then ? Does the record companies throw in their profit for charity ? I don't think so and they r the ones that earned the biggest profit. Charity will get more if u donate directly isn't it ? For $100 profit from CD, $80 or more go to record comapnies, admin and managerial staff, song writers, lyrics fillers, music players and producer. If u guys r so kind and buy the CD just for charity, I think u should start reflecting on your own action and start thinking whether r u being economical on tis.<br><br>People r after different things. Some go for money, some go for power, some go for fame. And she don't need any much money in the first place since she is living rather comfortably now. I have asked tis question before. Wat cars r the 2 driving now ? Wat r the size of their house ? Can anyone answer me on tat ?<br><br>And regarding to issue about whether will normal people donate the money from their work to charity. My answer is no. However I find those stars tat worked hard and use their own hands to carve out a niche themselves r more admirable than someone tat made use of her special status and religion to fulfil some ambitions of hers. I like a star more for being frank into telling people he spent the money on buying a big white elephant then one tat claims she put all her earnings into charity. Whether she really put it inside charity doesn't matter. The mere fact tat she publicises tis statement is bad enough. To me tat is nothing more than a publicity stunt. Tis is especially so when she was too overrated and act like a goody goody two shoes.<br><br>So u wanna repeat sending tat same reply again ?</blockquote>Firstly about this its not really about the money issue. It is important but it is secondly. It's about her evangelistic concert. Hmmm already there are many ppl saved while her husband preach in her concert in many countries like hong kong and taiwan. Try evagelising and preach openly in china and see if its possible with the prosecution. Now try with her singing. THe chinese government is more welcome that she enter into the china world thru singing. Explain if you can denial the effect of that. Maybe you would argue why should she mix both singing and Christianity together? But why not? Who forbided it? the bible or the law? And to your questions why she publised tat, actually she didn't, neither the record company. But its her husband and only to the church. so let's get the facts right before slandering.<br><br>Gtg busy now post again next time.</div>

He is catarising that that way. I'm wonderign why is this still a argueable subject. Unless the person is trying simply to twist and pick on the language. 10 % hmmm. Christians around the world recognised the understanding of the word in giving tithe it is not only in chc( giving of 10% of what ur gross earning). But is a practiced adopted by ALL Christians, Catolics and Judalism. WHereas muslim give 3%. But most other churchs only around 10-30% of the members practices that but that doesn't mean the bible doesn't have it. Many ppl like to use this subject to debate but Let's that a look. If you think chc building itself is grand yea that becoz its grand in a different piloshophycal region like asia. If you look at other countries esp western countries, these would never had happened. Churches are one of the grandest buildings in the world. It is one of the riches architecture in the ancient world and represents changes in trends for many centuries. For instance the dome shape architecture. But why issit so different between western countries and middle east compared to asian ( excluding korea and japan)? Is the biblical teaching different? Simply not. Or the bias and perjudice of the people? More likely is the thinking of ppl. Beside the tithe which is coincide with the word. THe building funds are encouraged but not compulsory or anyhow? ( you may still say its peer pressure, pls lah if you think its not right in giving money away, you think just by peer pressure you would doing it?) Whereas the cds. Just by peer presure??? Well I think I had never seen anyone in chc doing that buying 10s of cds for her out of peer pressure simply becoz there isn't so many ppl willing to do that. No peer where got pressure? You seen it? why not report it? If you managed to find them that an entire cg buying 10s of cds, then I believe you? I'll willing to put my life on it tok is cheap. Especailly in 3 album striaght. I did bought something for my fren but its a chinese bible for my chinese frens. But hmmm??? a cd with secular songs? is the evangelistic value there?

This was already mentioned during the building funds which sepreated the "working adult' and "Students". Its just like u picking up any piece of bone of the ground and think it has some prehistoric values. The english is simple and it has no other meaning.

U have 10 bucks u have to pay $3 bucks for your meal, and u had a option of paying another $3 bucks for a magazine. Does that means U paying $3 bucks for the meal u'll definitely pay $3 for the magazine. Totally illogical rite? 10% tithe is a requirement if you decided faithfully to obey God. but the cd??? Its not a must to buy cd if you pay tithe even u can do that. U r assuming everyone does that in an ideal situation where they have no life they just live on tithe and cds. Well wake up.

Picking only little insignificant things that can't prove much. Just as if you are so confident of what u said thru proving in the real "arena". You had nothign to lose if truth is on ur side. Most anti-chc ppl have common characteristic (i seen alot) They are affected by something or wat the church does through it may not be wrong, but that they disagree much. In fact most of them doesn't really enuff first hand encounter with the church itself but thru a second hand understanding ( in fact more than 90% of what they noe of the church are rumours and myth, for instance saying chc force ppl to pay tithe buy cds etc, Well I was nvr forced yet). Some their feelings are caused by the influence of peers. And just dislike becoz they think its the norms and trends and for the sake of doing so. I think perhaps in a court room you may prove more beneficial if u holds the truth.

By the time the 3rd albums comes due to the overwhelming results the record company had printed more. I heard once for the second album is 45000 - 60000. The thrid album definitelly is much more. It hadn't include overseas, this  is just singaproe alone. That is assuming EVERYONE buys then we could get 78% as u said. Check the statistic again pls. Let's say its only 100000 and the total gross sales is 1.8 million. Hmmm I wonder how the company survive after paying the singer, retailer, frieght, copyrights, product etc etc + productions cost. Even if the company has many such Singers and record but.... this is pathetic. I remembered once I watch this taiwanese tv program. Singers who are top in Taiwan actually have records sales of near to a million. Even lesser it can never be 100000.<br><br><blockquote><br>.....if this is the way CHC functions...i ask it to be closed down la. God doesnt need this kind of fame and pomp, cross spinning church and watever things made by human hands.<br><br>on behalf of them i apologies to all of you.<br><br>btw i'm not fr CHC...<br></blockquote>Well yea I agree so. If chc is really so, I would have left the church too. If the church is functioning by brainwashing ppl, forcing ppl to buy cd and teaching the wrong doctrine of God and does all things for just the glory and fame of the pastor, I too ask God to close it down, if not let it shine brighter for Christ.<br><br>Finally in conclusion, I think the main reasons why some ppl detest HYS so much if becoz of the affiliation with the church etc etc. If not she would be just antoher singer.</div>
