            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]<br><br><strong>Seriously I dun really noes the detail but anyway something that I do know is that she never preached in service, she only sing. In the church there's quite a number of pastor that doesn't preach but does in position to admistrate. For instance in the army not all colonel lead men to battle, there are those that does other areas of work. Pastor is just a name just as not all prist in vatican are minister. Some does duties and the same goes in Protestant churches. Anyway for further details on this try mailing the church for answer.</strong><br><br>seriously i don care wat kind of pastor she is... but she has openly denied tat she is NOT a pastor... so now i am asking you is tat why is CHC website stating that she is one - regardless of wat kind of pastor she is...<br><br><strong>Hmmm.... Yea as if she use the name pastor would bring in more cd sales and less of your mindless arguement. Secondly Do you haf the figures of ppl who does like her? I think a larger portion of singapore are in a neutral stand having nothing for or against her even as other religion or free thinker. For instance in this topic we can see alot of ppl are holding quite neutral comments secondly alot of ppl just view and didn't care much perhaps only u are the most hardcore anti-chc.<br><br>So what if she is still associated with CHC? I think even if she is associated with PAP, SAF, PUB, CTE, PIE, ORD or even ERP. She had help so many needy throught the profit of her cds, the mentally challenged, elderly, disabled, proverty, children, orphan, bring hope and getting soul saved to Christ. What had you done for the past years of your life crawling in this planet?</strong><br><br>she saying here that using the name of pastor if it will bring in more money... in one of ur replies u typr out below... u stated that the reason y most of u guys buy the cd is cos she is a pastor of the church... isn't tat obvious... most of u guys r nt buying cos she has talent.. but cos she is a pastor in ur church...<br><br>try counting the number of ppl who r netural n the number of ppl who r replying actively in this thread i think u r mistaken... basically the ppl supporting CHC and HYS r ALL CHC members... and the numbers are so little... whereas the number of ppl who r anti-HYS i can openly say is more... compared to the number of ppl supporting HYS...<br><br>y she can do so much charity work? did she do any? did she do it in the name of HYS or in the name of CHC... all of us have done charity in our life... even calling NKF to donate money i think it is already charity... and i can proudly say that everytime i call at least 5 calls to NKF alone... nt considering the other sums of donation i made to the public... annoymously... by donating all proceeds of her sales to charity and announcing it openly... i think she is a hypocrite... juz to get ppl to notice her... if she is a sincere giver... she would have gave it without making it a big hoo-ha...<br><br><strong>??? When did I say that CHC CGLS would have noe your gf blah...blah...blah??? Pls check the posting again. Perhaps you can repaste it for a clearly picture. I really do not understand what you're getting at?</strong><br><br>regarding this... pls read my reply above...<br><br><strong>But if this is so your arguement is invalid as there isn't more than half the cgs in chc that buy the cds as a whole for all three album. So far I see. Most of us bought for the same reasons that is to be supportive becoz she is our pastor. Secondly, her song is nice, professionally done, her effort and the song bring hope. Thirdly for the just cause, coz thru her and becoz of her fames she managed to penetrated into Taiwan Hong kong and china where ppl would come for her concert and as she sing her husband preach which in effect many ppl would turn their life to Jesus (not to chc as they are rooted to local church have no direct control by our church.) It is a Just cause that all christians should appreciate. And believe me while ur typing ur mindless sense, she is somewhere singing in evangelistic concert bring new hopes to ppl who never heard of Jesus. In comparision the nobility of what u r doing is futile.  Such thing is not the first time done by secular singers. It's been tried by foreign singers too and only a pathetic few Singaporeans would detest it so much out of ignorance and jelousy.<br><br>And you said your not against Christainity but yet ur against the teaching of Christianity. hmmmm Ironical.</strong><br><br>out of jealousy n ignorance? y shd i be jealous of her? being a hypocrite and living a life of hypocrite? let's face it... most of the time she would be proberly working out on her new album n deciding wat kind of skimpy dress 2 wear then later say "oh i am forced 2 wear it"... n i repeat again... as a free-thinker... i respect all religion... yes including christianity... however... i am against CHC on hw they r spreading it... and hw they r representing themselves with christ... it makes me wanna puke... hypocrites...</div>
