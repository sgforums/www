And if she doesn't, they threaten to quit the church.<br><br>Last week, The Sunday Times received a letter which suggested that if she wishes to pursue her singing career, she should step down officially from the church 'to avoid bringing more shame' to City Harvest.<br><br>The letter writers added: 'We are embarrassed to attend City Harvest and are seriously considering attending another church if Pastor Ho continues to add more controversy.'<br><br>A 33-year-old chemist, who wanted to be known only as Mrs Leong, said she attends the church with her family. 'I find it very disturbing that the church plays her music videos before the services. My two children attend the children's church and they have been told to pray for her. I'm uncomfortable that kids are being asked to do that, and especially now, when she says she's not a pastor.'<br><br>But Rev Kong, 39, said he would 'never force my members to support her singing career against their will'.<br><br>He added: 'We can't please everyone and people do vote with their feet. So, if there is a philosophical difference in our world view and the way we do things in City Harvest, they would leave.<br><br>'What's good is that we have 400-over wonderful churches to choose from in Singapore, and they should settle into a church that they feel comfortable in.'<br><br>He also tried to clear up the confusion over his wife's status.<br><br>The Taiwanese media had stopped calling her 'pastor singer' because in Taiwan, a pastor is a pulpit preacher and marriage solemniser. As she does not perform these duties, she is strictly speaking, not a pastor, as she had told The New Paper.<br><br>But that does not stop the church from calling her a 'pastor' in the broader sense of the word, to recognise her contributions.<br><br>Widely credited as her mentor and image consultant, Rev Kong sees no contradiction between his wife's church work and singing career.<br><br>'There are a lot of pastors with part- time secular careers. Even the great Apostle Paul of the Bible was a tent-maker.'<br><br>He said that his wife is using her songs to bring joy and hope to people and brushes off criticism that show business will compromise her values and integrity.<br><br>Citing actor Denzel Washington and actress Dyan Cannon as examples, he said: 'There are many good, strong Christians who are working in Hollywood today as producers, directors, singers, actors and actresses.'<br><br>Denying any suggestions that his wife runs rings around him, he said: 'There is nothing that happens to Sun that I am not aware of. We are very close mentally, emotionally and spiritually.'</blockquote>Did you all read the ST article today? I feel that the CHC side never gave a good defense and their stand was poorly argued.<br><br>First, the Lucy Liu analogy was a poor one. Lucy is not our typical Asian and she doesn't have such a strong connection (I believe) to the religion. Obviously no one call Lucy Pastor Liu right? Should someone cite them the famous Celest Chong example?<br><br>To me, she's representing many christians. It's how some non-believers see the religion too. No doubt many see the gay bishop example, they shake head. Why the religion, which is proclaiming itself to be the Truth, is like that? And do not forget Sun is representing the biggest church? in Singapore, not some ulu church located in some ulu place whose ulu members have little influence over people.<br><br>Wah .. 15,000 members threaten to quit? That's news to me.<br><br>However, I do agree that if CHC people feel uncomfortable, they should leave. No point not leaving and making a din in the church by firing email/complaint. But I guess it's hard if you have many friends there.<br><br>Then there's a part ... <span style="font-style: italic;">"sees no contradiction between his wife's church work and singing career". </span>But earlier ... <span style="font-style: italic;"> "As she does not perform these duties, she is strictly speaking, not a pastor, as she had told The New Paper". </span> I think there's a contradiction of some sort. May I know what is her church work? Isn't it music director and not pulpit preacher? Or do we call any music director in any church pastor too?<br><br>Of course, there's the point about woman not ordained to be pastor. I believe many christians with proper understanding of Scripture will agree with me, but of course there're some who don't.<br><br>But the most laughable part is the analogy of Paul being a tent maker. Since that's a secular career, we can conclude the bible allows pastor with secular career. Haha, but whereas Paul preached in the bible (preach day and night, super long one also have), does Sun preach? I guess the answer is evident, for she deny it herself.[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i totally agree with you... let mi say my 2cents worth of comment...<br><br>1) Lucy Liu never uses her religion to make her famous... more of her attitude... whereas HYS uses her status as a poastor to shoot her to fame...<br><br>2) Ask any teenager to wear the same red dress to one of the service n see wat happen... most likely u will be asked to go home by the church... so as the co-founder y is HYS nt practicing wat the church preaches?<br><br>3) Fine... if she denied she is a pastor... then i wld rather CHC changes the position of her from pastor to music director... wld nt tat clear up more misunderstandings?<br><br>4) Yea... there are letters to encourage her to wear more revealing dresses and make singapore proud... most likely those r sent by CHC members or those CHEE KO PEI uncles who will do anything to see mroe stars wear lesser n lesser... personally i don see that she is doing singapore proud... cos watever awards she win... she don thank singapore whereas she contributes all the effort to the church... she ever sang national song for singapore? NO! everything she does... she say church... more likely she trying to gain more support for her church...<br><br>5) i can't believe that a pastor will juz ask the members to live... don he has any shame? after asking the members to poll in so much money to build a building... pls... i heard that they r trying to raise money to buy the land now... in previous read... i remember tat Poon hesitated to leave the church cos he "contributed too umuch money to the church alreadi"... so do u think the 15000 members will leave? of cos not!<br><br>6) As i can see tat pastor HO is choosing his wife over the church... which i think is wrong...<br><br>7) To compare herself with the Great Apostle Paul.. who she think she is? she is nt even a pastor! Paul went through alot to be finally names the Great Apostle... wat did she do? oh yea... she had to force herself to sing to alot of people... forced to wear revealing dresses... forced to earn alot of money only for it to be donated to charity... wow... wat great "sacrifices"...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Yes there are many christians in hollywood but none i had seen used their status as a christians to get to hollywood... HYS is a first to use her status as a "pastor" to get into the music scene...<br><br>haiz... first time type so long... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think why people make a big hoo haa out of that "slinky Armani dress" is also because people are taught in her church not to dress like that. If she's not the one preaching, then lets just say that she's not practicing what her husband teaches.<br><br>Playing her MTVs before her church is also not justified! She's not even singing hymns or christian songs! She sings pop songs just like any pop artist! So what is the church trying to prove by playing her MTV in church? Itz basically just free advertisement.<br><br>Why people don't like her is not because of her religion. We don't like her because she uses her church as a stepping stone for her career. Because of her fame in her church, which has a big congregation, she already is a step ahead. And she blatantly exploits that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know, if her cd can be allowed to be sold in a church, i think local churches perhaps can consider leasing out spaces for CD Rama or Sambawang Music or Music Junction to open their outlets in the church.<br><br>Why should i be able to find her CD there and not Sun Yanzi's Cd? They both sing love ballads and stuff of the same genre.<br><br>Food for thought! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But if they treat the money as investment, then it's a different story. It's like asking them to willingly give up their stakes on the church. I suspect some donated so much that they own at least a brick inside? No?<br><br>Anyway, I feel it's quite pointless if they suffer silently in the church, facing the MTV and ad and CDs and coercion from CGLs. This might affect their relationship with God.</div>
