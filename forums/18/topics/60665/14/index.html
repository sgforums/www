            <div class='col-md body'>Unknowingly HYS has broken the religious harmony in Singapore. Because of her actions and onscreen charisma (or lack of), she has unintentionally attracted Singaporeans attention to the lavishly contructed CHC and has raised the question of monetary gains and humility in a religous organisation.<br><br>Just a week ago my immediate family had a vigorous discussion on religions after seeing HYS on the Sunday Times. The discussion ended by breaking the taboo and spilling the foul-points of christianity which we preferred not to mention in the past. Evidently it is also present here in this very forum and many others as well where accusations have directly been hurled against the christian belief, all of which stemmed from CHC and HYS.<br><br>She is singlehandedly causing an upset in the delicate religious balance that the govt has strived so hard to achieve all these years. If more controversy is to be spawned from her, it could be possible that Singapore might be headed towards religiously biased society with the non-christian society's unhappiness gradually escalating.<br><br>There might even be a day where the ISA might pay her a visit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We live in a capitalist society today. The threat of materialism creeping into the Church is very real today. The Devil will resort to all trickery to drag God's children down with him into the lake of sulphur. Hence, all Christians, must at all times, be discerning. The sheep must be polarised from the big bad wolf - in other words, Christians must behave and think differently from non-Christians. Sometimes, the way we are brought up and nurtured is soaked in the ethos of the world, and therefore subconsciously the beliefs of the world get embedded within us. Self examination is indispensable. He Yao Sun and the City Harvest Church have been controversial, and unnecessarily so. We must all seek to eradicate all roots of depravity..... but this must be done out of unadulterated love for God and the advancement of His Kingdom.</div>

Now, what if some christian children rebuke their parents using that example? Do you agree that parents are all sinners?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">... and if u think that by saying all these on the forum, will lead to HYS to " so call "improve" upon ur views here are again pretty far fetched....</span><br><br>I think my views are not original. Some, I suspect, were voiced to her in those complaint letters.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">but wat i tried to say here was just who are we to understand so much of her "stardom" stint and some criticism might be uncalled for.....</span><br><br>I agree that some criticism might be uncalled for.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The issue of Ho Yeow Sun ought to be discussed rigorously within the Christian circle. It will only be constructive and productive if Christians get together and reach a conclusion before making a collective stand to the public, if that is possible.<br><br>Essentially, Ho Yeow Sun has displeased Christians because of the decisions she has made as well as the manner in which City Harvest Church supports her actions. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being a celebrity - singer, actress, etc - but she left her calling as a pastor to engage in a job that has caused much disapproval from the masses.<br><br>That only serves to reflect badly on her. She has become a stumbling block to others and she must be made to see her errors. May the Lord correct the thinking of the City Harvest Church and Ho Yeow Sun. They are increasingly worldly and thus, un-Christian.</div>

WOW! Think the pastor will have to throw 10,000 every week to reach that amount, and then to explain the "asia wide", this church would have to import lots from oversea to push their charts to the top? WOW!! Good imagination.. so much so for a person like u to post this remarkable post HeRE. heh heh...</div>
