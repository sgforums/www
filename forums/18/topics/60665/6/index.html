            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Do u know why music companies won't sign up new singers tat were old, ugly, doesn't have great voice and married ?<br><br>Firstly, if u r old, u have a limited time before u retired. If the recording companies spend a lot of money to bring up a star who can only work for less than 10 years, it is not worth it. And the truth about entertainment is young women r more attractive. Can u deny tis fact ?<br><br>If u notice in entertainment, idols tend to remain unmarried, or secretly married. When it is an established fact tat they had married, their fans lose interest and their popularity drops. Tat is why newcomers to show, music and modeling business r single. They need a 'momentum' to moltivate people to support them. Can u dispute tat fact ?<br><br>About her voice, u say it is great. True, better than normal folks like u and me. But is there any character or style in her singing ? Since she is in the entertainment world she had to be compared to professional singers. Can she beat them ? I believe if her songs were given to other singers they can sing equally well, if not better.<br><br>To SoliDeoGloriaGal, don't u find them suspicious ? Why will she get a chance to be signed up ? Everything happened for a reason. Recording companies aren't nitwits.<br><br></blockquote>FIrstly I wan to say I think she has a nice voice which the record company believes in. Perhaps that the main reason she was sign up for. Like I said from previous posting pls read. Such case as married singers joined the music industry and even divorce ones is not uncommon. In fact it is very common. Why don't you start discussing hwy they managed to succeed? And about her voice I think its u that doesn't agree with it. Since she started her christian debut, she is already been recognised not by Christians but by music industry. Unless your opinion is much more well sought after than them, else I dun see your qualified to comment.<br><br><blockquote>For point 2, in short she is acting cute. If u r 30 and act like 20, u r acting cute. Since she doesn't behave like tis before her album cutting days, she is proven to act cute. If u r mature, act mature ! Don't pretend to be like anime female character faking a voice everytime she talks. Tat makes people sick. Tat explains why people don't like her.<br></blockquote>Here you say she act cute. Personally I think from the first album she is like that and also her personality is actually quite sincere. I think this question is about personal preference. No one has the right to stop you in what u like, just like you have no rights to influence over what other would prefer.<br><br><blockquote><br>Why do u refuse to divulge out the figures I given to u previously ? It is a common knowledge tat u people bought in SoooOOoo much CDs tat make us feel u all had lost all sense of logic and economic. People r seen snatching 10 over CDs at on go and pay for it. People r seen distributing her CDs free to their friends. Can u deny tat ? Do u think tat is logical and economical ?<br></blockquote>Hmmm how about coming to the church and find out how many actually so rich to pay for 10 over CDs and distribute to frens? 10 over CDs cost at least $180 would u pay for it? This is absurd. Even if there is such ppl, Imagine 3 album getting top 1 in ranking? U expecting everyone consistantly supporting all 3 album? Would u? Perphaps your ideal of the church is all kana voodoo. And the ideal of getting ppl from oversea to buy ur cd when they arent' even ur church member is even more absurd. CHC may be affliated to oversea but their numbers is in the hundreds per church do you think they buying 30s of cds? Or hundreds? U expect me to quote the figure, and u can't quote the figure urself to support your stand for arguement. I think you should make ppl believe what u think is fact by providing evidence. I'm here trying to answer your questions not proving your notion.<br><br><blockquote><br>as for your GF incident, if your GF has not attended CHC, how would our CGLs know her ? is it logical<br><br>like wat i said... nt attending CHC doesn't mean tat i don noe any CGLs... u failed 2 answer the question above...<br><br>More likely is that the entire cell group are buying together. That is more common. Believe it or not up to u.<br><br>you say buy 4 the entire cell group... let us have an example... 20 ppl in the cell group... 10 buy... the other 10 will definately feel the pressure to buy...<br></blockquote>Don't quite understand what u trying to say? Know her???<br>And what I mean by entire cell group is buying is really out of support. Peer pressure is a potential thing its not tangible. Just as your frens smoke and you smoke. Try sueing the tobacco coy for that.</div>

[/b]</blockquote>Seriously I dun really noes the detail but anyway something that I do know is that she never preached in service, she only sing. In the church there's quite a number of pastor that doesn't preach but does in position to admistrate. For instance in the army not all colonel lead men to battle, there are those that does other areas of work. Pastor is just a name just as not all prist in vatican are minister. Some does duties and the same goes in Protestant churches. Anyway for further details on this try mailing the church for answer.<br><br><blockquote>) due 2 more n more ppl started 2 doubt her talent... n more ppl who dislike her... she wanted 2 pull away from her status as a pastor... so tat watever she does... will nt affect the church... but onli reflect on herself... but this will nt be possible... as wat sky_dew state from above... all proceeds from her album sales goes to charity... so no matter wat she does... she is still associated with CHC...<br></blockquote>Hmmm.... Yea as if she use the name pastor would bring in more cd sales and less of your mindless arguement. Secondly Do you haf the figures of ppl who does like her? I think a larger portion of singapore are in a neutral stand having nothing for or against her even as other religion or free thinker. For instance in this topic we can see alot of ppl are holding quite neutral comments secondly alot of ppl just view and didn't care much perhaps only u are the most hardcore anti-chc.<br><br>So what if she is still associated with CHC? I think even if she is associated with PAP, SAF, PUB, CTE, PIE, ORD or even ERP. She had help so many needy throught the profit of her cds, the mentally challenged, elderly, disabled, proverty, children, orphan, bring hope and getting soul saved to Christ. What had you done for the past years of your life crawling in this planet?<br><blockquote><br>in case u r wondering... in previous replies... u stated that there was no way that CHC CGLs would have known my gf since she is nt in CHC... wat i am tryin' 2 say was 4 a good social circle... 1 wld have friends from all kinds of religion, occupations n races... by restricting ur social circle 2 only church goers... i think u r pretty pathetic... i think u r also hinting that CGLs onli noe ppl from CHC... i think they r more pathetic... n self-centered...<br></blockquote>??? When did I say that CHC CGLS would have noe your gf blah...blah...blah??? Pls check the posting again. Perhaps you can repaste it for a clearly picture. I really do not understand what you're getting at?<br><br><blockquote><br>Regarding 2 peer pressure... wat i mean is when more than half of the CG r buying the CDs then the remaining ppl will definately feel the pressure 2 buy the CDs too... definately... if most of my friends smoke n i hang out wif them often then i think most likely i will also smoke... cos in some ways i wld have been a passive smoker already...<br></blockquote>But if this is so your arguement is invalid as there isn't more than half the cgs in chc that buy the cds as a whole for all three album. So far I see. Most of us bought for the same reasons that is to be supportive becoz she is our pastor. Secondly, her song is nice, professionally done, her effort and the song bring hope. Thirdly for the just cause, coz thru her and becoz of her fames she managed to penetrated into Taiwan Hong kong and china where ppl would come for her concert and as she sing her husband preach which in effect many ppl would turn their life to Jesus (not to chc as they are rooted to local church have no direct control by our church.) It is a Just cause that all christians should appreciate. And believe me while ur typing ur mindless sense, she is somewhere singing in evangelistic concert bring new hopes to ppl who never heard of Jesus. In comparision the nobility of what u r doing is futile.  Such thing is not the first time done by secular singers. It's been tried by foreign singers too and only a pathetic few Singaporeans would detest it so much out of ignorance and jelousy.<br><br>And you said your not against Christainity but yet ur against the teaching of Christianity. hmmmm Ironical.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for being late in replying. I am back now<br><br><blockquote><br>FIrstly I wan to say I think she has a nice voice which the record company believes in. Perhaps that the main reason she was sign up for. Like I said from previous posting pls read. Such case as married singers joined the music industry and even divorce ones is not uncommon. In fact it is very common. Why don't you start discussing hwy they managed to succeed? And about her voice I think its u that doesn't agree with it. Since she started her christian debut, she is already been recognised not by Christians but by music industry. Unless your opinion is much more well sought after than them, else I dun see your qualified to comment. </blockquote>In other words from above, u r trying to say tat her voice is so good, so special compared to the singer and other young potential singers tat the record company go against many written rules such as age and martial status in recruiting her ? If u really believe so, then I have nothing to say but the truth is out there.<br><br>BTW, Can u name me a chinese female singer tat is married, 30+  when she JUST join the entertainment industry ?  I do not mean stars tat were married or watever after they get famous. U say it is common, who actually does tat ?<br><br>I am not going to mention about her voice here or look here since u will readily say she is the prettiest thing on earth or have the voice of an angel. The truth is out there. Compared her with new stars like xiao xiao, jolin, sun yan zi, melody etc<br><br>http://www.geocities.com/hypermusic01/yaoshanswl.html<br><br>I found tis website tat comment on her singing. They r not professional reviewers, but they r opinion from the public.<br><br><blockquote>Here you say she act cute. Personally I think <strong>from the first </strong>album she is like that and also her personality is actually quite sincere. I think this question is about personal preference. No one has the right to stop you in what u like, just like you have no rights to influence over what other would prefer. </blockquote>I am saying <strong>before</strong> she start to cut album. Why does everyone seems to avoid trying to comment her behavior before the first album ?<br><br><blockquote>Hmmm how about coming to the church and find out how many actually so rich to pay for 10 over CDs and distribute to frens? 10 over CDs cost at least $180 would u pay for it? This is absurd. Even if there is such ppl, Imagine 3 album getting top 1 in ranking? U expecting everyone consistantly supporting all 3 album? Would u? Perphaps your ideal of the church is all kana voodoo. And the ideal of getting ppl from oversea to buy ur cd when they arent' even ur church member is even more absurd. CHC may be affliated to oversea but their numbers is in the hundreds per church do you think they buying 30s of cds? Or hundreds? U expect me to quote the figure, and u can't quote the figure urself to support your stand for arguement. I think you should make ppl believe what u think is fact by providing evidence. I'm here trying to answer your questions not proving your notion. </blockquote>U think paying for $180 for 10 CDs is absurb ? Let me tell u something more absurb<br><br>I have done some calculations over the figures at the website. I used the figure gathered from 2002 Annual General &amp; Building (25.9 million) Fund Income and divide by the attendance at Christmas 2002 (17971) and tis is wat I gathered<br><br>If all the members during the christmas party is true, and if all money gather from the members contribute <strong>only and only</strong> to the General and Building Funds ( I believe there is a further tilthe and donations funds + donations to charity which was not included), then on average each person actually contributed <strong>$120 per month</strong>. From the statistic, <strong>only 53% </strong>are salaried members. Thus one can expect that this portion of people had to contribute much more money to counter the additonal young children and old folks. Pardon me for saying, tat is nearly about 10% of the total income they earn.<br><br>And here u r complaining tat u guys won't be so stupid to pay $180 just to buy 10 CDs. She just came up with 3 CDs for these 2 years. For these 2 years average out each person already paid $2880 just for the General and Building Funds. Wat makes u think they won't pay $180 per album for Sun ?<br><br>Second, for the 2002 album Sun with Love, she manage to sell 100,000. Now in 2002, the people in City Harvest is already about 18,000. If everyone <span style="font-style: italic;">just bought 1</span>, tat is already 18% of the sales volume. And tat is total figure for the whole world. But r u sure u guys just bought 1 CD per album per person ? Com'on the average CD bought per person is higher bah !<br><br>Look at this website for more interesting article. One can see a Mr Poon already buying 5 CD at one go.<br><br><blockquote><br>Mr Poon, who has been attending City Harvest for six years, alleged that he was 'encouraged' by his cell group leader to buy both of her albums, and so he bought five of each at one go.</blockquote>http://www.religionnewsblog.com/archives/00002017.html<br><br>In the end somone (secret secret) pay $33,372.06 for public apology fees. I don't know wat u guys did to him at tat time though... (was it suing ?)<br><br><blockquote>Together with Mr Chew, Mr Poon drafted the apology last Wednesday night, got it <strong>vetted by City Harvest's lawyers </strong>last Thursday and submitted it for publication the same day.</blockquote>http://www.religionnewsblog.com/archives/00002148.html<br><br>From above link. Need more evidence ? After reading tis, u guys wanna victimised Poon again ? Want him to write another public apology tat need to be vetted by City Harvest lawyers ? Or u wanna to sue me or sgforums ?</div>
