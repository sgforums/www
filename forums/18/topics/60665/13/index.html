            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by weidev:</div><div class="quote_body">i totally agree with you... let mi say my 2cents worth of comment...<br></div></blockquote>Was expecting someone would start another uproar in forums after the article here I am again.  I think weidev again is here to release his perjudice detest of her HYS. Hmmm Everyone tat reads this can see how much hatred he had gather in himself. Abit Zhou huo lu mo. But all his arguement is very easily to rebuke if everyone reads easily. He is based on most of what he thinks. Assumption. Believes in what was passing around. Rumours? or perhaps here says. These information are often incomplete. But once I had shown the evidence his debates is invalid. Nevertheless I'm here not to go against him but through his arguement I try to explain things to many other ppl out there reading. I guess it should be the answers that most ppl would wan to noe.<br><br><blockquote>1) Lucy Liu never uses her religion to make her famous... more of her attitude... whereas HYS uses her status as a poastor to shoot her to fame...</blockquote>Hmmm lucy liu??? Wat about her? And issit tat she used her pastor name to shoot her to fame? hmmm I think u can only find such analogy in SIngapore and not anywhere else. Rather the fact is that in taiwan ppl attend her evangelisitc concert becoz she is a singer and her fame and not becoz she is pastor.<br><br><blockquote>2) Ask any teenager to wear the same red dress to one of the service n see wat happen... most likely u will be asked to go home by the church... so as the co-founder y is HYS nt practicing wat the church preaches?</blockquote>??? Issit true? I think that red dress is quite conservative oreadi and not much was reveal. U try wearing it to the svc if u got kick out. I'll treat u a meal at pizza hut. Seen newcomers who wear spegetti strap etc to church and did not get kick its strange u get all the information where I as a member could not. Perhaps u should try going hollywood. I think that red dress u see on newspaper is the most conservative. What else u expect? Pants? Long Seleeve? Hat? how bout a veil? I think we are christians btw not muslim.<br><br><blockquote>3) Fine... if she denied she is a pastor... then i wld rather CHC changes the position of her from pastor to music director... wld nt tat clear up more misunderstandings?<br></blockquote>Perhaps u should try to find out what really happens before u comment. She said that for the understanding of the taiwanese. Coz most ppl see that she does not do or fit in the category of pastor in what she do. She looks more like a counsellor in the taiwanese understanding. Btw the statement is made to the taiwanese media not Singapore. But she had never deniel she is not a pastor either by her self or by the church in Singapore. Try understanding the whole passage rather than a statement. Anyway that is released by the church itself.<br><br><blockquote>4) Yea... there are letters to encourage her to wear more revealing dresses and make singapore proud... most likely those r sent by CHC members or those CHEE KO PEI uncles who will do anything to see mroe stars wear lesser n lesser... personally i don see that she is doing singapore proud... cos watever awards she win... she don thank singapore whereas she contributes all the effort to the church... she ever sang national song for singapore? NO! everything she does... she say church... more likely she trying to gain more support for her church...<br></blockquote>This is so funny coz the things u used to debate is rediculous sometime. Chee ko pei??? Btw she does not contribute the effort to the church also leh. She contributes it all to Jesus. Btw wat has singing national song got to do wif it??? Very very week arguement. BTW she didn't say church but Jesus. pls get things clear.<br><br><blockquote>5) i can't believe that a pastor will juz ask the members to live... don he has any shame? after asking the members to poll in so much money to build a building... pls... i heard that they r trying to raise money to buy the land now... in previous read... i remember tat Poon hesitated to leave the church cos he "contributed too umuch money to the church alreadi"... so do u think the 15000 members will leave? of cos not!<br></blockquote>????? Why leave? Thru the report everyone still thinks entire chc ppl hated the crossover etc etc??? All I can say is why dun to take a trip down to chc for once a couple of weeks. All of us support her more than anything. You may think we being brainwashed. Hmm but u mean 15000 of them ALL?? Tat's interesting it's about 1 in every 200 ppl in Singapore get brainwashed. How powerful it must be. In chc members are just like u and me every ordinary folks with flesh blood and brains and not zombies. There are the brains of the nation also the common folks or mentally disabled. There are rich ppl also poor ppl, students adult etc from all different walks of life. ON the street they look just the same as anyone except that they are fervent for God. I find ur arguement very intersting. How come no one argued about the church paying so much money helping ppl locally and oversea??? And those that always argued against the church are those misers that doesn't donate a single cent when the flag boy comes.<br><br><blockquote>6) As i can see tat pastor HO is choosing his wife over the church... which i think is wrong...<br></blockquote>Who is pst ho??? U mean pst kong? I think the correct mentality is that as a Christian should choose God above all including his church and wife. What is the church then?<br><br><blockquote>7) To compare herself with the Great Apostle Paul.. who she think she is? she is nt even a pastor! Paul went through alot to be finally names the Great Apostle... wat did she do? oh yea... she had to force herself to sing to alot of people... forced to wear revealing dresses... forced to earn alot of money only for it to be donated to charity... wow... wat great "sacrifices"...</blockquote>Now u accept tat she is not a pastor? I tot u keep arguing that she is a pastor tat claim she is nto??? Kaoz... U are very contradicting leh. Can focus on where u argue or not. U r not very solid in ur beliefs lor. Full of loop holes and weak arguement which I had so easily over turned for the past few weeks. Dun use loop holes, languages or twisting to argue your point try like me use facts and evidence. When is she forced??? She loves to sing and she had been singing? Be I think in this world with ppl like u, any singers would be forced to sing if not there's a reason. Put urself in her shose if you r u and theres many ppl like u would u feel like going on?  Secondly the wearing thing is that her clothes is sponsered by the company and that's the msot conservative of them all. I wonder why still arguing sia? U really expect her to wear veil to hollywood? It's a option that she have no others with the amplified of the media. Try to understand her than babbling. U'll find the answer.<br><br><blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Yes there are many christians in hollywood but none i had seen used their status as a christians to get to hollywood... HYS is a first to use her status as a "pastor" to get into the music scene...<br></blockquote>There is a few I can name one. She is Robbie Hafuse (Wrong spelling) SHe used to be from the SOlid Gold series which is older than u and me.  There's a few more. Mel Gilson?  He actually pay to shoot a JEsus movie btw. This is not common esp during the 60s now the world changes its harder becoz there's less christians believers.<br><br>Finally from all we know, Singapore is the only place where there are these few ppl that keeps ranting over this and tat. Its ok anyway she and pst kong is in taiwan creating an positive uproar revival among the churches there in only the past one month of crusade. More than 40000 ppl are saved thru her revival concert, ppl are coming not knowing of Christ first but her. And thru her singing and preaching many give their hearts to Jesus. And churches and ppl and fans are much more supportive than our very own Singapore. I think the effort of these little ppl are too futile to foil anything.God will judge.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi qwerty24, seems that you are defensive of hys and chc, however noticed that you never made a defence against my article posted on page 18 of this thread, mind givng your comments?<br><br><br>1.During the period of her album launching, my cgl called me as asked,' how many cds you buying?'. he did not ask are you buying but how many? so it is obvious that people are buying more than one. when i ask why you want to know, he said the pastor want to know.<br><br>2.There was once a campaign to aid needly children. All you need to do to play a part is to buy her album( the more the better, since its for charity), and chc staff will send those album to the children home. there are of cause ppl who again buy more than one( afterall, its for the children isn't it?) during one service, the pastor reported that the children were delighted to receive her cds and were greatly blessed by her songs, there's even pictures as evidents. but my thoughts is, of cause those children are delighted, they will accept any presents, afterall, its free, but i believe they will be happier to receive other things like toys, books etc, it will be more useful anyway. but wait!!! why do those children living in the same children home need a CD each?? weird weird.. i doubt they have a cd player each. so in the campaign, all the children gained was a cd that they will prob. forget in a few weeks time, but hys's cd sale got a massive boost, in the name of charity..<br><br>3.during the period of her cd launching, you can see her promotion posters all over the church compound, her mtv, concert and variety show video clips and even advertisement on TVs all over the church. there will be people stationed at the lobby holding baskets of her cds, urging people to buy. and of course, the cgls.. for your convienence, they will call you up, helpfully arranging to get the cds for you. nothing wrong you may think, yes, nothing wrong, if we are talking about business. but in this case, the cgl's influence would have cause people who are reluctant or undecided to just buy to please him/her. (similar to new insurance agents trying to call up relatives and friends to sell policy, people who experienced will know its pressurising and often very hard to reject these agents)<br><br>4.during service, some time is given to show her mtv and other video clips, and the pastor will talk about her new album, urging people to support her etc. Once in a statement given by the CHC board of 'something', they clarified that the reason why her clips are shown during service is because hyw is a well-loved and respected leader of the church, the members will want to know updates about her.. ok, fair enough.... but why only during her album promotion period? what is the purpose?<br><br>What good does it do to God's work by buying her cd?<br>Hys's singing career is often stressed to be doing God's work. to use secular music to reach out to non-christians, therefore members are urged to support her and buy her cd... think about it, as christians, chc members buying her cd... what good does it do? so what if she sells 20k albums in singapore? does that help in evangelising? ultimately, its christians who are buying up her cds, so what's the point?<br><br>Hys doing God's work?<br>Rom 12.2<br>Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will know what God wants you to do, and you will know how good and pleasing and perfect his will really is. (NLT)<br><br>2 Cor 10:3-5<br>We are human, but we don't wage war with human plans and methods. We use God's mighty weapons, not mere worldly weapons, to knock down the Devil's strongholds. With these weapons we break down every proud argument that keeps people from knowing God. With these weapons we conquer their rebellious ideas, and we teach them to obey Christ.(NLT)<br><br>So.. is God suddenly so desperate that he now uses secular music to win souls into his kingdom? CHC people argued that she's not the only one, where are others too. well these verses apply to those people as well.<br><br>Tithing<br>I know its irrelevant, but since it was mentioned in previous postings, let me share my two cent worth.<br><br>1.Tithing is biblical, it is 10 percent of your income, afterall, the word tithe means 1/10. Most, if not all churches practice tithing. Members are encouraged and should be encouraged to tithe.<br><br>2.However, tithing is not a must. CHC never force people to tithe, but pressure. definately. why?<br>A-if you started tithing and suddenly for one mth you did not tithe, your cgl will talk to you or call you and ask,' have you given your tithe?'( obviously he know you didn't, if not why he won't ask you anyway)<br><br>B-I once gave half my tithe to a non-chc christian mission organisation. my cgl knowing that my income is stable and should be similar to previous month, rang and asked me if i had withheld my tithe. i said i gave to another org and he replied that its good to give to other christian org, but the tithe must be in the house of God, i must tithe to chc. that's so self-centred. as if chc is the only church, as if the centre-focus of God is chc. after arguing 'but this but that.. he said everything needs money, the building, nice cosy environment etc... so much for total dependency on God.<br><br>C-during chc service, everyone receives an offering envelope. to give tithe, you write down your particular and amount you tithe, reason? so that you can be issued a receipt. why? so that you know that the church has received your tithe. sounds innocent? look at point A and B.&gt;<br><br>thanks.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you. And I have things to add on. This post is mainly addressed to <strong>qwerty</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1) the Lucy Liu analogy was quoted by ur beloved Paster Kong</span><br>I somehow think that there's a danger in using analogy with hollywood people. We know the showbiz industry is full of scandalous news like divorce, shotgun marriage, one night stand?(unproven though) etc. I'm not sure about Lucy Liu's character, but if Pastor Kong used the example of someone with very bad lifestyle, and said "no-one battled eyelid with her dress", then it won't be a good analogy.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">2) wa tat red dress conservative ah? then to you scantily dress to u is underwear onli lar? </span><br>I think querty's definition of conservative and the usage need some explanation. From her reply, I can question, if that one called conservative, then how does Sun dress in church everytime? Don't tell me that's her minimal standard in church?!<br><br>And querty's example of sphagetti strap, which is laughable. How can you compare that with Sun's fantastic dress?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">3) okay... by wat u say... so to the taiwanese she is a counsellor to singaporeans she is a pastor... to the rest of the world she is a singer</span><br>I think they're trying to play with words, and the argument they present resembles one of the fallacy of shifting the goalpost. And by their dubious usage of 'Pastor', I think they commited the fallacy of equivocation as well.<br><br>Singapore and Taiwan, their mentality of Pastor can't be that different. A pastor, as agreed by most people, christians or unbelievers, is still someone who preach.<br><br>Qwerty, what is your view on the biblical injunction that women should not be pastor?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">u Mei Jing, Dreamz FM, Evelyn Tan... all had a share in singing NATIONAL SONGS... nt national anthem hor... so wat did HYS </span><br>Hmmm, when will they invite Stella to sing national song during NDP ah? Aiyah, maybe HYS will get her chance la, can't stand them repeating SYZ also.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">15000 ppl who wan to leave... but some of the 15000 members... </span><br>Yup, and I apologize too, for I made the same mistake  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">so did god allow woman to dress scantily? i don think so... tat's wat HYS did...</span><br>I think it's incorrect to say God allow or disallow someone to dress scantily. To say that will imply we're living under the Law. I think it's her freedom to do what she wants. As with many other controversial actions, the consequences will be bore by us human.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">PASTER KONG agreed with her... so tat's wat god wan?</span><br>They're making it easier for some people (a few in this forum) to commit spiritual adultery.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">7) even whether she is a pastor anot... i don think she is even FIT to be compared with GREAT APOSTLE PAUL</span><br>Exactly. She's not even a pastor in the strictest sense, not to mention an Apostle.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">if she is after fame... she will nt refuse the red dress</span><br>Perhaps she's really more liberal with clothes than us, but did she know that she'll stir up more controversy this way? Or does she simply want more attention? Typical showbiz mindset.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">they juz don wan to mess up christinity faith further after wat she had done to disgrace the christian community</span><br>I won't go as far to say she has disgraced the christian community, but it certainly is not good testimony to unbelievers.<br><br>I think it's fair to say there're many things in this world that put unbelievers off. Ask some of your friends why they don't want to believe in Christ. I bet bad testimony is one of the reasons. Compare a congregation with people blabbering in tongues and girls wearing scanty clothes (approved by church somemore) ... with Buddhist/Taoist believers praying in temple, with our muslim brethens praying peacefully in a mosque, with our Jewish friends worshipping in a synagogue. Ironical, isn't it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ha ha!  it's really quite interesting to read the "arguements" of the */* supporters.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The way they argue make no sense at all.  Maybe only to themselves?<br><br>Probably because they have all been brainwashed?<br>They have been so brainwashed that they part with their $$$ willingly.  So they don't really feel "forced" to do it.  That's why they say they bought all those crap willingly.<br><br>Anyway, maybe their supporters are mostly in the late teens and young adults 'cos they are easier to brainwash?  these people are quite vulnerable and peer pressure can make them do really funny things.  Of course if they are too young, then they got no money.  And if they are too old, they would be richer, but then probably harder to brainwash.  But still can be done lah, everyday got aunties and uncles cheated with "magic rocks"<br><br>Anyway, unless they can be de-barinwashed, it is probably quite pointless to argue with them.  They are too plugged in the Matrix.  And they probably rather believe in the Matrix.  But they know that something is wrong, but they choose to ignore it.  But when someone tries to prick them awake, they launch vigorous attacks and ominous threats of lawsuits to chase them away so that they can continue sleeping.  zzzzzzzzzz.  And it's quite hard to de-brainwash people.  I don't think it can be done over online foums.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

So when someone kills your pet dog, you cannot even criticise him and say "you bad!" ... for you yourself at least kill an ant in your lifetime.
