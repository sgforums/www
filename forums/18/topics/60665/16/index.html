But a Christian must be the salt and light of the earth. If leaving your post as a pastor will cause so much commotion, then what you are doing is certainly not worth it. Everything - every single thing - that we do is to glorify God. CHC has distorted Christianity and affected many, both believers and non-believers.<br><br>Yes, it may be your calling from God to be a singer. But why will God wants you to be a singer that causes so much unneccesary controversy?  Why do we keep hearing stories about CHC forcing its members to buy Ho Yeow Sun's albums etc? All these tales are distressing.<br><br>I personally have no idea who Michael W Smith is -  but let me ask you a simple question. Does he get into the hot soup like Ho Yeow Sun is?</div>

Sadly, to truly discuss about Ho Yeow Sun, the theme of religion is unavoidable. Maybe there are other parties who simply wish to view her as a secular singer but personally I perceive this as one of Christian implications.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally i think that Christianity is becoming<br>more of a cult den a religion,esp CHC.<br>i dun agreed the way the religion is taught there,<br>as if they r the shepherd &amp; those who believe in<br>others religions or non-believer as Lamb.<br>(it's like they r higher lifeform &amp; the rest r like shit)<br>Being a pastor isn't a disgrace thing,why did she deny it ?<br>Wonder who force her to wear that Dress.(God ?)<br>Spreading Love &amp; God...only she knows her own intention.<br>Hope her fans bought her Albums cause they like the songs,<br>not because of their belief...CHC...God.<br>Whether u'r forced to buy or not,only u urself know.<br>is she was spreading God Love,msg through her songs.<br>(i can't seem to find any God msg in the songs anyway ?)<br>it's really a miracle that her albums surpass 5566 &amp; become the<br>best seller.(i'm no fans of 5566 but it sure a miracle)<br>u can't hide somethings for long nowsday,even if so...<br>The Truth bound to reveal someday &amp; if all the rumours were True,<br>it will shatter the belief &amp; the image of the church,<br>as for the followers who follow blindly,they will suffer the most<br>as everything became a lie.<br><br></div>
