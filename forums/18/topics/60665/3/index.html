            <div class='col-md body'>i know of a very devoted christian, who has dedicated his life to christianity. He believes very much that whatever he has now he is thankful to God for it. I respect him very much for that.<br><br><strong>BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT BEING A CHRISTIAN ISN'T ABOUT GOING TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY, OR WHICH CHURCH YOU GO.</strong><br><br>its about your relationship with God, and whether you have him in your heart. Not bcos you wear it on your face and going around telling ppl you are a christian and go to so-and-so church.<br><br>I'm not saying everyone who goes to City Harvest are there bcos they wanna be seen as ppl with status. There are of cos ppl there who attend church bcos they want to be closer to God, and not bcos they want to be seen going to church.<br><br>and i quote my fren though i forgot his exact words, a quote from the bible...<br><br>"And many shall come before me during judgement and shout "Lord! Lord!" but i shall reply them "Who are you? I do not know you.""<br><br>...simply bcos they are only a christian by name... but not by faith.</div>

Kong did not force any members to buy any of Ms. Ho's alburm. nor is any members of CHC pressured into buying her CDs, if any of your friends are force by their cellgroup leaders, please approach your friends to send a email to CHC attention the email to Pst Derek who is a board member in CHC.<br><br>as for the rest, you CAN dont like Rev. Ho but if the comments are too cutting or damaging, do u know tat you are liable in law for comments made here and she reserve the right to sue for damage.<br><br>thirdly, her ranking in CD shops are not CHC's main concern, althought we wish for the best that she may top the chart like her previous 2 alburm, the church management did not in anyway FORCE any members or congration into going to the stores to purchase. Members purchase the alburms on their own accord. like i say u can send a email to CHC if u are forced by anyone in the chc management to purchase Rev. Ho's third alburm.<br><br>and as for the person that made the comment " force your gf and you to break up " , my understanding is that Rev. Ho did not approach you or your GF to make such a statement. either you or your GF is approached by the cellgroup leaders in charge of your GF and her job is just to console and provide options for her and you. the final choice still lies in your hands .<br><br>on a lighter note, how would you feel if someone made similar comments about you? if you hate that, dont you feel that Rev. Ho will feel the same way too ?<br><br></div>
