            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm, I'm here to give my views on most of your postings.<br><br>Let's look at the matter maturely.<br>I think if let say that you critise a singer due to her style and the way he/her expressing herself I think regarding this topic there is no right or wrong answer. No one has the right to say whether's soemone's preference is right or wrong. That is agreeable.<br><br>But I guess that most of the people against He Yao Sun is becoz of her religion. Most of the people discuss her with her religion together. One of the point that being pointed out is that regarding a non-christian and christian should not be together. Answer is basically that is the rule, its like something like you marrying a muslim you have to convert into being a muslim take it or leave it kind of thing. You can take it or leave it suck thumb. You have a right to disagree with it but I think you still have to respect other people's belief just like buddist who just eat vegetable and muslim that does not eat pork.<br><br>I also see that some people thinks that why she got number one is becoz her church is supporting. BUt in fact you'll realise that in her concert most of the people attending are not from her church or even non christian in comparision in fact she is more popular oversea, the number of sales in her cd is far greater compared to the total number of church member. (I noe most people would say this is wrong etc etc, i think if you believe it so there's no point urguing becoz there's nothing aginst you you would believe.) And the church itself includes a number of elderly, mentally challenged, children, foriegner in singapore, adults and youth. So the number actually bought in fact is much lower.<br><br>There's also a myth that the church are forcing people to buy the CD but if it is so I guess it would be sue. I admit i in the church and there had be promotion going on but during my stay I only bought one CD willingly out of respect for her + support and that is only her first album. I yet to be forced to buy any.<br><br>Some people may disagree that she use her singing to promote her religion. I dun see why. In fact such ways of promoting christianity is been done by quite a few secular singer in the western counties. Its only the first in Asia excluding Japan. Her singing and what she done had indeed impacted people from all over the world from turning towards Christianity people who never heard of Jesus could hear of her song which penetrate with the interest for God is a just cause in Christianity context. Her sales and profit and singing had benefitted not only people who are hope deprived but also the needy and community services who needed the money badly. What had those people who are ranting about what she does benefitted a single individual in this world? None.<br><br>Some may disapprove of what the church itself. And as far as I can see that the doctrine coincide with that of all mainstream christianity around the world. Approved by church counsel Singapore. It is also in close relationship with various famous churches around the world. He yao sun's singing is approved by them too. For Instance, hillsongs church, Sydney Christian City CHurch, Ulf Elkman, and many others key people in today's Christian world. In basic doctrine it is just the same as the church in your neighbourhood. Bible "the rule" that is followed by chc or all mainstream christians. So perhaps you are disapproving with Christianity and not chc alone.<br><br>"ppl from diff religion also live happily after they married wat.. both my parents are of diff religion... similarly... both her parents also have diff religion..." Regards to this there are buddist in name that eat meat too or muslim that eat pork. Only the faitful one and true believer would keep to their faith. And by the way if they are married in the first place then it wouldn't be right to divorce for this reason.<br><br>"i been wondering.. the bible says one shall not have any idol except him... its one of the ten commandment. so what does it means by being an idol?? wierd huh.. " Idolatry that means taking anything else in replace for God. Let's say if the singer is like a God itself in someone's heart where u would worship him/her in every way everyday etc etc then that's idolatry. I dun see that supporting someone, acceptance of his/her talent and enjoying of his/her art as a form of idolatry. Or else we should be idolising toothbrush, coz most of us been brushing everyday and believing in its effect.<br><br>I think also let's look at the matter in a mature manner, I think turn cd of artist is childish. If's like a preference if you coke on ur big gulp then press the button dun see you sticking straws into the outlet if you detest it. Imagine the effort an artist it had given. Not just on He yao sun but all others.<br><br>"on a heavier note... if u wan 2 make comments about me... go ahead... if it is nt true... i will set the records straight... if it is true... then i will keep my mouth shut... basically if i have done nthing wrong... i am nt afraid of ppl toking behind my back... cos i have a clear conscious... thanks..." I assume you would look at facts then... and not discriminating against anyone or any church.<br><br>MOst pople had many misconception of many things even of those outside this topic. My only solution is dun assume or hear from heresay but COnfirm if not sure then dun comment.<br><br>You may think I'm a cult follower too. Come On lah let's be sensible.

            <div class='col-md body'>Tis is interesting<br><br>First, if u guys wanna sue me, then sue me lah ! I never expect u guys to be like some political parties tat threathen to sue to silent the opposition. Tis is a forum, it is suppose to be an area of free speech. If u read through the replies, u will find tat there is a lot of people tat are anti Sun, it is a good time to reflect why is tis the case. Just a reminder, if u sue, u r gonna make Sun look bad in press. Suing people just because of comments on her sales and involvement in church etc. As a famous (or infamous) person, people r bound to talk about her. She doesn't complain why u complain ? So wat else u gonna do ? Hit me at the road etc yah ? Wanna start be a terrorist yah ?<br><br>Second, they of course won't force people to buy the CDs. They cannot impose any forcing in the first place as they r not law enforcers too. But the peer pressure is there. Just ask around. For the 3 albums she came out, how many City Harvest people actually buy more than 1 CD each ? Wat is the benefit of buying more than 1 CD of the same album ?<br><br>Overseas there are a lot of singers tat were christian. But they r there because they r talented. Sun is not young, doesn't have a fantastic voice and probably doesn't write good songs too. Out there, the record companies can find TONS of people tat had more commercial value than she. Why does she get chosen ? The only reason most thought of is tat she has strong connections with the church. Even if she really doesn' think tis way, the record company does.<br><br><blockquote>Some people may disagree that she use her singing to promote her religion. I dun see why.

What had those people who are ranting about what she does benefitted a single individual in this world? None. </blockquote>Anyway when she talk about her religion in her songs, tat have an effect on fellow Christian to buy her CDs. To support her is like supporting their group, supporting their religion. Tat is why her sales get boosted so much even at overseas. Isn't tat making use of religion to generate money out too ?<br><br>Finally, she try to act cute. Think about tis yourself. Before she comes out with album and after she came out with album, do u think there seems to be a switch of character ? She used to be more mature then, now she try to act like an "idol", a young idol which isn't suitable for her age. I don't know about u but tat sounds yucky to me.</div>

Not for your case though, since 45 % of your members were already adults 30 and above. I bet most of u probably never buy much CDs from other singers.<br><br>Second, thanks for admitting tat your group does bought a lot of her CDs. I guess a lot of people here r just puzzled why does her album sell ? Frankly I don't remember any songs from her. A simple logic most came up with is tat their church members BOUGHT so much CDs tat they actually manage to put her on top of the sale chart, which I guess is sort of true now. Especially since 45 % of members r 30 years and above and got much more spending power.<br><br>Third, in forums, those with reason wins.
