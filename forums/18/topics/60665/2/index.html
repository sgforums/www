            <div class='col-md body'>I think u r misleaded... Don't let the word Free thinker be taken literally. Free thinker doesn't mean he go for free give aways nor does they believe everybody has have liberty, nor they r more liberal in thinking etc. Free Thinker just means he doesn't believe in any religion. If u want it to be politically correct, then lets just say we have no religion.<br><br>Wat is a religion ? Religion should be the intense belief of some supernatural beings tat really existed and some supernatural incidents tat had really occured in the past.<br><br>Free thinker is not a religion. How can one say if one don't believe in any religion, tat can be counted as a religion (sounds funny ). He does has his own set of belief, but could not be counted as a religion right  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  All scientist believe in science, r they practising the religion called science ?<br><br>I did always try to persuade people to drop their religion :p I am guilty of tat truly... but it is just tat I can't help thinking why r people so foolish into doing things, believing in things tat doesn't sounds logically correct ? Can one be really sure tat there wasn't any illogical things in the bible or some holy text ?<br><br>Lets treat it tis way. There r a lot of supernatural being we don't believe in. Example Santa Claus, Indian Gods, Chinese Gods etc. The difference between Free thinker and Christian, Catholic watever, is just tat Free thinker believe in one less God than them. And tat God is the God tat Christainity describe in <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Don't get too tense or defensive huh. U wanna be serious go to political site bah. At Lub Sub Bar, people should try to be Lub Sub Beng bah. Don't disturb the blasting of He Yao Sun.

When she was talking about unhappy incidents, make them sounds real silly or absurb, something u will never face yourself as a free thinker. In the end of speech just prompt a question regarding the many doubts in the bible (why is God so cruel to kill so many people to satisfy his ego etc). Just ask as though u r interested in christainity, not as though u r against. (though u r against :p)<br><br>If u wanna maintain both your beliefs then I guess better break up now.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess why ppl dun like her its because she is crossing the boundaries from a religious person, to trying to be a star in her own rights.  The understanding of religion and media must not mix is very much set into our asian mindset. If you want to be a star you cannot attain to be religious. Unfortunately, she is trying to break that asian mindset. She made a few mistakes while trying to win over the crowd.<br><br>Firstly, she tries to be young and trendy. She wants to be seen as a person who is in with the times. She dressed herself in clothes not fitting her age, not to mention her trying not to act her age. It really puts the general public off. Maturity  is something she should portray as a good example.<br><br>Quite a few ppl people knew that she had a few miscarriages from overworking herself. Sympathy votes from her church is high because of that the members feel that she is a committed pastor and gone beyond the call of duty. But of course those young members don't have the maturity to think clearly. They only know that their parents failed them and someone who is willing to sacrifice for them is good enough. So they support her in whatever she does. God on the otherhand do not expect us to make such a sacrifice because the sacrifice is already made by Jesus for all mankind. This kind of believe system is very occultic in practice which unfortunately crept into the church system. It emotionally charged ppl who are sold into this manner of thinking. These category of ppl are usally from broken homes or latchkey children.<br><br>Thirdly, ppl cannot stand her making use of her influence in church to sell her cds. Already they didn't dare reveal how much they'r paid by the church when interviewed by Newpaper let alone the actual earning from the profits they stand to gain from selling her cd.<br><br>My conclusion is that they should've raised someone young from the congregation to advance his or her music career instead of herself. That'll even make her a greater leader isn't it? Hope that more youg ppl start to save for their future rather than supporting a person whom they don't really know.</div>
