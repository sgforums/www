            <div class='col-md body'>About the issue of whether women r suitable for pastor, here is my 2 cents worth<br><br>I didn't go and read the website given by icemoon, however I guess it is common knowledge tat the bible was already written in a pro-male manner. I believe for some studies people say tat the word woman appears only once in the whole bible. Hence it is not difficult for me to believe just by strictly reading, taking the meaning literally from the bible, the conclusion will arrive tat a woman cannot be a pastor.<br><br>And if the bible says so, then the pastor or pope or whoever <strong>human</strong> cannot change tat fact, even if "God" has given them a 'calling' etc. Why not ? I just give an example. Osama and Abu Bashir receive a calling from 'God' to start a jihad too, thus does tat means they r right ? Tis doesn't meant any offence to muslim, my point is tat if people can start using "calling" as a reason, then I can do anything under the sun, like murder and rape, and in the end point the finger to God claiming "I receive a calling for me to do it". Tat will be taining the name of Him isn't it ?<br><br>Human aren't design like God. They aren't perfect and there will always be abusers. Thus religiously speaking, people had to follow strictly to the bible. People can only argue on the interpretation of the bible, and not about changing the content in the bible.<br><br>Wat ? U feel something is wrong here ? U don't agree with teachings there ?  U don't agree with me ? U don't agree with the website ?<br><br>Heh... tell u, the problem is not solely on the reader of the bible, since we r designed inperfect and understanding of the bible will remains inpefect. Part of the blame should be on the writer of the bible itself.<br><br>Nuff said... I try to stop being an "anti evangelist" before I got bombarded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by stupidissmart:<br><strong>About the issue of whether women r suitable for pastor, here is my 2 cents worth<br><br>I didn't go and read the website given by icemoon, however I guess it is common knowledge tat the bible was already written in a pro-male manner. I believe for some studies people say tat the word woman appears only once in the whole bible. Hence it is not difficult for me to believe just by strictly reading, taking the meaning literally from the bible, the conclusion will arrive tat a woman cannot be a pastor.<br><br>And if the bible says so, then the pastor or pope or whoever [b]human</strong> cannot change tat fact, even if "God" has given them a 'calling' etc. Why not ? I just give an example. Osama and Abu Bashir receive a calling from 'God' to start a jihad too, thus does tat means they r right ? Tis doesn't meant any offence to muslim, my point is tat if people can start using "calling" as a reason, then I can do anything under the sun, like murder and rape, and in the end point the finger to God claiming "I receive a calling for me to do it". Tat will be taining the name of Him isn't it ?<br><br>Human aren't design like God. They aren't perfect and there will always be abusers. Thus religiously speaking, people had to follow strictly to the bible. People can only argue on the interpretation of the bible, and not about changing the content in the bible.<br><br>Wat ? U feel something is wrong here ? U don't agree with teachings there ?  U don't agree with me ? U don't agree with the website ?<br><br>Heh... tell u, the problem is not solely on the reader of the bible, since we r designed inperfect and understanding of the bible will remains inpefect. Part of the blame should be on the writer of the bible itself.<br><br>Nuff said... I try to stop being an "anti evangelist" before I got bombarded. [/b]</blockquote>Interesting.... v. interesting....... what is anti evangelist? why? Why? WHY?<br><br>So why woman cannot be a paster? must be a pester?</div>
