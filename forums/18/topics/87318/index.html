            <div class='col-md body'>They make the final 20 list to The New Paper New Face contest - thanks to their assets<br><br>By Eri Akbar<br>eri@sph.com.sg<br><br>THEY look good.<br><br>But they know it takes more than a pretty face to beat the competition.<br><br>Twenty girls were shortlisted after an audition at Velvet Underground on Saturday .<br><br>Four of them talk about the assets (and not just physical ones) they say they are blessed with.<br><br>Leg up<br><br>Surya Sundaram spends her free time playing basketball, and her long legs have served her well on as well as off the court.<br><br>The 16-year-old girl said animatedly: 'Even a long skirt looks really short on me.'<br><br>She can certainly put her legs to good use at this contest.<br><br>She said: 'I joined New Face because it really looks fun and it's not sleazy at all.<br><br>'It's also a great opportunity for me to meet people and gain experience.'<br><br>Surya, who's originally from Mumbai, is learning Mandarin in school. 'I'm sure China needs lots of buildings in future,' said Surya, who wants to become an architect.<br><br>She says she is artistic and conjures up images on canvas.<br><br>She took physics and advanced maths in Australian International School, so that she could be one step closer to her ambition.<br><br>Surya, who moved here over a year ago, said: 'I see myself having a job, a family and taking care of my parents.'<br><br>This is one girl who knows her priorities, and that means no boys at this stage.<br><br>Toothy charm<br><br>Another shortlisted contestant who knows where she's heading is 20-year-old Rosliana Rosli.<br><br>She's training to become a Silkair stewardess.<br><br>Her best asset - her boyfriend told her so - is her smile, which could very well make the jaws of her future flight passengers drop.<br><br>What makes her smile unique is a prominent vampire-like incisor.<br><br>Rosliana grinned: 'All my family members have two (of those sharp-edged teeth).<br><br>'I'm half-lucky with one.'<br><br>Maybe it could be her lucky charm.<br><br>Rosliana, who has modelled for Malay wedding magazines, hopes to gain 'exposure' from New Face and realise her dream of becoming a singer one day.<br><br>The sporting girl even broke into Britney Spears' Everytime tune when requested.<br><br>Upfront appeal<br><br>Mass communication student Joanna Jean Chen, 17, is surprisingly well-endowed for a young Asian girl.<br><br>On her 34C statistic, she said with a chuckle: 'This is not my asset. It's my family asset.'<br><br>She thanks her mum, who's Eurasian of North Indian, American, Irish and Chinese descent, for the 'gift'.<br><br>Joanna is used to getting stares at chest level - not only from guys, mind you, but also from girls.<br><br>She doesn't have a problem with that but her boyfriend might.<br><br>'It's usually the people with me who are uncomfortable with the stares. My boyfriend says if anybody tries anything funny, he'll kena (Malay for get it),' she said.<br><br>Joanna can fill out a lot of clothes nicely, but it may be a little tough finding her a perfect fit in a dress.<br><br>When trying on dresses during shopping trips, she said they tend to turn out 'tight at the bust and ride up' in the rear.<br><br>But she's not banking on her asset to give her a win.<br><br>Joanna, who wants to work in events management in future, said: 'Having big boobs doesn't mean you'll win in a competition. If you've a dull personality, you won't be an attractive person.'<br><br>Apart from being a movie and book buff, Joanna is quite the thrill seeker and her escapades would be 'illegal to print'.<br><br>But what she can tell you is that she's dying to try skydiving.<br><br>Eye for beauty<br><br>Passion for music keeps shortlisted contestant Stephanie Ang going.<br><br>The 16-year-old girl, born to a Bruneian-Chinese dad and an English-Indian mum, looks like a cross between former MTV video jockeys Nadya Hutagalung and Sonia Couling.<br><br>She does aspire to become like them. She wants to interview her idol, Nick Valensi, the guitarist from The Strokes.<br><br>There's little doubt the United World College student, who has been living here since four, would look good in front of the camera.<br><br>Stephanie, who's 'just dating', is pretty vain about her eyebrows and makes sure they are immaculately-groomed at all times.<br><br>She said: 'I used to look like a nerd with triangular eyebrows. I even read beauty books to learn how to trim them.'<br><br>Apart from her grooming skills, Stephanie can also converse in French and Mandarin.<br><br>They strutted their stuff and got in<br><br>FROM over 1,000 girls who signed up for The New Paper New Face contest this year, some 200 were selected and went through an all-day audition at Velvet Underground.
