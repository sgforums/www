            <div class='col-md body'>Help me lose my virginity, not me ok...lol<br><br>US woman asks magazine<br>SHE has a degree, she's funny and she's not a bad looker.<br>NP, 25 August 2006<br><br>SHE has a degree, she's funny and she's not a bad looker.<br><br>So what has driven 29-year-old Sarah DiMuro to get a magazine to help 'sell' her virginity?<br><br>The Catholic-raised Rhode Island native explained: 'Recently, I just became startlingly aware of the fact that I'm about to turn 30.<br><br>'Some people buy a new car. Some people get their hair cut differently.<br><br>'Me, I haven't done so much with my life in terms of social stuff. So this is my adventure - with a kind of scientific method.'<br><br>She'll be 30 on 7 Nov. So, with time ticking, she decided to enlist the help of Jane magazine to meet the deadline, reported The New York Daily Mail.<br><br>Miss DiMuro, who says her first kiss with a boy didn't happen till she was 23, has signed a legal document attesting to her chastity.<br><br>She's even game for a medical exam to verify her claim.<br><br>She said: 'I am a girl who is not particularly religious nor prudish or shy, but I was a complete and utter dork growing up.<br><br>'I had braces, teenage acne, and experienced social shyness and, as a result, attended only all-women's educational institutions.<br><br>'I have wonderful parents and come from a great background, but just never really got a chance to, well, 'do it'.<br><br>'I never thought I'd be approaching my 30th birthday as a virgin who hasn't found a meaningful connection, but here I am.'<br><br>Predictably, her unusual quest has proved a PR bonanza for both herself and the women's mag - which will publish her blog about her blind dates and her progress, if any, from first base to home plate.<br><br>The magazine's website now features a Sarah Needs You section (www.janemag.com/virgin) dedicated to helping Miss DiMuro find the right guy.<br><br>Readers are invited to nominate candidates to date her and can browse through a slideshow of Sarah's potential suitors.<br><br>Sarah's Dating Blog will feature her commentary after every date and the Pick Sarah's Date feature offers web readers the ability to vote on who she goes out with next.<br><br>Sounds stressful, you say?<br><br>Without a doubt it is - the decision to put her fate in the hands of magazine readers may just prove to be more of an adventure than Miss DiMuro counted on.<br><br>'I'm a little bit anxious about all of this,' said the stand-up comedienne and humour writer.<br><br>'I guess this is why my stomach hurts so much.'<br><br>Yesterday's first date - with a guy named Lucky - didn't go so well.<br><br>'The fact is that Lucky and I had no spark or real connection,' she wrote on her blog.<br><br>In fact, it turned out Lucky was trying to get lucky with the Jane magazine representative instead.<br><br>He wrote on Miss DiMuro's blog: 'I felt that some little sparks flew between the Jane magazine rep.<br><br>'I wish she had been my date... she is the girl I've been thinking about since last night.'<br><br>Well, who said finding Mr Right was easy? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
