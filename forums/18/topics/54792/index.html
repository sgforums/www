Got a problem here.. hope you ppl can give me some advices..<br>how do i actually make a man gain back his confidence after accidentally commenting that his 'brother' is small?<br><br>do u guys really feel in the dumps if ya gf says tat u do not really have a magnificient dick?<br><br>gals, do u mentally compare the dick sizes of the men tat u had wif?<br>or reali juz give blunt comments once in a while like " u arent reali big.. XXX is so much bigger.." any comparison done? n how do u make up for the hurt tat is being caused by a slip of tongue?<br><br></div></blockquote>I can't believe you did that! Never comment on a man's "brother"!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  If he cannot pleased you then you got to teach him how to even if his "brother" is too small. Even if there are girls who compare sizes of men's little brother... NEVER EVER say it out. Either way... you gotta try to make him feel that he is good enough for you to enjoy yourself. If that doesn't work then good luck and hope that he can get over it.</div>
