              <p>not all guys go for paid sex are despos, quite a lot are attachted or married , to them its just a service like getting a massage and its not really consider cheating since they dun form relationship with the pros. I think most of them are sensible enough to use condom and as long their gfs/wives dun found out its not a big deal.</p>
