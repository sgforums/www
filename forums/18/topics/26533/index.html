The girl is MOST probably young and/or sexually active to achieve this.... I also don't know how to describe the feeling (mainly because I'm not a woman... -_-`~), but they've got to just relax and achieve it in order to feel the difference and understand that it's another BIG ORGASM and NOT just nature's call..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Cause when she reaches her "peak", it has the same feeling like want to urinate but, it is not.  Its just that she has reached her big "O" and hence, if she let go, er body fluids will just gush out, wetting the bed even. I guess this is the best feeling a woman can get when she have sex.<br><br>Try talking to her and encourage her...i am sure after that, she will enjoy sex more.</div>
