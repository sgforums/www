Still there, even after years, thousands of years, of teaching about<br>goodness and truth and love and peace.  Still there, after all the sermons and<br>teachings.  If religion is good and true, why should this be?"<br><br>The preacher said nothing.  They continued walking until he noticed a child<br>playing in the gutter.<br><br>Then the preacher said, "Look at that child.  You say that soap makes people<br>clean, but see the dirt on that youngster.  Of what good is soap?  With all the<br>soap in the world, over all these years, the child is still filthy.  I wonder<br>how effective soap is, after all!"<br><br>The atheist protested, "But preacher, soap cannot do any good unless it is<br>used!"<br><br>"Exactly," replied the preacher.

This sentence means that, literally salvation is a form of grace, thus salvation is only one of the graces ppl receive. In my earlier paragraphs, when i said grace, it means general graces, blessings that God gives, like riches even to the undeserving. In my later paragraphs, my "grace" meant salvation. I regret and apologize for not being specific enough. So the grace i had mentioned in addition to the parable meant salvation, if i was clear enough.<br><br>Again, i stress that i didn't say non-believers have the "grace of salvation" (which i would like to quote using your own context), i said "plan", not "already have". In my line "God's plan of salvation extends to all", i mean to say that God plans to save every men and women. This line also means that we are going to saved, only if we allow ourselves to be, therefore meaning that we can reject, salvation that is.<br><br>Please, please read the what i said before making any disagreement or dispute.

Then who can really say that they can get salvation if they repeatly sin though they say they believe in God.I understand from dumbdumb! that true repentance is what neccessary from salvation but who can say that they will not ever sin after they believe in Christianity.</div></blockquote>whu ever said christians dun sin? haha i said liaoz.. christians sometimes are worse.. but the difference is that christians hv forgiveness, cuz someone, pure died in the place of us. thats grace, something we don't deserve. its like a huge cave of gold! and we want to share it as well... its not something we want to selfishly keep and be all self conceited like "HAHA! I'VE GOT SOMETHING YOU DON'T!" no, the fact is we dun deserve it any more than the next average joe, but its something so good, we want to share it. not only do we get salvation, we get the promise of joy, peace, power, and authority.<br><br>in times of crisis, we have someone we know who will answer, someone who cares, God. He promised never to leave us nor forsake us, hv u ever had the assurance like that? that you don't have to earn God's answers, but He is always there, like a Father is always there for a son, when u call on His name, He will always answer. we do have worries, but we know we hv the answers to the problems of this world. and these are answers that works. my parents, before they understood, never could hv understand the joy, that no money can buy. being at peace in a world of confusion and chaos. this is priceless.. and we want all to hv an oppotunity to know. choice is still yours to make. your responsibility to know first. before making a choice.</div>

Whenever we make statements, especially sensitive topics public, we have to be very responsible over what we say. Because if we make a conclusive statement without first getting the solid <strong>facts</strong>, ppl would then conveniently assume what we is true. Just i as had made so many statements here, I based all of them on facts, which i had affirmed with many religious ppl i know.<br><br>For example:<br><br>Myth: Non-Catholics, sadly most Protestants often accuse Catholics of worshipping Mother Mary.<br><br>Truth: Mother Mary, to the Catholics, is seen as the model of virtue and purity. A devout Christian who bore sufferings of a mother of a son who was crucified. Catholics therefore constantly believe in her presence (concept Eternal Life), regard her as friend and mother, but not as goddess. Mother Mary is not a god/goddess to the Catholics, and they don't worship her.<br><br>"...even catholics, they preach that it doesn't matter, all will be saved..." Therefore here in this statement you have made, I beseech you to research into this rumour by asking the Catholic clergy for the right answer. Simply because i tell you, there is no truth in this statement you have made.<br><br>As a reminder, if we don't ascertain facts before declaring them as truth, we are in effect spreading malicious rumor against our neighbor.</div>

But do let me say that this is not the way to end a debate, argument etc. One should tackle the ball to win the ball, not the man.<br><br>"You your debative skills is somewhat like a apologist. May you're a CGL or of that calibre..." Er...what's a CGL?<br><br>"That's also a downfall" Please elaborate, i genuinely wish to hear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"please don't get defensive and start throwing verses at me..." Er...I don't direct at the people arguing, but what that is argued.<br><br>"Sadly, your words didn't have audience...my point made it's way that people in different levels may not see eye to eye as what you have presented." Well, I presented my point alongside with social viewpoints and religious viewpoints. this is so to explain to help ppl better understand the difference between social versus religious viewpoints. While you maintain that people at different levels may not see eye to eye, like i said, <strong>morality <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by (most) religious context </span>is absolute</strong> and therefore timeless, in contast to the <strong>changing norms by social standards</strong>. Have i not explained this enough?<br><br>Therefore i am saying in effect that, "While other people can't agree or accept the religious standards, such standards remain within the religion." I am also saying in effect, "Non-religious are not expected to follow the religious doctrines", and "so a visitor to a church is not expect to follow the liturgy." [but out of courtesy/respect he/she should at least do what is respectful in the eyes of the host. Even when violated, the visitor is not to be reprimanded or any sort because he/she has a different set of norms/rules]<br><br>Here i am not expressing my opinion, but rather the standard, or the doctrine of religions. You can agree/disagree opinions, and that's fair, but arguing doctrines leads close to nothing (i repeat, close to nothing, but not nothing). Anglicans can disagree that divorce is unacceptable, but Catholics see otherwise, that's why there're still so many differences not only among denominations, but also races, ethnicity, culture, norms, etc. Here, i am trying to allow "audience" to adopt a "relativist" view, not a culturo-centric, ethno-centric, or religio-centric view.<br><br>"What you may have thought is clear is not." <strong>May</strong> expresses an opinion, therefore cannot be debated. Out of defense, i know what i, here am saying. (I suspect you'll say that others would feel that i am not)<br><br>"What you think is right may not." As per above<br><br>"What you may thought was explained may not be delivered in it's fullest form. Worst, people may have taken your message in the wrong light, a greater damage done. What may be 'right' to you may not be to others. (Give careful consideration. It's all only but personal views)" Not many how bad/good i had presented or even the best writer had written, conflicts are inevitable, just as it is obvious misundersandings are. Here, well, i have also tried my best.<br><br>So you stand on people dont see eye to eye is clear, but my stand is to present what the doctrines mean. There can be no agree/disagree, there is however accept/unaccept, because u can't agree/diagree doctrines/rules, but you can ignore/accept.<br><br>"A simple example now to support my points. You can't agree with me fully even though i felt that i've done my best. Neither can i fully agree with you." I have to remind you that i'm presenting the facts, just like i'm telling everyone that the sun rises from the east, so you're not actually not disagreeing what i had said, but rather impression tells me that you are disagreeing with what i am doing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>What was your last point? I genuinely do not know. "Meet up" ?<br><br>I had already mentioned that i am crippled, hav a crippled left leg, can't walk for at least a few months. I beg you to tackle to topic, not me. (Please reply me in private, since i feel that this is already went off the mark.)<br><br>Cheers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
