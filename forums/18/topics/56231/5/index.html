He was a murderer, the turning point was when he realise that Jesus is indeed what He claimed to be, the way, the truth and the life, and that <strong>no one comes to the Father, except through Him</strong>  john 14:6.  because pharasees are the teachers of the Law, and they didn't believe that the messiah, was Jesus. too blinded by self righteousness i guess.<br><br>and i agree, grace is given to all, but not everyone chose to receive the grace.<br><br>it is also written, in romans 10:14<br><br><strong><blockquote>How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? </blockquote></strong><br><br>i'm not exactly sure what you meant in the whole post, i presume u meant that there is no difference between believers and non believers, and God loves all, saves all, there is no need to share and stuff like that. correct me if i misunderstood you.<br><br>but that verse above shows that yes, there is a need, if what you say is true, everyone is saved by default, that verse would contradict itself, which is impossible.<br><br>but i do agree that God loves all, and is WILLING to save all. but not all wants to be saved. but how can they hv a chance to make a choice, unless they are given one first? therefore, how can they call on the One they hv not believed in, and how can they even start believing without hving heard of Him, and how can they hear.. if no one speaks to them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  dumbdumb.<br><br>On your point saying that Saul converted to Paul <strong>before</strong> he became Christian, my memory serves to tell me that it is <strong>after</strong> he had converted. But i wish not to argue on this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>"but not everyone <strong>chose to receive </strong>the grace." I think <strong>reject or the inability to recognize or acknowledge</strong> the grace would be better replacements.  God gives the grace, freely as we all know it, and He gives it at His own will and we received it, whether or not we know it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Far too often we fail to see this, and even more often we take it for granted. What God gives is something we cannot reject. If you still would like to dispute my statement, i won't comment.<br><br>"i'm not exactly sure what you meant in the whole post, i presume u meant that there is no difference between believers and non believers..." That is correct, from my point of view, everyone receives their own share of grace, just as Christ said, when everyone was paid the same amount regardless of the hour they had started working.<br><br>"but that verse above shows that yes, there is a need, if what you say is true, everyone is saved by default, that verse would contradict itself, which is impossible." Here you have clearly misunderstood. What i had said was  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  "His plan of salvation extends to all..." I didn't say by word or intended that everyone is saved by default, but "his plan of salvation". I used to the word <strong>plan</strong>, so that statement means that God plans to save, which is in future tense, meaning that God plans to save but the salvation has yet to past but is ongoing and will continue until the second coming of Christ. But your statement "everyone is saved by default", your sentence is in past tense, showing that you thought that i meant God had already saved, which is untrue, not what i had said.<br><br>And in my post in response to mCbaobao, i had even stressed the need to evangelize, at least with some groundwork done by missionaries so as minimize misunderstandings of the faith. So to your last paragraph "but i do agree that God loves all, and is WILLING to save all. but not all wants to be saved. but how can they hv a chance to make a choice, unless they are given one first? therefore, how can they call on the One they hv not believed in, and how can they even start believing without hving heard of Him, and how can they hear.. if no one speaks to them." This I agree to all; the missionaries are to spread the faith, so as faith accompanied by good works may lead to salvation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is however a very depressing fact that in some churches, there are very weak pastors who were not effective enough to preach to the lay the real meaning of church attendance. But, even with the best preachers around, people still attend church for variety of reasons. And here in our topic, there are indeed people who attend church for sex and for their own sick and selfish desires, which directly contradicts the meaning of church attendance and defiles the reputation of the church.<br><br>It is obvious that in the first pages of the forum, there are already ppl admitting that they had relations with churchgoers. In additions, ppl also attend church to pray for 4D, exams etc, and according to first post, pastors were said to have sex with the congregations (this, i don't know is happening). Despite all these happenings, what these ppl are doing is <strong>definitely not</strong> what the Bible or any righteous religion (i didn't just say church) preaches. It is just that while the great religions preaches righteousness, the so-called believers still commit heinous/mortal sins, and defiles the name of the religion they belong to.<br><br>My point: While the great religions preaches on the importance of peace, chasitity, purity, morality, righteousness, there will always be ppl remain as believers, yet continue their un-religiosity, their sinful behavior that stain the name of the religions.</div>

But i wish not to argue on this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>"but not everyone <strong>chose to receive </strong>the grace." I think <strong>reject or the inability to recognize or acknowledge</strong> the grace would be better replacements.  God gives the grace, freely as we all know it, and He gives it at His own will and we received it, whether or not we know it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Far too often we fail to see this, and even more often we take it for granted. What God gives is something we cannot reject. If you still would like to dispute my statement, i won't comment.<br><br>"i'm not exactly sure what you meant in the whole post, i presume u meant that there is no difference between believers and non believers..." That is correct, from my point of view, everyone receives their own share of grace, just as Christ said, when everyone was paid the same amount regardless of the hour they had started working.<br><br>"but that verse above shows that yes, there is a need, if what you say is true, everyone is saved by default, that verse would contradict itself, which is impossible." Here you have clearly misunderstood. What i had said was  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  "His plan of salvation extends to all..." I didn't say by word or intended that everyone is saved by default, but "his plan of salvation". I used to the word <strong>plan</strong>, so that statement means that God plans to save, which is in future tense, meaning that God plans to save but the salvation has yet to past but is ongoing and will continue until the second coming of Christ. But your statement "everyone is saved by default", your sentence is in past tense, showing that you thought that i meant God had already saved, which is untrue, not what i had said.<br><br>And in my post in response to mCbaobao, i had even stressed the need to evangelize, at least with some groundwork done by missionaries so as minimize misunderstandings of the faith. So to your last paragraph "but i do agree that God loves all, and is WILLING to save all. but not all wants to be saved. but how can they hv a chance to make a choice, unless they are given one first? therefore, how can they call on the One they hv not believed in, and how can they even start believing without hving heard of Him, and how can they hear.. if no one speaks to them." This I agree to all; the missionaries are to spread the faith, so as faith accompanied by good works may lead to salvation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>[/b]</blockquote>nono, i meant that saul, received Christ, and became paul, i meant that b4 he knew Christ, he was saul, who was a murderer.. but it got all jumbled up.<br><br><blockquote>God gives the grace, freely as we all know it, and He gives it at His own will and we received it, whether or not we know it.</blockquote>i hv to disagree. it depends what kind of grace we are talking here, grace, on the whole, just simply means, something we do not deserve, for example, a rich spoilt brat being rich, he doesn't deserves being rich, all he does is make others lives miserable. but God still blesses him with wealth, for whatever reasons i dunno, thats grace, being alive, thats grace too, having food, thats grace.<br><br>but what i am talking about, is grace of salvation. that is given to all, freely, but not everyone accepts it, there is no biblical backing to say that we can unknowingly receive salvation through Christ. and Yes, we can reject the salvation,<br><br>i know of neighbours, who know everything we had told them. but they don't want to, for some reason or another.<br><br>in the bible, there was an incident, where a rich man approached Jesus and asked what must he do to attain eternal life, Jesus said, obey all the commandments (Jesus knew no one can do this, its impossible but its also true, by obeying these commandments would be reaching God's standard of perfect holiness)<br><br>and the young fellow said he did all those (claiming that he is perfect, and sinless, which the bible says that anyone who claims to hv no sin, has lied, which is a sin itself)<br><br>so Jesus simply pointed to him, to leave behind his money and follow Him. the young man was dejected cuz he could not bear to leave his cash behind, which means he could not put God first, which is the first commandment.<br><br>you see? the rich fellow knows about salvation, following Jesus, but he just couldn't follow through. and he rejected the salvation.<br><br><blockquote>That is correct, from my point of view, everyone receives their own share of grace, just as Christ said, when everyone was paid the same amount regardless of the hour they had started working.</blockquote>that parable simply means that as long as that person knows and receives personally the Lord and saviour, he can be at his deathbed and receive, salvation is still his. at that time, Jesus was talking to the people and the pharasees, that salvation isn't just by works, the previous 2 workers were unhappy cause they felt that they deserved more for working longer hours than the third worker.<br><br>someone may be a believer for 40 years, and someone may just be a believer for 2 mins. both die same time. they both have salvation. afterall God is the one giving the salvation, who are we to say we deserve more?<br><br>there isn't any biblical backing to say that non-believers hv that grace of salvation, but it is written that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the LIFE!<br><br>and no one has any excuse at all to say they do not know.<br><br>if what you say is true, that nonbelievers hv the grace of salvation, why did the man in luke who died, went to hell? he didn't believe, that was why, even though he knew, because they hv the law and the prophet, whereas now, the people now, have the gospel of salvation and the missionaries. no one has any excuse.</div>

This sentence means that, literally salvation is a form of grace, thus salvation is only one of the graces ppl receive. In my earlier paragraphs, when i said grace, it means general graces, blessings that God gives, like riches even to the undeserving. In my later paragraphs, my "grace" meant salvation.

In my line "God's plan of salvation extends to all", i mean to say that God plans to save every men and women. This line also means that we are going to saved, only if we allow ourselves to be, therefore meaning that we can reject, salvation that is.<br><br>Please, please read the what i said before making any disagreement or dispute.

Basically in my understanding and what that has been taught, is into heaven.<br><br>This is a very neutral yet very true topic. Christians, are no different from other people, except religion, are sinners. Dumbdumb was basically saying that everyone are sinners. As the saying goes "The very body the makes great saints, makes great sinners" This line means that great saints and sinners have the same body as we all do, the human body. Yet here, given the same body, we have sinners as well as saints.<br><br>I'll skip explaining true repentence, but speak on what i think you're saying here. It is the sincerity to repent that i think is what God looks into, the heart, something that we cannot see spiritually speaking. And ultimately it is God himself who judge who is to be saved, who is not to be.<br><br>As a reminder: Don't be mistaken that Christians are entitled to salvation; this is nonsense and lead to complacency. I say this because there are missionaries who said that to join their faith, we'll be saved, and if not, we'll go to Hell.
