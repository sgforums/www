Are we not human too? I have never met a christian who claims to be an angel.. cos we know perfectly well that we are sinners in need of Christ. So dont make up bull. Perhaps ur friends are just 'sunday christians.' They go to church every sunday but in reality, they do not reflect the lifestyle of true christians. So do not stereotype ALL christians based on those that you know. There are always hypocrites in every religion. (Not saying that ur friends are though.)<br><br>Who are u to judge me? Are u perfect yourself? Not suitable for angels like me.. who on earth claims to be an angel? And before u tell me what i can or cannot do, take a look at yourself first. "May he who has no sin cast the first stone." Agressive religions? What the?! I'm so surprised that u can call christians aggressive. Oh well..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christians are not perfect, but they are called to be perfect.  Does that mean that the moment they accept Christ, they become perfect immediately?  Of course not.<br><br>What is a christian then?  A christian is one who accepts the sovereignity of God.  He dies to his old nature and put on Christ's nature.  It is a process of becoming like Christ.  There will always be people calling themselves christians but not act in a christianly way.  But christians should not give excuses when their human nature fails them, but continually look to our source of beliefs and continually look to be someone God has created us to be.<br><br>Christian need not shun away from topics like sex, smoking, drinking, etc.  Talking about it is not a sin itself.  It's the the perversion of these subjects, the actual act of it that is forbidden.  Is drinking bad?  No, but the act of drunkeness is.  What is more important that christian should not let all these things be a vice to them and let it become a "god" in the lives.  e.g. the love of money.<br><br>Anyway, let's hear from the other religions?  I think they'd disagree about people abuses faiths/religions.</div>

I dont wish to say anything else, except don't be so narrow-minded.<br><br>And, pls have some consideration. Calling them mad? Saying they are brainwashed? Another sign of narrow-mindedness.. just because u dont believe in it doesn't mean it's not true. Dont say that it al a joke. Just respect other people's beliefs. No one here has the right to criticise anyone else's religion. I can skip reading your whole paragraph and read the last sentence just to get a sense of ur level of maturity.<br><br>Perhaps it's true that some christians dont know the right way to introduce God to other non-christians. In the end, they end up offending them, like what they did to you. But they have good intentions, but perhaps they just didnt go about it in the right way. Sometimes we just get too excited about Him and just wanna share it with the whole world.<br><br>You see, it's just like when a child has a new toy. When his parents just buys him something new, he wants to show it off to everyone - friends, family, etc. That is exactly what we've found. We've found so much happiness that we want our friends and the people we love to share it with us, to get to know Him too.<br><br>Some members behave like God and look-down on non-christians? Again, dont judge ALL of them because of this. In reality, we christians do not do that, cos we know that we were all sinners once. We are not superior in any way.<br><br>Oh, and the stupid thing u said about them having a target, and then fighting to make sure that they acheive it. Pls think before u speak -that comment was just plain dumb. Who're they gonna fight?! There's no harm in setting a target, why does it bother u what they aim for? But that extra remark abt fighting was inappropriate.<br><br>And no - it's not because we claim that christianity is sooo holy and good. Yes, we do find it good, otherwise why are we christians? But we would never FORCE anyone. Whoever does so is wrong. In the end, God gives everyone a choice.<br><br>From reading a few of ur posts, I'm sorry to say that u seem to speak without thinking first. Your arguments are poor, with no logic or any real sense. You don't really have anything to back up what u say. I'm not meaning to insult you, I'm just saying that the way u convey ur thoughts are very hard to follow through.</div>

All it requires is a LITTLE bit of effort and complete and total faith in God.<br><br>I couldn't be bothered reading the rest of ur reply.
