You've never seen it for yourself, yet u 'know it is happening'. And then u turn around and ask if there's any truth in it.<br><br>For the first part, there are definitely some people like that. Cos they think that there are a lot of hot babes in that church, so they go there for the sake of getting to know them. My cell group leader was an example, and now, he is one of the most devoted Christians I know !! Hmm.. I think it's amazing what God can do.. =)~~<br><br>As for the next 3 statements, I refuse to comment. Gonna get all heated up. But anyway, there are definitely ppl who will abuse their religion in some way, whether for sex or not. And this includes ALL religions, be it catholic, buddhist or whatever else..<br><br>Why single out churches? There are deffo poeple like that in every religion.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah,I think in Singapore its a good time to do something religious now.I mean look at all those religious people,they are earning more than any CEO or minister in Singapore.City Harvest Church,Recreation Church etc......all have annual budgets of 30 million.The pastors use church money to open GLC- type of company...and put themselves at directors.I heard they drive Benz and got private yachts.Children nowadays dont wanna be doctors,lawyers or accountants anymore,they wanna be pastors,it sure pays cause demand is there..Dont underestimate religion,it has survive a thousand years,it is a powerful tool to galvanise,inspire and brainwash people.This is why cults exist and thrive.Many people all over the world in these 1000 years had died for religious purposes.Its powerful even for evil purposes.Somtimes I think its better the world do without religion,it will have one less reason for frictions,war and conflicts.It will be a much safer and peaceful place to live in.No religion is pure and perfect cause the humans make it so.I known of christians and muslims alike who visits prostitutes,find girlfriend for sex aand dump later,go churches for the sake of girls,girls who make use of guy's feelings to tempt them to church,religious couples from same religion go Geylang to open room etc.Nothing is so black and white anymore.The more the religion says its damn good and pure,the more hypocrisy it shows,some of the worse people I met are also some of the most religious I had met..So i came to a conclusion,religion is not important at all.Religion doesnt make or break a man nor does it show how good or bad your character is.If you have it,good,but dont be overzealous.If dont have,so be it.Just sit back and enjoy life.I will never 'break a leg' just for religion.So if a person use religious excuses for sex and money,well,lets not blame him.People are stupid.</div>

First sex and religion is not related, why only christian and muslims? there are many other that did the same thing, whether you free thinker or not. It is the personality of that person. Its human nature.<br><br>People don't go for sex but pray for 4D , pray for study, pray for relationship, does all this succeed if they themself never put in effort? Do you thing all those pray for 4 D sure strike? exam sure pass?<br><br>I am christian, but I think all religion teach right things, it depands how individual to understand and relate the way.<br><br></div>

They see pastors driving huge cars, being rich, and they wanna be like them. How typical.<br><br>If u wanna be rich, work for it!! These people are just blessed by God, who said that He will provide all our needs. They just chose the smart way, and devoted their lives to serving God, and this is the result.<br><br>Children wanna be pastors? Where did u get that info?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Anyhow, do u think if u wanna be one, u can just do it just like that? It's not that easy!! Do u have what it takes? Is that your calling? No one will wanna go to a church where it is obvious that God isn't with the pastor.<br><br>Sure, there may be some corrupt people, especially in Catholic churches (dont shoot me for this!) who spoil the whole name. This is not what it's supposed to be.<br><br>In my church, we are happy to see that out pastor is rich. I mean, it shows our God is not a stingy God!! If a guy on stage is preaching about how 'God will provide u with everything' and he is wearing torn pants with holes in them, would anyone believe him? No!! People have this idea that because God made him rich, he cant make them rich. As if there is a limited supply of miracles in heaven or something. Come on, have faith in God!! (This is mostly for believers).<br><br>And as I said before, there will certainly be people who make use of religion in the wrong way. Be it Christians, Buddhist, or whatever it is. Dont just single out one.<br><br>At the end of it, God gives everyone the right to choose, whether to believe or not. You will either suffer the consequence, or get saved by it.</div>
