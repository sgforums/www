            <div class='col-md body'>I am always wary of making christian friends cause you just have to doubt their sincerity.....most christian friends I had are ok but some only make friends with you just to make you join church.....I hated that...after you say you willing make friends and go out with them...and when they ask you join church and u said no..they stop being your friend and stop asking you out and the response was like "to hell with you"....thats some friend I make..I dont need such friends.....there was zero sincerity.....maybe christians should learn how to make friends without the 'joining church thing' hanging over the head...the feeling sucks.....sometimes they condemn other religions so much you feel like punching them...my catholic frd had to suffer constant abuse from this christian frd about God and all....i must say the catholics are more praiseworthy......I believe in God but not in the christian church movement....its too egoistic,too flashy,too cultish and too fake.......They are so proud and defensive about everything they do that it sucks.....if I wanna be a christian,i will only join for religious reasons like I believe in God or I need God etc and not for non-religious reasons like making friends,meeting girls,I am lonely,I am loss etc......come on....I hate the part of christians preying on people's lonliness or helplessness and making them christians when theya re most vulnerable....I will give christians 100 marks if they willing to help people when they most vulnerable and making friends when people most lonely<br>without asking the lonely and helpless to be christians after all the help given...thats like a business deal....like a deal devils make with people...they need to exchange something for something....Christians dont force?.....I dont know whether whats the right word....but they are sure persistent....calling your house all the time,approaching you on the streets,asking you join them for this and that with a condition "but must be a christian later". Some christians are hell of a aggressive and warlike but why they exist cause their damn churches and pastors encourage them and feed them with extreme and xenophobic ideas like "World domination for christians"....the wonder christians only have christian friends....cause they are so exclusive......so stuck up.....The idea of going to hell if you dont believe in Him is a good one...thousand of years ago.....this kind of clause will be useful to hoodwink and threathen poor,uneducated and superstitious folks to join the church or the pastor followers but maybe no longer in the modern world....people are not so easily threathen anymore or dumb enough to believe.....you add another clause like "No matter how evil you are in real life,as long as you believe in God,you got salvation"..that certainly add more people to the following...those evil but old and dying or guilty who believe their past deeds can just wash away like that...ask those waiting for revenge to believe in that.... and they will give u a middle finger</div>

Some christians are hell of a aggressive and warlike but why they exist cause their damn churches and pastors encourage them and feed them with extreme and xenophobic ideas like "World domination for christians"....the wonder christians only have christian friends....cause they are so exclusive......so stuck up.....The idea of going to hell if you dont believe in Him is a good one...thousand of years ago.....this kind of clause will be useful to hoodwink and threathen poor,uneducated and superstitious folks to join the church or the pastor followers but maybe no longer in the modern world....people are not so easily threathen anymore or dumb enough to believe.....you add another clause like "No matter how evil you are in real life,as long as you believe in God,you got salvation"..that certainly add more people to the following...those evil but old and dying or guilty who believe their past deeds can just wash away like that...ask those waiting for revenge to believe in that.... and they will give u a middle finger</div></blockquote>Is lyk... Yes we christians do lyk to reach out to the people.. but we dun force them to come to church lo.. we encourage them lo... and for ur info.. me hav alot of  non-christians frenz.. and our relationship are still veri good lo... so doesn mean u don come to church we dun "fren" u.... is lyk we still accept those who are non-christians... of the world population onli 30% are christians.... we don isolate ourselves n say "wah we are the holy 1 we dun mix ard with u".. Is lyk... u noe a cure for cancer, wont u tell every1 u noe... tat cure... n try to help them... wat are we doing is similar lo....to us we believe God bless us eternal life.... but we wont force those that dun believe.. but we will try our best to explain to them and let them feel the grace n love given by God (by bringing them to church where the presence of God is the strongest).. AND EVEN if they still dun believe in it, we wont say u dun believe in it... get lost.... no we don do tat lo.. if not i think all my non christians fren will leave me le lor...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>hmm ok, let me put it this way. say if the girl loves music and music was her life, and the guy doesn like music, u tink that they can live together in peace??<br><br>there will be no conflict? its the same case here. when someone comes into christ, most of her time will be spent in church, with christian friends. lifestyle will change, not for worse, for the better. but the guy would not understand it, like why everyweek she has to goto church and stuff. for me? i spend at least 3 days a week doing church work, and meeting church friends. if the girl does the same thing, which is a good thing, not a bad thing, will the guy understand? or will he initiate the breakup? think abt it.<br>and if he was the one initiating the breakup, would u be singing a different tune? agreeing with him for his decision? or will u be just and fair?<br><br>but don't get me wrong, there is NOTHING wrong in having a relationship with a non believer. but marraigewise, cannot *thus the verse do not be yoked,, blah blah.* and every relationship we pursue, we try to aim for long term into marraige, not just walk walk, hold hand, u screw me i screw u*which is wrong*, 3 mths later, bye bye..<br><br>is that all there is? </blockquote>I think people wif different religions can still get together.Why not? People wif different races get together,people wif different hobbies get together and so on.It is not very possible to have everything the same wif each other. What if u have the same hobbies same this same that but different religions?Of course u also cant have too many differences lah. But if a relationship ends becos of some differences,it just makes me wonder is there really love involved in it.Even if someone spends more than 3 days per week wif church frens, it is just a very small problem if  u really love each other.What about people who work until very late everyday,what about people who stay in camp everyday?And i don mean being in a relationship means srewing around and holding hands then bye bye.I personally know of one old couple where the husband is a buddhist and the wife is a catholic and they are still very loving.Even if i have a christian girlfren i would still accompany her to church,going to church doesn't mean believing or want to be a christian,sometimes i accompany her do this and she accompany me do that and i think most people in relationships do all all these, it is just about compromising.Of course if the relationship hasn't begin, everybody can choose wat kind of partner he or she wants cos it is their choice but to end a relationship becos of some differences is a different matter.Last of all,if it is my fren who initiate the breakup i wont agree wif him.If he couldnt understand that his girlfren has to go to church and initiate the breakup,i would think its his fault.In their argument, i think my fren would already have tried to tell her that religion should not be a problem in their relationship though saying is one thing and doing is another.But the problem is his girlfren didnt even gave him the chance to try.All in her mind was "if u don join christinity,we have to breakup".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well if the people around the church accepts who you are, it is alright.<br><br>I met this frend of mine from a Buddist temple that had a very bad experience with a christian group, which was one of the biggest group. She got gb on the first night of the cell group studies by the pastor and several others after she thought she got hypontised and drugged.  She found no evidence was found that she was drugged of any kind. 3 months later, she found herself pregnant and the church she join shunned her as a slut cause even her husband thought she was bonking around in church. Eventually, she divorce, left the church, aborted the child, and now studying Buddism. She blamed Christianity for causing her happy marriage to collapse, Jesus to be a "fake", and so many other issues.<br><br>I even dare not to tell her otherwise and just leave her alone in the temple as when someone abuse the religion, this is the consequence to the victims.[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I wun feel so bad if I were you. It helps to understand the mindset of siao-on christians like myself.<br><br>You see, they do their very best to place their relationship with God above all else, friends, family and of course, even their romantic relationship, bringing everything into submission. Sounds shocking but even a christian's devotion towards God is supposed to be more then that to their spouse.<br><br>Henceforth, the more siao-on ones will not engage in a relationship that's not pleasing to God's eyes. It's more then just a matter of differences, though they present obvious challanges. But also a matter of their piorities. The area of getting a boyfriend/girlfriend is also put into submission to God.</div>

My friends have taught me something about Christianity, which I have not accepted, have they damned me? If I remained ignorant about Christianity, just like many other people around the world, would I have been saved?<br><br>Well, if you are willing to be judged by something that happened 2000 years ago, I'm afraid you judge yourself more harshly than I do myself.<br><br>I don't feel that we should be responsible for what happened in the past - we should take charge of the present and take responsibility for our own actions and wrong-doings.<br><br>In my opinion, we must be judged by our own deeds, good or bad.<br><br>Eternal judgement, and salvation, if it exists, must lie on our deeds. If we are damned anyway, why bother to practise a good life?<br><br><blockquote>but does our eternal judgement, lies on good deeds? it is not so.. salvation does not lie in deeds, its not what we do that counts, its what was already done 2000 years ago that counts.</blockquote>If this is true, no amount of good or evil I do matters, as what counts has already happened 2000 years ago. Then what can save us? Is belief and repentance all that is necessary for salvation, regardless of deeds?<br><br>I urge all to think about this carefully with some logic. We may have different religious beliefs (I'm atheist), but logic is a skill that we all have, regardless of beliefs.<br><br>I live as my conscience and moral code dictates, and as free of hate as possible.</div>
