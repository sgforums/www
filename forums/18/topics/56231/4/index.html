His passing mark is 100%, one wrong doing, sin, dooms us. good deeds don't count. so if deeds cannot save us, cannot wipe out the sins in our lives? what then? God knew, we are weak, but the Law demands death for sin, so someone had to die, and that someone is Jesus, pure and sinless, His purity is exchanged for our sins, His purity is in us, and our sins are in Him, and He died, and rose again, to prove that God has now forgiven our past, present and future sins.<br><br>it is after salvation, where good deeds comes into play, to bless others, and it will naturally come, because of whom you put your faith in, deeds will come.<br><br>christians are no better than non christians, i tell you in your face right now, that there are non christians who are better in character than us christians. its just that we have salvation, a big cave of solid gold, and we want to share. its up to you to accept.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh, so much arguments around here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ultimately, I believe in following to the best of my ability to live up to the commandments, esp the greatest commandment Christ told the Pharisees.<br><br>Of course, these alone is very difficult, especially when i'm so aware of my sinful and begin thinking and doubting if following His teachings can indeed bring forth salvation [afterall absolutely no humans can say who goes to heaven, who doesn't]. And so I ultimately don't have the salvation, what's the point being good?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>{My point} God has already told [followers] what to do (the 10 commandments), [followers] should first, like Moses, lift the staff and lead the Jews out of Egpyt., the God's signs will follow. I'm saying here in effect, that God wants [me, at least] to first follow His words, and only then He'll show me the signs (and i do hope i'll be rewarded like Job). Following the way of God is NEVER wrong.<br><br>Afterall, even if the "signs" don't come, following the commandments helps to free yourself from each and everyone's own slavery (to sin). A simple one would be not to bear grudges and hate (to love your neighbors/enemies even), and if one would be able to do that, himself/herself would be definitely be more peaceful at heart. The commandments free us, and not restrain us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

In this case, their religion.) So these charismatic people go around preaching the gospels in hope to bring new friends into the church. Their intentions are generally GOOD, which i have to stress. But sadly, their Bible "wisdom" (notice i didn't say knowledge) are still fresh, thus often misinterpret and stumble on the meanings of the Bible. The Bible is not simply a book, a self-help, a recipe for salvation, a "How-to-do-it?", but a book of uncountable mysteries and paradoxes, and is thus very abstract.<br><br>So my point here is, that while i maintain that it is not wrong to evangelize, and i agree that many Christians "Bad-market" themselves, <strong>their intents are good</strong>. The misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and oftentimes the ridiculously simple interpretations made by these new converts, while unavoidable, we should bear in mind that these root from a lack of Bible wisdom. If the Bible is that easy to understand, the spiritual author of the book (God himself) is hence made simple, which defies the meaning to the word "God" itself; the Christian theology, esp. the Summa Theologica (extremely thick book) by St Thomas Aquinas would then become a joke.<br><br>Bottomline: The Christian theology is not as simple as we all, Christians included, think to be.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
