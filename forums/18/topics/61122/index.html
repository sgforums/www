If she can do it to you and your buddy, why not others? "Sense of security" sometimes is just an excuse. So you have to tell between the truth and the lie.<br><br>If you are conscious enough, you would not have enjoyed that moment. Can't blame you as sometimes guys are controlled more by the little brother than brains.<br><br>Now the problem is, u cum inside her. If anything happens, you will be held responsible. You might lost both your buddy and the girl (if she is toying with you). Come on, this should be the last time. It ain't worth it.</div>

But one day,when we are watching a movie in the cinema,she suddenly french kiss me and I was shocked that I do not know what to do and allow her . After the show , I kept quiet all the while and she broke the silent by telling me she wants to be with me rather then my buddy and I ask her why is she doing this . She says my buddy can't give her the sense of security when she is out with him. Well my buddy is quite skinny cuz he don't go to the gym to built up like I do . Anyway I sent her home that night . At the doorstep, she invited me in for a drink and I paused for a moment then she pulled me in . We chat for about a while then I realised that she was staring in my eyes then my face turns very red don't know what to do now .Then I realised her hands are in my pants already . A while later we were both naked in the living room . I really cannot control myself already and i told myself ok ok oral sex enough ok . So i told her the most is oral sex and she agreed . She gave me 15 mins of oral sex .I was in estacy already and she led my penis into her and I was thinking SORRY BUDDY I AM REALLY SORRY THAT I HAVE SEX WITH YOUR GIRL . I have sex with my buddy GF 2 times in a row and I cum inside her the second time and I am feeling so guilty now . She swallow my cum the first time but the second time she wants me to cum inside her vaginal . After that night I have been avoiding her for about 2 days till now and I do not know what to tell my buddy or should i just pretend nothing has hapened and just treat her GF like my younger sister like I used to do please can anyone help me I am very confused now my dick should not have jumped out of my pants that day .

These people can actually give up a good friend or buddy for a girl. I mean, if he let go of that girl, he can find one more suitable for him, even maybe becoming his wife but a buddy is hard to come by. Kena backstabbed is one of the worst thing that can happen to anyone, especially by someone you trust.</div>
