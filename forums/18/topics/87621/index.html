            <div class='col-md body'>http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2004350174,00.html<br><br><blockquote>By SHARON HENDRY<br><br>DESPITE her nine GCSEs and three A-levels, Kate Rollason left school with only one ambition in life Â— to own BritainÂ’s biggest breasts.<br><br>Seven years, 25 plastic surgery ops and Â£75,000 later, she has her wish.<br><br>And Kate, who funded much of the cost through lap-dancing, insists she has no regrets.<br><br>Â“The bigger I get, the more guys tend to be frightened of me Â— but I just love big breasts,Â” she says.<br><br>The results of the ops, which have taken the 29-year-old from a healthy 34C to a shocking 32L, are certainly a fearsome sight.<br><br>The size of basketballs, they weigh a stone in total Â— a ninth of her total body weight.<br><br>Kate bears little resemblance to the mousy girl who grew up in sleepy Stourbridge, West Midlands Â— and that is exactly what she set out to achieve.<br><br>She says bullying at school left her with a poor self-image and prompted her transformation.<br><br>Â“I  was punched and kicked and called ugly by other girls,Â” she recalls.<br><br>Â“It was hellish. I was hard-working and intelligent and people donÂ’t like that.<br><br>Â“I was good at sports and represented the school at athletics, but I hated what I saw in the mirror.<br><br>"At 15 I really liked this guy but he said I was too ugly to be seen with Â— it pushed me over the edge and I took a bottle of tablets.<br><br>Â“I wanted to kill myself but it didnÂ’t work, so I figured IÂ’d get even instead.<br><br>Â“One day I saw a woman on TV who looked amazing Â— Lolo Ferrari. I thought, Â‘I want to look like that!Â’"<br><br>Tragic French porn star Lolo, who appeared on C4Â’s Eurotrash, died in March 2000 at the age of 30 after a suspected overdose. Over ten years she had numerous ops which inflated her breasts to a massive size .<br><br>Kate says: Â“When I was 17 I had just one mission Â— to be better than all the girls who bullied me.<br><br>Â“I feel IÂ’ve achieved it every time I go home and see them pushing their prams and looking terrible.Â”<br><br>After passing her A-levels in maths, biology and chemistry, KateÂ’s parents hoped she would go to university to get a degree in accountancy.<br><br>Instead, she got a job as a lifeguard at the local pool. She says: Â“I wanted to be glamorous, attractive to men.Â”<br><br>She had her first op Â— an NHS nose job Â— at 18. A year later she had her first boob job.<br><br>Kate, who now lives in Bicester, Oxon, says: Â“I had saved and saved and was happy with the result, which took me from 34C to 34DD. I remember going to a club two nights after.<br><br>Â“Loads of guys were coming up and asking me for sex. I felt more attractive Â— great.Â”<br><br>It was the beginning of an addiction to surgery and she later underwent three boob jobs by Lolo FerrariÂ’s former surgeon.<br><br>Kate has also had five nose jobs, her eyes widened, chin reduced, collagen added to her lips, liposuction, an acid face peel and more than Â£20,000 worth of cosmetic dentistry.<br><br>She says: Â“I went to Blackpool and started lap-dancing to pay for more operations.Â”<br><br>Kate still seems in pain from her most recent breast op four weeks ago in LA Â— no British surgeon would agree to pump 2,000cc (two litres) of saline into her already heaving breasts.<br><br>Â“I was in agony at first,Â” she says. Â“They had to put me on morphine, but theyÂ’re fine now.Â”<br><br>The doctor warned of possible complications such as back pain and stretched skin, but they never asked why Kate wanted even bigger breasts.<br><br>The patient is clear about her reasons. Â“It has totally empowered me. ItÂ’s given me self-confidence and IÂ’m really happy,Â” she says.<br><br>Now Kate plans to write a book and launch a singing career.<br><br>She also wants a husband.<br><br>Â“I suppose I have to find a breast man. I just want someone who will do right by me,Â” she says.<br><br>But any future spouse had best be warned, KateÂ‘s bizarre addiction has not gone away.<br><br>Â“IÂ’d never say never to another boob job."<br><br></blockquote></div>
