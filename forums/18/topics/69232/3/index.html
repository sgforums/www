            <div class='col-md body'>That school really sucks. I remember 2 pervertic incident that happened at my school before. The first one was a student writing pervertic notes about teachers like how much she was worth their measurements etc. The note was passed around the class, apparently the guy who wrote the note sat behind me and luckily he thought I was too naive to read those kind of things and didn't passed the note to me. A nosy Prefect got hold of the note and reported it to the Discipline Master. Damn that Prefect, I think she wanted to get promoted only, the class Monitor also didn't take that note to heart.

If I am staying nearby the school, I will still accept to sent children to this school. I would rather children learn character-building more than only academically. This is a learning process, but proper guidance/"education" from school, parents and society must be given.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Principal so old still haven't marry yet. You really think she don't watch porn, masturbate and go Red Light District? The police should catch her instead. And parents shouldn't sent their children to that school not because of the bad influence. I think being curious isn't a bad thing. Parents shouldn't sent their children to that school because the school doesn't even protect their own student. I don't think the school gotten the parent's permission before reporting the incident to the police, which parent would allow their children to be blacklisted? And even worse they deprived the students of their meals. I hope the parents of the poor boy in hospital sues the school until it closes down. Such a school shouldn't be left operating.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quoted from <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/70413/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/70413/1/.html</a>:<br><br>The principal of the school, who declined to be interviewed on camera, said in an e-mail to Channel NewsAsia, "It was an <strong>oversight</strong> on our part that we had <strong>neglected</strong> to let the boys go for a break during the period of investigation. We are sorry that a boy has taken ill as a result. We have visited the boy at hospital to check on his condition."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>When the principal said "oversight", I believe it means the school/"whoever" did not take concern/care for students as one of the priority in Education or when citing punishment. This is more or less similar to the 3 deaths in SAF whereby more emphasis on care/concern for soldiers is done now. I hope the MOE should include this into their teacher training/re-training, and emphasis this issue.</div>
