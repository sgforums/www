            <div class='col-md body'>I think if police is called simply due to the students possessing the vcd is kinda over-reacted by the school. The school should understand why the students do so and also these students are growing teenagers. I believe a good school should educate/guide/explain to the students and give them a chance, esp. if this is the first time. Students/Teenagers must be taught with more heart/care than punishment/police. I remembered my teenage school days, some 'bad' students actually turn for the better due to the guidance/care/concern given wholeheartedly by the school.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's indeed wrong in the first place to possess such undesirable material in school.<br><br>HOWEVER, the school's authority shouldn't overlooked the boy's well-being. If anyone of you had read the news, one of the guys who's caught possessing the vcd was punished in such a way that he missed the breaktime and later on, contracted a rare disease whereby his intestines fused as a result of hunger.<br><br>I'm very sure his parents would be dead worry. Hope the boy speedy recovery.</div>

They all missed their recess and did not eat for seven hours.<br><br>As a result one student had to be hospitalised.<br><br>He suffers from a rare disease in which the walls of his intestines start to fuse together if he goes without food or water.<br><br>It is understood the boy is still under observation at the hospital.<br><br>The principal of the school, who declined to be interviewed on camera, said in an e-mail to Channel NewsAsia, "It was an oversight on our part that we had neglected to let the boys go for a break during the period of investigation. We are sorry that a boy has taken ill as a result. We have visited the boy at hospital to check on his condition."<br><br>The school has also involved the parents of the boys and the police in its investigation.<br><br>Three pornographic VCDs were handed over to the police, who detained and questioned a 14-year-old student.<br><br>He was later released on bail of S$2,000. - CNA<br><br>Copyright ?2004 MCN International Pte Ltd<br><br></div>

Cannot everything use law/punishment on students. The school should have their own discretion, and the students well-being in heart.

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading all the responses and news report, I canÂ’t help but impressed by the decisive actions taken by our beloved MOE appointed principle. MOE is just wonderful at picking the right talent for the job. I mean look at the principle of that school. Not only is she an education advocator but she is also a great cook. So much so that even her students are baking in the sun for 7 hours just by bringing a pornography VCD to school just to share it with his friends. To top that up, the principle also displays an awesome skill of shrinking responsibilities to human error. A well-rounded person indeed.<br><br>My dear people, despite MOE's high and rigorous standards of appointing principles, despite the principles lucrative pay, despite that principle has an average about 10-15 staffs around her corner looking at the welfare of her students and despite the fact that one parent has repeatedly warned the school about their sonÂ’s health, error can happen. Â“It was an oversight on our part that we had neglected to let the boys go for a break during the period of investigation. We are sorry that a boy has taken ill as a result. We have visited the boy at hospital to check on his conditionÂ” said the principle. So parents need not worry, if any mishaps happen to your son, be sure that there is someoneÂ…in this case some errors to blame, so you can claim your insurance.<br><br>Following the Iraq war, many people complaint that Singapore sells her soul for a free trade pact with the US. Perhaps by baking 17 14-year old students in the hot sun for 7 hours, denied our further generation of education and without food and drink so much so that one has been sent to the hospital, our critics will not criticize us for being a US Â“Running DogÂ” because what the principle is doing is following the ways of Taliban. The reminds me of a Chinese adage Â“Yong Xin Liang KuÂ” Such patriotism!<br><br>Our media did not disclosing the name of the school impresses me. By doing so, more parents will be in the dark as to which school is in charge by this well rounded patriotism principle that we all love dearly.<br><br>I believe the 17 students have no one to blame but themselves. Knowing how keen is SingaporeÂ’s leader is to wanting more babies so that Â“we can replace the adultsÂ” in the future, it is little wonder the other principles and teachers are only keen on transmitting academic knowledge but this principle is different. This principle redefines the defination of sex education. Being grilled under the sun for 7 hours and sent to police for detainingis her defination<br><br>I believe in the near future, all women must required to wear veil when shopping, working or schooling. The government will ban all R-rated movies and sent out the Baath.. I mean our police to punish these wrong do-ers after being grilled for 7 hours. Heck even wrestling will be ban. This is a crucial first stage towards a new and free Singapore! Free from porn that is and we can only thank this wonder principle for setting up this example for the rest to follow. Thank-you.<br></div>
