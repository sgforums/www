            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The 17 boys involved in the recent porn VCD incident at Kent Ridge Secondary have expressed regrets over their actions.<br><br>Some parents have also approached Mr S. Iswaran, MP for West Coast GRC, on Monday for help, expressing unhappiness that the school had referred the matter to the Police before speaking to them.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Like many other teenagers, the boys love football, hanging out together and watching VCDs.<br><br>This time though, it was porn VCDs.<br><br>Despite their light-hearted banter with reporters, the underlying tension was apparent.<br><br>The boy on bail said: "A little bit pressured waiting for the charges the Police are going to press against me. And when I will get back to school?"<br><br>The boy promised he would now study hard and go to a polytechnic or a junior college.<br><br>He said his mother initially felt angry, but later feels very sad for him, and has told him to change himself.<br><br>The parents met their MP for more than an hour, expressing concern over the fact that the school referred the matter to the Police instead of calling them.<br><br>Mr Iswaran said: "The parents are concerned about the fact that the school went to make a police report on this matter.<br><br>"The other part of it is that the parents are unhappy about the manner in which this whole episode was dealt with by the school from the time when they first started looking into the matter to the time the parents were brought in and the police were brought in.<br><br>"I will take this up with the Ministry of Education on two counts. The first is to ask whether the ministry has specific guidelines on how to deal with such matters. The other of it is also specifically what has happened, whether the school could be more forthcoming with a written apology to the parents."<br><br>The MP said he might also bring the matter up for discussion in Parliament.<br><br>Mr Iswaran said: "These are 14-year old boys. From what I understand, most of them have got pretty good or clean disciplinary record. If that is the case, then maybe we could have given them the benefit of the doubt...well everybody makes mistakes."<br><br>The boy on bail said: "I hope they will give me a chance to turn over a new leaf, and I hope I will not disappoint them, by studying hard and not repeat the same mistake again."<br><br>The Ministry of Education said the school should have handled the matter better - from letting the students concerned have their meal breaks, especially the boy with the special medical condition, to explaining the situation better to the parents.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Ministry said the school decided to call in the Police because of concerns over the source of the VCDs, as well as the possibility the problem might have been spread beyond the 17 students concerned.<br><br>The Ministry said the principal had the discretion over whether to call in the Police.<br><br>In this case, schools should not be disparaged for doing so, especially when there is evidence of illegal activity, it said. - CNA<br><br></div>

They shouldn't treat it so seriously," one person interviewed said.<br><br>"If it's their first time, the action taken was just too much," another said.<br><br>"It'll definitely affect them. Though their action was illegal, it could have been handled differently or with some special care. They are still students and have got their lives ahead of them," a third person said.<br><br>But the principal of Kent Ridge Secondary has defended her decision to involve the police.<br><br>She said in an e-mail: "I decided to work with the police because this is a serious matter.<br><br>"I believe the police will be able to help us determine the extent of the problem and work with us to come up with viable solutions.<br><br>"I also informed the parents of the boys of my school's decision."<br><br>So what is next?<br><br>"The parents and the school should communicate and find out why the school made the police report.

We are sorry that a boy has taken ill as a result. We have visited the boy at hospital to check on his condition."<br><br>The school has also involved the parents of the boys and the police in its investigation.<br><br>Three pornographic VCDs were handed over to the police, who detained and questioned a 14-year-old student.<br><br>He was later released on bail of S$2,000. - CNA<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Poly survey shows 62% of youths have visited porn websites<br>By Johnson Choo, Channel NewsAsia<br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpYeDaGB.jpg"><br>Related News Â»<br>Â• Education Ministry to work with schools to prevent another Kent Ridge incident<br>Â• Boys involved in porn VCD incident regret their actions<br>Â• Many say principal over-reacted in porn investigation<br>more&gt;&gt;<br><br>SINGAPORE: A new survey has found that almost two-thirds of Singapore's youths have come into contact with pornography on the internet.<br><br>The revelation comes just a week after 17 boys from Kent Ridge Secondary School were caught with porn VCDs.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>There's no doubt young Singaporeans are comfortable in cyber space.<br><br>The latest figures show an incredible 96 percent of people aged 15 to 29 have an email account.<br><br>But being free and easy on-line also means there's a greater chance of stumbling across sites that are officially frowned upon.<br><br>And figures from the Singapore Polytechnic survey back that up.<br><br>It reveals more than 80% of the youths surveyed found it easy to view content considered objectionable including violence, racism and pornography.<br><br>The poll of 800 people also found 62% have actually checked out a pornographic website.<br><br>Perhaps not surprisingly, more than 70% are males.<br><br>Norman Phua, a student involved in the survey, said: "I guess it's just somehow more natural for males to want to visit pornographic websites because males are males."<br><br>Said another student Tan Wei Qi: "Males have this natural tendency to be interested in such things, and being hot-blooded youngsters, you might be more interested in such material online. Furthermore there will also be the factor of peer pressure."<br><br>A third student also involved in the survey, Ho Sie Sie, said: "The society is generally conservative, so there will be a natural curiosity among the teenagers to go into such sites and view the content. Because some of their parents may not be willing to share these information with them, so they may be curious."<br><br>And just how do people find this sort of thing?<br><br>Search engines are powerful tools that can help internet users find information that they need.<br><br>But these are also tools commonly used by youths to search for pornography.<br><br>Since nearly 80% of the youths gain access to the internet from home, the Singapore Poly feels that more can be done beyond using technology to ban access.<br><br>And there's no doubt the internet is here to stay.<br><br>The Poly's Director of the School of Business, Maheantharan, said: "We can't stop what's happening at home. So the key I think is education. How can we do it? We can do it by explicitly talking it in the classes.<br><br>"The other thing we ought to also do is to educate parents. As you can see from the survey, they access it from home, so parents ought to be aware that this is happening, and probably be educated on what to do to avoid, and also to educate the kids at home. So it should be a partnership." - CNA<br><br></div>
