            <div class='col-md body'>maybe the school is doing it for fame?  The so-called 'good' schools will avoid this kind of negative publicity.  The principal might have tot that by reporting the incident to the police, she is establishing the school to be a strict and proper place, and strict parents will want to send their kids there....<br><br>IMO the principal is a bi*ch!

I remember 2 pervertic incident that happened at my school before. The first one was a student writing pervertic notes about teachers like how much she was worth their measurements etc. The note was passed around the class, apparently the guy who wrote the note sat behind me and luckily he thought I was too naive to read those kind of things and didn't passed the note to me. A nosy Prefect got hold of the note and reported it to the Discipline Master. Damn that Prefect, I think she wanted to get promoted only, the class Monitor also didn't take that note to heart. In the end most of the boys in the class were called out to write a report except for me and a few others. We are the " Guai Kia " type so didn't suspect us. The boy that wrote the note was given 3 strokes and the boys that read the note and laughed were give suspension. The Prefect went around telling people something about the invading the pride of a woman and all that crap. Luckily, the boy that  wrote the note didn't report to the teachers that I provided him with the paper.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div></blockquote>What were in those notes?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After following the news for 2 days and finishing reading all the replies, I felt that it is clear that it's the school's fault.<br><br>Firstly, the principal said that the police was alerted after the boy felt ill. But why are the parents only contacted after the police arrived? Shouldn't the parents be notified immediately upon catching the student red-handed?<br><br>Secondly, if you could still remember a while ago, when our dearest MP Steve Chia was caught with having porn in his PC, he was let off with a warning letter. So, i was wondering shouldn't this boy be discharged and be sent for some counselling? In my opinion, he is just a growing-up kid(minor). Who in this forum haven't really viewed porn (in any sorts) before?<br><br>This incident happened to my ex-secondary school before. The only difference is that our vice-principal took another alternative to solve this problem. He wanted this guy to surrender all his VCDs and send him for counselling. Year later, now this guy ( a good friend of mine) is a fine young lad. I wonder how would this Kent Ridge principal command respect from her students after this incident.</div>
