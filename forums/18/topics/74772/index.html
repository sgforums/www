            <div class='col-md body'>Okay.<br><br>This is kinda my first time posting here so I hope people dont think im too much of a n00b :-D<br><br>anyway i wanted to shar an experience last night.<br><br>i usually go to liquid room on sat nights, good crowd, nice music etc.<br><br>except last night not ONE but TWO fights broke out.  it was freakin hilarious.<br><br>some guy apparently "looked at" some other guy's girlfriend.  and then they proceeded to fight like girls.  i was standing right next to them when this guy ran through chasing after the other guy.  all the girls were like "eeek" and had to be comforted by their strong boyfriends ;-)<br><br>i have never seen two guys look more ineffectual when fighting, maybe if they wore bikinis and had a mud pit but thats about it.<br><br>thing is right, if this was australia itd be a REAL fight, where some guy would pull a knife (or occasionally a gun) or get his 50 lebanese mates to start pounding on you.<br><br>whereas this guy was screaming at the top of his lungs in hokkien while 3 malay bouncers with arms bigger than my head completely surrounded him.<br><br>anyway just thought it was a funny story as i had never seen a fight break out before at liquid room :-)<br><br>has anyone else had similar experiences? seen a fight? started one at a club after too much to drink?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I saw one fight at zouk last year. This angmor guy, seems drunk, was dancing by himself and swinging his arms around wildly. Must have hit some people doing that as others start to give him space to do his 'thing'. But he got more and more wild then all a sudden two small chinese guys just jumped on this angmor ape. One was on his shoulders and start hitting the head, the other was hitting the body. Then all 3 fell to the ground. Everyone just watched and continue to dance. Then less than 10 seconds later it was over. The 2 guys disappeared and only the blur angmor left. Bouncers came, look around a bit, then also left. More like a hit and run than a fight!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Iast time fights between the SS gangs in Singapore used to be a lot worse, they had a pretty good system going. They would have a call sign on their pagers and each sign would mean a different meet up place. Since SS gangs usually stayed in their own terrority but if some rival SS gang invaded their terrority, they would have a mass pager alarm on a call sign and everyone would come armed to a certain location waiting to ambush the SS gangs.<br><br>There's tons of articles in the newspapers before then about a couple of SS gang members getting killed and injured whenever there was a SS fight.</div>

They would have a call sign on their pagers and each sign would mean a different meet up place. Since SS gangs usually stayed in their own terrority but if some rival SS gang invaded their terrority, they would have a mass pager alarm on a call sign and everyone would come armed to a certain location waiting to ambush the SS gangs.<br><br>There's tons of articles in the newspapers before then about a couple of SS gang members getting killed and injured whenever there was a SS fight. </div></blockquote>a sign of immaturity, those people.</div>
