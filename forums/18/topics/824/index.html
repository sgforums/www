            <div class='col-md body'>Just in case any of you guys haven't notice YET. The price of movie has ONCE AGAIN gone up... YUP.... Used to be that movie tickets are selling at $5 from Monday to Thursday before 5pm..... Now tickets are selling at min.$6....? Thursday remains at $7 FOR NOW... After 5pm on Friday all over the weekend tickets are at $8..... The reason they gave for this adjustment..? &lt;- People won't mind that +$1.... Here is the SUMMARY of what happened before this increment was actually made....<br><br>All tickets are selling at $6 NET... $8 for R(a) shows.... The authority SAID that they wanna increase the price of the tickets to $8.... &lt;- MIND YOU, this is NOT the 1ST time and Singapore's ticket price is really one of the MOST EXPENSIVE in ASIA if not in the world....? People started to make noise... Then the authority SAID OTHERWISE.... They said they are not trying to discourage people from watching movie... It's just that too many people are catching the movies over the weekend causing an 'inbalance' in their ticket selling.... Nobody's watching the movie on weekdays BUT ONLY on weekends... HENCE, they decided to increase the price of the weekend tickets to discourage people to catch the movies only on weekend and they pull down the price of the weekday ticket by $1? so as to 'promote' weekday ticket selling...<br>So what I wanna know now is WHY do they PULL BACK the ticket prices to $6 (though it's ONLY +$1) which makes it NO DIFFERENCE from the previous price... But now the weekend tickets' prices have GONE UP by $2 for NO APPARENT reason at all..???!! To encourage people to watch ONLY weekend movie..?? MOREOVER the tibits, popcorns and drinks they're selling are already DEFINITELY earning them EXTRA BIG BILLS.... I feel that all this while they're just FINDING EXCUSES for them to continue to ROLL in their $$$ because they're already earning so much... And that THOSE GREEDY PIGS are NEVER CONTENTED......<br>I don't see them promoting weekday movie watching at all... In fact, with such good TV systems at home nowadays, they're just PROMOTING 'PRIRATED VCD' watching....<br>I'm just so SICK N TIRED of the excuses they GIVE... So PLEASE... Next time ya wanna roll in more $$$ for your pockets, FIND US BETTER EXCUSES!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
