            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Mike, a free country this is indeed and it's only right that you take what I posted and don't write as if you've got a problem with me, because I didn't have a problem with you in the first place. Don't like what I posted, just spare your pathetic emotions the trouble.<br><br>The last thing you should do is contradict your sorry arse off on that thing about freedom and such. I mean, no one's even asking you to look at my post in the first place, nor am I askin' anyone to participate in those questions I suggested...I mentioned 'sensible', but did I mention 'cool?' They hold very different meanings you know. Just like your name...probably cool-sounding, but it don't make sense to me. Come, on, start reading and listening to people carefully. I see you've been nodding off in class again, as usual?<br><br>And why is eveyone here contemplating that I could have problems with my sex life? So what if I do, or did, am going to have? Does it make me less of a human? Duh!<br><br>So let's get on with XDesire's questions, folks. He's been waiting long enough for you people and needs some real answers. He's got one though from the (Polish?) doctor, but even then the latter isn't sure, because he 'thinks' (with what, one wonders? Maybe the prostate gland?). Could be a fatal guess, that one.  And either might be the one with the real problem, I don't know. And remember, I don't have the power to stop anyone from posting what he wishes. Don't deviate...I've been reading numerous posts on this site...most of the time, they just eventually drift to Timbuktoo...but of course, it's none of my business!<br><br>No love lost here - and really, you all shouldn't too. Have a happy midweek!</div>

Don't like what I posted, just spare your pathetic emotions the trouble.<br><br>The last thing you should do is contradict your sorry arse off on that thing about freedom and such. I mean, no one's even asking you to look at my post in the first place, nor am I askin' anyone to participate in those questions I suggested...I mentioned 'sensible', but did I mention 'cool?' They hold very different meanings you know. Just like your name...probably cool-sounding, but it don't make sense to me. Come, on, start reading and listening to people carefully. I see you've been nodding off in class again, as usual?<br><br>And why is eveyone here contemplating that I could have problems with my sex life? So what if I do, or did, am going to have? Does it make me less of a human? Duh!<br><br>So let's get on with XDesire's questions, folks. He's been waiting long enough for you people and needs some real answers. He's got one though from the (Polish?) doctor, but even then the latter isn't sure, because he 'thinks' (with what, one wonders? Maybe the prostate gland?). Could be a fatal guess, that one.  And either might be the one with the real problem, I don't know. And remember, I don't have the power to stop anyone from posting what he wishes. Don't deviate...I've been reading numerous posts on this site...most of the time, they just eventually drift to Timbuktoo...but of course, it's none of my business!<br><br>No love lost here - and really, you all shouldn't too. Have a happy midweek!</div></blockquote>bla bla bla bla bla bla bla ............. boring<br><br>Zzzzzzzzzz .................</div>
