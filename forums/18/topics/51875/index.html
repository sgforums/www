            <div class='col-md body'>Art Of Female Masturbation<br><br>Clitoral Stimulation<br>Using Hands and Fingers this involves rubbing, stroking and pinching<br>of the clitoris with your finger(s) or the palm of your hand.<br>Sometimes direct stimulation of the clitoris too intense, and you may<br>prefer stimulation near or around the clitoris more pleasurable. Or<br>try a layer of clothing or fabric between the hand and clit.<br>Finger Stimulation<br>Palm &amp; Fingers Rub with the palm of one hand on the clitoris and<br>fingers from other hand inside your vagina<br>Finger Roll<br>Finger roll your clitoris between the index finger and thumb.<br>Lubricated Rub<br>Lubricate your vulva with baby oil and rub your clit with two fingers<br>until it gets hard. Use a dildo in your vagina<br>Left &amp; Right<br>The middle finger of your right hand rubs your clit. Then start<br>rubbing just to the right of your clit, then quickly move to the left<br>side. (One side of your clit is usually more sensitive than the<br>other.) Most of the rubbing will take place on your more sensitive<br>side. Your left hand is holding the wrist of your right hand. Lie on<br>your back with your legs spread or raise your knees to your head<br>Tickle<br>Lie on your back with your legs as tightly together as possible.<br>Tickle your clitoris with one finger kind of bent very lightly.<br>Water Masturbation<br>The showerhead massage is the control that switches the water from a<br>steady stream to a pulsating jet spray. Keep one hand free and adjust<br>the temperature or water pressure for even more variety. Hot tub jets<br>work, too. Avoid sending strong streams of water into the vagina;<br>this can cause fatal air embolism.<br>Steady Spray<br>During the shower find a steady spray and push your vagina forward so<br>the spray hits your clitoris.<br>Detach Showerhead<br>Using a plastic showerhead that attaches onto the tub faucet, detach<br>showerhead from the hose and send steady water stream onto the<br>clitoris. Try covering the hose so the water intensity changes.<br>Faucet Scooch<br>Lie on your back with legs spread far apart then scooch down to<br>position yourself under the flow of water from the tub faucet.<br>Faucet Spray<br>Spray the water from the tub faucet by covering the faucet with your<br>thumb or fingers and spray the water on to your clitoris.<br>Pillows &amp; Furniture<br>Lie on your stomach and move against some object to stimulate the<br>clitoris. Rubbing against the corner of a piece of furniture might do<br>the trick:<br>Ottoman Plane<br>Balance yourself on a corner of the ottoman and rub your clit on the<br>corner and periodically lift your hands and my feet off the ground.<br>This gives you the feeling of flying when you cum.<br>Pillow Ride<br>Riding on a pillow, the end of the pillow twisted into a hard knot<br>and pressed against your clit.<br>Vibrators<br>Vibrators are used primarily for clitoral stimulation, although many<br>women also use these electric or battery-powered toys for vaginal or<br>anal stimulation. They can be combined with different toys and used<br>in any number of positions.<br>Direct Vibration<br>Try lying in bed with sexy music, rubbing your body with scented oil,<br>fingering your nipples and using the vibrator directly on your clit.<br>Butt Whack<br>Lie on top of your vibrator while whacking yourself on the butt.<br>Penetration<br>Try vaginal penetration with firm, fast strokes, and have the other<br>hand play with your nipples<br>Art of G-Spot Manipulation<br>Inserting a vibrator or dildo into the vagina can help locate and<br>stimulate your G-Spot and offers a feeling of fullness in the vagina.<br>Try this independently or with clitoral and/or anal stimulation. You<br>can locate your G-spot with your fingers, but it's difficult to<br>provide adequate stimulation through manual masturbation. Women who<br>enjoy this method usually use toys. The G-Spot is found about 3<br>inches on the top of the inside vaginal wall. Ie: the wall behind the<br>pubic hair<br>Depending on you mood you may not always cum from the same kinds of<br>stimulation, but you can still enjoy the feelings they induce. Try to<br>ignore the performance and just enjoy the sensations.<br>Knife Handle<br>Insert a smooth curved table knife handle in your vagina - and wiggle<br>it with one hand while stimulating your clit with the other.<br>Anal Stimulation<br>The anus is quite sensitive to touch. Many women enjoy stimulation of<br>this area during masturbation or partner sex play. You can experiment<br>with your fingers or anal toys either by themselves or with clitoral<br>or vaginal stimulation.<br>Double Duo<br>Push a lubricated dildo in and out of your anus with one hand, and<br>either rub your clitoris or use a vibrator on your clitoris with the<br>other hand<br><br>Secrets of the G-Spot:<br><br>What is the G-Spot?<br>Unlike men, women can orgasm several different ways, via clitoral,<br>vaginal, or G-Spot stimulation. Your partner may already climax<br>fairly easily with clitoral stimulation or during intercourse.<br>However, there is an area for stimulation inside her vagina called<br>the G-Spot that you may not have found. Most people don't know about<br>it. The G-Spot is a bean shaped mass of nerve tissue located about<br>halfway between the back of the pubic bone and the top of the cervix.<br>The G-Spot is the focal point of the female sexual arousal. The size<br>and location of the G-Spot will vary from woman to woman, but it's<br>usually about the size of a quarter, and lies two to three inches<br>inside the vagina directly behind the pubic bone. You may be able to<br>help her have added pleasure, experience new sensations, and perhaps<br>have a new type of climax.<br>Where can I find the G-Spot?<br>The G-Spot is not easily located. Sometimes women have a hard time<br>finding it and do not even believe they have one. Here is an easy<br>method to finding it.<br>To explore this area, have your partner lie down, knees bent and feet<br>flat on the bed, with a small pillow under her buttocks. Insert the<br>length of your lubricated fingers into her vagina towards her navel.<br>This will be about two inches inside the vagina. Press with one or<br>two fingers against the front wall of her vagina. Because it's<br>surrounded with tissue and is deep in the vaginal wall, you may want<br>to apply a little more pressure than usual.<br>When you stimulate the right spot, it will swell the way your penis<br>does. Slide your fingers from side to side. Have your partner tell<br>you when you hit the right place. She will be able to tell. When you<br>find the sensitive spot, continue stimulating it and you may find<br>that it becomes firm and swells much like the erectile tissue in your<br>penis.<br>How do I stimulate the G-Spot?<br>Now that you've found the G-Spot, kneeling between your partner's<br>legs you can use the thumb of your other hand to gently stimulate her<br>clitoris at the same time. This combination should give her very<br>intense sensations. She may climax in this position, or you have the<br>alternative of continuing in a different position.<br>If your partner turns over onto her back, you can stimulate her G-<br>Spot most easily if you lie between her legs. Then try inserting two<br>fingers and rub against the bottom of the vaginal opening, press<br>upward with the tips of your fingers until you are pressing her G-<br>Spot. Move your fingers from back and side to side. You can give her<br>great pleasure by licking your partners clitoris and stimulating her<br>G-Spot at the same time.<br>Another method is to have your partner lie on her belly with her legs<br>spread apart and her hips slightly elevated. Insert your fingers with<br>your palm down, into her vagina and explore the front wall. Have your<br>partner move her pelvis to make contact with your fingers. As you<br>feel your partner become more aroused, slip the other hand under her<br>abdomen above her pubic hairs and slowly press.<br>What else is important about the g-spot?<br>Many women enjoy the "doggy" position during intercourse because it<br>stimulates the G-Spot. This is because a man's penis has better<br>access to the front wall of the vagina. Most women need firmer<br>pressure to the front of the vagina, quick rhythm,and a lot of<br>friction to have a G-Spot orgasm.<br>Some women get a feeling of the need to urinate at first when the G-<br>Spot is stimulated. Your partner may need to empty her bladder before<br>you begin love making.<br>It's possible that by stimulating the G-Spot your partner may<br>ejaculate a small amount of white or clear fluid when she climaxes.<br>.</div>
