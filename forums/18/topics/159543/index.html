            <div class='col-md body'>Dare to or Have the courage to suck a dick?? I have heard from many guys that they love Blowjobs. It feels really good. Well my boyfriend's been hinting me, but whenever I hold his dick in my hand..... and Try to go near and just Lick or Suck a little, I get freaked out. Actually he said it is Okay if I am scared and ask me Not to do it. But I Thought perhaps if a BJ feels really that great, I will just let him enjoy once, But now I Do Not even Dare go or Place my Face near.<br><br>Okay I admit I Tried Once. I start off with Kissing the Head and Lick/Use my Tongue Flick On the Head. Then I CLOSED my Eyes and Stuff that Thing In. It is so big, My Mouth feels Full. Then I Suck Once and Then Pull Away From It as I Do Not know how to Continue Sucking it. I watched Porn before, I see the girls' Heads go bobbing Up and Down, I Do Not Know how they do That. When I was doing it, I like Cannot Breathe Like that, I Do Not Know Why..... Only Know It just feels uncomfortable with That Thing In my Mouth. I Am scared My teeth will scratch the Head or Skin, making him pain. Is this my Own psychological Barrier?? After that he says it feels really Good, it is both our First Time, He first Time got Sucked, and I FIRST time Suck.<br><br>Please do Not flame/Joke or Think I Am a clone, I need help badly.

            <div class='col-md body'>Blowjobs are so cool!! In the meantime, since you're afraid of his hideous dick and afraid to put your face near it (You afraid he shoots semen on your face?), then I suggest you learn how to give him pleasure by giving him a handjob. Heheh, Use your hand and rub his dick up and down rythmatically like how one usually masturbates, then wait til he reaches orgasm and once you see the semen actually shoot out, you can have a feast. It tastes great and provides nutrients for the body. (Although it may feel a little salty at first)</div>

It's sad to think that many women don't appreciate just how much fun it can be. The reason for this is they don't know how to do it correctly and so it doesn't end up being much fun because if you mess up, you don't get your reward.<br><br>It's easy to learn how to be a terrific cock sucker. And I'm going to tell you exactly how.<br><br>Squeeze the shaft and see if some clear liquid pops up. If it does, dip your tongue into it and pull away. It will stretch with you and look fantastically erotic to your partner. Now, make like you love the stuff. Close in on that penis head like it was chocolate icecream and take the whole knob into your hot mouth. Hold it there. Listen to him moan. Now down quickly and take as much of his cock as you can get into your mouth. Don't worry, you won't choke.<br><br>If you bend your neck in just the right way, you can take it clear into your throat. Stay there, with the cock down your mouth, for just a moment. Feel it inside of you. This can be almost as luscious as having one in your vagina. It grows on you. At this point you can do several things. This is one of them: Slide back up to the tip of the penis and flick your tongue against it.<br><br>Moving as fast as he can handle it (don't let him come yet), slide up and down on his cock as if you're having intercourse. If he gets too close to coming, stop, or at least slow down. If you can't get all the way down to the bottom of his penis, you can cheat a little by using that right hand of yours to complete the sensation of deep throating him. It still looks as if you've got the whole thing in your mouth and still feels like it. You can also slide your fingers, made in an O-shape around the shaft, up and down with the rhythm of your sucking.</div>

In the meantime, since you're afraid of his hideous dick and afraid to put your face near it (You afraid he shoots semen on your face?), then I suggest you learn how to give him pleasure by giving him a handjob. Heheh, Use your hand and rub his dick up and down rythmatically like how one usually masturbates, then wait til he reaches orgasm and once you see the semen actually shoot out, you can have a feast. It tastes great and provides nutrients for the body. (Although it may feel a little salty at first)</div></blockquote>shit dude REALLY?!?!?</div>

I have heard from many guys that they love Blowjobs. It feels really good. Well my boyfriend's been hinting me, but whenever I hold his dick in my hand..... and Try to go near and just Lick or Suck a little, I get freaked out. Actually he said it is Okay if I am scared and ask me Not to do it. But I Thought perhaps if a BJ feels really that great, I will just let him enjoy once, But now I Do Not even Dare go or Place my Face near.<br><br>Okay I admit I Tried Once. I start off with Kissing the Head and Lick/Use my Tongue Flick On the Head. Then I CLOSED my Eyes and Stuff that Thing In. It is so big, My Mouth feels Full. Then I Suck Once and Then Pull Away From It as I Do Not know how to Continue Sucking it. I watched Porn before, I see the girls' Heads go bobbing Up and Down, I Do Not Know how they do That. When I was doing it, I like Cannot Breathe Like that, I Do Not Know Why..... Only Know It just feels uncomfortable with That Thing In my Mouth. I Am scared My teeth will scratch the Head or Skin, making him pain. Is this my Own psychological Barrier?? After that he says it feels really Good, it is both our First Time, He first Time got Sucked, and I FIRST time Suck.<br><br>Please do Not flame/Joke or Think I Am a clone, I need help badly.
