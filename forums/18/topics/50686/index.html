Usually the law will side the gal, because of outrage of modesty. Unless you have a witness.<br><br>1.  I guess most lifts in HBD are not camera enabled (high maintence cost).<br><br>2. When you are in the lift, you've got less than 1 minute to react .. . what will you do? I've taken a HDB lift from the 1st floor to the 30th in less than 1 minute.<br><br>3. Usually people dont carry voice recorder, say when you go to buy your food nearby. Wonder how many people carry a voice recording phone like Nokia.<br>Who knows by the time you press those stupid buttons to get to the voice function.... i guess the gal will either shout molest or you kana bash up by her gangs.<br><br>4. Haaa . . . i like the suggestion . . . make you $50 worth if you are a strong guy. hmmmmm interesting.<br><br>Come'on let's keep suggestion coming in.<br><br></div></blockquote>Not to mention that molest in a lift is an ADDITIONAL offence <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>Solution?
