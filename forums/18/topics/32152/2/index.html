            <div class='col-md body'>less sensitive and painful? i think doctors overseas have proven that the pain a newborn child feels is just the same. and while doing it when you're still a baby is even more dangerous, because there is no anaesthetic. if you cut off the foreskin is comparable to cutting of the clitoris. it essentially has the same potential and goal factor: reduce sexual desire. male circumcision originated to stop masturbation in the united states. but now that has been proven wrong (cut does it 1.5x more in studies), it just shows the stupidity of the elizabethan era thinkers. Thus therefore, doctors (might i note those that want to do the operation because they are pro-supportative about this or just want extra money for the operation) they go around giving crappy reasons and making up a whole bunch of BS, like lowered HIV transmissions and numerous fibs. Male circumcision is still also done during puberty for many religious and tribal groups, like the muslims for example. It's no different from female circumcision, the original goal and the aftereffects are the same. however the intensity of each varies, and it is that female circumcision is more harsh to a degree. removal of the foreskin WILL reduce pleasure due to your dick being scratched day by day in your undies. the foreskin protects that. so look at it this way: male circumcision removes the protection which will lead you to sexual displeasure. female circumcision directly leads you to sexual displeasure by the removal of an amount of nerves. there are no hygenic reasons to get a circumcision. some people say it's tight and stuff, but if they pulled their foreskin back in their high school or elementary school days, that wouldnt happen at all. as for it being clean, who doesn't wash their wee wee?<br><br>wah liao. enough talking from me, hope you learned something from this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
