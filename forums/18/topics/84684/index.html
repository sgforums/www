There're many things which are too... And alot which doesn't really make sense as to why they're still so actively alive today... People LIVE, people CHANGE... You HANG ON to some IDEAS like it's meant to LAST FOREVER...? It wouldn't work... No doubt some form of morality has to be there at times...
