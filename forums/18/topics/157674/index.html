            <div class='col-md body'><br>White girls seem, to me, to be more independent than Asian girls and less attached. Most seem to be lacking culture, they adopt black culture and can be annoying when they do that. Ofcourse it depends on the girl, just like Asian girls there are many types of White girls. Those that dress in more of a rock or punk style are usually more "White" meaning that they have more sense than the ones who adopt Black culture and possibly are more caring. As with any woman a man must be firm and use his head. The White girls who adopt Black culture (Wiggers, which also applies to White boys who adopt Black culture) can be somewhat intense and hard to control, that is why a man must know what he wants and he must know when to put his foot down with the girl. I hope this doesn't sound like a put down for White girls but it is for the wigger ones because they are confused, rude, and disguisting. Make sure you avoid wigger girls and boys too. Oh and as to what position they prefer, that ofcourse is dependant on the girl, there is no sterotypical "White girl position".</div>
