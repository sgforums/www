I was eating at a restaurant which I frequent, and one of the waitresses caught my eye. She was beautiful and her eyes were shapely and exotic, her hair looked smooth as silk and her skin like porcelain. She was new there because I had never seen her prior to that day. So I called her over and she took my order, she was very sweet and we had a nice chat.<br><br>I found out her name was Jenn. It turned out that her father just passed away and she is struggling with 3 jobs to support her family as the only child. Jenn dropped out of school because of this and she is very sad that she cannot continue with her education. I felt so touched and sympathized with her plight. She was so strong, and so beautiful, I instantly fell in love and offered to help her. She was hesitant at first but eventually she allowed me to help her as I convinced her with my sincerity.<br><br>She eventually fell in love with me and brought me back to her place. We made love and shared in our passionate moments. All of a sudden, I heard a loud crash as the window of our room shattered. Masked men wearing black outfits started leaping in through the broken window.<br><br>"Oh no! the ninjas!" Jenn exclaimed and I quickly took out my .44 magnum and started shooting. Soon however we found ourselves totally outnumbered so we decided to run out of the house. Just then, this huge muscular man appeared out of nowhere and started screaming and shouting. "this is madness!" I said, and was about to just give up. To my surprise, the man said "madness? this is Sparta!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" and kicked one of the ninjas out of the window. The man then drew out a sword and started slashing at the ninjas, who put up a good fight but was no match for the brutality displayed by the man. Jenn and I ran out of the place without delay. Outside the house, I saw this cab, it had dice on the front and the liscence plate said "Fresh". Jenn and I entered the cab and I said "yo, home to Bel Air!" and We arrived at Bel Air and I sat on my throne as the prince of Bel Air!</div>
