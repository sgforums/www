              <h1><br>Psychological Benefits of a Bigger Penis</h1>
              <p>The face of a man is usually an open book to most women. They can read practically anything in our faces. I’ve known ladies who could tell the size of my penis, bank account and the status of my sex life by taking only one look at me. Of course, the look was followed by the lady’s departure in the opposite direction.<br><br>Failure always leaves a mark on your face, just like success does. And women can read those marks awfully well. It’s even worse when you have a small penis and failure tends to follow failure in a pattern that grows bigger every day.<br><br>The first thing women notice about a man is his confidence level. A stoop-shouldered man with a downcast look has very little chance of actually getting a date from a decentlooking lady.<br><br>On the other hand, a broad-chested guy with a confident look in his eyes and a swagger in his step is sure to <strong>catch the eye of most women</strong>. He may not get every single pretty girl, but he’ll sure as hell be noticed by each and every one. Trust me, nothing gives a man more confidence than a big penis. A man who knows that the schlong dangling in his pants is big enough to <strong>satisfy any woman</strong> walks around with an “I don’t have a care in the world” kind of aura.<br><br>You can bet your life that women notice that. Women don’t care a lot what a man says, since most men have little to say that interests a woman. But they pay strict attention to the subtle signs in a man’s attitude. Women think: “If he looks confident, then there must be something about him that makes him so confident. This could be interesting”. A big penis is your ticket to that show of confidence that is not an act or a sham, but the real thing. Are you suffering from low-confidence and anxiety? Are you afraid that women may look down on you? <strong>Then penis enlargement is the solution for you.</strong> The minute you stop worrying, it’s their turn to be anxious.<br><br>A big penis has a lot of benefits and no downside that I can think of. Well, maybe if you decide to increase your penis size to 9 or 10 inches; that could be a problem. But if you stick to a nice 8 inches, then you’ll reap all the benefits. <strong>Increased confidence, greater stamina in bed, better control of your ejaculation, longer sex sessions and more pleasure for you and the lady, all these can be yours.</strong><br><br>Anxiety, depression and low self-esteem have no chance against a big penis and rockhard erections that last much longer than before. Women will be impressed by the hefty dick that just keeps going and men will eye the bulge in your pants with envy. Now that’s what I call turning the tables!</p>
