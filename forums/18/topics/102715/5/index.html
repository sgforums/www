            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Esther76,<br>Dunno why.. But u so desperate till lik tis? Mayb i am wrong.. But i feel tat marriage is a form of commitment to each other.. Etc.. Marryin each other coz u wish to live and spend a life time wit the special someone.. Marriage is not about sex and sex alone..<br><br>Different people have different sexual needs.. It isn jus fair for ur hubby jus coz he has different needs from u, tat u eh.. Go out and look for satifisation outside..<br><br>Sex should not be based on the frequency? But the quality? It is up to both of u on how u would lik to spice up ur sexual life to the pt whereby both of u are mutally satisfied.. Have u mention to ur hubby b4? Tat hmm.. His lovemakin is too little for u?<br><br>Since u R so open.. U could be the one to initate sex rather than waitin for him.. etc...<br><br>Have u ever tot urself in ur hubby shoes??? Wat if instead of u goin out to have fun.. but rather is ur hubby.. Coz his wife couldn satisify him.. How would u feel? Hurt? Guys i feel.. Quite ego bt hmm.. their performance..<br><br>They feel tat each time they need to satisify their partner.. Mayb he has found out that.. U got a bf outside? So the hurt or mayb resentment is really great... He dare not voice out.. Coz he felt embrass for not bein able to satifsy a women..<br><br>I belive tat he is really special to u? Thus u wouldn want to divorce him.. Coz he is ur first guy in ur life.. Tat u met durin sec school, etc.. Somehow.. I feel tat.. It was the innocent relationship in the beginnin tat u both share still draws u to him..<br><br>I feel tat u should have a gd talk with ur hubby.. OR lik those mag always suggest.. Go to sex counsellor..<br><br>It is all bt being faithful n loyal to ur partner.. Control ur hormones n needs gal!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
