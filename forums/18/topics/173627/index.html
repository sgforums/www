To the extent that I initially got PES D for my CMPB medical check-up before eventually being upgraded to PES B.<br><br>I eventually got used to it after several months, though. I guess my tinnitus wasn't that bad - listening to my Discman for long periods of time must have sparked it. Exam stress made it worse.<br><br>I heard that there are some hearing aids which can help to mask the ringing sound. They cost something like a couple thousand dollars each.

If I were to own a company, I would be very very happy if all my workers thought that way. If he was not given ear protection, then it looks, on the face of thigns, like he has a good case in Negligence. Remember, suing the company need not be personal. Maybve the company have insurance so you will actually be suing the insurance company.<br><br>Look I am not sure about the situation in Singapore, I do not know if the coy has insurance, etc  since i am not in Singapore.

But I think you are overestimating the the amount of initiative and knowledge a worker might have. I dunno what this guy did to try and protect his hearing. Maybe he used tissue paper/cotton wool (both pretty much useless, but commonly thought by many to be a good substitute), or maybe he used none coz no one else used protection. Or maybe he did not know about the long term effects of being exposed to loud noises, and therefore thought of the noise as a temporary embuggerance.

Whatever the case, the company should know about these safety issues.<br><br>I would say the company has at the very least a responsiblity to ensure that the work place is as safe a place to work as is reasonably possible. At the minimum, the company should provide protection -and- tell its workers to use them. It is no use buying hearing protectors and then telling no one about it.<br><br></div></blockquote>that shi t job i had for 5 years i saw other workers going about their duties without ear protection...i dun know coz for me i cannot even work in front of the machinery wihtout any ear protection... the noise was hurting me so much ..later on i even bought my own type of slicon/ rubber  type ear plugs coz the army type suz if u have to wear them for 9 hours a day! i went for our cmpany's hearing test several years later and still pass it. now i enjoyed music with cover ear type of headphones and not in-ear type since the later tends to increase the damage to the ears.<br><br>besides ear protection in noisy workin environment....some employers even neglect other forms of protection for the eyes and respiratory system. machinists should wear goggles or eye protective glasses and muffles to protect the workers vision form machining debris and lungs from the dusts and chemicals from machined parts present in the air. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
