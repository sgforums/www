I believe you are mentioning about the labia majora, the outer lips? But i wasn't aware that labia(majora or minora) are stimulus glands.

It's the male equivalent of the scrotum. Embryologically, all individuals are females, and the only thing that differentiates them both is the presence of hormones level...<br><br>Labia (lip in Latin) is present in the outermost part of the female genitalia. There are two, labia majora and labia minora, and they consists of multiple glands (fat glands). Sometimes if you wear a bikini too tight, you may see the labia majora forming a valley in between, that is also known as the camel toe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Labia and clitoris are spots for stimulation during sexual intercourse... but of course, the clitoris offers more satisfaction, since the receptors are more concentrated towards that part...</div>
