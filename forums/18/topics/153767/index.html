Any scientific researcher or professional care ta tell us why?<br><br>Lyk for example my fren.. it's all girl talk so it mite get bit disgustin if ur nt open-minded nuff.. Know this girl.. nt sayin her name but she's real goddamn open bout sexual stuffs.. No longer in contact with her so no askin fer numbers.. she's told me many things bout stimulation N all.. Dont be surprised cuz she actually go pantyless on several occasions.. N no guys knew bout it cuz she keeps it a secret. Lookin at her face ya cant really tell she's tht kinda gal cuz she looks so innocent N demure.. lyk a geisha doll of some sort. Acc ta her.. she tells me she gets 'wet' easily.. nt too certain bout tht cuz i didnt experience it.... even trivial things lyk seein cute guys N wind blowin against her skirt can cause 'wetness'.. Howeva i refuse ta believe it until i experienced it myself.... nt goin ta post any sexually explict things here but as a girl.. there's one thing tht's always been prickin me N want ta noe why..<br><br>Do guys <span style="font-style: italic;">moan</span> whn they feel aroused? call me ignorant or smt.. but i don haf da courage ta ask a guy bout this cuz its kinda weird too... but im open-minded N if a guy asks me bout sex related issues, i'd answer em honestly.. but tht dont mean i'm loose cuz i dont go arnd screwin pple lyk a hoe.. Whn it comes ta sex.. i often think more thn twice before actually doin it.. juz ta play save. tht means totally NO sex with strangers.. nt worth takin da risk. :]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do admit that some gals do get aroused easily and easier than most guys. Especially for some girls who have their labia protruding slightly more than others. Nowadays, women are more exposed and have a wider view on sexuality. Discussions on stimulations and the art of making is love are frequently initiated by ladies more than men now. Some men have to shy away from some of these women and some men actually take advantage of such situations by trying to hitch the open-minded ladies. It takes both hands to clap.. so even if he gets her, its not surprising... as its human needs they both haf to satisfy. It maybe something they will not regret as at times we regret what we never had tried.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Sometime i feel uneasy with gal who arouse easily. But i also get uneasy if gals dont arouse easily. Dunno why<br>But i know why women with labia (dont know wtf is this but i think it has something to do with vag*na) get aroused easily because they always have "fricition" there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway i am single and in my early 20s never had sex before. But i watch porn and such stuff and learnt from there about women. Not interested right now to get sex partner but if true love yes( long time investment)<br><br>I think women in heir late 20s and 30s sometime i fantasise about them because they are mature. But i am a man and i can recognise who the horny women are around me by noticing their behaviour and body language.<br></div>
