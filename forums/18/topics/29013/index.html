I never really got a change to propose something naughty to them, cos suddenly they said they were gonna met me at the beach. so i had to ride there. i rode my bike to this huge condo/shopping centre (which kind of reminded me of marine parade shopping centre) and parked my bike in from of the place..(didint really bother to cover the bike with canvas or park in the parking lot as i was so excited to see the two girls.<br>At the beach, apprantly it was sort of a bbq and gathering, didint really had a chance to talk to them or it felt as if i didint put in the effort to see them and hoping that they would come to see me.<br><br>so after that one of the girls (not the 2 hot one) wanted to be my pillian, and i was excited to learn about that, and then suddenly (a day has gone by) it was the next day, everyone was.. gone.. i had to get back and get my bike ( i was feeling abit nerveous and was rusing) i was apprantly at the bus interchange, and i saw an old army friend, i ask him where is the placde where i parked my bike, he said.. it was on the other side of the building but he told me its not safe... with the as there was a bombing by the road just a day ago and told me NOT to go there,<br><br>but i had to, itsmy bike, so i decided to take the chance, and make my way into the rear enterance shopping centre to find the exit on the othe side.. and i suddenly find my self at the arcade, and then an arab looking bloated entered the arcade... and behave very suspiciously.. i was not gonna stay to see what happen, so apprantly when i left the arcade i was outside and i ran to the place where i parked my bike, but the whole place was empty!!<br>not a single bike in sight.. i was sondering didi i park my bike here, so i had a look around, but still not a single bike in sight, i was feeling really down and depressed!<br><br>My bike has fire and thief insurance... but.. how long do i have to wait before i got the bike!! i was really pissed!! i wanted my bike NOW and i wanted to go home!! i started to shout" my bike is stolen!, by bike GOT stolen!!!!"<br>and i wanted to kick a bottle and smash it, but i was stopped by someone... i was feeling really down...............<br><br>and then<br><br>end<br><br>of<br><br>dream<br><br>kind of miss the 2 hot girls, there were not really that hot but they were flirty and carefree, if only i could be alone with one of them, then something fun could happen, but *sigh* didint know where they went (they were alwasy together and my bike got stolen)<br>so much to do so little time...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>wake UP time to go to work!!<br><br></div>
