            <div class='col-md body'>DO SOME BARTENDERS CHEAT?<br>Quality drinks are almost impossible with some "bartenders" especially when they start work with an intention to cheat.<br><br>Because of lack of training, practice and speed, they tend to overpour or underpour, thus, affecting the quality of the drink served.  Similarly such behaviors are also characteristics of bar cheats if they are, they would have increased in speed without accuracy.<br><br>How often do we get a well portioned cocktail when the bar is full of customers? How often do we get our checks fast? How often do we drink what we paid for especially during the later part of the night?  Pilferage and cash loss to bar owners is a major problem... 25% - 30% of revenue loss is serious.<br><br>This is an international problem which exists in America, Canada, Europe and closer to home Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore as well.  So much that Private Investigators are able to make a living, books have been written, articles have been published by business journals, movies have been made and it was requried as part of a course project in an American University.<br><br>Bar cheats work as a team within the same barcounters, with a waiter as a partner and at times with the cashier as a partner.<br><br>Who gets cheated?  Bar Owners and Customers<br>HINT #1 COLLECT YOUR RECEIPTS CHECKING THE DATE AND THE TIME.<br><br>However, there are still lots of Good barmen/maids...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the new paper on sunday had a computerised "bartender"<br><br>i think that defeats the purpose since many pple like to see pple work behind the bar while mixing drinks...<br><br>maybe it'll help those super crowded bars like zouk and mw2....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>jOhO,<br><br>being a beer and liquor lover... looks like a system like that in the New Paper helps if the bar has volume... since it dispenses a drink in 3 seconds...however I also understand that there are also other systems that does not alter the bartenders' operational behavior.<br><br>As for the presence of a bartender...  I do agree with yourself &amp; Mr. Foo that the human element behind the bar brings confidence in bar knowledge, meaning quality drinks... showmanship... para-psychologist... for a beer like Tiger all I need to know is the taste &amp; aroma  ...  a sip of a bad cocktail, straight shots or beer  raises an alarm...  cheap beer does not justify bad beer...but bad beer is cheap beer...<br><br>Hint # 2:  Is there soda in the Jug before beer is poured... floating...<br><br>There are still good bartenders/maids around</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well i agree with qulitydrinks...having a computer as the bartender is although fast and efficient, but lack of a human touch...cause you cannot interact with the computer??  Besides economy is so bad now....why cut more jobs for people??<br><br>Being a person who worked in a pub for some years, the only thing is about cheating cases is that a) take note of how much you drink so that they cannot overcharge you b) check the bill properly before paying up.  As for the drinks wise, the bartenders actually have a standard cup for measuring of the liquor.  But most bartenders dun liek to use them cause after some time, they feel they are expert enough to estimate.<br><br>But qualitydrinks, if you are a regualr drinker, you would definitely know whether the drinks have lesser or more liquor then the usual rite?  All these are human faults lar...cannot blame but as for the billing, that is all the advise i can offer you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Huh! True that bartenders pour differently... also not nice to cut jobs...   but when you know that each bartender earns about $300 &amp; up per good night as high as $800 x 8 bartenders x 10 nights a month  thats $64,000 losses for the boss.  Now the adverse effect is that paying customers cannot get good drinks when the art of overpouring is balanced by underpouring... floating...Like Bar - Copperfields, when you focus on the show, you cannot see the real act.  Like how we  appreciate wine... the same will occur for liquor and especially beer.  Automation can be resisted but for how long... how many people can a barcounter sit? Or how many people can be bothered to be at the bar just to watch the barmen!<br><br>As a customer, all we are concerned with is the finished product.  When I walk into the bar, here is the money where is my drink.  At the end of the day, good bartenders will loose out on year end bonuses... or even face job cuts because of bar losses.   How much more salary can a boss pay to stop an ongoing cheat...  it is like a "Pay cut" remember the old saying... once a thief always a thief!<br><br>hint # 3: ladies night is actually everynight!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my personal favourite...(no need any bartender to mix for me) that is cordon bleu with 7-up. discovered it by chance when coke was not available at the table..haha.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cristalle,<br><br>I believe you have really smooth liq plus sweet pop... when you mix good stuff together they will always taste great... imagine Johnny red label and coke vs Johnny blue label &amp; coke... (although it is a waste of good whisky if you do not drink it neat) it's a world of difference.  Your creativity does not require a bartender, however you need bartenders to serve it to you and imagine getting house brandy mixed with Cordon Bleu instead of Cordon Bleu but pay $45 a drink...<br><br>hint #4: right drink wrong glass ... wrong portions...</div>
