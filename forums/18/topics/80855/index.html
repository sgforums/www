            <div class='col-md body'>I was as eager as you to drive when I first got my licence. Well I suppose you think you're a very qualified driver now that you've got your licence right? Let me tell you that you're wrong! I bet you can't even park properly now.. poles and real cars are different... If you insist on driving out on your own, please start thinking of how u're going to tell your father about a dented car door...or a missing bumper....or a total wreckage. You'll even find it hard to tell your father about a small dent tht u made on the car!<br>These are part and parcel of a new driver.. you may want to drive around with your father in the car first...then after some time, he may allow you to drive out on your own already..but defintely u'll get the car into some trouble...trust me...<br>Well...on the other hand, for those who havent drove a long time since they got their licence...i dunno what to say abt them.. KEEP 10 METERS AWAY FROM THEM! IF THEY DECIDE TO PARK BESIDE YOUR CAR, PRAY THAT NOTHING HAPPENS!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well its their car... if they dun let u drive, then... u also can't do anything. the only good idea i can think of is to offer to chauffer them around, so that they get to see u drive, and while doing that, impress them by being extra careful and cautious, don't drive fast, and maybe they'll change their mind.</div>
