            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Epilogue, Part 1/2 </strong><br><br>Usually, all along i thought the hot black coffee blends well with white creamer.<br>The white creamer blends the black coffee into a very rich aroma taste of coffee - Yes i've been drinking coffee with creamer since 13 years ago everyday. But now, the white creamer doesn't blend with the cold black coffee anymore, leaving a picture of coffee no more...<br><br><strong>22nd Dec, 6.35pm </strong><br>"Hey, how's the contest? can i go?" I said<br><br>"Ya, but i think it will be quite late. If someone can come and fetch me then .."<br><br>I paused for a moment before replying "Do i have to pay for the entrance fee, i come and fetch you lor or see how".<br><br>"No need la, come and fetch me can already la. no need no need i take cab with friends you good rest at home"<br><br>"See how first la" i replied<br><br>Shortly after the conversation, i messaged her "Add oil Baobei, i send you home later"<br><br>She replied "thanks, Love u dear "<br><br>I drove home.<br><br><strong>22nd Dec, 9.45pm</strong><br>My phone rang. I got a call from her sis saying that her aunt isn't feeling well and ask if it is convenient to send her to the clinic since the neighborhood clinic closed.<br><br>I did that. Knowing the situation is not too good. I send her an sms, saying that her aunt is sick and hope she learn to think more. And she replied 'thank u and told me not to fetch her cause it will be late'<br><br>After the jab, i got to her house and rest for a while<br><br>An hour later, i recieved a call and she called to ask if everything is ok.<br>I said its fine and she told me that the party might end at 12.30 am or  1 am plus plus and call me later and see how cause she afraid that i am too tired..<br><br>Thinking that everything will change and i usually dislike her to party till late night.. i took up the courage and made up my mind that i must be there for her and send her home as she got work tomorrow too. And i am on long weekend so its perfectly alrite for me to forgo my early sleep.<br><br><strong>23th Dec 12.15am</strong><br>The traffic is so smooth that i have reached in 20 mins time.<br>I sms her to let her know that i am there.<br>I waited .. have a cup of coffee and saw my gf's friend. We had a short chat and asked what time the whole thing is ending. She said 'not sure still not finished' and we bid goodbye saying that see her later.<br><br><strong>23th Dec 12.45am</strong><br>After the hot coffee, it started to rain.<br>I went back to retrieve a pair of umbrella thinking that she might be out anytime and hoping she and her friends would not get drenched.<br><br><strong>23th Dec 1.00am</strong><br>I waited and still no news.<br>I called and called her umpteen times<br>I just dun know why her phone can be ringing in one moment and the other i hear 'there is no response from the subscriber mobile phone, please leave a ..'<br><br>I hang up and called and it started ringing again.<br><br><strong>23th Dec 1.20am</strong><br>The call was picked up. However, its not my gf. Its another guy. he told me to wait a moment. And I could hear my gf screaming excitingly in the background.<br>She told me this when the phone was passed to her hands.<br><br>"Sorry, i know u waited so long but can u go home first cause haven't finished."<br><br>"Do you have work tomorrow?" I retorted<br><br>"Yes, i have but no choice. Will be late end at 1am plus plus. Its ok. i can share cab with my friends you go home and rest first dun wait for me"<br><br>"Do you know what time is it? " Glancing at my watch.<br><br>"Sorry, really sorry" she apologized<br><br>"Ok, ok anything". I hunged up the phone in a fit of anger.<br><br><strong>23th Dec 1.25am</strong><br>I walked to the carpark and look at my watch again.<br>Hey she said 1 am plus since i am here, i think i can wait. i thought to myself..<br>I tried to call her but to no avail. The phone was ringing and there is no response.<br><br>As i walked in further, the phone is in emergency call mode.<br><br>Really in a fit of anger. I drove the car back.<br>While driving, i keep thinking should i break up with her<br>???<br><br><strong>23th Dec 2.00am</strong><br>I reached home and started to pack her things in a plastic bag. A small one.<br>And realise i cant do with a small one but a big one.<br>I was hoping to see her after she comes back and let her explain to me what happen before i pass her stuff back. Maybe i won't pass it to her afterall.<br><br>Anyway, i sent her sms to say that i will be waiting for her house void deck.<br>1. Concerning about her safety<br>2. to let her explain why she treat me this way asking me to go back<br><br><strong>23th Dec 2.15am</strong><br>A Taxi passed by and here i was sitting there anxiously to see her in the cab which i think i have tried to lied to myself because it is impossible to get to her house in such as short time - I was right, there was only a driver in the cab.<br><br><strong>23th Dec 2.30am</strong><br>As i waited and waited some vans passed by, some cars passed by some bikes passed by. Different engine sounds - and yes i was hoping for a diesel one, a  cab, maybe.<br><br><strong>23th Dec 2.45am</strong><br>The more i think the more it just doesn't sound good to me.<br>i just banished the thoughts of going overseas with her during the new year and put the foreign curriencies into the bag too.<br><br>Next comes the neo print. and nexts comes off all the photos of mine and hers in my phone..<br><br><strong>23th Dec 3.00am</strong><br>A cab arrived finally and finally. I got to see her.<br>She did not see me. I saw her. Right beside her was a guy!The guy saw me but i looked away. Afterwards, they disappeared from my line of sight...<br><br><strong>23th Dec 3.05am</strong><br>I thought maybe the guy send her home because its too late and anyway, i press for the lift and my heart beating twice as it is hoping my deduction was right... but wait a minute.. why does he take so long? should be downstairs by now...<br><br><strong>23th Dec 3.07am</strong><br>I saw him. It was his ex. his face was red and his arms are around my gf waist and my gf played along swinging from left to right and right to left.<br>They never thought they will be caught by surprise.<br><br>When he saw me, he pushed her away. They looked at me and was very surprised. I tossed the bag of stuffs onto the floor and said to her .<br><br>"Return to you!" and stomped off.<br><br>After i got off, she used her house phone to called me.<br>I didn't pick up the first call but the second<br>and she pleaded "Please listen to me.."<br><br>"We have nothing to say between us" was my firm reply and hung up the phone.<br><br>After a few minutes, she said "my handphone battery is dead and i will wait for you at your house void deck till u come or till morning."She hung up<br><br>i spend about 10 minutes cooling down and took up the courage to see what she got to explain.<br><br>She just cried that saying that sorry she did'nt know why she did that and she have been drinking a little and him too.<br><br>She started to cry and said why other bf can go and support her and why can't i? I tell u to go home cause i afraid u too tired.. and.. this week you hasn't been calling me and when i was sick you didn't even ask me whether i took medicine.. and .. when i was sick she did called me and sms me to take medicine ..<br><br>But now its not the point of medicine.. i forgot to reply to her medicine case as she has been going home very late and fall sick. I didn't know why i didn't cared about her anymore.<br>Nonetheless..<br>I got even more angry and said "No both of you were'nt drunk when he saw me he pushed you away! He was more sober than you"<br><br>She got nothing to say but cried and i took the lift up.<br><br>And i said "Enough enough, i will not forgive u... this is not the first time!! we will break up today!!"<br><br>I took the lift up.<br>She cried terribly very badly and my heart start to grow soft and concern about her safety.<br><br>I didn't go back to my house and i press the '1' button to go meet her again.<br>But somehow the lift stops at every level before going to level '1'<br><br>I go to her and see her cry and cry and we had a conversation in the park again..<br><br>I said "This is not your first time! You know the last time when you lied to me and went over to your ex house? I dun love you as much as before anymore."<br><br>She said "she was sorry"<br><br>"How can i ever trust u again?" I questioned her.<br><br>She didn't reply and started to say how bad she was and how good i was and how i treat her coldly recently (which i admitted)<br><br>"What about him" I questioned again.<br><br>"I have no feelings for him. The person i love is u"<br><br>Ridiculous! "Then why you can't spare a thought for me when you and him are hugging together? if you want to break you can say there is no need to do all these things!"<br><br>"Do you know, i dun cried anymore when i say break up.." and she started to rewind again. saying how this like and why its like this and she said i wanted to ditch her long ago and this time is just right.. That's why I have no feelings.<br><br>We have a long chat before i walked her back to her house.<br><br><strong>23th Dec 5.00am</strong><br>I walked her to her doorstep and she opened the door but didn't lock it.<br>I just stood that and cried bitterly. She came and hug me saying that she was sorry .. she will change.. she know its her fault.. and i cried more.. she asked me to give her a chance. she love me and she really needs me and she can't do without me... (I just recieved a msg from her younger sis saying that her da jie still crying and dun know what to do. I did not reply and my vision blurred and keep on typing) I said to her its all too late. Too late...<br><br>She hugged me even tight afraid that i will push her away. I hugged her once more.. and said maybe we dun meet.<br><br>She asked me whether i am going overseas with her. And i shook my head.<br><br>I was holding to both of her hands refusing to let go and she appeared wanting to go inside the house.. I said i was confused i am not willingly to let her go. And finally after while i let go my hands and walked her back to her doorstep and said to her. "I send you to work tomorrow.."<br><br>"She replied she can't work tmr cause she in such a bad state maybe take leave"<br><br>and i walked home....<br><br>it was 6.00am in the morning and i thought i closed my eyes but its still open..wondering and hoping its a nightmare all along-but it wasn't...<br><br></div>
