But think u can sue him if u see him taking snapshot of u. Just tell police that's he's invading your privacy can liao.</div>

There were some who questioned whether it was invasion of privacy...but it seems that if the guy doesn't use the pic to do other 'abnormal' stuff such as 'altering the pic' etc or tarnish the reputation of the gal...then it's seems nothing can be done to him.</div>
