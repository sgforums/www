            <div class='col-md body'>Think there r many bros out there who understands why ppl cheat. Lotsa reasons to it but sometimes they r just excuses  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I think a fling is when u have some kind of attraction to someone but u din go all the way. Maybe just spending time together more than u should. Cheating would probably mean sex.<br><br>But for ladies who despise all these acts by men, take a little time to think. Not all men who cheat or have flings did it intentionally. Sometimes it's becos of frustration n being deprived of attention which may lead to these things.<br><br>I've got friends who cheat becos of just being plain horny but I've got friends who r model husbands or bfs but due to insensitivity or frustration from their partner, they succumbed to another woman. Men have needs n feelings too. Just like women. Dat's why both gender cheats. It cannot be avoided n it will exist no matter how we like it or hate it. Just gotta accept it.<br><br>Honestly i enjoy the company of women n I get lots of attention from them. My gf stays wif me n she know abt this. But she knows dat I'm not doing anything funny. She knows dat she's not giving me enough attention due to work n she's trying to change her schedule to accomodate me. Dat way I'll have less reasons to go out wif the ladies n spend more time wif her.<br><br>I hope this can help some of the ladies understand how some men feel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are girls out there who purposely target guys in relationships. They find the act of taking someone else's bf away from them and breaking up their r/s a sign of superiority over the other gal. I can personally vouch for it because i have frenz like tat and I myself had a few encounters.<br><br>Some gals find another guy in a relationship extremely attractive. And they feel if they can actually cause a r/s to sour and win the guy over, it proves they are better than his prev. gf. And i have female frenz despite knowing full well that i have a gf persist in "courting" me asking me to accompany them to all sorts of occasions and seizing and chance to get intimate. saying things like "no strings attached", just f*ck buddies and a host of other social issues<br><br>Just another point of view to add to the thread.

They find the act of taking someone else's bf away from them and breaking up their r/s a sign of superiority over the other gal. I can personally vouch for it because i have frenz like tat and I myself had a few encounters.<br><br>Some gals find another guy in a relationship extremely attractive. And they feel if they can actually cause a r/s to sour and win the guy over, it proves they are better than his prev. gf. And i have female frenz despite knowing full well that i have a gf persist in "courting" me asking me to accompany them to all sorts of occasions and seizing and chance to get intimate. saying things like "no strings attached", just f*ck buddies and a host of other social issues<br><br>Just another point of view to add to the thread. And no i declined them all nicely, despite how tempting the proposition might be. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>You are a model bf.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
