After hours of hacking through the undergrowth, they came upon a group of natives. Their hands were promptly tied up and the three of them were brought back to the leader of the tribe. "You have committed a sin by trespassing on the sacred land of our ancients. According to our custom, the only way for the three of you is to find 10 fruits of the same kind before this incense finishes burning and  bring them back here! Only the one that reaches here first will be spared!" With that, the tribe leader lights a stick of incense, assigns a guard to each guy and the three guys scurry off to find the fruits that the leader wants. Alex comes back by half an hour with 10 watermelons and realises that he is the first one. He heaves a sigh of relief. Robert comes in second after an hour with 10 apples and Danny comes in last after an hour and a half with 10 bananas. In a flash, Robert and Danny were killed by poison darts shot from the natives' blowpipes. "You came in first! As promised, you will be spared."said the leader. There was tears in Alex's eyes as he realised that he would not have to die.  "However,in accordance to our custom, you will only be released after the fruits you have chosen have been stuffed in your arse!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

The first of the twosome teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole.<br>Indeed, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in evident agony. The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize. She explained that she was a physical therapist: "Please allow me to help. I'm a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you'd just allow me!" she told him earnestly.<br>"Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I'll be all right. I'll be fine in a few minutes," he replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal position still clasping his hands together at his crotch. But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help him. She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, she loosened his pants, and she put her hands inside. After a short massage she asked him, "How does that feel?"<br>To which he replied: "It feels great, but my thumb still hurts like hell!"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bob joins a very exclusive nudist colony. On his first day he takes off his clothes and starts wandering around. A gorgeous petite blonde walks by him and the man immediately gets an erection. The woman notices his erection, comes over to him grinning sweetly and says, "Sir, did you call for me?"<br>Bob replies, "No, what do you mean?"<br>She says, "You must be new here; let me explain. It's a rule that if I give you an erection, it implies you called for me."<br>Smiling, she then leads him to the side of a pool, lays down on a towel, eagerly pulls him to her and happily lets him have his way with her. Bob continues exploring the facilities. He enters a sauna, sits down, and farts. Within a few moments a huge, horribly corpulent, hairy man with a firm erection lumbers out of the steam towards him. The Huge Man says, "Sir, did you call for me?"<br>Bob says, "No, what do you mean?"<br>"You must be new here, it is a rule that when you fart, it implies you called for me."<br>The huge man then easily spins Bob around, bends him over the bench and sodomizes him.<br>Bob rushes back to the colony office.<br>He is greeted by the smiling naked receptionist. "May I help you?"<br>Bob says, "Here is your card and key back. You can keep the $500 joining fee."<br>"But Sir, you've only been here a couple of hours; you only saw a small fraction of our facilities..."<br>"Listen lady, I am 67 years old, I get a hard-on once a month, but I fart 15 times a day."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A elderly, single, third grade teacher was informed she would have to teach sex education.<br>She was quite upset and refused the assignment. She didn't think she would actually be able to talk about the subject. Eventually, she changed her mind as the alternative was to be fired.<br>On the first day of school she drew a woman's body on the blackboard, pointed to the chest and asked the class "Does anyone know what this is called?"<br>Jane, who was sitting in the first row, raised her hand and answered "It's called a 'breast' and my mommy has two of them!"<br>"Very good," said the teacher. Then she drew a male body on the board, pointed to the groin, and asked "Does anyone know what this is called?"<br>This time Billy raised his hand. "I know what it is! It's called a 'penis' and my daddy has two of them."<br>"That's the right name," said the teacher, but I don't think your daddy has two of them."<br>"Yes he does!" said Billy. "He has a little one that he uses to pee, and big one he brushes mommy's teeth with!"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was an old man named Bozo, and all he had was a female donkey. One day he wins the lottery and gets $50,000. He doesn't know what to do with his money, so he decides to spend a night in a five star hotel. He asks for the finest room and starts going up the stairs with his female donkey. The manager sees him and asks where he's going with his donkey.<br>"Anywhere I go, she goes."<br>"I'm sorry, sir," said the manager, "but you can't take the donkey upstairs. Leave it down here with us and we'll take good care of her." So Bozo goes up to his room and opens the door. Everything is made of gold, there is a table full of food, and a huge television. He doesn't want to ruin anything so he takes his raggedy coat off and sleeps on the floor. The next morning the manager comes up to the room and asks how his night was.<br>''Great!'' replied Bozo. ''How much do I have to pay?'' he asks.<br>''One thousand dollars for the food.''<br>''But I haven't touched the food."<br>''It was right there, so you should have. Two thousand dollars for the TV."<br>''But I didn't even know how to turn the damn thing on!''<br>''It was there, so you should have. Five thousand for sleeping on the bed."<br>''But I slept on the floor!''<br>''It was there. Your total is eight thousand dollars."<br>''You owe me ten thousand dollars for screwing my donkey.''<br>''But sir, I didn't screw your donkey.''<br>''It was there. You should have!''<br><br></div>
