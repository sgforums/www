            <div class='col-md body'>ONTROVERSIAL CASE ENDS IN IRAN<br>On death row for killing rapist, she'll be freed for $100,000<br><br>SHE was sentenced to death for killing a police chief as he raped her at a resort.<br><br>But now Iranian mother-of-two Afsaneh Nowrouzi is set to be freed.<br><br>The officer's family has agreed to accept US$62,500 ($102,000) in cash compensation in lieu of their right under Iranian law to insist she be put to death.<br><br>The deal ends a seven-year legal wrangle that sparked outrage among women's activists both within Iran and around the world.<br><br>Nowrouzi, now 34, stabbed Moghaddam to death in 1997. She also cut off his penis and placed it on his chest.<br><br>She claimed she was defending herself as Moghaddam raped her.<br><br>At the time, Moghaddam was the police chief on the tourist island of Kish.<br><br>In Iran, a married woman who is raped can be convicted of adultery and sentenced to death. If she kills the rapist, she can be tried for murder and sentenced to death.<br><br>The Kish court rejected Nowrouzi's self-defence claim and sentenced her to death in 2001, sparking international outcry.<br><br>In response, Iran's head judge, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, ordered an indefinite stay of that verdict last year.<br><br>Judiciary officials then urged Moghaddam's mother and his two children to show mercy to Nowrouzi - which Nowrouzi's lawyer said she would never ask for.<br><br>DIDN'T WANT MERCY<br><br>'The victim's family members did a good thing... despite my client's refusal to request mercy,' Mr Abdolsamad Khorramshahi said.<br><br>Under Iranian law, the death penalty is waived once the victim's family agrees to a cash settlement. Nowrouzi will be freed soon.<br><br>Prominent activist Sara Irani commented: 'Nowrouzi's freedom will give new breath to women to find the courage to stand up for their rights and defend themselves.' - AP.</div>
