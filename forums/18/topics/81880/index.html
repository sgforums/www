It may be just that at that point in time she is unsure she wants to that the friendship you two had to a new level (read: boy-girl relationship).<br><br>You did the right thing by respecting her choice then. Now since her original concern is over, try asking her again. If you don't do it you will never know the result.

IMHO, what she meant was you got chance and she willing to try it out but not then as there were restrictions / inhibitions then. She was probably very very very concerned with her study and fear that a relationship will disrupt her studies.<br><br>Now that you are both eng and available, start asking her out again, but don't cheong straight to the point, warm up first, build up momentum from there, rekindle the old flame, make her see stars, you'll know what to do...  for all you know, she is waiting for you all this while that's why still single.<br><br>So........... mai tu liao!!!<br>Wish you good luck!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
