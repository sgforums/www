            <div class='col-md body'>July 24, 2005, ST<br>First video game to get 'porn' rating<br><br>Explicit sex scenes found embedded in No.1 game<br><br>SAN FRANCISCO - THE gaming world is now in a tizzy.<br><br>First video game to get 'porn' rating<br><br>Webscan<br><br>The US video game industry's decision to give an adult-only rating to the best-selling Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas because of explicit sexual content could signal the start of a crackdown on raunchy games.<br><br>The rating change followed intense pressure from politicians and media watchdogs.<br><br>Retailers reacted swiftly - Wal-Mart Stores, Target and Best Buy said last week that they would pull all copies from their shelves nationwide.<br><br>Rockstar Games, the producer of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, said it has stopped making the current version of the game, which includes graphic sex scenes that can be unlocked with an Internet download.<br><br>The game was released last October with an M (mature) rating, for players aged 17 and older.<br><br>Senator Hillary Clinton applauded the change but said she was disturbed that the sexual content appeared on store shelves in the first place.<br><br>She asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and called on the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) to do more to police game content.<br><br>'Apparently the sexual material was embedded in the game. The company admitted that,' Mrs Clinton said. 'The fact remains that the company gamed the ratings system.'<br><br>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was last year's top console game, selling more than 5.1 million copies in the US.<br><br>Rockstar's parent company, New York-based Take-Two Interactive Software, acknowledged for the first time that the sex scenes were built into the retail version of the game.<br><br>Company officials previously suggested that a modification created by outsiders added the scenes.<br><br>'The editing and finalisation of any game is a complicated task and it's not uncommon for unused and unfinished content to remain on the disc,' said Take-Two spokesman Jim Ankner.<br><br>In a statement, ESRB chief Patricia Vance said the sex scenes were programmed by Rockstar 'to be inaccessible to the player'.<br><br>But she also acknowledged that the 'credibility and utility' of the industry-run board's initial M rating had been 'seriously undermined'.<br><br>Rockstar said it would provide new labels to any retailer willing to keep selling the games and offer a downloadable patch to fix the sexual content in PC versions.<br><br>The company is also working on a new and more secure version to be rated M.<br><br>A computer program known as Hot Coffee allows users to unlock the sex scenes.<br><br>Such modifications - or mods - are wildly popular among the hardcore gaming community, and have been shown to extend the retail longevity of games.<br><br>Half-Life, for example, is still sold years after its release because of a Counter-Strike mod that allows for detailed counter-terrorist shoot-'em- up action.<br><br>Take-Two's president Paul Eibeler said 'the decision to re-rate a game based on an unauthorised third party modification presents a new challenge for parents, the interactive entertainment industry and anyone who distributes or consumes digital content'.<br><br>The Parents' Television Council, one of several media watchdogs that have criticised Rockstar and the ESRB, called on the game publisher to recall the game and offer refunds.<br><br>'I tip my cap to that first step of showing responsibility,' said Mr Tim Winter, the council's executive director.<br><br>'We need to be getting to the bottom of this coding issue. How did it get into that game? How did it get past the ratings board?'<br><br>Take-Two said net sales could drop by more than US$50 million (S$80 million) this quarter. -- AP<br></div>
