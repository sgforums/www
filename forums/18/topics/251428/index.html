A beautiful bird, I'm sure you'll agree,and it's an absolute steal at only $20."<br><br>"Why is it that cheap?" the woman asks.<br><br>"Well", replies the assistant, it used to live in a brothel and as a result its language is a touch fruity."<br><br>"Oh, I don't mind that", said the woman, making her mind up, I'm broad minded and it'll be a laugh having a profane parrot". So saying, she<br>buys the parrot and takes him home.<br><br>Nice safely in his new home, the parrot looks around and squawks at the woman, "F==k me,a new brothel and a new madam."<br><br>"I'm not a madam and this isn't a brothel" says the woman indignantly.<br><br>A little later the woman's two teenage daughters arrive home.<br><br>"A new brothel, a new madam, and now new prostitutes" says the parrot<br>when he sees the daughters."<br><br>"Mum, tell your parrot to shut-up,we're not prostitutes" complained the girls, but they all see the funny side and have a laugh at their new pet.<br><br>A short while later,thewoman's husband comes home.<br><br>"Well f==k me, a new brothel, a new madam, new whores, but the same old clients.

            <div class='col-md body'>The out-of-state couple are camping on the shores of a lake near a tiny hamlet. The young wife, stunningly built, decides to give the local town folk a thrill by sunbathing in the nude.<br><br>"That's OK with me, honey," says her husband. "I'll go get some wood for the fire." About thirty minutes later, the husband returns to the campsite and finds his wife in tears. One of her breasts has been painted green, the other red and her ass is blue.<br><br>"What on earth happened to you, dear?" he asks.<br><br>"Some of those rednecks from town came over and told me they don't allow any nakedness around these parts. Then they gave me this paint job!"<br><br>"Damn those trouble-makers! I'll fix them!" the husband shouts. He rides into town and finds the rednecks in a bar.<br><br>"Who is the SOB who painted my wife red, green and blue!", he shouts.<br><br>A huge redneck, about 6'-8," steps forward, a shotgun in his hand. "I did it," he bellows. "What you got to say about it?"<br><br>The husband answers meekly, "I just wanted you to know the first coat of paint is dry."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was a businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else.<br><br>So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.<br><br>"Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except Â…" said the old man, and then he stopped.<br><br>"Except what?" asked the businessman.<br><br>"Nothing, nothing," said the old man.<br><br>"C'mon, tell me! I need something!" protested the businessman.<br><br>"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick,'" the old man said.<br><br>"So what's up with this voodoo dick?" the businessman asked.<br><br>The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, "Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!"<br><br>The old man said, "But you haven't seen what it'll do yet."<br><br>He pointed to a door and said "Voodoo dick, the door."<br><br>The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, "Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"<br><br>The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.<br><br>The businessman said, "I'll take it!"<br><br>The old man resisted and said it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, "Voodoo dick, my pussy."<br><br>He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.<br><br>After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said "Voodoo dick, my pussy!" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.<br><br>After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.<br><br>The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, "Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A little old lady went into the Bank of Canada one day carrying a bag of money. She insists that she must speak with the President of the bank to open a savings account because it's a lot of money. They finally get her into the presidents office and he asks her how much she would like to deposit. She says she has $165,000 and then dumps it out of the bag onto his desk. The president was surprised and of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asks her. The old lad says, "I make bets". The president replies, "Bets? What kind of bets?" and she says, "for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square". "Ha!" says the president, "That's a stupid bet, you can never win that kind of bet". The old lady says,"So, would you like to take my bet?" "Sure," says the president, "I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!" The little old lady says "OK, but since there is a lot of money involved is it OK with you if I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 AM to witness?" "Sure" says the president. That night the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again, thouroughly checking them out until he was sure that there is no way his balls are square and that he will win the bet. THe next morning at 10 AM the little old lady appears with her lawyer at the president's office. She introduces the lawyer to the president and repeats the bet, that $25,000 says the president's balls are square. The president agrees with the bet again and the old lady asks him to drop his pants so they can see. The president does this. THe little old lady looks closely at his balls and then asks if she can feel them. "Well, OK" says the president, $25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure". Then he notices that the lawyer is quietly banging his head against the wall and he asks the old lady , "What is wrong with your lawyer?" She replies, "Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that by 10 AM today I'd have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hands!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Farmer Brown goes out one day and buys a brand new stud rooster for his chicken. The cocky young rooster walks over to the old rooster and says: "OK, old fellow, time to retire." The old rooster says: "You can't handle all these chickens, look what it did to me!" The young rooster replies: "Now don't give me a hassle about this old man. It's time for the old to step aside and the young take over, so take a hike!" The old rooster says: "Aw, c'mon, just let me have those two old hens over there in the corner. I won't bother you." The young rooster snarls: "Scram! Beat it! You're washed up! I'm taking over!" The old rooster thinks for a minute and then says to the young rooster: "I'll tell you what, young fellow, I'll have a race around the farm house with you. Whoever wins the race gets full domain over the chicken coop." The young rooster smiles: "You know I'm going to beat you, old man. So just to be fair, I'm even going to give you a head start." The two roosters line up in back of the farm house; a hen clucks "Go!" and the old rooster takes off running. About 5 seconds later the young rooster takes off after him. They round the front of the farm house and the young rooster is inches behind the old rooster and gaining fast. Farmer Brown, sitting on the porch, hearing the commotion looks up and sees what's going on. Quickly, he grabs his shotgun and BOOM! The young rooster is blown to smithereens! Farmer Brown sadly shakes his head in disgust: "Damn! That makes the third gay rooster I bought this week."</div>
