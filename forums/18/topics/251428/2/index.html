            <div class='col-md body'>Tarzan had been living alone in his jungle kingdom for 30 years with only apes for company, and suitably shaped holes in trees for sex. Jane, a reporter, came to Africa in search of this legendary figure. Deep in the wilds she came to a clearing and discovered Tarzan vigorously thrusting into a jungle oak. She watched in awe for a while.<br><br>Finally, overcome by this display of animal passion Jane came out into the open and offered herself to him. As she reclined on the wild grass Tarzan ran up to her and gave her a big kick in the crotch. In pain she screamed 'What the hell did you do that for?'

            <div class='col-md body'>Two young guys were picked up by the cops for smoking dope and appeared in court on Friday before the judge. The judge said, "You seem like nice young men, and I'd like to give you a second chance rather than jail time. I want you to go out this weekend and try to show others the evils of drug use and get them to give up drugs forever. I'll see you back in court Monday."<br><br>Monday, the two guys were in court, and the judge said to the 1st one, "How did you do over the weekend?" "Well, your honor, I persuaded 17 people to give up drugs forever." "17 people? That's wonderful. What did you tell them?" "I used a diagram, your honor. I drew two circles like this...<br><br>o O<br><br>...and told them this (the big circle) is your brain before drugs and this (small circle) is your brain after drugs." "That's admirable," said the judge.<br><br>"And you, how did you do?", he asked the second boy, "Well, your honor, I persuaded 156 people to give up drugs forever." "156 people! That's amazing! How did you manage to do that?!?", "Well, I used a similar approach. (draws two circles)<br><br>O o<br><br>I said (pointing to the small circle) "this is your asshole before prison, ..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by GIB:</div><div class="quote_body">There was a businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else.<br><br>So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.<br><br>"Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except Â…" said the old man, and then he stopped.<br><br>"Except what?" asked the businessman.<br><br>"Nothing, nothing," said the old man.<br><br>"C'mon, tell me! I need something!" protested the businessman.<br><br>"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick,'" the old man said.<br><br>"So what's up with this voodoo dick?" the businessman asked.<br><br>The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, "Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!"<br><br>The old man said, "But you haven't seen what it'll do yet."<br><br>He pointed to a door and said "Voodoo dick, the door."<br><br>The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, "Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"<br><br>The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.<br><br>The businessman said, "I'll take it!"<br><br>The old man resisted and said it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, "Voodoo dick, my pussy."<br><br>He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.<br><br>After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said "Voodoo dick, my pussy!" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.<br><br>After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.<br><br>The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, "Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!"<br></div></blockquote>wasnt there a Flash vid for this on newgrounds?</div>

She looked up and noticed that a man her age had walked up, placed his blanket on the sand nearby and began reading a book.<br><br>Smiling, she attempted to strike up a conversation with him. "Hello, sir, how are you?"<br><br>"Fine, thank you," he responded, and turned back to his book.<br><br>"I love the beach. Do you come here often?" she asked.<br><br>"First time since my wife passed away last year," he replied, and again turned back to his book.<br><br>"Do you live around here?" she asked.<br><br>"Yes, I live over in Suntree," he answered, and then resumed reading.<br><br>Trying to find a topic of common interest, Sarah persisted. "Do you like pussycats?"<br>With that, the man threw his book down, jumped off his blanket onto hers, tore off both their swimsuits and gave her the most passionate ride of her life!<br><br>As the cloud of sand began to settle, Sarah gasped and asked the man, "How did you know that was what I wanted?"<br><br>The man replied, "How did you know my name was Katz?"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man goes to a restaurant and orders a chicken dish. By the time the food is ready and he is about to eat, the waiter comes back and says, "Sir, I'm afraid there has been a mistake. You see, that police officer who is sitting at the next table is a regular customer of ours and he usually orders the same dish. The problem is, this is the last chicken in the house. I'm afraid I'll have to take this dish to him and arrange for another dish for you!"<br><br>The guy gets really upset and refuses to give up his food. The waiter walks over to the other table and explains the situation to the officer. A few minutes later the officer walks over to the man's table and says, "Listen and listen good. That is MY chicken you are about to eat and I'll warn you, whatever you do to that chicken I'll do the same to you. You pull out one of its legs, I'll pull out one of yours. You break one of its wings, I'll break one of your arms!"<br><br>The man calmly looks at the chicken, then sticks his middle finger in the bird's rectum, pulls it out and licks it. He then gets up, drops his pants, bends over and says, "Go ahead!"<br><br></div>
