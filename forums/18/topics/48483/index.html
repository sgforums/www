Romantic attraction and feelings of love for someone elevates our dopamine and serotonin levels, which causes feelings of elation and loss of appetite. When we get to the point of feeling attachment and a more long-term phase of love, our bodies generate more oxytocin (known as the "hormone of love").<br><br>Lust, sex drive and an increasing appetite for sex is generated by increased testosterone levels in both men and women. Heightened levels of testosterone inspire a feeling of focused attention and sexual arousal and because men are more inclined to have one-night stands and women tend to connect love and sex to a greater degree, we men are confused between women' needs and wants.
