            <div class='col-md body'>Hey everyone. I've been trying to astral travel on my own without any help for a few weeks, but everytime the separation occurs, i wake up with a jolt. I found a few methods which I am going to attempt tonight. Hope this helps. It should be really fun.<br><br>In astral projection the conscious mind leaves the physical body and moves into the astral body. The astral body is one of our subtle bodies.  In astral projection you remain attached to your physical body by a silver "umbilical type" cord. Some people see the cord and others do not.<br>You are aware of things you encounter along the way while out of your body.<br>To astral project, as with all out-of-body experiences - one must feel totally relaxed, clothing fitting comfortable, reclining is best.<br><br><strong>The Monroe Technique </strong><br><br>Relax the body. According to Monroe, "the ability to relax is the first prerequisite, perhaps even the first step itself" to having an OBE. (out of body experience). This includes both physical and mental relaxation.<br><br>Enter the state bordering sleep. This is known as the hypnogogic state. Once again, Monroe doesn't recommend any method of doing this. One way is to hold your forearm up, while keeping your upper arm on the bed, or ground. As you start to fall asleep, your arm will fall, and you will awaken again. With practice you can learn to control the hypnogogic state without using your arm. Another method is to concentrate on an object. When other images start to enter your thoughts, you have entered the hypnogogic state. Passively watch these images. This will also help you maintain this state of near-sleep. Monroe calls this Condition A.<br><br>Deepen this state. Begin to clear your mind. Observe your field of vision through your closed eyelids at the blackness in front of your. After a while you may start to notice light patterns. These are simply neural discharges. They have no specific effect. Ignore them. When they cease, one has entered what Monroe calls Condition B. From here, one must enter an even deeper state of relaxation which Monroe calls Condition C-- a state of such relaxation that you lose all awareness of the body and sensory stimulation. You are almost in a void in which your only source of stimulation will be your own thoughts.<br><br>The ideal state for leaving your body is Condition D. This is Condition C when it is voluntarily induced from a rested and refreshed condition and is not the effect of normal fatigue. To achieve Condition D, Monroe suggests that you practice entering it in the morning just as you are getting up, or after a short nap.<br><br>Enter a state of Vibration. This is the most important part of the technique, and also the most vague.<br><br>Many projectors have noted these vibrations at the onset of projection. They can be experienced as a mild tingling, or as if electricity is being shot through the body. Their cause is a mystery. It may actually be the astral body trying to leave the physical body.<br><br>Learn to control the vibrational state. Practice controlling them by mentally pushing them into your head, down to your toes, making them surge throughout your entire body, and producing vibrational waves from head to foot. To produce this wave effect, concentrate on the vibrations and mentally push a wave out of your head and guide it down your body. Practice this until you can induce these waves on command. Once you have control of the vibrational state, you are ready to leave the body.<br><br>Begin with a partial separation. The key here is thought control. Keep your mind firmly focused on the idea of leaving the body. Do not let it wander. Stray thoughts might cause you to lose control of the state.<br><br>Now having entered the vibrational state, begin exploring the OBE by releasing a hand or a foot of the "second body". Monroe suggests that you extend a limb until it comes in contact with a familiar object, such as a wall near your bed. Then push it through the object. Return the limb by placing it back in to coincidence with the physical one, decrease the vibrational rate, and then terminate the experiment. Lie quietly until you have fully returned to normal. This exercise will prepare you for full separation.<br><br>Dissociate yourself from the body. Monroe suggests two methods for this. One method is to lift out of the body. To do this, think about getting lighter and lighter after entering the vibrational state. Think about how nice it would be to float upward. Keep this thought in mind at all costs and let no extraneous thoughts interrupt it. An OBE will occur naturally at this point.<br><br>Another method is the "Rotation Method" or "roll-out" technique. When you have achieved the vibrational state, try to roll over as if you were turning over in bed. Do not attempt to roll over physically. Try to twist your body from the top and virtually roll over into your second body right out of your physical self. At this point, you will be out of the body, but next to it. Think of floating upward, and you should find yourself floating above the body.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Here is another technique for astral travel. I bluntly call it the '4 in the morning technique' I have tried many methods over the past two years, and this one had the best results. I have written it out in steps. It involves getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning - a little extra effort, but it is by far worth it. The reasons for waking up at 4 in the morning are:<br><br>- You will be drowsy and it will be easier to clear your head.<br>- You will drift off to sleep much faster.<br>- You will have gotten up for a purpose; your body and mind will be tuned to what you are trying to achieve.<br><br>A note to those who are skeptical about astral travel but still wish to try it: You must keep an open mind while attempting to project. Any negative thoughts or feelings will certainly hold you back. Stay positive, open, and willing.<br><br>The technique is as follows:<br><br>Set your alarm for 4 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>Allow yourself to drift asleep.<br><br>At four in the morning, the alarm will wake you. Get out of bed turn on the light, and splash water on your face. Dry your face with a towell.<br><br>After about two minutes, get back in bed. Lie on your back.<br><br>You will most likely be feeling groggy and tired. Your mind will be eager to get back to sleep.<br><br>Close your eyes, and clear your mind. This should be easy because you are so tired.<br><br>Now, imagine you are standing somewhere in your room. Perhaps in the far corner. Vividly see yourself standing there. Know that you are standing there, and that your body is still lying on the bed. Focus your whole mind on this concept.<br><br>While working on that, begin a simple affirmation in your head. "I am going to astral travel. I am going to leave my body." Say it in your head, over and over, while imagining you are on the other side of the room.<br><br>While you are doing this, you will begin to drift back to sleep. Slowly, your mind will begin to cloud. Make sure that the concept of standing elsewhere in your room is the last thing that goes through your mind before you are asleep.<br><br>You may experience one or more of the following sensations:<br><br>- Floating<br>- Sinking<br>- Vibrations<br>- A bright white/blue light<br>- A rushing or popping sound<br>- Starnge noises; someone calling your name<br>- A jolt<br><br>If you experience one or more of these sensations for the first time, it may be frightening. But know that they are positive signs; signs that let you know you're about to project.<br>Almost always, apon feeling a strange sensation, the person trying to project gets such a fright that he/she is jolted back into their body. If this happens to you, allow yourself to fall asleep and try again the next night, knowing presently that there is nothing to fear.<br><br>If you find yourself outside your body, do not stay out for too long the first time. Float about your room, become used to the physics of the astral plane, and then will yourself back into your body. You can start exploring after a 24 hour break. There may be a guide waiting for you. This guide will watch over you and take you where you please. Talk briefly with the guide, and say you will project again in 24 hours.<br><br>When 24 hours pass, you will be ready to explore and venture further than your room. You may not even have to use drifting off to sleep as a medium for astral travel.<br><br>If, after several attempts, you still have not projected, do not be detered. It is likely you will have felt some of the sensations above while trying, and this is a positive sign. You must remember that it is a matter of willpower. You can't just casually attempt to project in a one-off scenario. Think about astral travel throughout the day. Buy a book on astral travel. Attempt to astral travel everynight. Eventually, I gurantee, you will get out.<br></div>

I have actually felt this cord once when i was almost falling asleep i felt something pulling at me and i got afraid and i woke up with a jolt. this jolt is really the astral self falling back into your physical body.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very good questions, people. The cord WILL break if you stretch it. The closer your astral self is to your physical self, the thicker your cord is. But as you move farther away, the cord starts to thin out anf eventually it'll break and your consciousness will be seperate from your physical body and you'll become a comatose person, meaning your heart still beats but your brain is dead.<br><br>Supernatural? There is nothing Â“supernaturalÂ” in the Universe, except our limited understanding of Nature. What we think we Â“knowÂ” on Earth now is just a tiny drop in the Ocean of Knowledge.</div>

When science couldn't explain things, we blame them on the wonders of God. Now I myself experienced Astral Projection while i was wide awake last night and I couldn't have been hallucinating, and I KNOW it is real. YOU do not know, because you have not tried. Your mind has been living in comfort since the day you were born and minor or major changes in life may prove too much for you to adapt to, so your mind simply shuts off from these changes, telling you that there is no need for you to believe all this, that you should be living the way you are living now. For people to make great breakthroughs in science and engineering, they have to think beyond. They have to realize that things are not so simple in our world, that new and wonderful things could be made if we just stretch our mental capability a little farther, and THAT is what you have to do. Learn to accept all theories, whether they be true or false. Do not only believe what your mind tells you to believe, because if you do that, you will never be successful in life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course Astral Projection can be explained by science, because it IS science. What we think we know on Earth now is just a tiny drop in the Ocean of Knowledge. Science has not gathered enough information and evidence on this topic yet, for 2 reasons: They are skeptical, or, they do not see this as something they should be bothered with. But I tell you, once you try astral projecting and succeed, even for a few seconds, like what happened last night to me, you will be an instant believer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And, there are those who resent astral travel and/or refuse to believe it is possible at all. Perhaps for one or more of the following reasons:<br><br>1. They beleive that astral experiences are actually dreams. (Wrong. Astral travel is a fully conscious experience, as thousands of people have confirmed worldwide.)<br><br>2. They beleive that those who claim to astral travel are under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. (Wrong again. Drugs or Alcohol actually hinder astral travel. Furthermore, most people who astral travel began astral travelling at a very young age - 6 to 12.)<br><br>3. They beleive what people describe as an astral experience is actually an alien abduction. (Thrice wrong. Although, waking paralyzed, seeing strange entities, and being engulfed in a blinding white light may be likened to an alien abduction, such symptoms are components of the first stages of astral travel.)<br><br>4. They beleive people claim to be able to astral travel for publicity, money, or attention in general.</div>
