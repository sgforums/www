I'm just a stranger on the net to everyone. </blockquote>If I don't trust the net, then should I trust u ? U never show me anything and I don't really supposed I have any grounds to believe in it. If it is found to be true, then why keep it a secret ?!? Don't u want to prove noah's ark exists ? Won't it strengthen the faith of your people ? Displaying such secrecy already admits it cannot be under scrutiny of world scientists.<br><br><blockquote>I'm sure they have it. What I said about Noah's Ark is all I know, and I think testing to see how old it was proves a lot. </blockquote>A dust bowl can be as old as anything. In fact I was doubting if the age is really tat old since u show me nothing. Talk is cheap u know. I can say I knew a deity from a certain religion which can prove all the other religion wrong. but I have to keep it hush and a secret so u cannot get to see him. In fact I can even say I keep a pink unicorn and a purple hippo who is as old as noah's ark but I cannot tell u anything more about it.<br><br><blockquote>What happened to "Where's the wood?" I thought you said there was no evidence. With no ship, how do you even calculate that? </blockquote>I had read the bible and in it they stated the <span style="font-style: italic;">exact dimensions and material for the ship</span>. Using simple mathematical calculations, it was found tat the a pair of the whole beetle race will requires a ship much greater than the size of noah's ark. And tis doesn't even include the water and food required for survival. So we don't even need to see wood. Even if the scripture is true about noah's ark (IMO highly likely to be false), it was still impossible to carry all the animals.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yoyoyo, this is getting too outta hand. Come on, why drag youselves into an endless spiral of philosophical argument about evolution over such a simple topic? Cool down guys, cool it! There are other things which are more worthwhile in accomplishing, not some argument here which will not arrive at any tangible result in the forseeable future...<br><br>Just my two-hundredths of a dollar worth...</div>
