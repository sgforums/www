I am sure you choose to marry your wife because you intend to live with her till you are old and grey, so there is no point looking for another relationship.<br><br>So if you choose to flirt, you must be in control of the game, and not let the game take control of you.<br><br>My advice to you is, if you want to flirt, make sure you go for a good one...at least if you wife finds out, she will not get so angry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
