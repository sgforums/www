Her husband cannot satisfy her sexually in bed while with me, she gets all the orgasms she wants. I know it is morally wrong (thanks to all the preachers out there with karma and retribution and what-not) but there are no strings attached and we enjoy each other tremendously, even after so many years.<br><br>This is not fiction - just to let you guys know that affairs with married men/women are common. A woman has sexual needs, like it or not, and if the husband cannot give it to her or is a numbskull who does not know how to make her orgasm, is she expected to live her whole life not knowing what it is like?? Can you imagine a woman who has NEVER experienced iorgasm? Forget all the moralistic preaching and how right or wrong. We are not here to discuss that. Just for your interest, the husband has this really big penis and she calls it a 'stupid penis' cos can't make her come! Goes to show that size isn't everything if the thing to which it is attached does not know how to use it!
