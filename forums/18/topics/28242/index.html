            <div class='col-md body'>Once: upon a time, a perfect man and a perfect woman met.<br>&gt;After a perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life<br>&gt;together was, of course, perfect.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving their<br>&gt;perfect car along a winding road, when they noticed someone at the<br>side<br>&gt;of the road in distress. Being the perfect couple, they stopped to<br>help.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to<br>&gt;disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple<br>&gt;loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Soon they were driving along delivering the toys.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect<br>&gt;couple; and Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of them survived the<br>&gt;accident.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question: Who was the survivor?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(Scroll down for the answer. Trust me, it's worth it)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Answer: The perfect woman survived. She's the only one who really<br>&gt;existed in the first place.<br>&gt;Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a<br>&gt;perfect man.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;**** Women stop reading here, that is the end of the joke.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;**** Men keep scrolling.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the woman must have<br>&gt;been driving. This explains why there was a car accident.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Men Keep scrolling<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;By the way, if you're a woman and you're still reading, this<br>illustrates<br>&gt;another point: Women never listen.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Add ons:<br><br>A young executive was leaving the office at 6 p.m.then he found<br>the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; CEO standing in front of a shredder with a piece of paper in his<br>hand.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "Listen," said the CEO, "this is a very sensitive and<br>important=0D<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; document, and my secretary has left. Can you make this thing<br>work?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "Certainly," said the young executive. He turned the machine on,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; inserted the paper, and pressed the start button.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "Excellent, excellent!" said the CEO as his paper disappeared<br>inside<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; the machine. "I just need one copy."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lesson I - Never, never assume that your BOSS knows everything.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; **************************************************************<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; A crusty old man walks into a bank and says to the teller at the<br>&gt;window:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "I want to open a damn checking account."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; To which the astonished woman replies:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "I beg your pardon, sir; I must have misunderstood you. What did<br>you<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; say?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "Listen up bitch! I said, I want to open a damn checkingaccount<br>right<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; now!"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "I'm very sorry sir, but we do not tolerate that kind of language<br>in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; this bank."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Having said this, the teller leaves the window and goes over to<br>the<br>&gt;bank<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;manager to tell him about her problem customer. They both return and<br>the<br>&gt; &gt;manager asks the old geezer:"What seems to be the problem here?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "There's no damn problem, sonny," the elderly man says. "I just<br>won<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 50 million bucks in the damn lottery and I want to open a damn<br>&gt;checking<br>&gt; &gt;account in this damn bank!"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "I see," says the manager thoughtfully. "And you're saying that<br>this<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; bitch here is giving you a hard time?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lesson II - If you are RICH, you can get away with almost<br>anything.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; **********************************************************<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; An American and a Japanese were sitting on the plane on the way<br>to LA<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; when the American turned to the Japanese and asked, "What kind of<br>-ese<br>&gt;are<br>&gt; &gt;you?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Japanese confused, replied, "Sorry but I don't understand<br>what you<br>&gt; &gt;mean."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; The American repeated, "What kind of -ese are you?" Again, the<br>&gt;Japanese<br>&gt; &gt;was confused over the question. The American, now irritated, then<br>&gt; &gt;yelled,"What kind of -ese are you . Are you a Chinese, Japanese,<br>&gt;Vietnamese!<br>&gt; &gt;, etc......???"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Japanese then replied, "Oh, I am a Japanese."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; A while later the Japanese turned to the American and asked What<br>kind<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; of 'key' was he. The American, frustrated, yelled, "What do you<br>mean<br>&gt;what<br>&gt; &gt;kindof '-key' am I?!"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Japanese said, "Are you a Yankee, donkee, or monkee?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lesson III - Never insult anyone.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; **********************************************************<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; There were these 4 guys, a Russian, a German, an American and<br>a=0D<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; French,who found this small genie bottle. When they rubbed the<br>bottle,<br>&gt;a<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;genie appeared. Thankful that the 4 guys had released him out of the<br>&gt;bottle,<br>&gt; &gt;he said, "Next to you all are 4 swimming pools, I will give each of<br>you a<br>&gt; &gt;wish.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; When you run towards the pool and jump, you shout what you want<br>the<br>&gt;pool<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;of water to become, then your wish will come true." The French<br>wanted to<br>&gt; &gt;start.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; He ran towards the pool, jumped and shouted "WINE". The pool<br>&gt;immediately<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;changed into a pool of wine. The Frenchman was so happy swimming and<br>&gt; &gt;drinking from the pool.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Next is the Russian's turn, he did the same and shouted, "VODKA"<br>and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; immersed himself into a pool of vodka.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; The German was next and he jumped and shouted, "BEER". He was so<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; contented with his beer pool.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; The last is the American. He was running towards the pool when<br>&gt;suddenly<br>&gt;he<br>&gt; &gt;steps on a banana peel. He slipped towards the pool and shouted,<br>&gt; &gt;"SHIT!!!!!!!........."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lesson IV - Think twice before you say something, because<br>sometimes<br>&gt; &gt;accidents do happen.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;Hello, my name is Basmati Kasaar. I am suffering from rare and<br>&gt;&gt;deadly<br>&gt;&gt;diseases, poor scores on final exams, extreme virginity, fear of<br>&gt;&gt;being<br>&gt;&gt;kidnapped and executed by anal electrocution, and guilt for not<br>&gt;&gt;forwarding out 50 billion phuqing chain letters sent to me by<br>&gt;&gt;people who<br>&gt;&gt;actually believe that if you send them on, then that poor 6 year<br>&gt;&gt;old<br>&gt;&gt;girl in Arkansas with a breast on her forehead will be able to<br>&gt;&gt;raise<br>&gt;&gt;enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her<br>&gt;&gt;off<br>&gt;&gt;to the travelling freak show.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you and<br>&gt;&gt;everyone you send "his" email to $1,000? How stupid are you? Ooooh,<br>&gt;&gt;looky here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get<br>&gt;&gt;laid by<br>&gt;&gt;every Playboy model in the magazine! What a bunch of crap.<br>&gt;&gt;So basically, this message is a big fat UP YOURS to all the people<br>&gt;&gt;out<br>&gt;&gt;there who have nothing better to do than to send me stupid chain<br>&gt;&gt;mail<br>&gt;&gt;forwards.<br>&gt;&gt;Maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my apartment<br>&gt;&gt;and<br>&gt;&gt;taunt me in my sleep for not continuing the chain letter which was<br>&gt;&gt;started by Jesus in 5 A.D. and was brought to this country by<br>&gt;&gt;midget<br>&gt;&gt;pilgrims on the Mayflower and if it makes it to the year 2006,<br>&gt;&gt;it'll be<br>&gt;&gt;in the Guinness Book of World Records for longest continuous streak<br>&gt;&gt;of<br>&gt;&gt;blatant stupidity. Screw them.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;If you're going to forward something, at least send me something<br>&gt;&gt;mildly<br>&gt;&gt;amusing. I've seen all the "send this to 50 of your closest<br>&gt;&gt;friends, and<br>&gt;&gt;this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a<br>&gt;&gt;nickel from some omniscient being" forwards about 90 times. I don't<br>&gt;&gt;give<br>&gt;&gt;a damn. For crying out loud! Show a little intelligence and think<br>&gt;&gt;about<br>&gt;&gt;what you're actually contributing to by sending out forwards.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;========THE FOUR BASIC TYPES OF CHAIN LETTERS========<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Chain Letter Type 1:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;(scroll down)<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Make a wish!!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;No, really, go on and make one!!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Oh please get real, that person will NEVERRR go out with you!!!<br>&gt;&gt;dream<br>&gt;&gt;on.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Wish something else!!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Not that, you pervert!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Is your finger getting tired yet?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;STOP!!!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Wasn't that fun? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hope you made a great wish <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Now, to make you feel guilty, here's what I'll do.<br>&gt;&gt;First of all, if you don't send this to 5096 people in the next 5<br>&gt;&gt;seconds, you'll be raped by a mad goat and thrown off a high<br>&gt;&gt;building<br>&gt;&gt;into a huge lump of sheit.

Here's how it goes...<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;*Send this to 1 person:<br>&gt;&gt;One person will be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid<br>&gt;&gt;chain<br>&gt;&gt;letter.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;*Send this to 2-5 people:<br>&gt;&gt;2-5 people will be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid<br>&gt;&gt;chain<br>&gt;&gt;letter.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;*Send this to 5-10 people:<br>&gt;&gt;5-10 people will be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid<br>&gt;&gt;chain<br>&gt;&gt;letter, and may form a plot on your life.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;*Send this to 10-20 people:<br>&gt;&gt;10-20 people will be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid<br>&gt;&gt;chain<br>&gt;&gt;letter and will napalm your house.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Thanks!!!! Good Luck!!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;---------------------Chain Letter Type 2---------------------------<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Hello, and thank you for reading this letter. You see, there is a<br>&gt;&gt;starving little boy in Baklaliviatatlaglooshen who has no arms, no<br>&gt;&gt;legs,<br>&gt;&gt;no parents, and no goats. This little boy's life could be saved,<br>&gt;&gt;because<br>&gt;&gt;for every time you pass this on, a dollar will be donated to the<br>&gt;&gt;Little<br>&gt;&gt;Starving Legless Armless Goatless Boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen<br>&gt;&gt;Fund.<br>&gt;&gt;Oh, and remember, we have absolutely no way of counting the emails<br>&gt;&gt;sent<br>&gt;&gt;and this is all a complete load of bull. So go on, reach out. Send<br>&gt;&gt;this<br>&gt;&gt;to 5 people in the next 47 seconds. Oh, and a reminder - if you<br>&gt;&gt;accidentally send this to 4 or 6 people, you will die instantly.<br>&gt;&gt;Thanks<br>&gt;&gt;again!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;---------------------Chain Letter Type 3---------------------------<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Hi there!! This chain letter has been in existence since 1697. This<br>&gt;&gt;is<br>&gt;&gt;absolutely iNcReDiBLe because there was no email then and probably<br>&gt;&gt;not as many sad pricks with nothing better to do. So this is<br>&gt;&gt;how it works:<br>&gt;&gt;Pass this on to 25,790 people in the next 7 minutes or something<br>&gt;&gt;drastically horrible will happen to you like:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;*Bizarre Horror Story #1..<br>&gt;&gt;Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on Saturday. She had<br>&gt;&gt;recently received this letter and ignored it. She then tripped in a<br>&gt;&gt;crack in the sidewalk, fell into the sewer, was gushed down a<br>&gt;&gt;drainpipe<br>&gt;&gt;in a flood of SHIT, and went flying out over a waterfall. Not only<br>&gt;&gt;did<br>&gt;&gt;she smell nasty, she died.<br>&gt;&gt;This Could Happen To You!!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;*Bizarre Horror Story #2..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter in his mail and<br>&gt;&gt;ignored it. Later that day, he was hit by a car and so was his<br>&gt;&gt;boyfriend (hey,<br>&gt;&gt;some people swing that way). They both died and went to hell and<br>&gt;&gt;were<br>&gt;&gt;cursed to eat adorable kittens every day for eternity.<br>&gt;&gt;This Could Happen To You Too!!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Remember, you could end up just like Pinsley and Bip. Just send<br>&gt;&gt;this<br>&gt;&gt;letter to all of your friends, and everything will be okay.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;---------------------Chain Letter Type 4---------------------------<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;As if you care, here is a poem that I composed. Send it to every<br>&gt;&gt;one of<br>&gt;&gt;your friends.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;/++FRIENDS++\<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;A friend is someone who is always at your side,<br>&gt;&gt;A friend is someone who likes you eventhough you stink of holy<br>&gt;&gt;shyt, and<br>&gt;&gt;your breath smells like you've been eating cow dung all your whole<br>&gt;&gt;life,<br>&gt;&gt;A friend is someone who likes you eventhough you're as ugly as a<br>&gt;&gt;hat<br>&gt;&gt;full of assholes,<br>&gt;&gt;A friend is someone who cleans up for you after you've soiled<br>&gt;&gt;yourself,<br>&gt;&gt;A friend is someone who stays with you all night while you cry<br>&gt;&gt;about<br>&gt;&gt;your sad, sad, miserable life,<br>&gt;&gt;A friend is someone who pretends they like you when they really<br>&gt;&gt;think<br>&gt;&gt;you should be raped by mad goats, then thrown to vicious dogs,<br>&gt;&gt;A friend is someone who scrubs your toilet, vacuums your whole<br>&gt;&gt;house<br>&gt;&gt;and then gets the check and leaves and doesn't speak much<br>&gt;&gt;English...<br>&gt;&gt;-no, sorry that's the cleaning lady,<br>&gt;&gt;A friend is not someone who sends you chain letters because he<br>&gt;&gt;wants his<br>&gt;&gt;wish of being rich to come true.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Now pass this on! If you don't, you'll never have sex ever again.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;The point being?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;If you get some chain letter that's threatening to leave you<br>&gt;&gt;sexless or<br>&gt;&gt;luckless for the rest of your life, delete it.<br>&gt;&gt;If it promises you something free if you "forward this to 10<br>&gt;&gt;people,"<br>&gt;&gt;delete it.<br>&gt;&gt;If it's funny, by all means, send it on! Don't piss people off by<br>&gt;&gt;making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth,<br>&gt;&gt;who's been tied to a dead elephant for 27 years, and whose only<br>&gt;&gt;saviour is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this<br>&gt;&gt;mail, otherwise you'll end up like Miranda. Right?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Now forward this to everyone you know, otherwise you'll be eaten by<br>&gt;&gt;rabid squirrels when you leave your house tomorrow.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;My apology if you're not laughing.</div>
