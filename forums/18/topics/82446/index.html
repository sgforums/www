            <div class='col-md body'>What is the most embarrasing "Truth or Dare" you have came across?<br><br>A little, not too exciting self experience to start the ball rolling.  I was in secondary school where we have this "Truth or Dare" thing.  It was a official school event, so nothing absurd was initiated.  I was being chosen a Dare &amp; I have to ask for a passerby's phone number &amp; it was already embarrasing enough!<br><br>Then when I was older, I went to a chalet with a group of friends, all guys.  Again, someone suggested Truth or Dare.  Because we were all enclosed in a chalet late at night, we only played the Truth part.  Expected questions like "which girl you like", "are you still a virgin" were asked.  But because it was an all-guy event, nothing really embarrasing was encountered.<br><br>So I thought, if there were girls in that chalet event, I think I would have really felt the real fury of the game.  There will certainly be questions that will make me go dumb.<br><br>How about you people?  Any interesting &amp; embarrasing experiences you wanna share?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Played this game with some of my colleague during a drinking session. More like a true and truth thingy. All of us had beers with us... each of us one by one will say something true about themselves, of course something unusual...then after he/she said it out... those whose answer is opposite will have to drink. Think its more of a get-to-know session... we end up talking about R(A) things like "i have never masterbate before", "i have had sex on e plane before", a guy say he have kissed a guy before. another one sayign she has taken nude pictures by a photographer. One say she has never blow a guy before in a restaurant and stuff like that...very fun and intersting way to know your colleagues better <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Another daring game is passing of coasters by mouth..as in sucking e coasters so it doesnt drop and pass it to e next person... end up either u kiss a girl or a guy... e other one was passing ice from mouth to mouth..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  rreally fun time during younger days</div>
