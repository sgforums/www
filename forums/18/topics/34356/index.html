            <div class='col-md body'>One time at chalet : a friend went into bathroom and I went out for a walk. While walking behind, heard the sound of water, so I climbed to the window and was surprised that I could see inside the bathroom!<br>I saw her sitting on the toilet bowl pissing with her panties down, everything else off. Her eyes were closed, and her expression was of relief. After she was done she took off the panties, wiped herself and dumped it into the dustbin. She then walked to the shower, I could see her nipples and pubic hair.<br>I walked away, arms tired, but feeling as if I had a wonderful and personal experience with her that nobody else will share with her.</div>
