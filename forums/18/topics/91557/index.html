            <div class='col-md body'>Well, to be millionaire by 30, is reachable. A fact is tat there are a lot of millionaire but not really what u all think that when have a million then can buy this and buy tat and do anything u like, don't forget that nowsday things don't get cheap. so most of the millionaire are still working either self employed or an employee.<br><br>The techniques is simple, forget all those motivation course tat waste your money. First, as wat rich dad say, money is just an idea. is how u found an money produced machine. it can be ur job, ur business, ur investment, as long money coming in.<br><br>Secondly, try your best to save 2/3 of ur money, forget all those financial planning for watsoever. All those are poor man thinking. plan of saving for old age etc. Don't forget when u rich, do u still need to plan any retirement or any money for any case? So the rule is be rich and forget bout wat all the financial planning advisor say, becz 90% of them maybe even poorer than u.<br><br>Thirdly, as an employee, find ways to increase ur market value, market value = your income level.<br><br>Fourth, investment, try learn investing skill and then apply ur money on saving for better ROI, let's be conservative if u had well learn and good risk management if ur money able to generate average 20% for 10 yrs, then u already an millionaire. For me, i think with good knowledge and risk analysis skill which u had to self study and attend for course. my investment can go 50% to 80% average yearly. so how fast you want to be millionaire, is depend on u.<br><br>Fifth, Contribute to the society, try spend $100 buying all foods and needs to old folk home urself, see their smile when they receiving, i tell u tat really make u rich.<br><br>Well, as a conclusion, is not a dream to be millionaire. is all depend on u all. willing to take the steps and later gratification <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Like me, i have been longing a PDA phone, but i'm keep on holding because i know with tat money go to my investment will give me a better and faster way to reach my financial goal.<br>All the best guy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>is this idiot-proof?<br><br>tell me when you have reached your first million.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by vivasg:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, to be millionaire by 30, is reachable. A fact is tat there are a lot of millionaire but not really what u all think that when have a million then can buy this and buy tat and do anything u like, don't forget that nowsday things don't get cheap. so most of the millionaire are still working either self employed or an employee.<br><br>The techniques is simple, forget all those motivation course tat waste your money. First, as wat rich dad say, money is just an idea. is how u found an money produced machine. it can be ur job, ur business, ur investment, as long money coming in.<br><br>Secondly, try your best to save 2/3 of ur money, forget all those financial planning for watsoever. All those are poor man thinking. plan of saving for old age etc. Don't forget when u rich, do u still need to plan any retirement or any money for any case? So the rule is be rich and forget bout wat all the financial planning advisor say, becz 90% of them maybe even poorer than u.<br><br>Thirdly, as an employee, find ways to increase ur market value, market value = your income level.<br><br>Fourth, investment, try learn investing skill and then apply ur money on saving for better ROI, let's be conservative if u had well learn and good risk management if ur money able to generate average 20% for 10 yrs, then u already an millionaire. For me, i think with good knowledge and risk analysis skill which u had to self study and attend for course. my investment can go 50% to 80% average yearly. so how fast you want to be millionaire, is depend on u.<br><br>Fifth, Contribute to the society, try spend $100 buying all foods and needs to old folk home urself, see their smile when they receiving, i tell u tat really make u rich.<br><br>Well, as a conclusion, is not a dream to be millionaire. is all depend on u all. willing to take the steps and later gratification <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Like me, i have been longing a PDA phone, but i'm keep on holding because i know with tat money go to my investment will give me a better and faster way to reach my financial goal.<br>All the best guy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote></div>
