Not only will you get monthly positive cash flow, you get the capital appreciation as well.<br>1st asumption : bank will lend you money given you are not rich in the first place<br>2nd assumption : people will always fight to rent in your property<br>3rd assumption : property price go up never come down<br><br>If you are one of those who invest in Japan property in the 80s or Singapore in the 90s, I think you are bleeding till today<br><br>Option trading ... not for the fainted hearted.<br>especially to write a naked option.<br><br>Personally, I invest in stock and 50% of the portfolio gone recently due to rising crude oil price, dare no invest in bond fund as interest rate set to go up,<br>dare not speculate property due to the falling price index, China market seem so shaky now, USD shows further weakness....<br><br>that why I stick to the most fundamental ....

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, i agree with all of u saying here, especially all those books i personally meant for knowledge, but whether it able to be apply is all depend on ourself.<br><br>Well, as i mention in my first posting, that is my technique of accumulating wealth, to be frank, i think i on the right track.<br><br>Friend, i'm sorry u lost  50% of ur money in stock. but i do lost too. Well all come back to the real fundamental tat is risk management, we can't control the price, but we can control amount we are prepared to lost, and the amount we want to keep the profit.<br><br>As i trully believe just earn one income doesn't make u a million worth. But if really possible at least save 1/2 of ur salary for saving and investment. I don't believe all those financial planning of saving 200 or 300 a mth tat provide a sound future. That doesn't make sense to me unless they want to keep working till one leg step into the coffin.<br><br></div>

A fact is tat there are a lot of millionaire but not really what u all think that when have a million then can buy this and buy tat and do anything u like, don't forget that nowsday things don't get cheap. so most of the millionaire are still working either self employed or an employee.<br><br>The techniques is simple, forget all those motivation course tat waste your money. First, as wat rich dad say, money is just an idea. is how u found an money produced machine. it can be ur job, ur business, ur investment, as long money coming in.<br><br>Secondly, try your best to save 2/3 of ur money, forget all those financial planning for watsoever. All those are poor man thinking. plan of saving for old age etc. Don't forget when u rich, do u still need to plan any retirement or any money for any case? So the rule is be rich and forget bout wat all the financial planning advisor say, becz 90% of them maybe even poorer than u.<br><br>Thirdly, as an employee, find ways to increase ur market value, market value = your income level.<br><br>Fourth, investment, try learn investing skill and then apply ur money on saving for better ROI, let's be conservative if u had well learn and good risk management if ur money able to generate average 20% for 10 yrs, then u already an millionaire. For me, i think with good knowledge and risk analysis skill which u had to self study and attend for course. my investment can go 50% to 80% average yearly. so how fast you want to be millionaire, is depend on u.<br><br>Fifth, Contribute to the society, try spend $100 buying all foods and needs to old folk home urself, see their smile when they receiving, i tell u tat really make u rich.<br><br>Well, as a conclusion, is not a dream to be millionaire. is all depend on u all. willing to take the steps and later gratification <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Like me, i have been longing a PDA phone, but i'm keep on holding because i know with tat money go to my investment will give me a better and faster way to reach my financial goal.<br>All the best guy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote></div>
