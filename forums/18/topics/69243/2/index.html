If the guy can't deal with it, for God's sake trade him in for someone who can.<br><br>Let me put it this way: If the bugger's so piss-weak that he can't handle you not being a virgin, why would you want to spend the rest of your life with him?  Along the way, five bucks will get you ten that you will face much bigger challenges than this - not to jinx you, but examples of this are loss of jobs, deaths in the family, miscarriages, all sorts of health problems, maybe even a war.  If he can't deal with you not being a virgin, do you think he's got the balls to stand by you "for better or for worse, in sickness and in health"?

            <div class='col-md body'>I usually avoid bar topics unless they are constructive...<br><br>Azreal's simplistic views aside, there needs to be an understanding on the issue of putting virginity in it's correct context. It would be irrational to argue that it does not matter for the truth was, if it was an nonissue, nobody would bother with it.<br><br>Being despoilt certainly has its obvious advantages, for a person who does not have a history of sleeping has a far, far lower risk running into problems associated with a havoc lifestyle, as well as some rather abstract concepts of keeping oneself soley for The One.<br><br>Anyway, the important thing is that, yes we need to understand that we should not condemn or reject anybody regarding their virginity status, but at the same time we must not disregard the virtues of being sexually pure at the same time, one needs to be clear on the two.<br><br>The truth is, if sex was just a physical act with no emotional or spirtual (for those of you who are religious) implications, it would not be taken any more seriously then eating or drinking. Are you sure it's exactly wise to engage in such behaviour outside the vows of marriage? With all those people who have given up their bodies in expectation for the best and then got burned when the relationship dried up, they can tell you it's not the prudent thing is not to do. If we had respect for ourselves, we would not treat our bodies so lightly, unless we have no reason to live that is.<br><br>Especially in an age where people regard each other as pieces of meat and have little respect for each other as human beings, it isn't exactly unwise for people of either gender to keep themselves pure until marriage, to avoid getting into all kinds of trouble and being used by people who just want them for their flesh.</div>
