            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by unwantedgal:</div><div class="quote_body"></div></blockquote>I seriously do not think that the women's charter issue can be compared to the apartheid situation that was prevalent in South Africa. The feminist movement has been around for decades and women today are equally if not more educated then some men. Do you not see women climbing the corporate ladder, do you not see female graduates coming through the university hallways. Yes there is no denying the fact that in some areas like medicine whereby the male-female quota was just lifted that the fields are just starting to even. However, I believe that considerations on implementing that quota in the first place was not based on the capabilities of women as being inferior to men but on society's needs. Women of today have little or no difficulties getting an education and jobs as compared to their male counterparts. Yet the Women's charter requires a sizable portion of a manÂ�fs fortunes to be given to his wife. If you really desire equality that much, why not just make it out on your own. Would women starve to death just because you don't get your alimonies?<br><br>You might say again that the giving of that portion of wealth is in remuneration/compensation or whatever of the time and effort the women have devoted to the family. With both parties working long hours nowadays, is it a certainty that the woman places more emphasis on maintaining the family. With all that cry of not focusing on the material aspects and not valuing the girl as a commodity, why should the contributions of either party in a marriage be weighed? Shouldn't it be based on mutual trust and commitment? In addition, regardless of what is being said that women look for character and responsibilityin a guy, there are still girls (a whole lot of them in fact) that look at how deep a guy's pockets are before deciding on continuing a relationship. My female lecturer once said to a whole bloody auditorium of university students (many of which are girls) that goes Â�gGirls if a guy has deep pockets he's your boyfriend. If he doesn't than he's just a friend." This was immediately followed by a furry of nods and claps and approving laughs by them. If girls look for guys with money (so called financial security), what's wrong with guys asking for purity in a girl? You might say that not all girls are materialistic but similarly there are guys that don't mind if his girl is not a virgin. This is on top of the fact that I believe that guys should value their virginity as well.<br><br>Lastly, I too am a proponent of freedom of choice. Everyone chooses his own path in life.  However, if a guy wants a virgin for his other half then you jolly well respect that and move on. It is meaningless to say that just because you or somebody else had engaged in premarital sex once that you should not be blamed (your intention/act theory). You made a wrong choice, you live with it. It is up to that fella to determine if can accept you. It is pointless to complain that life is unfair because it never was and never will be. There are areas that are advantageous to females and areas that favor the males. You with all your intelligence should be able to know that.<br></div>
