Whatever it is ... no one gonna judge you for being a virgin or non virgin .... it's your choice, your life and your relationship....<br><br>What i was also trying to put across was... if anyone expects his wife to be a wholesome virgin ... he too should save himself for her... well ... simply, if you want a virgin, make sure that yourself is one ... else save all the crap about dun feel comfy that you are not your wife's first....  I guess that's only fair .... Dun you agree ?? Everything just works both ways ... how you think a virgin girl will feel if she knows that she is not her husband first either? Haven't it occur to you that she may also feel uncomfy about it initially?<br><br>Education as you mention, teaches you moral values and inpart knowledge, ultimately it's still your choice ... i believe they also teaches you things like use a condem to be safe etc ... all they are just trying to tell you is value your body, dun sleep around and have multiple partners.... abstinace is the best to avoid STDs and unwanted preg ... well it is coz you aren't doing anything at all.... but isn't that a knowledge ...?? it doesn't force or tell you that you MUST do this or that else you are not doing things that are morally correct..... guess we have different views ... it's not how I was eduacated .... I'm very sure my education serves me well. It's a matter of choice ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alright. this whole discussion is getting a little too heated. i'm sure no one is saying that a girl or a guy should be giving their virginity away just like that. similarly, i don't think that what they are advocating is promiscuity. if two people are in love, and are responsible i.e. are not rash, it really is up to them what they decide. of course, i don't think that really young 'kids' should be doing it - for one, it's statutory rape as long as the girl is below the age of 16; for another, they just are not mature enough at that age to make such decisions. i mean, you guys have to think about whether you are prepared to support the girl or marry her should she get pregnant.<br><br>and yes, girls will mind in a way that their bfs are not virgins, but as long as they are really in love, it doesn't matter that much. of course, it's not a nice thought to have that your bf's been around the block a few times, but as long as he's not cheating on you, and really loves and cares about you, the past shouldn't matter so much. if you are so hung up on a person's past, you'll be unable to see how they've grown from those experiences. for all you know, they may regret having done those things. it's not fair to condemn them for mistakes committed in youth. ("ah, the folly of  youth") you end up blinding yourself to who the person really is right now.<br><br>as for the fear of getting STDs and all that, that's what protection is for. it's not 100% fool-proof though, and that's why going for regular check ups is important.</div>

Simple analogies are made with perhaps little or no particular implications yet you almost flame such replies as if they were a personal insult to you.<br><br>Why is that so?<br><br>for this, please refer to springtime's reply. as she mentioned, it is the subconscious imagery that men has of women that i feel an urge to highlight. it is only when this subconscious biasness is highlighted and pointed out then can people understand that yes, they do perhaps view women as lower in status than men. Another thing about scrapping the women's charter. its a bit like the african apartheid situation. you may suddenly proclaim that white men and black men are to have the same status after years of slavery and unequal treatment. But by automatically opening the doors of university and education to the blacks, you have not eradicate the problem. they are still not able to enter coz years of subversion has caused them to think they are inferior to the whites, they are poorly educated and cannot compete on the same level. the quota for female medicine students has just been removed. this year. isn't that still a sign that there is inequality in society?<br><br>And why be so defensive?<br><br>oh well, but let's stop this whole feminist issue. peace. i was just very taken aback by mr jaws consistent comparision of women to material goods and i felt a need to highlight that subconscious inequality to the public.<br><br>You have always prompted and led the discussion and yet you divulge no information of your own. Would you share some of your opinions instead?<br><br>wait a minute, you said opinions right? not my factual background right? so i will just answer your question. i think that the world is judged on two things. the intention and the act itself. So if a person is a pervert and has all kinds of sexual thoughts, and have sex because he/she is lustful and cannot control, he/she is a person of lower moral values. If a person had sex frequently with many partners, then the actions tells a lot of his/her character. But if it was not with many and any partner, then he/she shoudln't suffer for it. It is a balance of the intention and the action, takign into account the frequency and the intensity of the elements.<br>Peace</div></blockquote></div>
