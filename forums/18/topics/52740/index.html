            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><strong>WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH ANAL STIMULATION? </strong><br><br>By M.J. Ecker<br><br>(Note: It's relatively easy to do this technique unsafely, so you must be very careful with it. We assume no liability for the technique of anal stimulation, and if you choose to perform it, do so at your own risk. Please exit if you are not interested in the idea of stimulating the anus.)<br><br>IF you've done a lot of reading on masturbation and orgasm Ã¢Â€Â” even within JackinWorld Ã¢Â€Â” you've probably come across references to anal stimulation. "Why would anyone want to stimulate their anus?" you may have asked. "I would never do that!"<br><br>Those feelings are quite understandable. First, for most people, that region of the body is a place they don't think about or deal with unless absolutely necessary. Second, there's a strong association between any kind of "anal sexuality" and homosexuality. But actually, it's a biological fact that for men (and perhaps women, too), stimulating the anus can have a significant effect on sexual pleasure and, especially, orgasm. If you don't want to explore this rather advanced region of sexuality, that's fine Ã¢Â€Â” do only what you feel comfortable doing. However, if you are in search for techniques to enhance your orgasm, you might want to read on.<br><br>This technique involves inserting something into the rectum through the sphincter, the ring shaped muscle that ordinarily keeps the anus closed. This is usually uncomfortable the first time you try it, but you get used to it relatively easily. Once inserted, the object (if placed properly) stimulates the prostate gland, which lies just outside the wall of the rectum. The prostate is one of the glands that makes seminal fluid, so it's definitely linked to your sex organs and can enhance the pleasure you get from them. More important, though, is the fact that when you have an orgasm, the sphincter contracts quite strongly Ã¢Â€Â” and there's something about a foreign object holding the sphincter partially open that can really do a number on your orgasm. The orgasm is definitely heightened, and may even last longer. You kind of have to experience it to understand it.<br><br>Now, onto the mechanics of the technique. What kind of object do you use? Well, that's actually pretty important. It's essential that you do this technique safely, because the anus and rectum are relatively delicate tissues, and you can injure yourself (perhaps seriously) if you don't take proper precautions. First of all, the object must be unbreakable. Don't even think about using a glass object, or anything that can shatter or break in half. Second, the surface of the object must be smooth. Some people use a finger or two Ã¢Â€Â” but even well-cut fingernails can scratch the lining of the rectum, so this isn't recommended (unless you wrap them in a condom or something similar). Third, the object must be shaped so that part of it is always outside your body; this will allow you to remove it easily. Never use any object that has even a chance of getting lost inside Ã¢Â€Â” if it does, it will likely mean an extremely embarrassing and unpleasant trip to the emergency room. So that kind of narrows down the possibilities. You just have to look around you and be resourceful. Something the diameter of 1/4" or 1/2" might be a good place to start. Later, if you want, you can graduate to larger objects. Make sure it's clean first, and if it has any edges or points that are even remotely non-smooth, a condom (or something similar) is highly recommended. Make sure there's no chance of the object breaking through the condom.<br><br>Lubrication is a requirement. Unlike the vagina, the rectum secretes no natural lubrication to speak of Ã¢Â€Â” so you have to use something. And you have to use it generously. A water-based personal lubricant is highly recommended; there aren't many things around the house that will work well or are absolutely safe. If you're in a pinch, it's possible to use a lubricated-style shaving cream or a thick lotion or skin cleanser (like cold cream) Ã¢Â€Â” however, both of these things contain many chemicals, and it's possible they'd be unsafe or irritating. Also, for this purpose, we don't recommend any oil-based lube, such as Crisco, grease, Vaseline, or cooking oil, because they don't easily rinse off. Whatever you use, make sure it's very mild on your skin. The surface of the rectum is much thinner than that of the skin, and you don't want anything to irritate it.<br><br>On to how you actually go about doing this: If you're going to try this technique, it has to be when you have plenty of time and privacy; don't do it when your wife or your mom is running to the post office! Also, if you need to go to the bathroom, now is definitely the time to do it! Once you're all set and you have your lube ready along with anything else you need for masturbation, with a finger, put a generous amount of lube on and around your anus, in a circle a little bigger than the diameter of the object you'll be using. Then apply a layer of the lube to the object. There's no way you can use too much lube, and you can definitely use too little Ã¢Â€Â” so pile that lube on!<br><br>Insertion is, of course, the most difficult part. Many of us have very deep psychological associations with the opening and closing of the sphincter Ã¢Â€Â” and to do this technique successfully, you need to kind of suspend those for a minute. Relaxation, as difficult as that may seem at this moment, is essential. If you're tense, your sphincter will be very tight, and insertion will be more difficult and more uncomfortable. This may seem silly or weird, but try to think of going to the bathroom, only in reverse. That's difficult, but if you do it right, that's exactly what it will feel like.<br><br>Make sure the end of the object definitely enters the rectum. Because you're not really comfortable with this yet, you'll tend to talk yourself into thinking it's in when actually it isn't. Your sphincter must definitely be held open a little for this to work.<br><br>Some people like to move the object around once it's inside, but all you need to do is leave it in. Be gentle! Don't go probing around roughly Ã¢Â€Â” you could hurt yourself! Your body will have a tendency to push the object out, especially if it's at all cone-shaped. So depending on how it's shaped, you may have to keep it in by holding it with a hand, or tightening your buttocks around the part of it that's outside you Ã¢Â€Â” or it may stay in without you doing anything at all.<br><br>Now all you need to do is masturbate normally. Your positions will be somewhat limited in order to keep the object inside. You might try gently repositioning the object (and yourself) to see what positions feel best. And make sure the object doesn't come out when you orgasm Ã¢Â€Â” that's the best part! You'll feel an increased intensity of the orgasm, and it will be centered on a larger area of your pelvis. You're simply getting more nerve endings involved Ã¢Â€Â” and that means more feeling.<br><br>For a lot of guys, anal stimulation is a tough pill to swallow, if you'll pardon the expression. It's difficult to put aside all of those associations from various times in your life, and all the things you equate with anal stimulation. If you are straight, understand that anal stimulation will not, in and of itself, "make you gay" Ã¢Â€Â” although it may, in truth, awaken other feelings in you or lead to other desires, all of which probably would have (or at least should have) come to the surface anyway. But it's likely that if you enjoy it, anal stimulation can just be another, more intense level to which you can take masturbation Ã¢Â€Â” like putting on headphones while listening to music, or driving fast, or having an intense conversation. You won't know if you don't try it.<br><br></div>
