Just<br>make sure that ur foreskin can roll back to reveal the head when<br>erected(it is still OK to hav ur foreskin covering the head when<br>erected, it will still function fine.)<br><br>2)Well it depends on ur preference. just make sure u clean ur<br>penis by rolling back the foreskin when bathing.<br><br>3) Err, any position u feel comfortable. But since u penis cure like a<br>banana when erected, then i suggest putting it facing downward<br>(just a suggestion)<br><br>4) What??!! As long as u don pee on ur pants, i don care!!!!<br><br>5) Ok lah, everyone penis somehow got curve a bit. urs curve like a<br>banana good what, next time can hit the gal G spot better, hehe.<br><br>6) White or yellow is OK. Any other color u better got pray to ur fav<br>god.<br><br>When, next time when u are older, don ask people how to F***, cos u will noe what to do(u noe, animal instincts??)</div>
