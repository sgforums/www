After that day, pilot went for his trip. His wife endure, no shower and even dun dare to change her panty.. one week pass... she endure so hard... then when the last day of the two weeks, she cannot endure it.. so she went down to drag any first man she saw and bring him (which is indian) back to have sex.  After that, the wife get so worried because the two dragons was gone while having sex. she told the indian but indian said "you dun have to worry, my love.. I very good in drawing, I can helps u to draw back the two dragons" On that actual night, the pilot returns and immediately asks his wife to remove her clothes..
