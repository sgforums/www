            <div class='col-md body'>I broke off wif him on v day jus because i think he's not sincere in getting and celebrating the day wif me. I feel that he simply celebrate wif me not because he loves me but because of the obligation. i called him and say nasty and hurting things to him and he never wanna clarify. Immediately few hours later, i call him and say sorry and wanted to patch back but he couldnt forgive me and say we are impossible.. we met up after his work but i dint force him back to me, instead he say he not worth my love and told me to give him time. when he's ready, he will chase me back. Initially i dont believe but i trusted and have faith wif him thus i believe and say will wait till he's ready.<br>However, things turn out so bad.. We did meet up once a week for a walk and movie. He bought things for me and treat me very good jus that we did not kiss and hug or call each other "dear". Last week, he change suddenly, he did not meet me up on his off day but i manage to patch back wif him as i waited at his house.<br>but jus this thursday, i saw him bringing a gal at my house void deck when he needs to pass me somethings. my friends ask him who tt gal and he reply that she's her colleague. Den i sms him and ask him did he treat me as his gf, y when i sms him, he never reply, when i call him he never pick up the call or say that he's busy. Sadly, he reply me that isnt it obvious that we are impossible and he does not want to continue anymore and call me to find someone else.. my heart sank to the bottom and it bleeds. i changed so much to satisfy his needs and give him the things tt he yearn for but in the end this is wad i get back..<br>we met up tt night and i beg him back cos i dont believe that he does not love me. I trusted him so much and love him deeply, already feel that he's the one i want forever.but he say tt gal whom i saw jus now was his gf, tt gal was 5 yrs older than him. he said that she takes care of him and very understanding. i called up that gal that night to clarify and she say my bf was not his bf.<br>Den, i wanted to see him the next day so i waited for him for almost 5 hrs. He said he will go sch on that day but he never as i waited at his sch and never see him so i waited for him at his house void deck. Sadly, my frien called him and tell him that i was waiting for him and he burst into anger. He was so frustrated and came down to see me. He say he was so terrify to see me and say that his love for me had died. I do not believe as everything ends too abruptly.<br>We were so sweet in the past but becos of a small matter, he did not want to accept me again. I say he has changed after he got his job and he admitted.<br>I was so sad that i keep crying and went sleepless and without food for 3 days.<br>Pls give me ur advice and tell me if there still a possibility for him to get back to me. will he still think of me and accept me as a new person again. I will wait for him till the day i die</div>
