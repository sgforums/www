            <div class='col-md body'>"Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania and the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia have found that exposure to male perspiration has marked psychological and physiological effects on women: it can brighten women's moods, reducing tension and increasing relaxation, and also has a direct effect on the release of luteinizing hormone, which affects the length and timing of the menstrual cycle."<br><br>Two researchers put sweaty extracts from the underarms of male volunteers on the upper lip of 18 women aged 25 to 45 for six hours. The women subsequently reported feeling less tense and more relaxed - a bit surprising, really, considering they had male armpit sweat smeared on their faces, but that just shows we don't always know how we're being affected by the scents of the people around us.<br><br>What's more, after the women were exposed to the male underarm extract, further tests showed blood levels of the women's luteinizing hormone (one which plays a key role in ovulation) changed in response to the male aromas. In other words - women were more likely to ovulate quicker when exposed to sweaty male smells. Now, with that level of sophistication in our scent systems, who could doubt the smell of your partner is pretty damn' important?<br><br>"This may open the door to pharmacological approaches to manage onset of ovulation or the effects of premenstrual syndrome or even natural products to aid relaxation," Wysocki said. "By determining how pheromones impact mood and endocrine response, we might be able to build a better male odor: molecules that more effectively manipulate the effects we observed.</div>
