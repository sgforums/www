            <div class='col-md body'>A few days back,  I finally found myself in a position to get laid.<br><br>The exhilarating happiness and anticipation were beyond words!  For someone like me, I could briefly tell you how I felt but that would be doing myself an injustice.  Lately, the sheer feeling of having an orgasm is so remote to me that I would do almost anything (except paying for it) just to get some.  I am sure many have been in my shoes before.<br><br>Well....<br><br>Here's the story.<br><br>My company was celebrating it's recent, tough win against a competitor.  It took a team of dedicated pre and post-sales people to succeed and put our nearest competitor to shame in one of the hardest won deals in 2004.<br><br>Our country manager was so elated, he sent out an email to everyone.  Great win, it said.  Drinks on me this time!  Let's go out and party!<br><br>Party we did.  After work on Friday, we all went down to our favourite water hole and just let our hair down.  Everyone had a great time.  The food was fantastic.  The drinks were free flowing.  We drank, laughed, kisses and hugs were given to everyone who were there.  Basically, most of us drank ourselves silly while the oppurtunists took the chance and got real close with the babes in the company.<br><br>But like all sexual encounters, its has to end sometime.  As many of us were leaving, one of my female colleagues asked me if I could give her a ride back since it was on the way.  I never refuse being a good guy.  Furthermore, it wasn't out of the way either.  I accepted.<br><br>I couldn't help refuse her not because her blouse was unbuttoned two buttons from the top.  Not because she had showed me the softest and  fairest breasts the naked eye can see.  Not because she was wearing a very sexy and slinky bra that I just couldn't take my eyes off.  Not because she had a great curvy body that many men would die for.<br><br>Anyway, being the gentleman that I am, I accepted.<br><br>I had to hold her tight as we went down to the car park.  Her breasts brushed my arm a couple of times.  I could feel my hairs on the arm standing up, as if welcoming the tender flesh everytime it happened.<br><br>Whilst heading to the car I asked her, "Do you want me to drive your car or mine?  I can take a cab back later from your place."<br><br>She held me tighter and whispered in my ear, "Why don't you drive me?  Take your car lah.  I can always come back and pick up mine."<br><br>I wanted to ask her wha she meant by "driving her".  My thought were going wild but I thought, better to stay cool and just assume. (I assumed the best, of course.  An endless night of hot, heavy passion.)<br><br>I drive a Toyota Corolla but she drives a BMW.  Maybe she didn't want to dirty her car if she threw up.  I was absolutely sure if she did, I would probably throw up after her too.  I'm the type where I just can't stand the smell of freshly thrown up liquor.<br><br>We went to my car and I started the engine.  We sat down a while to take a rest.  I was still thinking about that comment she made earlier.  Was it an invitation for me?  Should I be so bold as to attempt more?<br><br>I turned aside and asked her, "Want to smoke or not?  I think we need a short rest before we move off.  I don't want to be caught driving like someone giving me a blow job."<br><br>Heh.  I commended myself when I said that.  At least if she start questioning me, I could come out with the intoxication excuse.<br><br>But what happened next was definitely mind-blowing.<br><br>"Darling"  She looked at me.  "You really want someone to give you a blow job as you drive meh?"<br><br>This time, I'm really going to get laid.  I threw the cigerette that I just lit out of the window and leaned over.  Gave her a tiny peck on the forehead first, then on the nose and put my arms around her and gave her a little hug.  She responded by laying her heavy head on my shoulder.  I could feel her left hand resting on my already hard crotch area.  She was rubbing it using her fingers up and down gently, as if trying to wake a hibernating bear.<br><br>I moved my hand up and caressed her half exposed breast.  It was as good to the touch as to the eye.  Almost flawless, it made me wonder how good and firm it was once the bra is removed.  We held on for a short while in this position.  It was about 11+ at that time and surprisingly, not many people were around.  A few cars passed, but I didn't care.  I bet she didn't even know too.<br><br>My heart was pumping out blood faster than it was taking it in.  Here I was, with one of the better looking women in my company in my arms.  I was going to send her home and who knows what lies in wait after that.  I decided to take it easy.  I put her back in her seat, laid it down a little so she can rest and engaged the gears.  We're off!  It's going to be a great weekend for me.<br><br>----End of Part One----<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Part 2<br>-------<br><br>We drove along Orchard Road heading to the exit to CTE.  She was relaxed, laying back on the passenger seat.  I was naturally excited.  We are normally so close while back in the office but the events in the past few hours have been tremendously surprising.  I must admit, sometimes I try to steal a few peeks at her in the office, or purposely walk to her desk to see what she's wearing on that day, but never have I expected that it would be like this.<br><br>It was hard to concentrate on driving.  Whenever I turn to look at her, I could see her half her breasts pushing against her blouse with every breath she takes.  She was looking up and out of the window.  I wondered what could be going on in her liquor-filled mind.<br><br>I put my hand on her thigh and gave it a small squeeze, "You ok?  So quiet.  I worried for you leh."<br><br>She laid her hand on mine and said in her dreamy voice,"I'm fine darling.  You drive carefully please.  Almost end of the year already, TP all got quotas to meet."<br><br>I started to run my hands up and down her thighs a little.  The slender, smooth skin was great to caress.  She was wearing one of those tight skirts, common amongst office wear.  I could not access deep into her thighs but I was trying my hardest to get my hand in where it mattered.  I think subconsciously she knew what I was trying to do and opened up her legs as much as she could.  I pressed my hand into her inner thighs, pinching gently at random spots.<br><br>Suddenly, she turned to me and laid her head on my shoulder once more.  She put her hand on my crotch again and started to rub.  It felt so good.  I felt as if we have done this sometime before, maybe in our past life.  The anticipation was driving me crazy.  The urge to stop someplace quiet and have the first round of many with her was overpowering.<br><br>She pulled down the zip of my pants and unbuttoned me in one swift motion.  Thank goodness I'm not the type to wear a belt!  I felt more pumped up as I felt her hand on my tummy, finding it's way down, moving into my pants.<br><br>"Ohh, I like guys who wear boxer shorts."  I looked at her and she was staring at me with those mischievious eyes.<br><br>I was at a loss for words.  Her hand was now holding my brother and her thumb was giving it soft presses and a nice rubdown. "Umm, you like?", was all I could manage to say.<br><br>"Yes darling, later can show me more of it.  I find guys who wear boxers very cute."  She gave me a small peck on my cheek as she said it, and all this while giving me a fabulous handjob.<br><br>We were nearing the the turn into Buyong Road.  Outside Meridian, we slowed and came to a stop at the junction.  There was a SBS bus to my right, and I was thinking, here's a free mini-show for those passengers in the bus who cared to look out of their window into this little car.  I gave her a kiss on her forehead while enjoying the feeling of her soft skin on her hand rubbing me slowly.<br><br>The lights turned green and I said to her, "Do you mind doing this until we reach your place?  Feels very nice.  I want to remember this always."<br><br>She didn't say yes, but she kissed me and laid back on my shoulder, hand still in my pants, moving rhythmically, sending me waves of pleasure.<br><br>We reached her place a while later.  This has been the best drive I ever had since I passed my drivers' test about 3 years back.  The memories of this drive has been etched so deeply in my mind, I could relive this again everytime I close my eyes and think about it.  I parked quickly and pulled the handbrake.  She was lying serenely on my shoulder, hand still holding my hard member.  I didn't really want this to end but I was feeling sure things can only become better.<br><br>I gently woke her up and told her we're at her place.  She opened her sleepy eyes and looked at me, "Can follow me up?  I a bit dizzy."<br><br>Of course I can!  I reluctantly pulled her hand away from my brother and wore back everything.  That was some sweet ride...<br><br>...Part 3 : The Finale...<br>I'll be on leave tomorrow so the final part will be on Friday.  Stay tuned!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello guys,<br><br>Last part today.  Anyway if you all like to read more, please do not hesitate to let me know or PM me.   Suggestions or ideas for any type of stories would be great too.  (Although I prefer writing real life stories, I can try make believe also.)  Of course, I will add yourself as the main character in the story too.<br><br>Ok, enough ranting.  Let's move on to the last and shocking finale!<br><br>Part 3 - The "Orgasm"<br>----------------------------<br><br>She had a nice place for a HDB flat.  Everything was surprisingly clean and in it's place.  The first thing that caught my roving eyes when I entered her home, while supporting her on my arms, was the big, cute and probably expensive Forever Friends bear on the black leather sofa in the living room.<br><br>Her body was soft and warm against mine as I set her down on the sofa.  The lights had this adjustable intensity knob and I set it to a very romantic low light.  I kneeled in front of her and helped to take off her shoes.  At the same time, I could have a sensational view right up her skirt.  She was wearing a pair of flowery whitish panties.  I yearned to see, touch and experience what lay behind that.<br><br>With a lustful mind, as if I was still a teen and having my first sexual encounter, I placed my hands on her thighs and pushed them in under the skirt.  She offered no resistance as I slowly fingered her.  I hooked my fingers on the top of her undies, slowly drawing them towards myself.  She lifted up her butt and allowed me to slip the panties effortlessly off her.  A clean shaven pussy stared at me, with moisture on the lips, as though as it wanted me to kiss it lovingly.<br><br>I moved my hands around her and unbuttoned her skirt at the back.  Again, she allowed me to strip the skirt off and she opened her legs wider, allowing me to have a bird's eye view of her beautiful lower body.  I put my fingers where it mattered and rubbed.  Sounds of pleasure emitted from her and I could see her breathing more excitedly.  I pulled her body towards me so that her butt was just sitting at the edge of the sofa.  I kissed her inner thighs and ran my tongue up until her vagina.  I could smell the tangy taste of a lovely woman and it made my hormones rage furiously.<br><br>I tongued her.  Slowly at first, tasting her fluids and feeling her body buck with every motion I make.  Her hands came down and held my head in position and her legs lifted up to give me a better access to her smeet smelling, sexual organ.  She started to moan a bit and it made me go at it even harder.  I've tasted others before, but this is a first time doing it for a shaved vagina.  She was mashing my face hard against herself and I found it a little bit hard to breathe.  I took deep breaths through my mouth whenever I could and concentrated on eating her.  I felt encouraged, a new high with every moan she made, every time she pulled me closer.<br><br>We kept at this for what it seemed like a lifetime, when it was only a few minutes before she gave a small shriek.  I knew she was going to come as she held me tightly in, deeply and hooked her legs around my head and held me in this position in a while as her body shook and bucked with her orgasm.  When it was done, she lay back and looked lovingly me.  I could see her lips moving as she whispered, "Thanks dear, I love you."<br><br>I moved up towards her and kissed her fully on the lips, our tongues searching each other with a fiery passion.  I undied her shirt and placed both my palms on her chest, feeling the softness of both her breasts.  Her nipples were pushing against her bra and I could feel them through the lacy material.<br>We hugged a while and I could hear her whisper in my ear, "Your turn.  Sit down on the sofa ok?"<br><br>We switched positions now.  Me laying on the sofa with her standing in front of me, wearing only her bra.  She turned around 360 degrees and showed me all of her.  I could see her full figure now.  Beautiful curves and a very tight, sexy butt is all I can remember before she knelt in front of me and started to deftly undo my pants and take it off together with my boxes in one swift motion.  My brother felt as if as it was home once she started to hold it in her hand.  She moved up slightly and I closed my eyes, anticipating the warm and wet enclosure that would be her mouth.<br><br>I gave out a small cry of half-shock, half-pleasure as soon as she started to take me in her mouth.  It had been a long time since I've gotten a blow job, much less by a sporting and fantastic woman like her.  I could feel her flicking her tongue around me while her hands took turns to rub me up and down.  Her head started to bob up and down sending waves of immense pleasure to my already sexed-up brain.<br><br>I couldn't control it anymore.  I was on the verge of having my big bang as I pulled her up towards me.  We kissed again and she started to rub my brother with her wet crotch.  "I want to fuck." I said as I positioned my brother at the entrance to her.  She moved away, spoiling my desperate attempt to enter her and said, "Carry me into the room lah.  I want you on the bed." as she put her arms around me.  Reeling with desire, I carried her up and into the master bedroom.<br><br>I set her down on the pink queen sized bed and removed her bra.  I started to lick and suck on a nipple while caressing the other with my free hand.  I could still smell a faint trace of her perfume as I felt both nipples growing hard.  I moved myself into position and wanted to ram it in for what I'm worth.   She held my head in her hands and said, "Darling, you go and wash up first ok?  Your hair got ciggie smell."<br><br>"You leh?  Why don't we take a bath together?"  I tried my best to look innocent.  One round in the shower would be a nice start, I thought.<br><br>"No lah, you go wash up.  Guys must bathe first.  I'll bathe after you come all over me later."  She giggled as after I heard her say that, nothing was going to stop me bonking her brains out tonight as I immediately got up and went into the bathroom.<br><br>I washed myself thoroughly with her shampoo, facial cleanser and body foam.  I wanted to smell good to be eaten, sucked and licked all over.  My brother stood up straight as a ramrod throughout the quick shower.  I knew tonight would be special and I fought the irresistable urge to masturbate.  I took a quick look at myself in the mirror when I was done.  Damn, I wish I could have shaved.  But maybe the dangerous look could have been one of the factors that turned her on.  I dried myself using a Hello Kitty towel laying on the towel rack and stepped out of the bathroom and eased myself under the sheets beside her in a world record time.<br><br>I put my hand on her breast once more, feeling the soft nipple and kissed her forehead.  I moved to kiss her mouth when I realised what had happened.  I could hear her soft snores and the gentle movement of her chest with every breath.  She looked so serene and peaceful when she slept, almost like a princess.<br><br>I prepped up a pillow and lay back.  Should I wake her up?  My hand moved and held my little brother as it started to reduce in size, knowing the worst had happened.  How are we going to have the "best night" when she is sleeping?<br><br>I laid there, feeling sorry for myself.  This is unbelievable!  The best chance in a week and this had to happen!?<br><br>I got up, picked up my clothes and dressed up.  I left her home that night, unsatisfied, feeling stupid and totally disappointed.<br><br>When I woke up the next morning, there was an SMS from her.<br><br>"Thks for sending mi home.  So pai seh I slept.  Will u forgive mi?"<br><br>Damn, I'm not going to have any sex in real life...  I went back to bed.<br><br>----END----</div>
