            <div class='col-md body'>I'm just feeling so tickled by many of your responses, but I guess everyone has his or her freedom to post here, so I shan't comment.<br><br>Like anyone else, when encountered with a truly unexpected situation, anyone would be too shocked and not know what to do. Not everyone can think on his feet in such situations. Someone gave the example of a war, and if you are truly clear about what can happen, many mistakes are made and deaths are caused because of the unexpected shock encountered - It just takes one soldier to be shocked, not know what to do, do the first thing that come to mind (which may not be the right thing) and cause other shocked soldiers to follow (or to comply).. And that would be it. Officer or man, alike. In Technomage's situation, he was truly shocked, and did not know what to do; so he reacted naturally the way he did. It was only after some thoughts that he felt he would have done this or that (e.g. wallop him up, etc.)<br><br>Secondly, it is also wrong to assume that such situations arise because "it takes two hands to clap". Yes, it may be true for some of such situations, but after reading what Technomage posted, I am ready to conclude that he did not "ask for" this molestation. Besides, there is no such thing as "gay-look". It could simply because that guy likes how Technomage, or simply because he likes Technomage body (sorry, I know this sounds disgusting, but it's a possibility). All these are not Technomage's fault so rubbing it in by asking if he had winked, or if he had the gay look does not necessarily make him feel better, right?<br><br>Well, learn from the incident, Technomage.. My words here are not aimed to make you feel necessarily better, but I hope others could spare a thought for you by posting more constructive comments (even though they have the right to lost inconstructive ones).<br><br></div>
