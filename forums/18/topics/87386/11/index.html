            <div class='col-md body'>too lo soh for me to read thru the whole thread...but i got something to say....<br><br>BLOODY REVOLUTION<br>You talk about your revolution, well, that's fine But what are you going to be doing come the time? Are you going to be the big man with the tommy-gun? Will you talk of freedom when the blood begins to run? Well, freedom has no value if violence is the price Don't want your revolution, I want anarchy and peace <span style="color: red;">You talk of over throwing power with violence as your tool You speak of liberation and when the people rule Well ain't it people rule right now, what difference would there be? Just another set of bigots with their rifle-sights on me </span>But what about those people who don't want your new restrictions? Those that disagree with you and have their own convictions? You say they've got it wrong because they don't agree with you So when the revolution comes you'll have to run them through Yet you say that revolution will bring freedom for us all Well freedom just ain't freedom when your back's against the wall You talk of over throwing power with violence as your tool You speak of liberation and when the people rule Well ain't it people rule right now, what difference would there be? Just another set of bigots with their rifle-sights on me Will you indoctrinate the masses to serve your new regime? And simply do away with those whose views are too extreme? Transportation details could be left to British rail Where Zyklon B succeeded, North Sea Gas will fail It's just the same old story of man destroying man We've got to look for other answers to the problems of this land You talk of over throwing power with violence as your tool You speak of liberation and when the people rule Well ain't it people rule right now, what difference would there be? Just another set of bigots with their rifle-sights on me Vive la revolution, people of the world unite Stand up men of courage, it's your job to fight It all seems very easy, this revolution game But when you start to really play things won't be quite the same Your intellectual theories on how it's going to be Don't seem to take into account the true reality Cos the truth of what you're saying, as you sit there sipping beer Is pain and death and suffering, but of course you wouldn't care You're far too much of a man for that, if Mao did it so can you What's the freedom of us all against the suffering of a few? That's the kind of self-deception that killed ten million Jews Just the same false logic that all power-mongers use So don't think you can fool me with your political tricks Government is government and all government is force Left or right, right or left, it takes the same old course Oppression and restriction, regulation, rule and law The seizure of that power is all your revolution's for You romanticise your heroes, quote from Marx and Mao Well their ideas of freedom are just oppression now Nothing's changed for all the death that their ideas created It's just the same fascistic games, but the rules aren't clearly stated Nothing's really different cos all government's the same They can call it freedom, but slavery is the game There's nothing that you offer but a dream of last years hero The truth of revolution, brother.......... is year zero</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting thread...have read all 11 pages of this thread (amazing, or is it????) and here are my thoughts:<br><br>1) Most of the postings in this thread are not related to the topic at all. In fact, I saw postings of pictures of girls from Sggirls, some posts saying FI had a birthday, etc...my point is: should a post that is unrelated to the thread be allowed to remain in the thread? I would think that the moderator has the responsibility to ensure that the subject of the thread does not stray into unrelated territory, and here lies one of the responsibilities of the moderator: to ensure that any posts that do not discuss about the subject should be removed. Agree?<br><br>2) A good number of FI's posts do spark off some unwanted and unrelated posts by other forumites, in the sense that the topic in duscussion turn into crap threads, talking about something totally different altogether, deviating from the subject originally intended, such that it almost becomes like a chit chat session between several regular forumites. I have seen this in so many threads. Should that happen? I would think not. I particularly like to read Aunt Agony, where even though the posts are cheeky and sometimes really outrageous, THEY ARE STILL RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC. There are of course some totally irrelevant posts, but it is not as numerous as in BAR. IMHO, what makes BAR so difficult and unpleasant to read is because whole pages can contain totally irrelevant  and unmeaningful posts. Such posts should IMHO go into CHIT CHAT, and not BAR. I think CHIT CHAT or KPKB is the perfect place to crap and not BAR I feel, since BAR has a more sensitive, and probably more serious theme.<br><br>3) I really appreciate some of the forums though, especially Singapore Buses, Speakers corner, where the moderators really ensure that whatever is posted is related. There can be personal flames, but the subject matter is hardly deviated, as I believe most people who post want serious and constructive discussion. I see no flaming in Singapore Buses, maybe because of the nature of the topic, where everything that is posted is factual. As for Speakers Corner, everything is on the other hand is more on opinion, and thus the common flames. In BAR, there is a little of both, so the mod can actually exercise some flexibility in deciding what is suitable and what is not.<br><br>4) I have to ask this: Why is there such an obsession with forum ratings and number of posts generated? This I completely do not understand: hope someone will enlighten me.<br><br>5) Coming back to the review of FireIce, I feel without her, this BAR forum would not be as lively as it is. But well, is it lively for the right reason? (right reason being that sexual topics are discussed with maturity, since BAR is the established forum to talk about sex issues). The fact that there are some forumites who post only similes, +1, X1, etc....how do such posts contribute to the relevancy of the topic?<br><br>6) There will always be the talk that "if you dont like it, dont read, dont come into Sgforums". That I think is a self defeatist and self protectionist mentality. Why I say so? Because by saying that, it defeats the purpose of having a discussion - you are not welcoming alternative views. Then what is the use of having a forum? Stand up to scrutiny by counterarguing with relevant and rational points, if one does not agree with a certain argument. Make responsible posts, one that does not incite flaming.<br><br>7) It is so true, that the moderator dictates the tone and spirit of the forum. Well IMHO, some of the threads are simply not worth reading, because they are threads about certain forumites. For example, sgboy2004 wants war with Ah Ma. I feel something like this would be perfectly acceptable in CHIT CHAT or KPKB, but not BAR. (of course this topic is not in BAR) When I see a thread like "who here likes Fann Wong?" or "Today SIbei Suay ah" I ask myself, how is these related to BAR? I think such topics should go elsewhere. But to the moderators' credit, most of the topics here relate to sex issues, whether questions or experiences or otherwise.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> about the point about fun made right at the beginning by ditzy: It would depend what kind of fun in a forum you are taking about. There is a specific purpose in this Bar forum - originally as a clubbing forum, then it migrated to sex issues. If the fun means flaming others for fun, then CHIT CHAT and KPKB will do nicely.<br><br>That is all. Peace.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good morning jOhO,<br><br>Like loud monkey I have been following all 11 pages and so far, I think he has given a pretty objective view on what happens in the forums. Whether what happens is right or wrong, loud monkey has only pointed out the truth of what goes on.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jOhO:</div><div class="quote_body">loud monkey, kudos to u for reading all 11 pages, u obviously haven't been here long enuff. i only read that last page!</div></blockquote>Just as how you've said loud monkey knows less about the forums since he hasn't been around as long, to be fair to him, perhaps you should read more of the 11 pages to get a better idea what has been posted in this thread so far.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong><br>there's something called "forum culture" just like the management experts like to call "company culture"</strong>[/quote]<br><br>Just because a system has been around for very long doesn't mean that it's perfect. A culture doesn't necessarily have to be correct, of course neither is a culture necessarily wrong. But just because it happens, doesn't mean its right.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>in some forums, discussions usually stick on topic, in others they NEVER. this is one of them.</blockquote></div></blockquote>To point out, it's not just that this forum is one of them, in the sgforums, BAR is probably the best example of were discussions do not stick on topic. It happens more here than in any other forum.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>as for FI being mod and all that crap, aiyah put it this way lar, 90% of pple here won't post differently, more or less, on topic or off topic, whether or not there's a mod. i mean we have a few entertainers that post their fantasies of how a JC girl squeesed her breast against his hand. cmon, he's gonna post that kind of stories whether or not FI is a mod. i think if she's gonna have to remove all "crappy" threads, she's gonna have to del ALL of them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong></div></blockquote>No offence, but this is one part where I truly disagree with you. If according to what you say there the moderators have totally no power in their own forums. I don't think you really mean that do you?<br><br>True enough that some people, not all, will still post in the same manner no matter who the mod is. And some people will still post the topics, even if the mod is another person. But the mod's activity or inactivity towards what is posted will set the trend within the forum. Whether a topic is lame or serious, if the moderator comes into the thread, starts crapping and being sarcastic towards the thread starter, then others would feel it's ok and join in. It get worse if the mod doesn't control the crapping and the flaming. Afterall, since the mod is doing it why can't they do it too? But if the mod takes part seriously in the discussion, then others won't have the excuse will they?<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>and the best part of all. do u think this forum's set up was for everyone to join in lively discussions to do the community good? by "this forum" i dun mean just bar, i mean the whole site.<br><br>ehheh u (and alot of others here) have no idea why this forum was created. that it became huge, well that's another matter. i've made frens here, and that's good enuff for me.<br></blockquote></div>I think it's really depends on Jason and his moderators what the purpose of sgforums was for. Whether it has achieved its purpose or not is another thing.<br><br>Good for you that you've managed to make friends here. It's always nice to be friendly towards each other rather than being sarcastic towards people at every oppurtunity, even if you have the wit. Of course in a perfect world everyone would be friends, but the world is imperfect enough so why not just try being nice?<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong><br>and i REALLY dun care who's mod of bar, or whether that person is doing a good job. take it from a senior member who's been here a while.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </strong></div></blockquote>Well you may not care but how you think may not be how others think. Senior or not, there are others who are more concerned than you are or have actually voiced out from what they observe. You however have chosen not to care and if that makes you happy, well good.<br><div class="quote_body">[quote]most of the regulars here have grown used to, even enjoy the out of topic posts. it's also becos many of us actually know each other in real life. those that have gotten "sick" of this place, have left, but honestly, the population of this forum only gets bigger, not smaller.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div>Again like I said earlier, a system that has been in place for a long does not gurantee that it is perfect. By saying that most of the regulars have "grown used to" it is acknowledgement in itself that the system is flawed. Right or wrong, perfect or imperfect, that is how the system is for now.<br><br>And according to your last line, it would seem as if most people are fine with the system at present. This is true only for those who remain.<br><br>If the original number of forumites was 100, then 300 came in, but 250 left because they didn't like it here, it would leave us with 50 new forumites making it 150 in total. So even if among the newbies, more people left than those who stayed, so long the old group stays, the number would increase. Then again, why would an old bird care what the newbies think? Again this should be up to Jason and his moderators whether they want to try and make this newbies stay or let them just go.<br><br>I'm not really sure whether among newly registered forumites whether more leave or more stay, but to assume that the system is perfect based on the increasing numbers isn't really correct.<br><br>Overall just to highlight once again, there is more discrepancy in the manner of moderating here than in the other forums in sgforums. Right or wrong, culture or not this is what is happening so far. So are you saying that this should never be changed? That the system is perfect and nothing should change?<br><br>Really good for you that you have made friends here.</div>
