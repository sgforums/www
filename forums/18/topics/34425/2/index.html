            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dark_slayer79:</div><div class="quote_body">Interesting things happen in chalets!<br>Was with another guy and 2 girls when we were bored with playing cards, so someone suggested upping the stakes. Lose one round, 1 piece of clothing off. Strip big 2 (chua dai di). One girl was pretty and horny, always told us dirty jokes but her breasts were tiny. The other girl had very nice boops but her looks were average.<br><br>Nobody thought of making it fair, so all kinds of things came out. The guys did not wear bras, so 1 piece less, and so the belt was counted as one piece too. I was not wearing a belt that day, so...<br>The girls panicked when they started stripping and wanted to take out the tissue paper piece by piece. Of course that was not allowed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I was stripped down to my briefs, the other guy had his belt off only. The pretty girl lost her t-shirt and shorts, the other girl also lost her t-shirt and shorts. Her pink and red bra was very cute, and she was a c-cup (I found out after she lost her bra and i held on to it). That was when the girls wanted to use tissue paper.<br><br>My erection was very obvious by now, and the girls were teasing me about it. The big girl purposely held her arms together when holding the cards to squeeze her breasts and make them stand out more in the cups so that I will be distracted and lose my briefs. My friend was stripped to his boxers in the next 2 rounds, and knowing that he could not concentrate, wanted to call it a night. The girls wouldn't let him. They threatened to strip him if he stop now.<br><br>The big girl lost the next round and gamely took off her bra but cupped her breasts with her hands to cover up. She turned around when she removed her bra, covered up and turned back with a very red face. The rule was that loser had to deal cards for the next round, so she awkwardly adjusted her position so that she was hugging her legs and used them to cover her breasts while she dealt the cards. She played in that pose for a few more rounds while the pretty and small girl lost her bra too and did not bother to cover up, showing her nipples bravely. They were hard in the air-con.<br><br>My friend then lost his boxers and the girls almost had to strip his boxers off for him, so shy he was to show his erected penis. We played on, if he lost, he would have to masturbate in front of the girls. By this time we were all very horny and a bit crazy, since this is not the kind of thing we usually do together.<br>The small girl then lost her panties and she sat very carefully with her legs tucked to one side so that we could see only a little of her bush. I lost my briefs and since the other guy did not cover up, I had to let it show too. The big girl decided to show her breasts so that she can concentrate on her game and cause us to lose our concentration. She lost the next round and now all of us were naked. The next round will have someone masturbating!<br><br>So she decided to show and sat with her legs crossed. We could see a bit between her legs! My friend lost the next round and had to jerk off in the bathroom while the 3 of us watched. He pleaded to be let off but we wouldn't allow him to. He was shy about expressing himself so the big girl offered to help him but he got scared. We were still young then. He did it mechanically and shot onto the bathroom floor. We went back for one more round and the big girl lost. That was the first time I had seen a girl do it, and it was an eye-opener. That got him hard again, much to the amusement of the girls.<br><br>We decided to go for 2 more rounds, the 2 losers will do together. The guy lost again, and the pretty girl. We asked if they wanted to do for each other and this time the guy was no longer shy and wanted to but the pretty girl would not, so they just did it in the bathroom, the guy standing and the girl sitting, ogling at each other. He took longer this time round.<br><br>By this time, everybody were tired and did not want to go for another round, though I had not had my turn yet. Nobody wanted to play, but to be fair to them I jerked off too. Cheh... the girls were not that interested anymore.<br><br>by s.s.c..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> geez..i hope i can get gal frens like tat to play strip poker wif mi oso..did u ppl drink before playing??<span class="large"></span><span style="color: blue;"></span></div>
