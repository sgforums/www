            <div class='col-md body'>Sex after a drink or two can be real fun.  Just before you are drunk...when you are quite high......for guys it will last longer.  After you have expended yourself, you will feel relax and can sober up...well at least for me.  But then, after the first shot, you may find it dufficult to get it up again.  Have to wait a bit longer, so if you are booked into a two hours hotel, you may find that you could only do it once.<br><br>I have had sex, in the afternoon where I had not drank any alcohol at all....and found could do it three times within the two hours period in the hotel.<br><br>Well gals and guys, try it with a little acochol in the system, you may enjoy it.</div>
