'cos girls are easily swayed by the superficial - and the little things.

They won't ask for it outright, but if u don't treat her good, she'll just move on.<br>i think really deep down, as long as the guy is genuine, she won't care if u're poor or rich or ugly or whatever.</div>

'cos girls are easily swayed by the superficial - and the little things. These jerks work really well with those inexposed girls and so these gals fall for these jerks.<br>once these jerks have had their fun, the girl wallows in her sorrow, and tries to search for someone who can give her something similar... still having the hopes that this guy will be the right one.<br>sighz... those who've been hurt bad enough would know better and would be able to tell from the real guys and the jerk of the jerks.<br><br>as for the rich ones.. hmm.. i guess most gals are still attracted to what the money can bring them. the whole experience. gals usually look for an experience they find sweet/romantic/whatever. and usually with money, that can be achieved.<br><br>girls dun really mind paying for guys, but they expect some sort of "returns" in terms of affection, etc, to convince them why they're worth it. They won't ask for it outright, but if u don't treat her good, she'll just move on.<br>i think really deep down, as long as the guy is genuine, she won't care if u're poor or rich or ugly or whatever.</div></blockquote>good in that yesterday's strait's times if that guy who is a garbage cleaner , i am sure he is genuine , will you give him a chance and be his BF ? I don't think so . So pls don't say " she won't care if u're poor or rich or ugly or whatever " it just make you sounds more like a hypocrite</div>

The truth of is in her actions not words. When it comes to choosing men, ladies heads straight for the cash. What women want most from men and the criterion most significant to them in selecting a mate -- is money.<br><br>The only reason a woman will choose a man without money is if he's on the fast track to a high-earning career, she views this as an investment of her time.<br><br>The blame for this phenomenon lies in our society, a society which promotes female arrogance, women screaming about equal rights.  And why should men allow themselves to be chosen primarily on their ability to earn? This is wrong. Dating should be about partnership, not a w.h.o.r.e/john relationship. It should be about two people getting together because they like each other and enjoy each other's company, not because a man is paying for a woman's time. Women need to learn to respect men, and dun use us ruthlessly...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't agree the point wherby you are rich and plenty of girls will fall for you no matter how you look. I have 2 friends who are so damn filthy rich that if you marry them you can live like a tai tai and go to which ever country club that catches your fancy in SG and deck yourself with whatever jewellery you want.<br><br>Tanglin club, Raffles Town Club, Cricket Club...you name it! They are really nice people but they are still single because they don't look the best? They have a rich social life but no gf. I guess maybe because they don't dress rich enough? And no, they don't play the field as well.<br><br>Anyways, I'm so sick of posts like this. Call it materialistic or whatever, but it is a very realistic world we are living in today.<br><br>Just imagine if you're a girl and not a guy, and 2 great guys go after you. One a doctor and one a rubbish collector. Which would you choose? I don't deny the fact that I will go to the doctor. With him, my future is secure. Doesn't mean that I will be dependent on him but at least we can ensure our kids have a better future and I don't have to convince everyone that he is really hardworking and won't sponge off me. Trust me its not easy convincing parents and relatives!<br><br>There is also another point to consider and that is girls like to have face too! Not only guys! Guys want a pretty gf as a trophey and a successful guy is like a trophey to a girl too!<br><br>The thing now is that with higher education, girls would want someone on par with them or even better then them (call it the cave man mentaility but that's how things go) Well the guy can have a slightly lowly education but the gap between their thinking cannot be too different (I hate to say this but lower educated ppl do see things differently) Even the circle of friends you have are different! and if a girl has lower education, she hopes to have a husband with much higher education so that she can have a better life. So what happens is that all the girls go for the grads and that leaves the blue collar workers behind.<br><br>As well, you guys are free to think that SG girls are materialistic, selfish, hypocritical whatever, because usually its the pot calling the kettle black. Anyway, if you can't get a girl, pls don't be a sour grape and start the SG girl bashing which I think is more then enough in this forum. Go ahead and go after your foreign mei mei for sex and whatever.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun understand why Spore gal are out for mens money, High maintenance. She expects a man to be financially stable n able to support her when times r bad just because she is biologically female. They think their vagina is plated with gold and is worth a million dollars. Their only interest is in getting what they want in life without any concept of the guyz feelings...<br><br>The reason is because men want sex, they let women get away with this, giving free rein to female exploitation. Men are brought up by their mothers to cater to women, to hold open doors, to act as chauffeurs, etc -- and to pay for access to sex.<br><br>If male-female relationships are going to change for the better, it's entirely up to the guyz to enforce the change. If we stop paying for women, then women will be forced to choose us for qualities other than the size of our wallets.<br></div>
