            <div class='col-md body'>abt a topic on single singapore men who went visit prositudes overseas all these and didn't get a wife because first no look secondly they don't earn much that's why they are single . that also reflects how materealistic singapore girls are . Before they go dating with you , they will secretly check your background like how much you earn a month , have a car or not , how much you have in the bank etc...before saying yes . To most girls MONEY COMES FIRST , THEN LOOKS , THEN LOVE . For me I will try to find an exception who does not goes for these but I guess it's kinda hard to impossible . Anyway , if can't find a girl which is most likely , I just spend abt few thousands dollars to buy a beautiful bride from overseas anyway what I need is satisfy my sexual needs only . Why god make men to have high sex drive but why you also create illness like HIV , herpes , other STDs . So good if there is no such illness , if really no aids all these I go geylang and play everyday liao and no need to buy a bride from overseas liao different face and different stunt at geylang . I will buy a pretty bride if I cannot find a girl by 30 yrs old .</div>

They don't want to suffer with you they rather get those who are already rich to save the suffering time somemore still have to risk being with a poor guy maybe he will forever be poor or never get rich . That's life . I hope one day there is a pill or medcine to cure STDs and aids or a vacine once inject you wil never get these illness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But they're not - as it turns out, men choose the way they do because we have been programmed through millions of years of evolution to get mates who will bear good children. Of course this is a generalisation - but a pretty accurate one, that's why men this way.<br><br>Women who are healthier have better figures. Not shallow, just wired that way.<br><br>Women on the other hand look for mates who can take care of them and their off spring. So they look for men who can provide and who will hang around to provide for the family ... the only way they can guage this is to see how much we have accomplished. Of course, they also want to know if we will hang around and be faithful ... but that's after they find one who fits the bill first.<br><br>So to a China bride, they see the Singapore guy  as someone who will better provide for them when compared to the local China men.<br><br>You kid yourself by thinking that you're getting a girl with better morals in the China girls - they're exactly the same - it's very relative.<br><br>BUT - it's not a bad thing - they're just wired that way.</div>
