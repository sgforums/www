So far, I've only manage to made her cum by stimulating her clitoris orally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Though my wife like oral sex on her, she prefer to cum while I'm penetrating her. I ask her how she felt during sex and she said she felt good by it's not as good compared to the clitoris stimulation I gave her....that why I think she's not having orgasms during sex.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Yeah I try to prolong myself from cumming but it's not as easy as it seems. Tried thinking of other stuff but it's useless, the emotional and physical stimulation is so great that it's uncontrollable. So I just cum....then she'll frown knowing that it's over again without her cumming and I'll feel very paiseh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Any tips on how to maximize pleasure during sex for women?

            <div class='col-md body'>Each person pattern of orgasm varies from one another. You have to discuss with your wife about her favourite positions and other stuffs that will make her highly to achieve an orgasm, that is through intercourse I'm talking about.<br><br>Perhaps you might try to have a longer than usual foreplay, not limiting to touch, but as well as words. Whisper sweet, sometimes naughty, words in her ears to arouse her. The idea is to make her almost there, so during making love, you stand a higher chance. Of course, sensual words and touching do not stop there, while doing it, continue your foreplay.<br><br>Another way is to use the commonly method 'stop-and-go'. Find out your 'point-of-no-return', and stop all activities, wait for the feeling to subside, then continue. However this is not a sure win situation, as some women may feel discourage and even losing patience when you stop many times. Still, you can discuss with your wife about this.<br><br>I've heard of another method which is using your sphincter muscles to control your orgasm. That muscles is in man's groin area, and we actually used it everyday...to control the urge of urinating. Likewise, it will prevent you from ejaculating. It requires training though to effectively use it.<br><br>Your wife can do her part as well, by sitting on top of you. That way, she can actually rub her clitoris against your pelvic bone back and forth. Strictly speaking, you are not moving nor thrusting, so the urge of cumming may not be that immense. Till she satisfies, then change position and finish on a happy note.<br><br>Again, what matter most is that you should openly discuss this with your wife. Do not be afraid to let her know. Work everything out. There are a lot of articles on the net that can help you, I'm only telling you from what I know, there may be more. Do it healthily and lovingly.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi there..<br><br>it's a little late now was gonna sleep but read ur latest post. wanna say that it's very sweet of u to wanna pleasure ur wife that u have to come to the net to find answers! the net is a wonderful place with alot of info, isn't it?<br><br>so before i plop off to bed, i have a suggestion.<br><br>is your wife someone who thinks she can or wants to enjoy sex? there are some women out there who swear they dun need sex and will do it only for their bf/husbands. if ur wife is one such person then this may not work. but if she does have her horny moments then this *may* work...<br><br>temporary abstinence.<br><br>try setting a period of time where you both won't have sex.. no intimate touching definitely no oral (both ways!) or fingering or stroking.. kiss and hug in bed is ok.. but plan a period of time when u just won't do it. how long u can discuss together depending on ur normal frequency of intercourse.<br><br>i feel that this way may help to build up a higher level of desire, and when the appointed time (sounds like a ritual!) comes u both can just let go. no pun intended! u cannot let go too fast!<br><br>of course dun just rape each other.. go ahead and try the things u've been "researching" on the net and thru talking to frens... foreplay etc etc.<br><br>on a personal note, i'm glad u give her oral.. becos it's something i enjoy as well (giving it - i'm male!) i dunno if it's the taste or the fact that her womanhood is smack bang in my face (it suggests that she trusts me and isn't shy around me) or becos i feel good being able to give her the pleasure which she definitely seems to be enjoying, or... all of the above!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>good luck pal! keep us updated!</div>

I ask her how she felt during sex and she said she felt good by it's not as good compared to the clitoris stimulation I gave her....that why I think she's not having orgasms during sex.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></strong><br><br>Remember in your last post you mentioned that you actually gave her oral, she enjoyed it too much and was too sore to continue (and you can't bear to stop the pleasure on her?) Actually, I already wanted to tell you this... Oral sex is mainly a FOREPLAY though can be use an appetiser too... (And can be 'main course' for lesbians... ~Hohoho.. But we're not going into that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>You've got to learn control your oral stimulation in such a way that she's aroused enough and yet not get her over the edge with just that... (Unless her stamina allows her to... Going into that later...) This is how you learn with experience through the sessions you have with her.... Make it such a way that she would be DYING to have penetration sex with you (you said she loves to cum in you yeah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )... If you wanna increase the chance of her being able to achieve orgasm in you, these are some of the things you may like to try...<br><br>1. Continue to fondle her, whisper words to her to know how she feel and maintain her arouseness...<br><br>2. Make on to a position that would allows clitoris to your body contact (rubbing?) after your oral with her....<br><br>3. Try having fingering sessions with her so that she can learn to enjoy orgasm through the feeling of penetration... It's usually true that women are more easily satisfied through clitorus arousal, but not necessarily follows that they can only allow good orgasm from that alone... She's most probably very inexperienced with the feeling of sex, so you've got to teach her to experience the different sensations of achieving orgasm....<br><br>4. Prolonging of your session with her through your own control is HIGHLY POSSIBLE by training yourself... You can most probably get books and information from internet about these (but please must sure that you know what you're doing and that the information's reliable before you try anything stupid on yourself?)... They usually emphasize on mental control and/or 'physical' training....<br><br><strong><br>Any tips on how to maximize pleasure during sex for women? Any "best positions" to share? My main aim is to make my wife happy b4 me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </strong><br><br>Maximise pleasure?<br><br>1. Keeping her sportingly active would helps her achieve pleasure and orgasm BETTER...<br><br>2. Encourage her to fantasize... It usually helps to lift up her desire...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>3. Let her learn about the different ways of achieving orgasms... Mainly clitoris, G-spot, anal (up to individuals), pure stimulation arousal (not very often achievable to orgasm by itself) and combinations of these....<br><br>4. Positioning is quite personal and up to individual's preference and 'ability'? You should be able to get tons of such everywhere....<br>The important thing is to try them out to see if you're both comfortable with it....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  ENJOY?<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Don't be afraid to explore<br>The basic principle of tantric sex is that your erogenous zone is everywhere. The idea is not to make a beeline for the genitalia, but to focus on sensual exploration.<br><br>Men and women have various erogenous zones that correspond with energy channels or acupressure meridians. In women they tend to concentrate around the vulva, breasts, neck, and navel, as well as the inner thighs, buttocks, hands and toes. For guys, erotically charged areas are typically the hands, feet, ears, tongue and nipples.<br><br>So don't be afraid to explore your partner's body in a worshipful way. Take your time and go slowly. It can be erotic especially if you take turns to stroke, massage, kiss, nibble and lick each other in new ways and places.<br><br></div>
