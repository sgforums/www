            <div class='col-md body'>SUSTANON (to build strength and muscle mass)<br><br>Sustanon is a very popular steroid which is highly appreciated by its users since it offers several advantages when compared to other testosterone compounds. This special feature has two positive characteristics for the athlete. Sustanon is a mix of four kinds of testosterone, synergistic mix of propionate, phenylpropionate, isocaproate, and decanoate.<br><br>First, based on the special combination effect of the compounds, Sustanon, milligram for milligram, has a better effect than Testosterone enanthate, cypionate, and propionate alone.<br><br>Second, the effect of the four testosterones is time-released so that Sustanon goes rapidly into the system and remains effective in the body for several weeks. Due to the propionate also included in the steroid, Sustanon is effective after one day and, based on the mixed in decanoates, remains active for 3-4 weeks. In plain English this means a mix of 2 short-acting, 1 medium-acting, and long lasting testosterone, in one shot that equals 250 mg of testosterone.<br><br>This is good because it is both fast-acting and long-lasting in the system. You get the fast action of testosterone propionate, and the long lasting effects of enanthate. The blend seems to be recognized by the steroid receptors for longer periods of time than other testosterones. Sustanon hits harder than enanthate or cypionate. At least you get several anabolic "peaks" as each testosterone kicks in for its duration.<br><br>Sustanon has a distinct androgenic effect which is coupled with a strong anabolic effect. Therefore it is well suited to build up strength and mass. A rapid increase in body strength and an even increase in body weight occur. Athletes who use Sustanon report a solid muscle growth since it results in less water retention and also aromatizes less than either testosterone enanthate or cypionate. Indeed many bodybuilders who use testosterone and fight against distinct water retention and an elevated estrogen level prefer Sustanon over other long-acting de-pot testosterones.<br><br>Many users claim fewer side effects when using Sustanon - less gyno, bloating and endocrine disturbances. It is little less stressful to the liver. In other words, the general feeling is that Sustanon is less toxic than other testosterones, especially suspension. This makes it a favorite of many bodybuilders and power athletes.<br><br>It is further noticed that Sustanon is also effective when relatively low doses are given to well advanced athletes- It is interesting to note that when Sustanon is given to athletes who have already used this compound in the same or lower doses, it leads to similar good results as during the previous intake. Sustanon is usually injected at least once a week, which can be stretched up to 10 days.<br><br>The dosage in bodybuilding and powerlifting ranges from 250 mg every 14 days up to 1000 mg or more per day. Since such high dosages are not recommended-and fortunately are also not taken in most cases-the rule is 250-1000 mg/week. A dosage of 500 mg/week is completely sufficient for most, and can often be reduced to 250-mg/ week by combining Sustanon with an oral steroid.<br><br>Sustanon is well tolerated as a steroid during treatment which stimulates the regeneration, gives the athlete a sufficient "kick" for intense training units, and next to the already mentioned advantage-rapid strength increase and solid muscle gain distinguishes itself also by its compatibility.<br><br>CLENBUTEROL -  fat burner plus maintain muscle<br><br>Clenbuterol is a very interesting and remarkable compound. It is not a steroid hormone but a beta-2-symphatomimetic. Its effects, however, can by all means be compared to those of steroids. Clenbuterol can cause a solid, highly qualitative muscle growth which goes hand in hand with a significant strength gain. Clenbuterol, above all, has a strong anticatabolic effect, which means it decreases the rate at which protein is reduced in the muscle cell, consequently causing an enlargement of muscle cells. For this reason, numerous athletes use Clenbuterol after steroid treatment to balance the resulting catabolic phase and thus obtain maximum strength and muscle mass.<br><br>A further aspect of Clenbuterol is its distinct fat-burning effect. Clenbuterol burns fat without dieting because it increases the body temperature slightly, forcing the body to burn fat for this process. Due to the higher body temperature Clenbuterol magnifies the effect of anabolic/androgenic steroids taken simultaneously, since the protein processing is increased.<br><br>Athletes usually take 5-7 tablets, 100-140 mcg per day For women 80-100 mcg//day are usually sufficient, It is important that the athlete begin by taking only one tablet on the first day and then increasing the dosage by one tablet each of the following days until the desired maximum dosage is reached. The compound is usually taken over a period of 8-10 weeks. Since Clenbuterol is not a hormone compound it has no side effects typical of anabolic steroids. For this reason it is also liked by women.<br><br>for more information about sustanon and clenbuterol and its application to your fitness routines, send email to my email.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is presented by Indo is very true. There are 2 types of bodybuilders. First, the drug-enhanced. These guys are big and ripped at the same time, I called it the drug-look. They are also very strong and recuperate rapidly after work-outs.<br><br>The second type are peformance-drugs free bodybuilders. These guys have more natural-looking bodies. They also need to pay more attention to their training plans, nutrition  and rest pattern to avoid over training.<br><br>By the way if any of you are interested in Ultimate Nutrition supplement, do gimme a call at 98254636 as I am their rep for Singapore.

Free radicals are unstable molecules that damaged body tissues (i.e. aging). If they take steroids, even worse because steroids speed up their cellular processes which mean even more free radicals are produced. But exercise in moderation are definite anti-aging and health promoting. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But, with some proper training and nutrition you will be able to show off the reps of chin up you can do. Some easy training 3 times a week plus my product Ultimate Whey gainer should do the trick. My advice is dun touch steroids. Steroids can potentially cause you to 1)develop female breast-like tissues under your nipples. $5000 to remove surgically (the only way), 2) enlarged prostate, 3) damage your liver, 4) acclerate hair loss, 5) oily and acne-prone skin. All these come directly from my head, because I am a qualified nutritionist who is well verse in bodybuilding supplements and understand the real world of bodybuilding.</div>

Heavy doses do not increase the effectiveness, but can also have a negative effect on your health in a long run because it can potentially tax your kidneys. I assume you are taking creatine in monohydrate form. Gathering from the research, creatine is relatively safe when administered properly. To make thing simple, for a person over 70 kg 2 rounded teaspoonfuls (10 grams)  daily is more than enough, under 70kg 1 rounded teaspoon (5 grams) daily is enough. When I say enough, I mean enough to fully fill up (saturate) your muscles after 30 days of continuous supplementation. There is not even the need for the  loading phase, which can be very troublesome and time consuming. As long as you continue taking creatine and keep the muscles saturated with creatine, maximum results will be maintained but expect no more from then.  An average result with creatine monohydrate supplementation is a weight gain of 2-3 kg for a 65kg man and maybe 4-5kg weight gain for a 75kg man. Besides muscle size gain, strength increase and sets-endurance are also observed. For Chin up performance, creatine may not be most suitable because the load is the body weight which increase with the strength gain. Thus the no. of maxi reps may not increase after taking creatine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Master -_-:</div><div class="quote_body">i weigh 78kg.. and i kinda mix my supplements.. and i bought a spray-on "muscle builder" over the net.. but my trainer said it is illegal.. do u noe anything about it? u spray on where u want it and just work out normally.. if u do noe abt it, kindly clear my doubts whether it is truly illegal and possibly harmful... thanks..</div></blockquote>The spray-on, if I am not wrong contain something something like androstenedione? This spray is supposed to be added with a medium that allow androstedione to gain entry into the body thru skin contact. Then in the body, androstedione can be converted to some testosterone.<br><br>From my scientific point of view, using androstedione in whatever form will be a total joke! The very reason why pple developed the spray on is the fact that oral androstedione is very hard on the liver (80% that is taken is destroyed by the liver and in the process liver suffer damages). Thus spray-on may be a better way to administer andro. Furthermore, andro accelerate testosterone level in the body for very short time (about 30 minutes), making it unclear whether it provide any real benefit on muscles growth and strength gain. Taking andro is like taking a very lousy steroid. If you need quality supplement at affordable prices which come with free professional advice let me know, I will be pleased to help you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
