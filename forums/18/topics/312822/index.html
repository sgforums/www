              <p>It's a psychological thing.</p>
              <p>I bet you only had your first pussy recently, am I right? Wait, don't bother telling me I'm right. I know I am.</p>
              <p>I will tell you the two primary factors behind your predicament, assuming your partner is reasonably attractive and does not possess the looks of rush-hour roadkill.</p>
              <p>Firstly, you're jerking your little sausage way too much at home. Probably more than once a day, sheerly out of habit. You're too used to shooting your load only through the sensation of your hands and hence, when faced with a good old cheese pie, it feels alien. I bet you asked your girl to give you a little shake. Doesn't work too good, right? That's because girls usually don't have that much strength especially if she is inexperienced, or you're just not accustomed to a different stroking pattern.</p>
              <p>Solution? Cut back on the porno and let the kettle boil a little longer. Cease all rubbing and wrist excercise activities if you anticipate a session within 2-3 days. The disadvantage to this, however, is that your love juice will probably stink a little more than how it usually smells. Kinda like spoilt milk, but worse. Too bad for the girl - but who gives a **** about her, hah!</p>
              <p>Secondly, it's a mental thingy as well. You've spent the last few years, since that time you got your first bit of hair on your ugly ballsack, doing it alone. And now there's someone with you. Adds a subconscious-pressure, believe me. Just be patient, take it easy. Don't freak out. Alot of teenagers are facing this problem due to over-exposure to pornographic materials since they were twelve and under-exposure to the real deal.</p>
              <p>What I can recommend you doing is try to get her to play out little fantasy. Maybe you always wanted to do doggy-style, or with her hands bound. Or your hands bound?  Whatever works. I don't care. It helps, a little. Personally, I'm a big fan of male over female dominance, and you will be amazed by how many girls are turned on by their pet fantasies of being cute, little, helpless and innocent things. You will also be surprised, that many of them surprisingly enjoy dirty-talk. Call her a slut in bed. Spank her. Coax the devil out of her.</p>
              <p>After a few sessions, you'll be spitting volcanoes in no time.</p>
              <p>P.S : Yes, women generally enjoy playing the submissive one in bed. However, that attitude disappears the moment that moment is over. :(</p>

              <p>My endurance has always been poor, that's the prime reason, I think, that's stopping me from achieving bedroom nirvana. Any advice from a veteran like yourself for beginners like myself? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>I've always been interested in medicine but many of my friends, teachers and even some psychology professionals have told me that my personality is much more suited to the law profession.</p>
              <p>Conclusion? I'm still fighting with myself for the best choice.</p>
