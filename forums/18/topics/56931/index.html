            <div class='col-md body'>guys &amp; gals<br>ur views ???<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>Times are bad and jobs are so difficult to come by that many of the not so well educated in Asia would settle for almost any job just to avoid prolonged unemployment.<br><br>The job of beer promoter has never been a very popular one amongst Asian ladies. The job often requires the ladies to dress in sexy attire to serve a bunch of intoxicated customers. Sexual harrassment and even molestation are often part of the job.<br><br>In these difficult times, the beer promoters seem to get younger and younger. More and more young women find beer promotion an attractive part-time job that supplements their wage cuts. One girl we interviewed (call her Min), eagerly took up the job to support her addiction to shopping and she ended up losing her virginity.<br><br>Like most playful girls of her age, Min, didn't do too well in school and decided to quit school against her parents wishes after she completed secondary 5. Min tried working in boutiques at first, but she lacked the experience and knowledge about things she could never afford to buy. The factories were too uncomfortable and the clerical job she held on to didn't pay very well. Without much apprehension, Min decided to serve beer at a food centre far away from her home.<br><br>For this job, Min had to wear a short and tight uniform. Once in a while, a customer's hand would "accidentally" brush against her buttock. Most decent girls would quit the moment they encounter anything close to molestation, but Min was a brave and adventurous girl. She was also not new to clubbing, so encounters with horny and intoxicated men were not new to her. In the past, she had little opportunity to visit KTV rooms as she couldn't afford it. After she started working as a beer promoter, she not only had more spending money, she could even get to drink and party for free at some of the regular customers' invitation. Why quit the job because of a little butt fiddling?<br><br>One evening, Min was aksed by her boss to go to a KTV pub to promote beer. Min stepped confidently into the room and announced: "Gentlemen, attractive free gifts for every half dozen jugs of beer ordered."<br><br>"We would love to patronize, but three of us just can't finish that much beer. Can you help us?"<br><br>Min was aware of what the men had in mind, but she didn't know how far they would go. She thought they just wanted to touch her here and there, or take a few peeks up her skirt or down her blouse. It turned out that after she got drunk, she was brought to their car, driven to the woods where they took turns to rape her.<br><br>Did she report the matter to the police? No, she didn't want any trouble and she didn't want her parents to know about it.<br><br>"After all, I didn't feel or remember anything?" she told us.<br><br>"But you lost your ...."<br><br>"No big deal. I was waiting for an opportunity to lose it anyway. Just treat it like an episode on the operating table."<br><br>We were shocked, but she did say that she didn't want to go back to the job anymore.<br><br></div>
