              <p>heh alot of degree girls are doing esscort.anyone want to comment on this topic?</p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Not to help them to adverstise their business but to expose so many students are doing it... just look at their occupation and you will be shock.That mean, any female students with the looks carrying a school bag looking innocent might be one of the female escorts group too.Wow, something the government must do something about it!I felt that yes, there is a supply and demand in this line, but it would be better if these escorts are already an working adult and not still schooling.That would at least be more acceptable.</p>
              <p>Bascially i don't look down on anyone doing escorting or prosituting.They are just providing a services like any other jobs, but of course it would came at a price.The ladies or guys doing it, their heart and soul will not be as complete as those who did not do it.</p>
              <p>I only don't respect those in high position highly paid but not doing anything to their people.These peoples are worst then a social escort!!!At least a social escort are doing their job professionally and get paid but those in high position are only getting highly paid but not doing anything to their people.</p>

              <p>"The girls who come under his 'care' are local Chinese aged between 20 and 24, amongst some who are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>undergraduates</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>The man elaborated that for <strong>undergrads</strong> the going rate is $400 per
                          hour, more that what other girls charge, which is $250 per hour.</p>
              <p>He told <em>Wanbao</em> that clients must make booking three hours in
                          advance, as well as handle their own hotel bookings. For house calls,
                          the clients must foot the taxi fares."</p>

              <p>We were discussing the pay of a nude model for life drawing class, which was 70 dollars an hour. 3 hours per session.</p>
              <p>And she was saying that she could earn more being one of those skimpy girls at the car/IT/tech exhibitions.</p>
              <p>Considering i could probably only get 5 dollars an hour on an average sales job, i was wondering if i should have been borned a woman instead.</p>

              <p>Let's see how many as the 'many' is presumed. Is it a huge amount, or is it just a minor few? Is it a sales gimmick, after all, i am sure the customers arent gonna ask for a CV, do they?</p>
              <p>No sense or point to antagonise our educated women, if it is just a few whom either want to experiment, earn big bucks out of a self gratification need or really in need of money to pay off the household expenses ( Even MPs had been known to loan money)</p>
              <p>To really help them, those who need the money to settle family matters should be directed for help. Such work will only harm their resume later when they graduated.</p>
              <p> Those who need the money for self gratification will need psychological counselling. Money isnt everything and what that piece of diploma obtain will offer a better deal than selling one's self respect, and dooming one's future.</p>
              <p>Social escorts is more than just another job. There is a social stigma attached, more so when there are sexual diseases that put such jobs at risk. This is not a job Singaporeans should seek out first, no matter how much it pays. Self-respect is more precious than gold, desired more by mankind. Once old and youth faded, its to the lonely pastures.</p>
              <p>Not much men would marry them or be faithful to them. Money isnt everything, for that inferiority complex will always stay, no matter how bedecked in gold and jewellry she wears, never to be taken seriously except when one can gain from her, and dump her when she is longer of use.</p>

              <p><br>mini, it all boils down to greed and materialism that these gals are after.   with greed and materialism how much can the govt please them.    govt should take care of people with genuine needs.</p>
              <p>BTW, the amsterdam whore centre looks professional and pleasant, not sleazy as the geylang in sg.   that is what i heard from a friend.    would like to take a look myself</p>

              <p>Let's see how many as the 'many' is presumed. Is it a huge
              amount, or is it just a minor few? Is it a sales gimmick, after
              all, i am sure the customers arent gonna ask for a CV, do they?</p>
              <p>No sense or point to antagonise our educated women, if it is
              just a few whom either want to experiment, earn big bucks out of a
              self gratification need or really in need of money to pay off the
              household expenses ( Even MPs had been known to loan money)</p>
              <p>To really help them, those who need the money to settle family
              matters should be directed for help. Such work will only harm their
              resume later when they graduated.</p>
              <p> Those who need the money for self gratification will need
              psychological counselling. Money isnt everything and what that
              piece of diploma obtain will offer a better deal than selling one's
              self respect, and dooming one's future.</p>
              <p>Social escorts is more than just another job. There is a social
              stigma attached, more so when there are sexual diseases that put
              such jobs at risk. This is not a job Singaporeans should seek out
              first, no matter how much it pays. Self-respect is more precious
              than gold, desired more by mankind. Once old and youth faded, its
              to the lonely pastures.</p>
              <p>Not much men would marry them or be faithful to them. Money isnt
              everything, for that inferiority complex will always stay, no
              matter how bedecked in gold and jewellry she wears, never to be
              taken seriously except when one can gain from her, and dump her
              when she is longer of use.</p>

              <p>How much 'money' does one really need? An independent lifestyle - apartment, clothes, accessories, food, cars? Simple job - just accompany clients and if one likes them, then bed with them. For the old fat ugly customers, the price would have to be right - an indecent proposal affordable by the customers anyway.</p>
              <p>I find it hard to condemn females in these trades due to survival needs, because their farming cousins overseas, who have an easier lifestyle such as farms to fall back on for subsitance are doing it as well, much less our females living in a city. When one is short of even 10cts to make it to $2.00, you will have to walk and not ride the MRT.</p>
              <p>Our cost of living is high, thus some, sick and tired of the miserly salaries, may be tempted to seek the easy way out. But they may be unaware of the high price they will have to pay later in life.</p>
              <p>Women of the night is not a trade or a way of life our singaporean girls must consider.<br>Education is only way out of poverty. Those with little education would have to either work extremely hard, or take the entreprenuer route. Therefore, we as a society, must do what we can to help pull everyone up, espacially our rich to be more fair with their earnings, educated more resourceful in planning and creation of opportunities and those in power to offer societal assitance where necessary, and not to condemn our Singaporean women to such detrimental lives other nations had either willing or hypocritcally subject them to. </p>

              <p><br>Out of curiousity, why is it somehow so much more dirty when girls use their bodies to earn money but somehow more honourable when a man uses his body to do manual labour?</p>
              <p>Both use the body that nature gave them, a woman's body definitely can't be used for manual labour(on a level equal to men) why should they need to compete on man's terms?</p>
