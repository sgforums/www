            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all,<br>just watched this late night japanese movie shown on TSC 8 yesterday night. The title of the movie is Himitsu's Secret.<br>The story is basically about the mother and teenage daughter died together in a bus accident. However, the mother's soul was being transferred into the daughter's body; while the daughter's soul has disappear.<br>Thus, because the body is the daughter's body and the soul's the mother, the father and mother won't be able to lead a normal husband and wife life. at first, the mother is trying to be a good wife and housewife and meanwhile trying to live the life of her daughter's by attending to school etc.<br>But, eventually, the father and mother just can't cope with this kind of life anymore.<br>In the end, the mother told the father that she is going to disappear and saying that their daughter's soul is coming back to her own body.<br>Thus, for the next few years, the mother has continued to live as the teenage daughter without the father knowing.<br>In the ending, the "daughter" get married to a guy and on the day of marriage, only then the father realised that the "daughter" is actually still his wife all the time.<br>After watching the show, I have a mixed feeling. One feeling is that the "mother"<br>is selfish to decide to live the life of the daughter's and get married again.Whereas, his husband continued to remain single and stay faithful to his wife. I think that they are not facing the reality that their daughter is already daed. But it is also difficult for them to maintain a normal husband and wife relationship.<br>What are your opinion to this show?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>watched the show over and over again. The plot is GREAT!<br>mmm... i think that its a relief to the both of them actually. And dun forget its the dad who said that Monami ( Naoko ) can lead her own life. Most prob she cried so hard over it that she came up with this plan. Its better rite? Both can lead their own normal life, with the fact that the mother is dead.<br>Also, they cannot maintain their own normal sex life. The dad juz cant do it with the daughter body. When the mum faked the whole thing, both of them could go lead their own life now, which is good for them.<br>I feel that its brave of the mother to do lead her life in her daughter's name ( she dun really have a choice, does she? ) and the father remain so faithful to his wife.<br>Apart the fantastic plot, the acting was great too! My god, tats what i call good acting too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Simply love the movie so much since 1999.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
