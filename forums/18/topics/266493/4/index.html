Abortion carries a risk . Also , you will kill a child of your own , that would have been the greatest sin . Abortion would also make her hard to get pregnant the next time when she plans to have a child .<br><br>People say , "wah give birth arh ? Need alot of $$$ leh .... " "So young give birth for what?" . True . But since you dont intend to have a baby yet , why have sex in the first place? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  And using "no money to raise child" is an excuse . Would you harm your own body , child and risk bing hard to get pregnant rather than give birth and plan about the child's livelihood instead?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
