            <div class='col-md body'>let me give my 2 cents worth of analysis ....<br>say for example, there is 200,000 girls in Singapore age 14 to 29, the age group where men are most interested in. If we divide them into 10 sub-group percentile based on looks, there will be 20,000 in each group. However, men are always visual species, all of them will go for the top 10 % beauties of the 200,000 gals regardless of how they themselves look or how much money they have. If these men succeed, they will try ways and means to rob these top 10% beauties of their virginity. If they flop, they will try the 2nd tier percentile and so on. The game will go on until they reach the 5th or 6th percentile and they will stop because after that, are the really below average looking girls.<br>If the above theory were to hold true, it will be nearly impossible for any guy to find a very pretty virgin in the above age group unless you are very very lucky or really go and test the laws and ambush outside secondary schools. If looks are not important, then there is a possibility. Look for the fattest and the ugliest and you can hit the jackpot that she is a V.<br><br>As for who are the lucky ones who got the "lion shares", of course they are either the very rich ones or the very lucky ones.<br>If I had tons of money to spend, I can chauffeur a pretty secondary school girl to school daily, buy big bouquet of flower for her, buy her expensive gift...etc, the chance of getting her (and her virginity) is very high as girls are very naive at the age. Also there is no one to rival me esp those poor schoolboy classmate.... If you are not rich, then you must be lucky enough to sit beside a pretty classmate in secondary school, then use whatever unscrupulous methods or "true love" to get her to bed....<br><br>If you are not rich or lucky, you will NEVER get a pretty Singaporean<br>virgin in this lifetime. The next best alternative is to try poorer neighboring countries.<br>Life is unfair Â… let us face itÂ…<br></div>
