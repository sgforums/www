Premarital sex, if strike a balance, is in fact a good thing to happen.<br><br>For me, I believe in cohabitation and premarital sex. We are in the modern age. It is not easy to balance between normal love life and cohabitation &amp; premarital sex. But bear in mind, if done at the appropriate stage of the relationship, it would in fact boost the bond between two person.<br><br>Cohabitation and Premarital Sex allows you to understand a person more in-depth. You will be able to see the other side of him/her that you do not see normally, like living habits which can be very minor details but potential cause of divorce/break-ups. Trust me, seen such cases happen all the time. Eg. The girl hate the eating habit of the guy, who likes to have alot of dishes but each eating a little and never finish up the whole dish, leaving behind alot of left-overs. Furthermore, you never know how your other half react to love making, whether both of you can satisfy each other or not. In a successful relationship, there will always be a minimum level of satisfaction between both parties. Else, get ready to see one party leaving for someone else cause he/she ain't satisfied in their sex life. Eg. A fren of mine cheated on her husband coz her husband cannot really satisfied her sexual needs, and later end up with divorce juz after 2-3 years of marriage.<br><br>It is up to individual's mentality and believes. And thus, we should respect other fellow human for their believes, and not condemn it.</div>
