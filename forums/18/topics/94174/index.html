            <div class='col-md body'>Joseph Cocho, 47, of Maple Avenue was being held at the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in lieu of $25,000 bail on charges of torturing a dog and owning a dagger for an unlawful purpose. He told police he had a conventional bomb enhanced by radioactive materials in the mobile home where he lived, said Detective James Ryan of the South Brunswick Police Department.<br><br>Mr. Cocho was charged with torturing an animal and illegal possession of a weapon after a woman he sublet a trailer from told police <strong>she saw him having sex with her dog, police said</strong>. Mr. Cocho rented space inside the woman's trailer. <strong>Police found dog hair matching the dog's coat on Mr. Cocho's jeans</strong>, police said.<br><br>Mr. Cocho's bail was originally set at $1,000 but a Superior Court Judge raised it to $25,000, according to the inmate information department of the county corrections center.<br><br>The Middlesex County ASPCA filed two criminal and two civil animal cruelty charges against Mr. Cocho, Detective Ryan said.<br><br>Mr. Cocho faces up to two years in jail and up to $2,000 in fines, Detective Ryan said. Police also found a 12-inch dagger and several smaller knives in Mr. Cocho's room, according to report.<br><br>Mr. Cocho also allegedly shouted anti-Italian epithets at an officer and made several other assertions while being arrested, according to the report. Mr. Cocho told police he believed people who died in a recent earthquake in Italy had donated blood to inhabitants of Central America through organ transplants, according to the report.<br><br>An investigative team including the South Brunswick Police, the New Jersey State Police bomb squad, and bomb sniffing dogs acted on a judge's warrant and searched the home and the park's common areas Monday, Detective Ryan said.<br><br>Mr. Cocho was renting space In the trailer against park regulations that prohibit subletting and require examination of those who wish to live in the development. "Basically, anyone who comes into the mobile home park, we do a criminal background check and a credit check," said Arthur Roedel, who owns the park. "This is the kind of thing that happens when people are careless," Mr. Roedel said.<br><br>After investigating the incident, police arrested Cocho at the home, and charged him with torture/torment of animals and unlawful possession of a weapon Â— a 12-inch dagger police discovered in his room.<br><br>The weapons charge was later dismissed because police could not determine that Cocho had the dagger for an unlawful purpose. The other charges were downgraded to a disorderly persons offense.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HIV man had sex with a nanny goat<br><br>Martin Wainwright<br>Thursday March 14, 2002<br>The Guardian<br><br>A judge decided yesterday to spend two more days deciding what sentence was apt for a man spotted by commuters having sex with a goat.<br>Stephen Hall, 23, who is HIV positive, was wrestled to the ground by walkers who found him with the animal on allotments in east Hull as the passengers, on a train to Bridlington, called the police on their mobile phones.<br><br>The commuter train had stopped at a red light, overlooking a shelter of tin sheets where Hall had imprisoned the nanny goat with his belt. Hull crown court was told that Hall had decided to assault the animal in a "spontaneous act".<br><br>Judge Michael Mettyear told the court he was "sceptical" there was any programme helpful to Hall.<br><br>He was asked by Chris Dunn, defending, to bear in mind the consequences of a jail term for this unemployed and sick man. "It is difficult to know what else to say to mitigate in [this] case," said Mr Dunn. "All right-minded, normal thinking people would find this abhorrent. Clearly [he] needs help."<br><br><strong>The court heard that Hall was seen having sex with the goat by a man walking with his grandson near Argyle Street allotments. Hall hid but then backed into view again, with his trousers round his ankles and a tight grip on the goat.</strong><br>He pleaded guilty to buggery at an earlier hearing. Rebecca Thornton, prosecuting, said the goat had suffered distress during the assault, which went on for up to 10 minutes.<br><br></div>
