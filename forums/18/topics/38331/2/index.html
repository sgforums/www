If you were to mind and get bothered over it - you are NO better than the guy who raped her because YOU are the one who reminded her about her past and actually make her feel that she is worthless because of it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>My tudi (Disciple)'s ex was a victim of such case. She was inferior and deep within her, she suffered psychological problem as she feels that she wasn't worthy of him. My tudi didn't mind, but the shadow kept haunting her, until eventually, she made the decision to leave him - which of course causes much distress and sorrow to both parties.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>A rape victim is needs more than just love in generally - a victim themselves, their image of men &amp; love is tanished. If you truly love her - You must:<br><br>I) Guide her, lead her and enlighten her that past experience will serve to build her.<br><br>II) Treasure and love her equal or more - she is no lesser than any of your ex.<br><br>You must prepare to run that extra mile in the relationship and as always, are you willing to make that extra mile?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
