            <div class='col-md body'>Dec 8, 2004<br><span class="large"><strong>Idol's mum jailed for hiding bankruptcy</strong> </span><br>By Selina Lum<br><br>THE mother of Singapore Idol first runner-up Sylvester Sim has been jailed for five weeks for borrowing money without disclosing that she is a bankrupt.<br><br>Her sentence comes less than a week after the 21-year-old freelance graphic designer was defeated last Wednesday by national serviceman Taufik Batisah, in the finals of the popular TV talent show.<br><br>On Monday, a magistrate's court convicted Sim's mother, Avigline Lim Poh Leng, 44, for borrowing $5,000 from Madam Chay See Soon, without telling the woman she was a bankrupt.<br><br>The court heard that Madam Chay, believed to be an acquaintance, and her husband had given Lim a cheque for $5,000 as a personal loan in March last year.<br><br>The couple made a complaint to the Official Assignee six months later. To date, Lim has repaid $1,050.<br><br>Lim, who did not have a lawyer, said in her mitigation plea she was taking medication for depression.<br><br>It is an offence under the Bankruptcy Act for a bankrupt to obtain credit of $500 or more without disclosing his or her status.<br><br>The maximum punishment is a $10,000 fine and a jail term of up to three years.<br><br>Even during the run-up to the finals, Sim's mother, who was made a bankrupt in June 2002, made headlines.<br><br>It was reported that seven people had made police reports against her, alleging they gave her $132,000 - of which $90,000 remains unpaid - for a business venture to provide food and lodging to students from Indonesia.<br><br>One woman claimed she had tried to get the money back from Lim when it seemed the business was not taking off, but received only excuses.<br><br>At one point, it looked like Sim, whose rocker image set many teen girls' hearts a-flutter, might be dragged into the scandal, as some of the dud cheques received by his mother's business partners had been issued in his name.<br><br>Despite the media attention, Lim turned up at the Indoor Stadium with her husband Larry to support their son, known affectionately as Sly, at the Singapore Idol finals.<br><br>Sim, who came second but ended up with the same prize as winner Taufik, is expected to be groomed for the Mandarin pop market.<br><br>He told MediaCorp's Channel News Asia: 'I am saddened by what has happened. But I need to focus on things coming up ahead. I will cover up my pain and concentrate on doing what I have to do for my career, and for my fans who have been supporting me all this way.'<br><br></div>
