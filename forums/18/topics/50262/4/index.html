However, this assumption is inconsistent with the following: (1) about 10% of all males and females prefer anal intercourse and thus AIDS should have spread into the heterosexual population...and (2)the risk of women for both HIV infection and AIDS is the same for those who practice anal intercourse as for those who practice other types of intercourse.</span><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Duesberg ignores the fact that Bolling and Voeller disagree with his view that anal sex is not a risk factor for AIDS, along with his implicit argument that anal intercourse is no more likely to transmit HIV than vaginal. They write that "receptive anal intercourse carries the highest relative risk by far for homosexual men" and express concern that it will contribute to the escalation of HIV infection among heterosexuals. Further, in regard to women who practice anal sex, they write: "this pool of women is increasingly endangered." </span><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Additionally, Duesberg fails to point out that Bolling and Voeller note that women who practice anal sex probably have fewer partners and a lower frequency of it than gay males. This provides an explanation for the dramatically lower incidence of AIDS associated with the sexual practices of women, in comparison to gay men. Finally, in his reference section, Duesberg fails to indicate that the work cited is a letter, not an article. </span><br><br></div>
