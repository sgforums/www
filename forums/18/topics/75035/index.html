            <div class='col-md body'>When I was in Poly, I have one rather young male lecturer, in his late twenties but has a doctorate from Imperial College. He is the most struck up person I ever seen in my life. When you ask him questions, he sneer at you for asking stupid questions and ask you to find yourself. But when a girl with a pretty ask him, he bring her to his room to dicuss the problem. And worst of all, he never look at you in his eyes when he is teaching, his  head and nose are so high above that I suspect he thinks we some kind of dung. I hope he burns in hell.</div>
