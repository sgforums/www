Everyone knows best at heart. Im equally angry at her for being so naive in giving the BASTARD a FAT chance to get away scot-free after <span style="font-style: italic;">enjoying a virgin</span>.<br><br>I bet many pple r still not getting wat i mean. Look at the situation differently. The focus isnt the BASTARD's acts nor my galfren's naviety, it's abt a gal who gave her 1st time away bcoz she had trusted some1 though the 'person' wasnt worthy at all.<br><br>In fact, the same day when I heard of this heart-breaking news fr my galfren, I had another galfren telling me tt she had been suicidal for the past few days over a guy who admitted likeing her but hinted more of SEX than dating her <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>She was really dispaired....utterly disappted with men &amp; she told me, <span style="color: red;">'you know, i do not understand how men can just turn off their feelings like that' </span>Well, I was speechless. No answer have I. I only know that emotions have been women's weakness all along. <strong>We, being the women, can only remind ourselves constantly abt it so tt men out to hurt women can never have the upper hand.</strong><br>Yet, I wonder abt this conclusion at the back of every woman's mind made abt men, if we cant trust our feelings, dun blame us tt we can see only $$$ bringing more security to us.[/b]</blockquote>I understand... but dis is abit extreme loh... TRUE got bastards &amp; a**holes... but there r nice guys... if she view ALL guys as 1 type... then her life gone... so sum times its very confusing...<br><br>Cannot do much abt it either... can only learn from it... dats Y I "HATE" mankind for dis... da ability to tink... if he dun have da ability to tink, how can he harbour such tots? but then again... its a matter of good vs bad... like a coin... 2 sides of da same thing... confusing...<br><br>I feel sorry for yr fren... try to cheer her up. have fun or do anything, those dat dun have to make her remind of dat incident...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think we just need prudence is choosing friends as we go out and have fun.. putting trust in the wrong persons can be a dangerous thing.. it is especially so for a lady, they are most of the time at the disadvantage..<br><br>at the same time, earning someone's trust is a precious thing and all of of us shouldn't take it for granted.. whether it is friendship between persons of the same sex or opposite..<br><br>all in all, we just have to learn how to have self-respect and how to love ourselves.. by all means have fun, but also be wise in protecting your own well-being.. it's not just about your life, ppl around you that loves you will be hurt if anything bad should befall you..</div>

She had taken a liking to this guy (BASTARD) for awhile &amp; well...she cld 'sense' tt he liked her too....<br><br>One unfortunate day, they went for a movie, an RA movie. And the guy muz have gone wild after tt, the horniness in him exploding, she followed him to his house after supper.<br><br>TADA! GONE!!! Fruit of the Forbidden given to the BASTARD.<br><br>Why a BASTARD?<br>He was so nasty to her. Although she told him tt she was in pain, tt BASTARD carried on &amp; forced his stupid penis inside her.<br>What a tormenting session! She trusted the guy but he betrayed her this trust. He avoided her when she sms her <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Feel so sad for my galfren <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> though I find tt her naviety is partly the fault for all tt had happened. However, I wanna share this story to all guyz who may feel like taking advantage of a gal &amp; making use of her feelings &amp; trust in u guyz, think abt this gal (my fren) if she happens to be ur gdfren, dear sister, daughter or whoever close to u, will u do it? Pls search ur conscience.</div></blockquote>I really sympathize with your galfriend. Although the guy is a bastard, I wonder why your gf will want to watch a RA movie with him and why did she follow him back to his house.<br><br>He is of course wrong, but did he "rape" your gf as in tear her clothes off?? I think probably not. Most prob they were fooling around willingly petting and stripping each other but your gf have no intention to have sex or decide to back out at the last minute.<br><br>Sorry if I sound cold, but your gf should take some responsibilities also.<br><br>And come-on, it is not easy to actually rape a girl (not that I have done it, for I have the highest respect for ladies), but if your gf put up a fight and struggle and is sober, it is difficult for the guy to rape her.<br><br>To those sexually active people, why don't you try this with your partner. The lady is to pretend that she is raped and "resist by struggling/wiggling, then the guy try to insert it in. and it is not easy OK. One ex-policeman told me this and I tried it with my gf and sure enough, it is damn difficult and we had a good laugh, I have to ask her to stop.<br><br>Of course if the gal is drugged/drunk or threatened and didn't resist then I don't know lah.<br><br>Did the bastard beat her or use a knife to threaten her?<br><br>And to the ladies, if a guy rape you, will you sms him back?<br><br>Your gf is cheated no doubt, but not rape. If a girl give in willingly and then change her mind later on. I don't think we can call that rape.<br><br></div>
