You can get std when after you 'poke' then never go urine.<br><br>Confuse? let me explained.<br><br>When you 'poke', bacteria or some sort, stay intact together with both of u.<br>For girl, they just have to go toilet and spray water into their 'inner self'. all germ and bacteria is gone.<br><br>But guys, 70% normally just go wash up. When wash up... you just clean your skin, getting rid of the slimieness but as you think back... these 'germs' are already inside your urine passage. How to get rid of it? simple... GO URINE LAH! then the germ will be washed out of u.<br><br>Ways of getting STD (sex transmitted diesease) or UTI (urine thread infection) is quite simple....<br><br>Screw your partner in a place where you can't wash yourself up.<br>Screw your partner, then go to sleep naked, wake up the naxt day and screw her again.<br>And the final way that i know is screw a partner not know if she already have that diesease.<br><br>Getting STD and UTI is a big NO NO... If you encountered a burning feeling while urinating, getter consult a doctor. I'm not sure for girls part of the conquences but for guy, if you played a risk and heck care, you will soon, NOT to be developing a baby.<br><br>How I know all this? Don't ask.<br>Kyohei86... I hope this will help.<br>I know most guys don't wear rubber. Saying no feeling and all that. Heh... I too never wear it... I just don't want to waste money just for a 30minute or more exercise... but like what others say... it's better to be safe then sorrie... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
