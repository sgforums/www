            <div class='col-md body'>if these are such a shock to you... then I guess none of you will ever believe this... anyway, the choice is yours... while I'd the experience<br><br>there was this time many years back when I was feeling a little ill and decided to go to my neighbourhood clinic for a check-up. It was my first time to the clinic, and I'd expected a male doc from the name.<br><br>it came as a little surprise when it actually turned out to be a female doc instead... and a rather young one too. I wouldn't try and spice up the story to say that she was a chio one, but just an average one. btw, I was there for stomach pains....<br><br>so it was the usual, I was asked to lay on the examination bed... and was told to pull my shorts down a little so that she can examine my stomach... a little pressing here and there to check for any abnormal lumps or if its pain anywhere she pressed... during that routine check, she started asking if I'd any girlfriend. I didnt think it was really wrong as it could have been some casual chat... I was attached then, so naturally I said yes... then she pop the next question: Do you guys engage in S.E.X?<br><br>by then, I was a little embarassed cos I've never shared this with anyone of the opposite sex before. but I guess she must have a reason for asking and so I'd replied obediently, yes we did on couple of occassions. Then she continued to ask if I masturbate... omg, I didn't know what to do then apart from admitting I do too... then she went off and when she came back, she had her rubber gloves on and ask me to pull my shorts down... I pull them down and she ask me how do I do it, masturbate, and ask me to show her... I just described it and while I was doing so, she helped herself to my privates... while she was doing it, she ask if that was the way I do it... Up till that moment, I was still trying to think that its a routine check, maybe a little abnormal but I guess she knows what she was doing....<br><br>I dont know how to describe that moment, while feeling embarrassed, I was getting aroused... I erected. When I did, she ask if that was the way I liked it and continued... I swear I almost lost control and wanted to grope her, but I managed to control that urge... One thing I didn't control was that I almost came... when she saw my face twitched, she stopped. God, why did she...when I was about to climax... anyway, she left hurriedly and while she was doing that, I sensed that its time for me to put on my shorts...which I did.<br><br>when I went back to the table, she just asked me the usual routine questions like if I was allergic to any medications... I left the room after that... and till this day, this incident is still very clear in my mind and I'm still trying to understand, whats stomach pains got to do with masturbation... I never went back to that clinic since so I don't know if she is still there... I didn't think it was appropriate for me to go back there and ask for the rationale of her actions, I didn't lose anything... so left it that way....<br><br>mind you folks, this is definitely not a story from those Jap AVs or any other pornos, but a real life experience...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sounds dramatic but i'm not surprise!  i know a lot of dark secrets of the healthcare industry and would like to share with u all too.<br><br>One of my doc friends told me that when he was working in hospital as  a medical officer, he enjoyed his work cos can see different type of breasts every day.  If a chio bu patient came to visit him, he will ask her to strip for examination although it is not necessary.  He even commented tat its very easy to trick a patient cos they thought tat u are professional and follow exactly wat u ask them to do.  To think tat ppl trust them but some docs are taking advantage of their profession!<br><br>I oso had another personal exp.  I went to visit a GP cos i had constipation and it was painful when passing motion.  I was expecting him for some laxative, but to my surprise, he said he needs to examine me to see if my anal had any prob.  I was caught by surprise cos i dun know wat to do,  so i obliged.  Then he poked his bloody finger into my arse hole!  Later on I found out from other docs that it is not necessary to examine unless there's other complications like pus etc.  I really felt cheated!  Kena molest for no reason!!<br><br>So better find out wat's required in a medical examination.  You can always request for a female doc if u dont feel comfortable.  It's consumers' rights!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That, my friend, is called a per rectal examination. It is supposed to be routine for the doc to do it if u come in for diarrhoea or constipation.<br>IN the army, the docs perform it all the time. (tts y ppl think twice when they wanna fake mc))<br>Its just that they don't do it that often outside the army cos 1) they're busier 2) army boys<br>can't complain. the public tend to make a lot of noise.</div>
