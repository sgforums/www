            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the largest sect of Buddhism in Japan is True Pure Land Buddhism, or Jodou Shin-shu. It's a sub-sect of the Amida Cult, more popularly known as Pure Land Buddhism, the mainstream of Mahayana Buddhism, the opposite of Buddhism in Singapore, which is the more cultarally Indian Hinayana sect. Ours is more Chinese.<br><br>In Jodo Shin-shu, we are the only sect which have abandoned going to a monastery. We do not have to shave our heads, and monks can marry and do anything they please.<br><br>My parents were Jodou Shin-shu, but recently I decided to convert to Tendai. Tendai is more conservative, and has a monastery, etc. But even in Tendai, you can have vulgar thoughts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Wunming, please answer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I can say what that means, if you don't believe I'm Japanese.

Are there any Mahayana temples?<br><br>And guys, please answer the poll! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>You are most welcome.  Regarding your questions on religion here, I can't really answer you fully.  But we have a wide diversity of religions here even if there are minorities.  As for me, I'm a free thinker.<br><br>With regards to your poll, most singapore guys are still pretty shy and conservative about revealing such info.  Although sometimes they do brag abit, but they are pretty clear to what extent they must stop.  I could be wrong on that part, but its just my personal opinion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.. this may be a bar, but we arnt that open enough i guess. Since it'll probably spoil our reputation, which many of us have spent many post to create it. I suggest you go sites like sammy boy (Im not sure of link, maybe someone can help you with it) or give us your email so we can tell you our private "adventures" without it going all over the net..<br><br>anyway, good luck to you in finding the way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
