There are so many ways to make girl hony or high.<br><br>Fore play<br>1) not neccessary that fore starts only from bed, you may starts when you met her, example, ticker her lower spain while talking to her.<br>2) some light "dirty talking"... bring her to the imagination<br><br>3) on the bed finger her, when you hear some noice that signal you that she likes that "spot" stay there and contiune at that please.<br><br>4) when she cum contiune the last action you did for another 10secs before you stop your actions.<br><br>5) If you want the girl to cum, you must not cum so fast must try out many times to know which action can make her cum. Not many pattern you do that will make them cum, The most you can find is 2 or 3 action, so just stay with that if you want them to cum. The rest of the pattern or avtion you do they only feel nice but won't cum.<br><br>All the above are provide by a lesbain friend, and tested by me certify its works.<br><br>If don't understand my english please ask again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
