            <div class='col-md body'>A friend of mine told me today that this happened to him:<br><br>Happened when he went clubbing at Boat Quay once. One of his earlier clubbing experiences in fact. Anyway, he was sitting alone for a while at one of those high stools. There was this group, mostly girls, dancing in front of him. He was just sitting there when he was hit in the face by hair. The girl then turned to him and smiled then carried on dancing. My friend was stunned, but he didn't respond. Just continue to sit there. Then, this time round, the girl spun while dancing and brushed her hand over erm, somewhere  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> . And again,  she turns around and grins.<br><br>He doesn't respond. Just so happens his friend comes over and pulls him away. From what he says, I get the idea his perception of girls in singapore dramatically changed after that.<br><br>So it kind of made me wonder, do guys really hint to guys like that at clubs or did my friend just have a weirder than usual encounter?</div>

One of his earlier clubbing experiences in fact. Anyway, he was sitting alone for a while at one of those high stools. There was this group, mostly girls, dancing in front of him. He was just sitting there when he was hit in the face by hair. The girl then turned to him and smiled then carried on dancing. My friend was stunned, but he didn't respond. Just continue to sit there. Then, this time round, the girl spun while dancing and brushed her hand over erm, somewhere  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> . And again,  she turns around and grins.<br><br>He doesn't respond. Just so happens his friend comes over and pulls him away. From what he says, I get the idea his perception of girls in singapore dramatically changed after that.<br><br>So it kind of made me wonder, do guys really hint to guys like that at clubs or did my friend just have a weirder than usual encounter?</div></blockquote>hahaha seen that move before...why ur friend never respond.. sure got chance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
