            <div class='col-md body'>That Wonderful Missionary Position<br><br>Perhaps the best known position in the Western world, The Missionary has often been thought of as unadventurous and amateurish. Nothing could be farther from the truth! In this very tender and intimate position the man is on top laying down and facing his partner. The full body contact felt in the missionary position gives a unique level of closeness between the two partners which is heightened by the ability to kiss, caress and hold each other close during coitus. The drawbacks of such a position have largely to do with the position of the female. Her pelvic movements are extremely restricted which means that she plays a more passive role. This limited freedom is unappealing to many women. Yet, the missionary position allows for easy entry, deep penetration and uncompromised intimacy.<br><br>The Missionary Position Described<br><br>The female lies on her back with her legs spread apart. The male then lowers himself on top of the female with his arms supporting his weight. From this position the male has the freedom to thrust or make circular movements with his thighs. If he lowers himself closer to her and rests some of his weight on top of her body, his pubic bone can provide gentle clitoral stimulation. The female can thrust her middle body towards the man using the support of her legs, or grasp the man from behind controlling somewhat his thrusting movements.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 1: Lifting Legs<br><br>Once you and your partner are in the missionary position, you can try many variations which will give different sensations. The first is that the woman can lift and bend her legs slightly with her feet flat on the mattress. Many women find this position more comfortable than the traditional missionary position. It allows for greater access to the vagina which means that both partners will enjoy more intense stimulation. This position can be further enhanced if the woman can put her feet on her partner's buttocks. Adding a particularly delightful feel for the female as the male's pubic bone gently rubs against her clitoris. This is only one slight variant to the traditional position but this simple change will have effects on the way you both feel.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 2: Locking Legs<br><br>For those of you who want to experience deeper penetration than the previous position, it can be attained quite easily. In this case the woman raises her legs higher and locks them around her partner. The higher she can raise her legs, the deeper the penetration because access to the vagina is better facilitated. If she has the flexibility to lock her legs around her partner then she can contribute to his leverage by squeezing him close to her or just hold him with her thighs. Many men find that the feel of their partner's legs around them to be a real turn on. One significant drawback of this position is that some men find it results in hurried orgasms. For this reason we might suggest that you leave this position towards the end of your lovemaking.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 3: Over the shoulders<br><br>One of the great positions in lovemaking is when the woman places her legs on her partner's shoulders, on both sides of his head. From this position lovers can attain the deepest possible penetration. Be aware that this position can allow too deep a penetration, causing irritation for the woman. The man should always take his cues from his partner and move slowly. The further back her legs are the deeper the possible penetration.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 4: Kneeling male<br><br>Are you feeling a bit adventurous? Although the previous positions have focused on comfort or depth of penetration we have another which promises a unique feeling. The female lies on her back on the bed with the male kneeling and sitting on his ankles between her thighs. From this position he grabs her thighs and brings her to him. Her bottom and lower back are elevated while her ankles or lower legs rest on his shoulders. To add to her comfort you can place a pillow under her lower back and a couple under her head. Unfortunately there can still be some muscle strain experienced by the woman so this position can not be held for a prolonged period. The female can massage her clitoris manually in this position, or her partner can apply a vibrator. The Pocket Rocket is a handy little vibrator for these occasions. Adding variety of stimulation to your lovemaking will increase the pleasure. An interesting aspect of this position is that the man can view the penetration easily which for many is an exciting sight. It also allows the man to deliver a sensual massage of his partnerÂ’s stomach, breasts and arms. This is not a position designed for speedy movements or rapid lovemaking, but rather a slow and intimate encounter.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 5: Using your bed<br><br>The elevation of the bed makes it possible for some very interesting positions. In this position the female lies on the bed with her legs draped over the edge and her feet resting on the floor. The male then kneels on the floor between her thighs. The success of this position depends heavily on the elevation of the bed, which for some is not quite at the height required. One of the beautiful things about this position is the range of movement possible for both partners. A woman has more control over movement as she can press herself against him to add to the penetration or rotate her hips for interesting stimulation. Likewise the male has an unparalleled amount of leverage and freedom of movement.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 6: Legs get together<br><br>Most women enjoy the missionary position with legs apart. This is not necessary and many couples prefer positions where the woman can keep her legs closed. Added stimulation and unique sensations are usually what result. When her legs are closed, a womanÂ’s vagina tightens around her partnerÂ’s penis giving more intense stimulation to both partners. This position also forces the man to enter from a sharper angle towards the clitoris adding more stimulation for the woman. The man in this position may also close his legs, placing all is weight on his partner. Careful here, some women appreciate this feeling, others are burdened by it!<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 7: Tantric Essences<br><br>This is an enjoyable and very special position often found in Tantric literature. In this position the woman lies on her back on the bed. Her partner kneels sitting on his ankles close to her buttocks. From here he hoists both of her legs onto one of his shoulders. A little bit of guidance from his partner and you are both in a deliciously unique position. This one is not for those who have problems with flexibility. You will both be surprised at the unique angle of penetration which many women find delightful. The penis massages the side wall of the vagina which does not get the same attention with other positions. If the female wants to try massaging the opposite wall of the vagina then all you must do move her legs to the male's other shoulder. The movement in this position is mostly up to the male. Some men may find it difficult to thrust with both legs on their shoulders but with time it becomes easier. Allow yourself some time to become accustomed to this position because it is a tricky one to master.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wendy81:</div><div class="quote_body">That Wonderful Missionary Position<br><br>Perhaps the best known position in the Western world, The Missionary has often been thought of as unadventurous and amateurish. Nothing could be farther from the truth! In this very tender and intimate position the man is on top laying down and facing his partner. The full body contact felt in the missionary position gives a unique level of closeness between the two partners which is heightened by the ability to kiss, caress and hold each other close during coitus. The drawbacks of such a position have largely to do with the position of the female. Her pelvic movements are extremely restricted which means that she plays a more passive role. This limited freedom is unappealing to many women. Yet, the missionary position allows for easy entry, deep penetration and uncompromised intimacy.<br><br>The Missionary Position Described<br><br>The female lies on her back with her legs spread apart. The male then lowers himself on top of the female with his arms supporting his weight. From this position the male has the freedom to thrust or make circular movements with his thighs. If he lowers himself closer to her and rests some of his weight on top of her body, his pubic bone can provide gentle clitoral stimulation. The female can thrust her middle body towards the man using the support of her legs, or grasp the man from behind controlling somewhat his thrusting movements.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 1: Lifting Legs<br><br>Once you and your partner are in the missionary position, you can try many variations which will give different sensations. The first is that the woman can lift and bend her legs slightly with her feet flat on the mattress. Many women find this position more comfortable than the traditional missionary position. It allows for greater access to the vagina which means that both partners will enjoy more intense stimulation. This position can be further enhanced if the woman can put her feet on her partner's buttocks. Adding a particularly delightful feel for the female as the male's pubic bone gently rubs against her clitoris. This is only one slight variant to the traditional position but this simple change will have effects on the way you both feel.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 2: Locking Legs<br><br>For those of you who want to experience deeper penetration than the previous position, it can be attained quite easily. In this case the woman raises her legs higher and locks them around her partner. The higher she can raise her legs, the deeper the penetration because access to the vagina is better facilitated. If she has the flexibility to lock her legs around her partner then she can contribute to his leverage by squeezing him close to her or just hold him with her thighs. Many men find that the feel of their partner's legs around them to be a real turn on. One significant drawback of this position is that some men find it results in hurried orgasms. For this reason we might suggest that you leave this position towards the end of your lovemaking.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 3: Over the shoulders<br><br>One of the great positions in lovemaking is when the woman places her legs on her partner's shoulders, on both sides of his head. From this position lovers can attain the deepest possible penetration. Be aware that this position can allow too deep a penetration, causing irritation for the woman. The man should always take his cues from his partner and move slowly. The further back her legs are the deeper the possible penetration.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 4: Kneeling male<br><br>Are you feeling a bit adventurous? Although the previous positions have focused on comfort or depth of penetration we have another which promises a unique feeling. The female lies on her back on the bed with the male kneeling and sitting on his ankles between her thighs. From this position he grabs her thighs and brings her to him. Her bottom and lower back are elevated while her ankles or lower legs rest on his shoulders. To add to her comfort you can place a pillow under her lower back and a couple under her head. Unfortunately there can still be some muscle strain experienced by the woman so this position can not be held for a prolonged period. The female can massage her clitoris manually in this position, or her partner can apply a vibrator. The Pocket Rocket is a handy little vibrator for these occasions. Adding variety of stimulation to your lovemaking will increase the pleasure. An interesting aspect of this position is that the man can view the penetration easily which for many is an exciting sight. It also allows the man to deliver a sensual massage of his partnerÂ’s stomach, breasts and arms. This is not a position designed for speedy movements or rapid lovemaking, but rather a slow and intimate encounter.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 5: Using your bed<br><br>The elevation of the bed makes it possible for some very interesting positions. In this position the female lies on the bed with her legs draped over the edge and her feet resting on the floor. The male then kneels on the floor between her thighs. The success of this position depends heavily on the elevation of the bed, which for some is not quite at the height required. One of the beautiful things about this position is the range of movement possible for both partners. A woman has more control over movement as she can press herself against him to add to the penetration or rotate her hips for interesting stimulation. Likewise the male has an unparalleled amount of leverage and freedom of movement.<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 6: Legs get together<br><br>Most women enjoy the missionary position with legs apart. This is not necessary and many couples prefer positions where the woman can keep her legs closed. Added stimulation and unique sensations are usually what result. When her legs are closed, a womanÂ’s vagina tightens around her partnerÂ’s penis giving more intense stimulation to both partners. This position also forces the man to enter from a sharper angle towards the clitoris adding more stimulation for the woman. The man in this position may also close his legs, placing all is weight on his partner. Careful here, some women appreciate this feeling, others are burdened by it!<br><br>Adding to the Missionary Position 7: Tantric Essences<br><br>This is an enjoyable and very special position often found in Tantric literature. In this position the woman lies on her back on the bed. Her partner kneels sitting on his ankles close to her buttocks. From here he hoists both of her legs onto one of his shoulders. A little bit of guidance from his partner and you are both in a deliciously unique position. This one is not for those who have problems with flexibility. You will both be surprised at the unique angle of penetration which many women find delightful. The penis massages the side wall of the vagina which does not get the same attention with other positions. If the female wants to try massaging the opposite wall of the vagina then all you must do move her legs to the male's other shoulder. The movement in this position is mostly up to the male. Some men may find it difficult to thrust with both legs on their shoulders but with time it becomes easier. Allow yourself some time to become accustomed to this position because it is a tricky one to master.<br></div></blockquote>wah peng eh..so late sitll wanna me read this article..i think my eyes going to pop out like goldfish liaoz..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
