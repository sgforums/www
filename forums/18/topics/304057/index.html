            <div class='col-md body'>Because I haven circumsize my foreskin yet since young, so my dad recently suggested that I go for it cos he say its better as it is more hygenic. But my friend told me that if you cut off your foreskin, your sexual pleasure during sex will go down to 70%, he said its been proven cos your penis will be less sensitive.<br><br>So my dad told me to just go and ask the doctor about it. And it happened, the doctor at the poly clinic near my house was a young male trainee doctor! Ok, he isn't very handsome and i am not GAY. So i went back to my university to look for my professor to ask some personal question. The professor at the university near my house was a young female associate professor! Ok, she isn't very pretty but very cute.<br><br>So anyway, she asked me if my fore skin is very long, cos if its long, and it affects me when I masturbate or have an erection, its better to cut it if not will affect my sexual life next time. I told herr its kind of long but I never had much problems masturbating.<br><br>She then asked me to lie down and take off my trousers and underwear. So I was very excited and nervous and I was trying my best not to get an erection! But if I didnt erect, it will look very small and will be paiseh.<br><br>So I didnt know whether to let it erect by itself or try to surpress it. It seem to have a life of its own.<br><br>So I took them off halfway down and look up at the ceiling.She put on his gloves and feel my foreskin, I could feel the thing standing up already. Then she tried to push it backward but because I wasnt fully erected yet, so cant. So she told me to relax and try to let it erect by itself. Then I just stared at the ceiling for about 3 mins.<br><br>Then she grab my penis and push it back in, pulling back my foreskin. Then she pull it out again, like giving a handjob! He did it three times! Then she said its ok since there's no problem since it doesnt hinder when I try to pull back the skin.<br><br>OMG MY PENIS WAS DRIPPING FLUID ALREADY BY THE TIME SHE TOLD ME TO PUT ON MY PANTS! MY MIND GOT BLOWN AWAY TODAY MAN!<br><br>I LOVE MY PROFESSOR !!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
