How can i explain to her i did not do anything with other girls? I tot of buying flowers and write her love letters hope it helps. Last time that one oso not affair, i just went pub and drink met this lady and she french kiss me that's all. But I am honest and I told my wife what happen and being honest i was awarded two slaps left and right. plus the trust is fading. Really regret telling her last time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>me very angry for being accused. Might as well go out and bed other girls. I so honest with her and she suspect this and that. don't even allow me to go out with my friends for a drink at night. Somemore scold my friend. Sometimes I so angry with her but what to do she is my dear dear anyway i still love her. I never use condom with her for a very long time already so I guess that the reason why she suspect.</div>
