            <div class='col-md body'>Just be a bit patient and tolerant towards her. Just make sure she is not suffering from this:<br><br><strong>Postpartum Depression (PPD)</strong><br>A serious condition that requires treatment from a health care provider. With this condition, feelings of the baby blues (feeling sad, anxious, afraid, or confused after having a baby) do not go away or get worse.<br><br>There are three types of PPD women can have after giving birth:<br><br>The baby blues happen in many women in the days right after childbirth. A new mother can have sudden mood swings, such as feeling very happy and then feeling very sad. She may cry for no reason and can feel impatient, irritable, restless, anxious, lonely, and sad. The baby blues may last only a few hours or as long as 1 to 2 weeks after delivery. The baby blues do not always require treatment from a health care provider. Often, joining a support group of new moms or talking with other moms helps.<br><br>Postpartum depression (PPD) can happen a few days or even months after childbirth. PPD can happen after the birth of any child, not just the first child. A woman can have feelings similar to the baby blues - sadness, despair, anxiety, irritability - but she feels them much more strongly than she would with the baby blues. PPD often keeps a woman from doing the things she needs to do every day. When a woman's ability to function is affected, this is a sure sign that she needs to see her health care provider right away. If a woman does not get treatment for PPD, symptoms can get worse and last for as long as 1 year. While PPD is a serious condition, it can be treated with medication and counseling.<br><br>Postpartum psychosis is a very serious mental illness that can affect new mothers. This illness can happen quickly, often within the first 3 months after childbirth. Women can lose touch with reality, often having auditory hallucinations (hearing things that aren't actually happening, like a person talking) and delusions (seeing things differently from what they are). Visual hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there) are less common. Other symptoms include insomnia (not being able to sleep), feeling agitated (unsettled) and angry, and strange feelings and behaviors. Women who have postpartum psychosis need treatment right away and almost always need medication. Sometimes women are put into the hospital because they are at risk for hurting themselves or someone else.<br><br>Latest news relating to PPD:<br><br><span class="large">Wednesday November 24, 2004<br>Mum with postpartum depression cuts off babyÂ’s arms</span><br>PLANO (Texas): A woman with a history of postpartum depression told an emergency operator she had cut off the arms of her baby daughter, then waited calmly until police arrived, authorities said.<br><br>Authorities found Dena Schlosser, 35, and the fatally injured baby on Monday after the child's father called a day-care centre and asked them to check on his wife and daughter in this Dallas suburb.<br><br>Day-care workers called the police-fire emergency number after talking with Schlosser, and an operator then phoned the mother.<br><br>The operator asked Schlosser if there was an emergency, according to tapes released by police. Schlosser calmly responded: Â“Yes.Â”<br><br>Â“Exactly what happened?Â” the operator asked.<br><br>Â“I cut her arms off,Â” Schlosser replied, as the hymn He Touched Me played in the background.<br><br>Child-protection authorities said the mother had shown signs of postpartum depression in the past, but there had been no signs of violence.<br><br>Authorities said when they arrived at the family's apartment, they found the nearly 11-month-old baby in a bedroom with her arms severed. Schlosser, covered in blood, was sitting in her living room. The child died at a hospital.<br><br>It was not immediately clear what instrument was used to sever the baby's arms or why the baby's father asked the day-care centre employees to check on his family.<br><br>Schlosser lived at the apartment with other family members, including her two older daughters. The girls, ages six and nine, were at school and their father was at work when police arrived. Â– AP<br><br></div>

How can i explain to her i did not do anything with other girls? I tot of buying flowers and write her love letters hope it helps. Last time that one oso not affair, i just went pub and drink met this lady and she french kiss me that's all. But I am honest and I told my wife what happen and being honest i was awarded two slaps left and right. plus the trust is fading. Really regret telling her last time. </div></blockquote>This call"Cha Bo".... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> tell also die, no tell also die <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
