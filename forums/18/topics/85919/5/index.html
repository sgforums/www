I am fat, 172cm/90Kg, my girl is 170Cm/53Kg. My penis at most is only 5 inches long but lickily i am quite thick but i never took a measuring tape to measure the actual thickness. Many times when we are making love, she will be in pain. Really longer  wonder if shes not deep enough like what joanne said or just that I am too rough. Sometimes i feel very insecure about my length so i try to go down on my gf to make up for my SHORTcomings .<br><br>I ever saw my friends dick around 8 or 9 inches long when we were in a mass orgy and all i can said that his partner is constntly in pain but mine enjoyed the sex more  So to all brothers who feels you are in secure about youyr length, its the quality thats counts most and how you make your girl feel shes the luckiest girl in the world. Sorry for being long winded. But just making my 2 cents worth. Good day.  Anyway, Is it true for losing every 14 KG for an obese guy, your dick will increase by 1 inch. Thats what my doctor tells me and i ever tried losing weight and indeed my dick is much </div></blockquote>why guys like to measure length but not their thickness one leh? so funny. thickness harder to show off is it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>some of us are not so deep lor, so dun do 'construction piling' if not we sure cry one<br><br>8 or 9 inches? u sure? why u do orgy? so nice meh?<br><br>losing weight is good, some more if can become longer, u also will happy rite? but must lose 14 kg then got 1 inch? so difficult hor. work hard! very soon u can be leaner and longer...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
