            <div class='col-md body'>Have U ever heard of "Slow &amp; steady wins da race?" Or let me ask U dis... U wanna court her juz to have her? only for da sake of having a GF? OR U really wanna live long long wif her? U ask yrself WAT U really wan here...<br><br>If U r simply only to have her as a GF, I sure there r MANY experts in da field of courting... BUT if U DO wanna be wif her like... for life? (not possible but can try...) then I advice to take things slowly...<br><br>Furthermore its exam time... very hard for her to divert attention to U since I TINK studies r more important to her for now... yes she may enjoy singlehood. Y not respect dat? she can maintain singlehood BUT still have U as a company ONLY if U approach her as a <span style="color: blue;">FRIEND</span>.<br><br>fast R/S normally result in fast breakup &amp; U cannot grow in dis area of love... coz its TOO SHORT for U to experience any! Wat I comment here is for yr reference... In da end its YOU who decide wat U wan. No 1 else does it for U...</div>
