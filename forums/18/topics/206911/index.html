            <div class='col-md body'>i is want to have a dinner. then my mother is gone out and not cooking dinner lor. so walk around deciding what to eat at the coffeeshop, coz got a few stalls. i saw a noodle stall then stallowner is a one auntie and her chio daughter. chinese of course. i is think she is about 16 years old.<br><br>then the daughter is a wear low cut tube top and short denim shorts. Got cleavage leh. her skin is tanned and got bikini tanlines on her chest. she is look so sexy and her figure is nice and slim and i is think she is about C cup lah. Can see her toned belly and got a piercing on her belly button<br><br>She quite tall lor then her long legs are smooth and slender. Her rebonded hair is long n is highlighted blonde the color.<br><br>wah lau so chio.... i think i like her. i watched her from a distance n she turned around n i saw a tribal tattoo on her lower back. so i kept observing her n she has nice painted nails, shocking pink color with glitter, and her toenails are painted purple color. she was wearing haivanas slippers and one of her toes had a toe ring.<br><br>then later she bend down to wipe the counter top and i saw her longkang. wah lau, i almost nosebleed. then a coin drop from the counter top and she bend down to pick it up, n i saw a black g-string peeking outta her butt cleavage. i then got a slight erection.i wanted to take a pic<br>of her but my camera hp battery was flat. damn it!!<br><br>then i think i was mesmerized by her beauty, and so i went over to her stall, and then her mum went off from the stall telling her she want to go play mahjong. the stall got sell pig liver bak chor mee, laksa and cockles mee siam. she said hello, and 'what would u like to have' in chinese? she had a beautify smile, and her eyes had a hynoptic effect on me,<br><br>probably becoz she was wearing green colored contact lens.<br><br>so i said 'errrr....' pretending to have a hard time deciding what to eat,<br>while staring at her cleavage and sexy long legs. she kept smiling at me<br>in the meantime. then i was curious how come chinese stall got sell mee siam. so i asked her and she replied me<br>in her girlish voice, saying that she dunno and her mum recently had this new dish a few days ago. she sounds friendly. Then<br>i also asked her how come the mee siam is called 'cockles mee siam', that means how come the mee siam comes with cockles.<br>then the chio girl replied, saying that recently the price of 'hum' have dropped, so her mum bought a lot of see hum<br>n decided to put them in the mee siam.<br><br>so i told her i want mee siam mai hum, because i scared to eat hum coz i scared will get hepatitis B. Then i took a seat at a table next to her stall, facing the stall. then i watched her with delight preparing my mee siam. i think she is so sexy n chio and i feel like asking her for her number n i hope she will be my girlfriend, so i can eat mee siam without hum and bak chor mee everyday.<br><br>then she prepared already n brought the mee siam over and said $2.50. then i saw hum on it!! yucks, i dun like to eat hum leh. then i said how come my mee siam mai hum got hum? then she said it is like that one, and said that i said mee siam mai hiam, never say don;t want hum. then i think she misunderstood me, and hear wrongly, and heard mee siam mai hiam instead of mee siam mai hum. i told her i dun want hum leh, coz i dun like to eat hum.<br><br>so i told her i said mee siam mai hum just now, and not mee siam mai hiam. then she said no, and said she heard me clearly saying mee siam mai hiam. then she kept insisting she is right. so i then said 'its ok, i really don;t want to puruse the matter, how much is my mee siam?' then she kept asking me to explain to her why i tell her i dun want hum when i never say i dun want hum. so i apologized and she then ask me to explain why i am sorry. then i told her i want to eat and she called<br>me a 'siao lang tau'.<br><br>then i paid her n she left. i noticed her stall got a CCTV. wah lau. i think her attitude is very rude n she act like an ah lian but anyway she is such a hot babe, so maybe i wont mind. so i pushed the hum onto the table n ate my mee siam. then one beggar came n begged for money n food. so i gave him $2 and let him have my mee siam n he sat opposite me n ate greedily.<br><br>so i went to the chio boo n ordered bak chor mee this time. then i tried to flirt with her n told her she is such a filial daughter to help out her mum at the stall, n that i m awstruck by her beauty n charm n cooking skills. i asked her if she's attached n if i could have her number n go out on a date. then she blushed n smiled n said 'tao yan la... dunch tell euu lahh....' 'euu comez tuu eatz at moi stall eberydae den i conshiderr lorrxxxx....' then i wanted to give her my number but then she said no need la n then went to tend to the noodles coz it was cooked already.<br><br>hhhmmmmmm.... i think she's interested in me, hehe. i was feeling excited. i asked for her name juz now n she told me her name was Maia Hum.<br><br>then the bak chor mee arrived. then i saw a few brown pieces of things in it. i asked her what is this n she said its tur kwa... oh shit, i dun like to eat tur kwa leh. then i....<br><br>~~~~~~~~~to be continued...</div>

Then<br>i also asked her how come the mee siam is called 'cockles mee siam', that means how come the mee siam comes with cockles.<br>then the chio girl replied, saying that recently the price of 'hum' have dropped, so her mum bought a lot of see hum<br>n decided to put them in the mee siam.<br><br>so i told her i want mee siam mai hum, because i scared to eat hum coz i scared will get hepatitis B. Then i took a seat at a table next to her stall, facing the stall. then i watched her with delight preparing my mee siam. i think she is so sexy n chio and i feel like asking her for her number n i hope she will be my girlfriend, so i can eat mee siam without hum and bak chor mee everyday.<br><br><span style="color: red;">2nd time liao</span><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=forum_display&amp;forum_id=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=forum_display&amp;forum_id=18</a><br><br>then she prepared already n brought the mee siam over and said $2.50. then i saw hum on it!! yucks, i dun like to eat hum leh. then i said how come my mee siam mai hum got hum? then she said it is like that one, and said that i said mee siam mai hiam, never say don;t want hum. then i think she misunderstood me, and hear wrongly, and heard mee siam mai hiam instead of mee siam mai hum. i told her i dun want hum leh, coz i dun like to eat hum.<br><br>so i told her i said mee siam mai hum just now, and not mee siam mai hiam. then she said no, and said she heard me clearly saying mee siam mai hiam. then she kept insisting she is right. so i then said 'its ok, i really don;t want to puruse the matter, how much is my mee siam?' then she kept asking me to explain to her why i tell her i dun want hum when i never say i dun want hum. so i apologized and she then ask me to explain why i am sorry. then i told her i want to eat and she called<br>me a 'siao lang tau'.<br><br>then i paid her n she left. i noticed her stall got a CCTV. wah lau. i think her attitude is very rude n she act like an ah lian but anyway she is such a hot babe, so maybe i wont mind. so i pushed the hum onto the table n ate my mee siam. then one beggar came n begged for money n food. so i gave him $2 and let him have my mee siam n he sat opposite me n ate greedily.<br><br>so i went to the chio boo n ordered bak chor mee this time. then i tried to flirt with her n told her she is such a filial daughter to help out her mum at the stall, n that i m awstruck by her beauty n charm n cooking skills. i asked her if she's attached n if i could have her number n go out on a date. then she blushed n smiled n said 'tao yan la... dunch tell euu lahh....'
