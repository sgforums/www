My advise is READ ON. Maybe you should start reading the website of First Church of satan. It is not really the traditional church of satan. I think it talks abit about the history of the cult and how they decided to build this church and how it differs to other satanic cult... There are nothing more than a bunch of idiots with some new age thinking with a mixed of satanism + people who doesn't really believe in anything. I'm surprised how limited your knowledge has being. Try searching try reading will you. First church of satan has barely a history of a decade and bit more only. It doesn't reflect the true satanic cult in anyway. There are more than what you think of out there. There is infact a larger more systematic satanic cult around running in underground covets.

I consider them pagan, not satanic.<br><br>my research is pretty solid. just because i do not consider paganisic cults as satanic does not mean i am not aware of them or of their rituals.<br><br>however, YOUR inability to understand that just because i do not consider something satanic from my POV does not mean i am not ignorant is very typically male short sightedness. No wonder arguing with men are like arguing with retards, they are so solidly stuck within their own bubble and can't see any other POV besides their own. Seems like men are not only irrational, they're also obstinately narrow-minded.<br><br>Oh well, no wonder my opponent is disappointed. I suppose the only thing that never fails to disappoint him is ladies stripping in front of him. Someone who doesn't even know the rules of the game shouldn't be talking about playing within the rules. Afterall, how within the rules can u be, if u're stupidly blabbing about no evidence even as you yourself remain blind to whatevr your opponent is saying? Just because your own short-sightedness blinds u to evidence, don't blame your blindness on others. Also, one wonders WHAT sort of "quality evidence" you have produced at all. Evidence like Fiona Xie upskirts? Or the likes thereof?<br><br>Maybe u should just stick to your pervert posts since u seem to get off on them so much. Don't bother trying to speak sense. It's obvious your own stupidity results in you wasting your own time whenever u try to indulge in any intelligent debate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">do tell me why i should have to consider paganistic cults as satanism. I consider them pagan, not satanic.<br><br>my research is pretty solid. just because i do not consider paganisic cults as satanic does not mean i am not aware of them or of their rituals.<br><br>however, YOUR inability to understand that just because i do not consider something satanic from my POV does not mean i am not ignorant is very typically male short sightedness. No wonder arguing with men are like arguing with retards, they are so solidly stuck within their own bubble and can't see any other POV besides their own. Seems like men are not only irrational, they're also obstinately narrow-minded.<br><br>Oh well, no wonder my opponent is disappointed. I suppose the only thing that never fails to disappoint him is ladies stripping in front of him. Someone who doesn't even know the rules of the game shouldn't be talking about playing within the rules. Afterall, how within the rules can u be, if u're stupidly blabbing about no evidence even as you yourself remain blind to whatevr your opponent is saying? Just because your own short-sightedness blinds u to evidence, don't blame your blindness on others. Also, one wonders WHAT sort of "quality evidence" you have produced at all. Evidence like Fiona Xie upskirts? Or the likes thereof?<br><br>Maybe u should just stick to your pervert posts since u seem to get off on them so much. Don't bother trying to speak sense. It's obvious your own stupidity results in you wasting your own time whenever u try to indulge in any intelligent debate.</div></blockquote>Oh sooo now you are accusing me of changing the topic to pagaistic cult....!!??? Not I mean Satanic Cult that worship SATAN!!! Wake up! Wake Up none of my threads talk about Paganistic Cult my little girl please do not side track again. Please stick to the core topics. Finally As far as I remember I had very few threads that is debatable.... I'm surprised threads like Fiona Upskirt can be seen as an challage to your intelligence... I shall give to you and let you win.... Frankly my debating talents has better uses haha...</div>
