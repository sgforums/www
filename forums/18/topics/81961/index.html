            <div class='col-md body'>It is very correct to say that those businessmen that have $$$$ and influences will always above the everyone in the eye of justices and law. They have this concept of mind that they are the people who drive the economy to grow and how it grow, it is depending to them. Thus making them feel that they have the right where other people does not have that privilge rights. They also think is the country and the rest of the citizen should be their servants. These people also can buy States titles and still commit such crimes to human beings. That's why, they are the "LEGAL" version of the Underworld bosses where they protect their own crimes with their wealth.<br><br>If somebody does not eliminate such people from running the economy of Malaysia, people will keep believe corruption will exist and there is no justice and law in  the country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be so easily influenced by the media. The paper has afterall 'declared' that the businessman is charged with rape which would definitely result in interest by the public because its a scandal.<br><br>Not everything has been revealed yet and the case is in its initial stages. The maid herself may be lying to have some finacial gain. Also, the organisation is 'pro-women' which may result in them seeking ways or any opportunities to find their so-called 'justice'. However, it MAY be a case of the man raping the maid. You'll never know. What I simply advocate is not to have any quick conclusions that it is the man's fault.<br></div>
