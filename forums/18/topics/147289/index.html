            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, my name is Beng ***** and here is my storyÂ…..<br><br>Part I Â– The Meeting<br><br>Having completed my Secondary 4 with only 3 Â‘OÂ’ level passes, I could not further my studies with the result but only to wait for my National Service enlistment. Upon completion of my NS, I applied for a job in a semi-conductor factory as a production operator. After 5 years with the company, I was promoted to a section supervisor looking after 5 production lines and 25 female production operators. I was paid $1,500.00 and I could receive up to $2000.00 with the occasional extra hours I put in. My job were pretty boring, scheduling productions, maintaining machine operational conditions and I had to put up with the operators tantrums, catfights, high turnover rates, training new operators and my manager pressure for production targets.<br><br>Gross Salary	 $1,500.00<br>Employee's CPF	 $  (300.00)<br>Motor-cycle loan	 $  (200.00)<br>Petrol	 $  (150.00)<br>Food	 $  (350.00)<br>Parent allowance	 $  (300.00)<br>Cigarette (2 days 1 pkts)	 $  (150.00)<br>Monthly saving	 $     50.00<br><br>After paying all the daily expenses, I am always left with only this little money. I could therefore only pamper myself by going to the neighbourhood gym to pump-up. Because of the regular gym exercises, I had developed a well defined toned up body that left many to envy. I was also born with good looks, thick eye-brows and a pair of watery eyes that could talk. With the good looks and glib of garb, I was able to handle the operatorÂ’s tantrums, catfights and made them do my bidding. I could even get some of the prettier operators to do one-night-stands for free and without any commitments.<br><br>Peter, my colleague suggested that we go Happy Hour after work before going to his house to watch the soccer match between Manchester United &amp; Liverpool. I agreed and we to the beer garden at East Coast Park because of the cheap rates they were offering. We sat down at one of the table and ordered a jug of beer. We were engrossed talking about the forthcoming match and I did not notice the surrounding or the guests in the beer garden. Then I noticed that there was a lady sitting alone on the corner table staring at me. She wore a blue body hugging mini skirt that brings out her se*y cleavage and her big bosom. When she noticed that I was looking at her, she smiled at me. I thought that she look familiar but was unable to recall where I had met her. I turned back carrying the conversation with Peter occasionally stealing a look at the lady. She smiles at me when I looked. I noticed that she sat there watching me and turning away guys who tried to strike a conversation with her. Finally I recalled that she was actually my ex-neighbour and attended the same school as I. After the Â‘OÂ’ level results, I went into the army and she attended Hwa Chong Junior Colleague with her outstanding results. Her family always kept to themselves and I knew little about them except her name Mei Ling. Her family disappeared and shifted out without anyone noticing. That was the last I ever saw her. But this lady was much prettier although there was some resemblance. I was determined to verify but I had to send Peter away. So I lied to Peter that some family matter cropped up and I had to attend them immediately. We paid for our beer and left. When Peter left on his motorbike, I U-turned into the beer garden and approached her by asking if she was indeed Mei Ling. She told me she was and invited me to sit with her. She told me that she had recognized me because she had notice me when we were neighbours. We chatted and I and queried about her and her family disapperance.<br><br>She took the pack of cigarette from the table, lit a stick and told me her story. Her mother had previously worked in a nightclub. She was carrying her when she married her step-father. After the marriage, her mother gave up her work to become a housewife. Her stepfather was a well-to-do businessman until his business failed. He became a compulsive gambler, a wife beater and a drunkard. He had owed a lot of money to the loan sharks and forced her mother to return to the night club to repay the loans. During that year when Mei Ling was attending college, her mother was diagnosed to have liver cancer because of her drinking habit and was unable to work anymore. Mei Ling needed money for her mother medical fees, her living allowance and to repay her father loans. She stopped her studies and tried to work as a sales girl to help out. Her meagre salary was not even enough to pay for her mother medical fees and she was forced to work in a KTV by her step-father. However after a year, her mother succumbed to the illness and died. Her step-father would sometime come back home drunk and tried to force his way into her room. Fearing for her safety, she ran away from her home. After that her father sold the house and was never heard of again. She had however stayed on in the KTV as she was unable to return to her old self again.<br><br>When she finished her story, she bottoms up her glass of whisky. I felt sorry for her and comforted her. She smiled and told me that she had much forgotten the past. She then asked me where I was working and how I was doing. I replied and we talk for more than 3 hours like old pals who had lost touch of each other. She then looked into the watch and told me she had enough of drinks and would like to leave. She called the waiter over for the bill. I looked at the number of glasses on the table and began to worry as I did not have much money in my pocket. She could sense my anxiety and offered to pay for the drinks. Then she asked me how I was leaving and I told her I rode a motorbike. She asked me if I could offer her a lift home. I agreed provided she is not afraid of my riding skill. She laughed and took the helmet from me. She told me that she lived in a rented apartment in Katong with one of her jie mei. During the ride home, she hold onto me tight and her body was all hugging my back. I could feel her brea$ts pressing against my back. I could smell the fragrance of her perfume emitting from her body. It was a wonderful but short ride to her house. When we reached her home, she told me that her jie mei is not home and invited me up for a cup of tea to help me reduced the  alcohol effect. I accepted and we when up to her apartment.<br><br>To be continueÂ…..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part II Â– The House Encounter<br><br>Upon reaching her apartment, she told me to sit while she changed into something more comfortable before making tea. Her rented apartment had 2 rooms, a living room and a kitchen. From where I was seated I could look into her room because her room was not fully closed. I could see her reflection on the mirror in her bedroom.<br><br>She unzipped and undressed revealing her black lacy lingaries. She proceed to remove her stocking, rolling them down to her feet. She removed her bras revealing her big bosom and her pointed n*pples. She then took a knee length white tee-shirt and slip onto it. I did not know if she had purposely left the door ajar but quickly turn my head away when she walked out of her room.<br><br>She smiled and told me that she was going to boil some water to make tea. She took the kettle and walked toward the sink. Under the lights, I could see her body shape under her tees.<br><br>Suddenly, she let of a shriek and water was splashing all over her. The faucet broke and water was gushing out while she tried to hold the water back with her hand. I rushed over to help and tried to fix the faucet. After some struggle, we managed to fix the broken faucet but both of us were soaked. Her wet tees was hugging her body revealing her big bosom and the n*pples.<br><br>She did not notice her conditions but was apologizing for making me wet. She took my hand and dragged me into her bedroom. She took out a towel from the cupboard for me to dry up. She told me to remove my wet tee-shirt and pants so that she could dry them up. I took of my shirt revealing my toned body and took off the wet pants leaving only by boxer shorts. She then put away my wet clothing took the towel to dry my body.<br><br>Seeing her soaking wet, I took the other end of the towel and tried to dry her. She looked up and we exchange stare and she hugged me. Her wet tees and brea$ts was pressing against my body. We kissed and hugged and her wet tees soaked my body again.<br><br>My hands reached for the end of her wet tees and pulling it out revealing her 2 pink n*pples. I kissed her brea$ts, squeezing and massaging them. She was breathing heavily and retaliated by putting her hand into my boxer grabbing the harden peni$.<br><br>I sat her onto the bed and she pulled down my boxer revealing the harden peni$. She handles it between her palm and her fingers pushing it up and down. Her action got me excited and moaning. She took my peni$ and stuck it into her mouth and gave it a good licking and sucking job. This got me even more excited. I pushed her down and pulled out her black laced panty showing her bushy pu$$y.<br><br>I laid on her and guided my peni$ into her pu$$y. I did the pumping exercise, thrusting her with force. The thrusting motion got her all excited and she aided by pushing her butt in forward to complement my motion. She hold my butt to prevent my peni$ from leaving her pu$$y and giving out faster and louder moan. We did it until my cum entered her pu$$y and she gave out her final cry.<br><br>We laid on the bed resting, hugging each other and fondling her brea$t. I took out a stick of cigarette from her bedside table, lit it and pass it on to her. She took a puff and handed it back to me. I took a puff from the cigarette. It feels great smoking after sex. After the cigarette, we laid on the bed sleeping. In the middle of the night, she woke me up and we did it all over again.<br><br>The next day, when I woke up, it was nearly noon. She was no where to be seen but there was some food on the table. She left a note on the table to say that she had to go out. She had enjoyed my company and that the food was for me. After breakfast, I left the apartment.<br><br>When I reached home, I found that there was an extra $300 in my wallet. I knew it was from her and had wanted to return it to her when I will to see her again. But spent it away before I could see her again. This was the first time I was paid to have S*X.<br><br>Two weeks later, I received a call from Mei Ling and she invited me to her home again.<br><br>To be continuedÂ…Â…<br></div>
