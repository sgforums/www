            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Recently I've read abt Churches are against homosexuality. Basically my feeling towoards what the church priest who are against them, I find it very wrong and not a professional way.<br><br>Gays are humans themselves and they have the right to be in this world despite some church priest or father who are against them. What they say that Homosexuality is a sin. They said that according to the bible, it's wrong.<br><br>First of all, according to christianity, all humans are sinners! Not only gays. Just because of government has open their doors to gays and they are unhappy. We should welcome them open heartedly not by treating them with discrimination.<br><br>Religion teaches us to harmonious not with discrimination. I find it quite sad that there are some people who treat gays as "Freak".<br><br>I would like to ask that how does ppl define Christian.</div>

Whether homosexuality is a sin or not. If you don't believe that it is a sin, no matter what reason i give you will still think that its okay as long as you have the right to do it.<br><br>Unfortunately i can't tell you why is it a sin. It is just against the way nature goes. A crude eg. will be: You don't see male dogs screwing male dogs right? So are we worse than animals? Its a question to ponder upon. Let's just imagine one day the whole of Singapore become gays and lesbians, just imagine lah. What will happen?<br><br>Then we will die of AIDS and under population because the abnormal homosexual relations does not give you a child compared to a heterosexual relations. You know what i mean? This is definitely not the way God has made it to be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not believe that the bible can be taken literally, word for word. Therefore, its intepretation is up to the reader. As nobody thinks the same way, whenever anyone quotes the bible to me, I listen, but I do not comment.<br><br>I do not believe homosexuality itself is wrong. It, too is a kind of love, and caring for others.<br><br>It is hard to agree on what sin is, so I shall not comment on that. However, when I think about it carefully, I feel that it is wrong to <strong>deliberately</strong> harm yourself or others. (Note that I'm not saying everything else is right.) Now, I do not believe homosexuals are harmful, or will do anything wrong to me. They can't even have children, therefore, they will always be in the minority. Therefore, they do not bother me, and I do not bother them, or go out of my way to bother them.<br><br>Why do I defend them? Well, I'm not too sure myself. I'm straight, in case anyone's wondering. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Maybe I just feel that it's wrong to bother people who have done nothing wrong to us, except that they're different.<br><br>I have heard that homosexuals "undermine society's moral fabric". Well, I feel that there is nothing to undermine.<br><br>All immorality springs from ourselves. Nobody can make you change your mind about anything, as long as you are strong enough not to give in to peer pressure. No one can make me gay, because I prefer ladies, and no one can make me smoke or take drugs because I know that they will harm me and people around me. In fact, smokers cause more harm to people around them than gays, I don't hear anyone reacting the same way to smokers.<br><br>However, all this is my own, personal views, which I have come to, after careful thought, and thinking things out. I have no bible to quote from, but I hope I have presented my views in a logical, reasonable fashion.<br><br>I conclude by saying that homosexuals should be left alone. They do not harm the society.</div>

So is surgery. I have yet to see someone say "Surgery is unnatural, therefore, I shall die, instead of going for surgery, since I am destined to." Surgery is accepted. Therefore, I feel that "unnatural" is an invalid argument.<br><br>I do not believe that everyone around us are homosexuals, therefore, there will be no declining birth rates.<br><br>When I see something on TV that I do not like, I switch channels.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>surgery is used when it comes to life and death. i don't see why you are comparing these two issues together?</blockquote>I am comparing them together because you used the word "unnatural". Surgery saves lives, and therefore, blooms Earth's population beyond what it is "natural". I have nothing against surgery - I'm just pointing out a fact.<br><br><blockquote>what research is there that gays are researched on and proven o help the society.</blockquote>There is no such research that I know of. But I feel that homosexuals can benefit society just like you and me. I do not believe that being homosexual makes one unable OR unwilling to contribute to society.<br><br>Yes, it will cause a decline. The fact that the government needs to dictate our sexual habits must be a constant source of amusement to other countries - but I feel it is necessary. Surgery means more lives. Homosexuality means less lives. I think surgery saves more lives than what is lost by homosexuality, so it does balance out, in favor of surgery.<br><br>I'm sure we'd prefer it if everyone were heterosexual. I agree that we should accept homosexuality, but I do not see the need to encourage it, NOR do I see the need to condemn homosexuals. As mentioned somewhere above, homosexuals are just like you and me, except that they like those of their own gender.<br><br>Homosexuality IS fine, but I would not encourage it. I agree that acceptance isn't approval either. Singapore accepts smokers - but it does not approve them. And I'm sure you agree that smokers do more harm than homosexuals.<br><br>Homosexuals are discriminated. Smokers are discriminated too, in fact, publicly discriminated with signs and such. However, I do not believe homosexuals should be discriminated. They do not harm society in any major way. As for declining birth rates... I agree that they cannot contribute in that manner.<br><br>I do not believe that homosexuals should be discriminated. They should be accepted, but we should not encourage others to be homosexual.[/b]</div>
