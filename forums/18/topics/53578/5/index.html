            <div class='col-md body'>just wanna offer a few thoughts... humbly<br><br>there's this big debate whether homosexuality is in-born (no choice..born this way) or it's active acknowledgement by the person..<br><br>consider the following scenario 1<br><br>Z is a female, but when she was brought up. Perhaps the father has been a violent person, wife beater.... and hence Z is totally disgusted with males. hence find comfort in her female counterparts.. and let's say she's from a single sex school and as she grows older.. she finds tht females are more attractive in tht sense.. and just doesn't like guys.<br><br>senario 2<br><br>say this male, Y assuming he was born with more female hormones (correct me if i'm wrong? never took bio~~ ) and as he grew up, his mannerisms were more femmenine and..since young he just din like hanging around with girls... since there were so many in his family..and ya just begin to have an attraction for males.<br><br>ok.. pardon me for the 2 very stereo-typical-and-lousy scenarios.<br><br>just wanted to make a point.  person Y in tht sense can say.. "i'm born, like this... it's natural for me... why  CHANGE me? "<br><br>if change is needed for Y, wat change is tht? change tht is acceptable in societal norms? so Y's perspective of normal and societal's norm is different. is tht wrong? is tht sin?<br><br>...for Z becos of maybe her background and past hurts.. tht led her to make a choice such as this. to abhor males, to dislike males.<br>so, being caught in this, led to Z liking other females.<br>is this wrong?<br><br>may i quote.. from  the bible:<br><br>Romans 1<br>25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.<br>26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.<br><br>wat's the sin here tht's mentioned.... is it the "lust, indecent acts" in 26.   but i can argue and say "i only like him/her wat... i never do anything physical or commit any thing.. just like... wrong meh?!"<br><br>let's pause here.. and consider then. wat is sin.<br>is lying sin? yes.  is being greedy sin? yes. is worship of idols sin? yes. is murder sin? yes.<br><br>is having lust sin? yes. watching porn sin? yes. is masturbation a sin? yes.<br>so basically if u wanna put it extremely.. everything tht's not for God. it's against God.<br><br>den why is there this stigmasation tht as though there are some sins tht seems more "serious"... for e.g... u lie... "oh.. it's ok lah.... white lie... u know... ho hum.."  as compared to "eee.... u watch porn !!! u disgusting creature." or "oh my gosh... tht so and so is gay!!"<br><br>funny how it seems we can givee more empathy to say a drug addict, who's is trying hard to turn away from drugs... say a period of 6 months.. den he goes back to his heroin/pot.<br><br>and here we have a HS, who's trying to change... and pple shun him/her... eee... tht gay/lesbian.. dun wanna associate with him/her... and finally after months of trying.. gives up. goes back to his/her way of living.<br><br>for the drug addict..the normal response would be... "oh ppoor thing .. he cannot help it.."  wat about for the HS who's trying geniuely to change... have we made it harder for them? by even not being welcome indifferent to them?<br><br>friends. in the christian perspective. Sin is defintely something tht cannot be judged. nor is it because i commit less sins tht seem "graver" or quantatively i commit less sins than u.. i'm so much better than. sin is just a condition.  there's was this " oh u christians are so uppity and snobbish.." if anyone of u had certain experiences of christian bigotry.. i appeal to u and just wanna clarify tht not all christians are the same.. just as no 2 fingerprints are identical..<br><br>Matthew 7<br>4How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.<br><br>coming back to the point. wat den in homosexuality is sin.<br>i believe it's the refusal of being "normal", and what our Creator has intended for male and female. saying this, i want to apologise if i offend anyone... but my take is i don believe in the "homosexual gene" or "i'm born this way"<br><br>IMHO, there must be a point in life. where u feel tht u can choose ur sexual orientation, even though circumstances may force u to go otherwise.<br><br>then, there's this big hoo ha about wat PM Goh said.. and the multiple responses. i feel tht some of the responses .. have been misintepreted.. and not exactly worded correctly/ perceived correctly<br><br>just wanna use the analogy of smoking and drinking.. no offence to any1 k? ( i have loadsa party animal friends.. and i enjoy their company and loyal friendship Ãœ)<br>just go down the streets and ask like 10 pple..<br><br>a: "u smoke?"  b:"yup"  a: "oh ok cool =)"<br>a: "u drink?"  b: "yup"  a: "ok cool"<br><br>let's say u can give sg a hard reset and u had a choice.. would u bring in alcohol and cigarettes for tht matter? or if u just give birth to a baby. would u introduce him to drinks and cigarettes as he/she grows up. my point is... with now the acknoledgement of homosexuals, this is a first step in the change of standards.... i forsee tht perhaps in the next 5 years, MAYBE (assumptive) therw would be gay/lesbian laws.... just like the US... so perhaps 10 years  or dunno how many years down the road...<br><br>a: " u gay/lesbian" b: yea. a: "oh ok.. cool"<br><br>i feel maybe the church council has tht concern... tht the govt has taked tht very first step.. baby step...towards the US culture.<br><br>so wat then should my response be? for me. i have no problems if u are gay/lesbian wateva. just as the most cliche phrase hate the sin love the sinnner...or modifications... love the smoker, hate the smoke.....bla bla<br><br>ultimately if u have geniune concern.. love thy neighbour as yourself. never be condescending and bigot.<br><br>3The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group 4and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?" 6They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.<br>7But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her." 8Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.<br>9At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"<br>11"No one, sir," she said.<br>"Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."<br><br>thanks for hearing me =)</div>

Amen.<br>26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.<br>28Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.<br><br>i'm not taking out of context cause this whole paragraph shows us how my God sees it, remembering that He hates sin, not the sinner, and longs to set things right.<br><br>smoking is wrong, i do not know about other churches, but my pastor preaches against smoking as well, not just about this impending issue.<br><br>like i said, ignoring them, merely just accepting them isn't the complete answer. in every one of us, there is a conscience given by God, we already know what is right and wrong, but we still choose to do wrong, due to our sinful nature of course, but use that conscience to think, if your child is gay, would u feel happy about it? ignore your child? or show your child, whom you love, what is wrong? this is how God sees them. as well as us, since we are all sinners.</div></blockquote>Who is GOD?? You? Me? There is no GOD in this world, only believe...<br><br>Anyway, stop this topic... Its an endless arguement...
