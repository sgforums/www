            <div class='col-md body'>Again and again, the bible is quoted. You would make a stronger point if you would present your views in a logical manner instead, as not everyone believes in the bible. No one argues with logic.<br><br>I can respect faith, but it is difficult for those who do not share your faith to understand your viewpoint. It is like showing a book written in Chinese to an Englishman. Therefore, I shall not comment on that.<br><br><blockquote>like i said, ignoring them, merely just accepting them isn't the complete answer. in every one of us, there is a conscience given by God, we already know what is right and wrong, but we still choose to do wrong, due to our sinful nature of course, but use that conscience to think, if your child is gay, would u feel happy about it? ignore your child? or show your child, whom you love, what is wrong? this is how God sees them. as well as us, since we are all sinners.</blockquote>Not all of us see ourselves as sinners, I'm afraid. If my child is gay, I can accept and respect his views. If my child decides to be a Christian, I shall not judge and say that he or she is right or wrong. I would encourage my child to explore and actually think about himself or herself, and his or her beliefs, rather than telling him or her what to believe in. Realizing the truth by yourself is the only way you will completely believe in something - not by someone telling you.<br><br><blockquote>and in a way, i agree, acceptence is important. but it cannot be confused and lead them to believe they are alright.<br><br>what is sin? sin is simply anything that falls short from God's perfectness. from a small lie, to rape and murder, is sin. even anger, hatred and unforgiveness is murder. </blockquote>If sin is defined by God, it cannot be fully understood, or accepted by those who do not believe in God. Therefore, it is hard me to accept the argument that homosexuality is wrong, because it is a sin.<br><br>I'm glad you feel that acceptance is important. I'm not saying homosexuality is right, and the only way to go. However, I'm not saying that homosexuality is wrong either. It is merely a different point of view, just like Christianity is.</div>

But do this with gentleness and respect, --- i would say i tried to be respectful as much as possible while being firm. no vulgarities, no insults *though i have taken alot* -- though this verse refers to sharing of christ, i feel its applicable as well cause i have to give them an answer to why we feel this way, when i said we, you want me to include you? or just christians, then share with them a possible solution, without "trampling on their rights" and so far, tell me, have i trampled on their rights?<br><br>as for you thinking i am forcing anyone, have i? i've spoken on why christianty sees this issue this way, not forced anyone to do anything, like i said, people cannot choose properly without seeing clearly the choices. me as an example of my past<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">back to the gay people... they know the consequences and are willing to accept them... you want to "deprive them" of their choice and consequences?  </div></blockquote>are you sure they are willing to accept the consequences? are you positively sure, cause the way i see things are going, they are fighting to make their own consequences, namely acceptance. which doesn't look like a consequence to me. this sounds harsh, yet like i said, adam and eve were punished serverely, and i believe God has His way of dealing with this issue, i rather concentrate in speaking out in defence to the gospel. rather than kick another believer's arse for speaking out what that is truth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
