If they dont wanna hear it, we can try, but there's not much we can do but pray for them.<br><br>And I know gay people too.. one of my really gd friends is gay. Yeah, they wanna be left alone, but i cant help feeling sorry for them.<br><br>Because sin is gonna lead to destruction. Whether when they're alive or whether when they're dead.
