Who are you to judge what is wrong or right for him?<br>Going to a certain good school may be what you perceive to be the right thing to do? But putting him in a not so competitive environment would be better for him.<br><br>You can't be there in every decision they make. You have to allow them to make mistakes, learn from them and move on. Over protective isn't a good thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have alot of bi sexual fren, some of them had gay sex since 14 and etc. its shocking, but its not a minority.<br><br>all i can say is that, he is what he is, he sexual preferrance is in his genes. he can change, but whether he will get happiness is another thing. as a sister, u should support him no matter how wrong he is, and not "report" him to your parents and worsen your relationship. Furthermore, there is nothing your parents can do, unless they think sending him for counselling or beating him straight will work. life is like that, its not always straight  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>just forget about the whole incident and do not avoid your brother or whatever just because of it. he is your brother after all.<br><br>good luck on improving your relation with your brother. who knows, maybe he wants to be in good terms with you too, just that he never had the courage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
