              <p>Hi Mardiana, what your bf means is no sex no relationship? Can
              you tell by the looks whether a man is a virgin or not? Answer is
              NO. If your bf is a virgin, how come he initiate for sex? Something
              funny right? Dont fall into the trap of having sex to satisfy yuor
              bf.</p>
              <p>To tell you the truth, guys lost nothing after sex. Guys can
              have many sex partners, ladies? If you are a virgin, you are done!
              Gone! Dirty.</p>
              <p>So, why not tell your bf if your bf sincerely love and likes
              you, cant he dont talk about sex? Can the sex will delay till
              marriage?</p>
              <p>Be extremely careful Mardiiana about this move. I just dont wish
              to hear you after some time posting here to say I get cheated.</p>

              <p>no no im not...well he is not trying to equate r/s to sex. we just think that having sex in a r/s is fine as long it strenghtens the r/s. i will have sex with the guy whom im love. yeaa thats the part i dont get it. to think of it, he was the one who started all this up. my parents went overseas a month ago and since my eld sis is schooling, he will come over in the afternoons. first few times we were just casual, eating and watching tv and those stuffs. i took it to bedroom (not with the intend of getting laid) but when a place so cosy anything can happen. we make out and bit of petting but nothing further than that happened.</p>
              <p>im not too concerned abt the long term issue like 'oh i was screwed and he left me' and im not that type. shit happens and it takes 2 hands to clap so i have to suck it up and move on. im worried abt pregnancy and STDs. my eld sis told me to bring him to do a blood test to see if he has STD or something. if he doesnt then should be 50% fine. the other half would be pregnancy and i heard theres female 'condom-like' latex for sale but is there any here in sg? plus taking contra pills 12 hrs before intimacy and having it during periods (gross) helps?</p>

              <p>hmm yea but its obvious on what his reply is if i ask him to take the blood test just for one night pleasure u see. its not easy but i will find a way to bring him to get his blood tested if we wanted to get together badly.</p>
              <p>i already thought twice. but i DO want to take my own precautionary measures. wow ur friend is such an ass for doing that. karma will get on him eventually.</p>
              <p>i never thought of that! u mean asking him abt the worst scenario right? but then im not gd at interrogating bcos i trust him alot. thats why i love him. what else can i ask? questions that will not make him to give the same answers..</p>
