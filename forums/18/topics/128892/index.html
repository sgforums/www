            <div class='col-md body'>I have viewed the ghastly pictures posted by fishieee.(This is how man become a woman under the knife).<br>Its so barbaric.<br><br>This need not happen if society everywhere can accept people as they are.<br><br>The ah qua usual explanation of a girl trapped in a manÂ’s body is only justification to conform to societiesÂ’ expectation. Conversely, ditto for the butch.<br>The sexual orientation theory of the gays is bunk.<br>All want acceptance.<br><br>The men may be effeminate. But they are still male.<br>And women with masculine tendencies, they are still female.<br>Gays just want to have their kicks, their way, they canÂ’t, they just canÂ’t, otherwise.<br><br>The problem with all of the above is conformity.<br>People the world over are required to conform to societal norms.<br>This occurs in every single society in the world.<br>Like men are expected to be macho, brave, strong and aggressive, and have a beard.<br>Women are expected to be beautiful, loving, dainty and submissive, and must cover their heads. Etc., etc., etc.<br><br>Those who do not follow?<br>They are considered queer.<br>Rebels, misfits, rude, dissenter, eccentric, heretic, odd person, freak, crank, crackpot, nut, weird, weirdo, maverick, traitor, pariah, and what have you.<br>Queer incidentally used to mean homosexual before the word gay replaced it.<br>Before I digress further, I will go back to conformity and societyÂ’s acceptance of people as they are.<br><br>My point is, there would be no need to resort to barbaric surgery if only society accept people as they are. And not ostracise them, when they are different.<br><br>The ah qua that went through the gender alignment procedure was desperately trying to fit into societyÂ’s mold of what people should be.<br>They are effeminate male. They convince themselves that they are girls trapped in a manÂ’s body, and science catered to the need. The results do not match their hope.<br>If society, all society, accepts that people are what they are, effeminate male could be just that. We would see Boy George everywhere. They could pair up with a female, have children and form a family unit. The butch could do the same. Be macho, and marry a male. If a male ah qua pair up with a female butch, now wouldnÂ’t that be lovely. No need for gender realignment surgery.<br>Gays can do their stuff with a willing partner. The law let up on them because what they do in the privacy of their rooms is their business, and not for the law to regulate. If this state of affairs existed long ago, there would be no need for the current same sex marriages occurring now. These same sex marriages is another example of homosexuals trying to meet societyÂ’s requirements. Where we have two women in bridal gown going down the aisle, or two men in tuxedo exchanging wows, before a minister in a manner exactly like a hetero wedding. Odd!  They should get the government to legislate a separate Act for same sex pairings. It should have all the rights, privileges, obligations, and recognition as spelt out in the hetero Marriage Act. Instead they resort to hijacking what is the norm. They too are victim of themselves.<br><br>When will society discard all its rigid stereotypes?<br>In the year 2525<br>If man is still alive<br>If woman can survive<br>They will find Â…Â…<br><br>But really it will all start with acceptance of self.<br>And courage.<br></div>
