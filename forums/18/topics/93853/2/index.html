            <div class='col-md body'>During the next six months, through the help of a friend, I began working for a boutique in Raffles City. It was the first time I ever started working for my own pocket money, and I was so excited.<br><br>The first day I started work there, I got to know a fellow colleague, Lawrence. At first I felt really awkward because I couldn't seem to communicate with guys. I didn't speak to him for the first few weeks and he didn't seem to be too keen on speaking to me as well.<br><br>This situation changed one day while I was having lunch in the store room. Lawrence came in to take some stock and he spoke to me for the very first time. From then on, we talk to each other as if we were old friends.<br><br>Lawrence wasnt particularly good looking, but he was a person whom you can tok to easily. We became very good friends and the other colleagues in the boutique were quite shocked to see us laughing and joking with each other.<br><br>Soon after, colleagues started to gossip about the two of us. I didn''t realised it until one day when one of my colleague ask me if I liked Lawrence. I didn't know what to say. But the colleague told me that Lawrence like me, I didn't believe it because we were like buddies and I wish for it to remain so.<br><br>Early one morning while i was still in bed, I recieved a message from Lawrence. He actually asked me to become his stead. At that time I thought it was a joke question - I had never had experienced with guys - so I told him not to joke with such things lah....<br><br>His reaction to my answer shocked me because he actually said he was serious and that he meant what he said. At that time I didn't know what to do, I wanted to tell him that I shall think about it before I give him an answer.

But i only managed to pressed the word 'OK' and I pressed the SEND button... Isn't it funny, this was how I started my very first relationship with a guy.<br><br>We were together for two months, but then the going wasn't smooth. He was more interested in his studies than me.
