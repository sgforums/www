              <p>1. Learning that there is homosexuality in the world does not make you a homosexual.</p>
              <p>2. You are not against gay or lesbians, you are against their lifestyles? What the heck does that even mean? You are equating a gay lifestyle with promiscuity? I see, yes, because heterosexual individuals all lead monogamous, sexually moral lifestyles and have only one sexual partner.</p>
              <p>3. Being gay is not an illness. You may be born with it, or it can be a lifestyle conscious choice. Whatever it is, it has nothing to do with you. they don't have a problem with you being heterosexual, why do you have a problem with them being gay. If you are not gay, then you live your own heterosexual life. Do other people having a gay lifestyle affect you? Are you going to argue that it affects your sense of a decent morality? Why should other people buy into your prescribed standards of morality? What is a mainstream value anyway - how does it come about? Do many people believing in the same thing necessarily makes it true? the majority is the best repartee, but it doesn't mean your argument counts. </p>
              <p>4. Stupid teachers allowing such garbage to be taught. Discussing homosexuality in class does not mean promoting it. I discussed plenty of things in GP class back in JC and I would be severely crossed if my education was compromised just because a bunch of people didn't want their children exposed to the wrong values. Oh my god, how can we have an education that reflects different perspectives? Sheesh.</p>
              <p>5. You probably think I am gay. I assure you, I am speaking all this from a heterosexual's point of view. I just want to let you guys know that you can be heterosexual and pro-gay rights too. Don't just agree with mainstream values. Really sit down and think for yourself, what is it about homosexuality that makes it so bad. Just really think about why you want to deny something so precious - love- to other people. Just think about it, that's all I'm asking.</p>

              <p>yes good points. what century are we in now? lol. Thio Su Mein is 70 years old for god's sake. When internet first became popular, she's in her 50s. It's understandable that folks brought up in the olden days will think this way but they must also move with the times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Internet is everything and everywhere now. No use suppressing information. Kids these days have a right to know about homosexuality and the public bias of associating them with promiscuity. Even heterosexuals are promiscuous for god's sake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise wana be like brokeback? Jake Gyllenhal got married with kids but in his entire life, only loved Heath Ledger. That's pretty sad, living your life so u can fulfill societal expectations.</p>

Why are we created with a penis or a vagina? It is for procreation and pleasure. A man is made for a woman period. Sex is a shared joy whoese ultimate aim is to have kids. But to do anal? Or to use a dildo for pleasure? The fundamental idea is totally wrong. Why in gay and lesbo relationship there is always a male version and female version?

              <p>The points you've brought up originates from religious teachings. Don't bring religious teachings and beliefs to a secular educational system. They are not equal to social moral values and norms.</p>
              <p>I think there's nothing wrong with homosexuality. The concept of being 'natural' or being 'unnatural' is just a invention of our minds. If I'm born in a village of homosexuals I'll be seen as being unnatural for liking women instead of men.</p>
              <p>You may not agree with me (obviously) that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. But at the very least, please allow our children to think for themselves, and not force-feed them your so-called 'moral values'. It's not like they're hurting other people so there isn't a need to teach our childrens to condemn such lifestyles.</p>

                  is totally wrong. Think about it. Why are we created with a penis

                  a woman period. Sex is a shared joy whoese ultimate aim is to have
                  kids. But to do anal? Or to use a dildo for pleasure? The

                  Because deep down in their hearts they know they are disobeying the

                  face up to the truth and seek treatment honestly.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong about learning about the existance of
                  homo. What is wrong is to teach that these values are right. If
                  this carries on, the human race will all become homo and extinct in
                  a matter of hundred years.</p>
              <p>Screw MOE and all teachers who teach garbage and screw old AWARE

              <p>No one is saying that heterosexual unions are wrong.  The human race isn't going to die out because homosexuals are a minority and they are not forcing people to convert to their orientation. The AWARE sex-ed programme did not promote GLBT rights in the way that it is made out to be. By extension of your beliefs, consensual anal and oral sex between heterosexual couples is also wrong, and anyone who doesn't get procreate is sick. Your understanding of roles in homosexual activity is totally wrong because they do not work in the same way as male and female roles. Homosexuality can't even be defined as a disease because it does not deteriorate one's quality of life through physiological symptoms.</p>
              <p>You don't know what you're talking about, and ignorance such as yours only serves to fuel fear.</p>

              <p>Just because you are an idiot doesn't make all humans idiots. Just because I agree with another person on a topic doesn't make me spineless and unopinionated.Just because I am sane, doesn't mean I have to witness your insane plattering.</p>
              <p>Just because homosexuals have a different sexual orientation and way of living doesn't mean they are wrong. By your indifferent statement, you claim respect for the people who are homosexuals but yet you stand against their life values. Love is a human feeling and thus by this love, homosexuals are normal humans and have a need for a life partner. Homosexuality can be proven to be normal in nature as there are primates and apes which practice bisexualism.</p>
              <p>By calling homosexuality a disease, JusticeLegal shows its ignorance of human sexuality and the study of illnesses. Some philosophers view homosexuality as a social ill and there had and will be very intense debates on this topic. The present view is that homosexuality is not a social ill but a unwanted social trend. However to remove homosexual's need to love his or her partner is the lowest of the low social acts, akin to Hitler's Holocaust of the Jews.</p>
              <p>Homosexuality is not a disease and hence it cannot be transmitted, thus there is no danger of humanity being wiped off this world.</p>
              <p>Screw JustticeLegal for being a fearmonger and creating a social hatred for homosexuals.</p>
