            <div class='col-md body'>This happened some time back during my BMT at Pulau Tekong.<br><br>This coincidently (or not?) happened during the period of Ching Ming (a lot of incence was burned on the island during this period). My bunk was directly opposite the back of the canteen. There was a big Chinese altar there, presumably used by the canteen vendors on the island.<br><br>It was one of those weary nights after our training. We were all lying in our bed as it was already time for ights off. As i was trying to fall asleep, I noticed a dark shadow by the window of my bunk. All the lights have already been switched off, so I could not really see whether it was actually just one of my instructors checking on us. However, I found it strange that the shadow was there for quite some time before it just disappeared. I also did not hear any of my instructors' usual footsteps. I did not want to think too much, so I just ignored it and soon feel asleep.<br><br>......to be continued<br><br></div>
