All that is needed is a woman's accuse to put u behind jail for 24-48 hours. (24 MINIMUM!)

In the MRT i always put out my hands to where everybody can see them, and make sure no girl is directly in front of me also (to prevent them accusing me of poking their backside).<br><br>I have a friend who went through all this hell during his NS days. He was an optimistic guy before all this sh1t and end up being a very broken man. It all happened during one of those holiday periods and as usual there was a big crowd. A girl suddenly turned around, grabbed my friend's hands and shouted "molest". He was taken to the police station where he was - somewhat "tortured" i would say - for more than 24 hours. I was supposed to be meeting him that fateful nite and me and my friends were cursing and swearing why he's late for so long and still dont answer his HP. Little did we know the sh1t that happened to him.<br><br>He called me the next day, asked me to help bail him out. yes... the NEXT DAY. He was thrown into a prison and was being treated like a prisoner. Dont believe in the "you get one phone call" sh1t they always say on TV. It dont work that way in real life.

They tried to threaten my friend, threaten to tell his family, etc. All those officers there mis-treated him, didnt even give him ONE SIP to drink. He asked for water and they look at him and walked away. Many times they would hurl insults at him, swearing at him, labelling him as a "molester".<br><br>After his bail, he was <strong>repeatedly</strong> asked to go to the police station for who-knows-what.

It's supposed to help him since if he were meeting us, he has a reason to be there.

I started to get abit frus, also triggered by what i see around me- how they mis-treat the other suspects in that room. So I start abit "guai lan" with him, only then he go mild abit. This goes to show what type of people we have there. Very bad impression.<br><br>For MONTHS, they keep asking my friend to go back to the station. Sometimes, when he reach there, they say "oh nothing, u can go back".

The test is taken by officers - meaning sergeants and below - and since a lie detection test is never proven as a 100% accurate, they can always use it to your disadvantage.  Of course during the test u dont know what questions they will ask, and what will happen to you (or what is being done to you) so u can imagine what the test "results" can be.

Violence is not an answer neither is running away from the problem an answer. Always remember that The light of truth will always prevail under the cover of darkness. Anyway I dun think Guys are horny. Have you seen the behaviour of some teenage gals nowadays? they are so voluptuous in nature that one could be forgiven for thinking that they are asking to be raped. Most of the gals nowadays are so daring.</div>
