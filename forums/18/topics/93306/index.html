            <div class='col-md body'>Just to comment, the law is so protective of women that sometimes the system gets abused by ladies. I actually know of two friends who got sued before for molest charges just because of some accidental contact which the guy is totally unaware of. But in both cases the girl (a stranger) happily screams "Molest! Molest!".<br><br>In one case, my friend was almost beaten up by the girl's guy friends. Now, once the police is called in, and the case is made, the guy must stay 24 hours in police custody unless they can be granted bail. During which the guy will be questioned, and warned about the possible punishments he will face.<br><br>Of course in both cases my friends both pleaded not guilty. Then, they must wait for I think a number of months while the authorities investigate the case and deem whether a court hearing is needed. If there is enough evidence to say that the 'contact' could have been intentional, then my friend would get charged in court.<br><br>Thankfully neither of my friends needed to go to court. But I can tell you, the experience was most unpleasant. Being arrested and kept in the police station like a common criminal.<br><br>It didn't stop there either, they also had to endure funny stares from people who knew they had been arrested. Friends, relatives and even family alike. And imagine having to ask leave from work to go to the police station. They felt so misreable that they felt like the whole world was watching them.<br><br>One friend was still schooling so the school &amp; principal was alerted. Teacher was asked for a testimonial about the student's character. Then my friend had to explain to the teacher all over again.<br><br>So ladies, please be very sure before you accuse someone of molesting you. Although both of my friends managed to maintain their innocence, the emotional damage done is something else altogther. All thanks to two extremely paranoid females.<br><br>If you ask me, I think the law needs re-writing.</div>

Just that there's a handful of us here who feel very strongly about how some girls have exploited the laws that were meant to protect them. From my point of view, they're not the only evil people around, just that they're a particular group of evil people that we're talking about now.<br><br>And it's very sad to hear of innocent guys being wrongly accused.
