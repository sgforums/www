Just cos we look different and are different culturally. What we ought to do is associate/go-out with our own kind.... that is what I have been brought to believe now... it is very sad sometimes to be what I am... especially over here. You get stares if u hang out with the local girls... the girls will know these stares and will ignore u cos she does not want to be an SPG... it is a vicious cycle.<br><br>U cant blame the people here though, this is just the way things are, it is the way God intended when he created blue eyes and different colour hair and different sizes of genitals. So it is normal, be with your own kind to be accepted mates.<br><br>In answer to your Question.... the guy who posted before me... if u went around beverly hills with a white girl and u are Chinese... you wil also get stares. It is exactly the way you people stare at us with your girls/women.<br><br>*sob</div></blockquote>You may feel free to reply in my thread and then we shall have some constructive debate.</div>
