            <div class='col-md body'>So I get to know this gal from a one night stand. After a while, we become friend. We made it very clear to each other there is nothing special going on. Since then I have left for study for 2 years, but I still keep in touch with her. At that time, she had been into 2 failed relationships. Well now she's single and free. So I'm coming back soon. She's eager to see me again (as friend as she made it clearly). There is some talk about doing it again with her, yes I like it, but there is part of me feelin guilty about it because I'm not even sure if she can do it without getting expecting something (like relationship). I told her about it, that I don't want to get into relationship with her (because I don't love her), but she says its fine, and we can still do it together for the sake of 'experience'.<br><br>Is it possible that a gal friend can have sex with a guy friend, without getting emotional about it (ie the girl expecting something from the guy she is doing it)?<br><br>Her offer is tempting, sure I like the idea of doing it with her for the sake of fun, but if she's trying to expect more from me, I'm not going to do it. And yes, I have made it clear to her that about that and she assures me that it won't happen. Can I really believe what she is saying?</div>

Not asking you to fark first, worry later. Since you two have already made things clear and agreed on matters, you're not in any wrong.<br><br>But, then if she starts dropping hints or something, then you should maybe check your relationship with her again. Afterall, who's to say that you wouldn't develop feelings for her in the future?<br><br>Still, I guess it's just another case of platonic sex. I would presume the two of you are old enough to know what you two are doing. Well, just don't do anything you two might regret. Also, don't end up regretting not doing something you didn't do.<br><br>Think right now, a lot of the other guys here are wishing that they had such a friend too. Even if they do say the girl is cheap, deep down they want it too.<br><br>Just to reaffirm, it is totally possible that a girl will not get emotional about it.

So definitely this person would be closer to you than most other people would be. So it's more likely that the two of you would know things about each other that others won't. I also have female friends who tell me everything, things they won't tell the family, things about their ex, but i don't sleep with them.<br><br>She would definitely be expecting a higher level of intimacy out of you, maybe not as a special someone but let's put it this way, the two of you have a beyond 'normal' friendship.<br><br>Lighten up and just see how the next session goes. Maybe just monitor her behaviour and be a little more sensitive to what she might be thinking. Just no point being too uptight about it.<br><br>Good that you're careful though, at least you're being mindful about hurting her feelings.</div>
