Around 15 years ago, when I was still in secondary school, used to go to Bukit Merah Library...the library is in very bad shape then and books are stored in rusty shelves. No computer, video or whatever multimedia to play with during the era. It was there where I always noticed old men in their forties reading at books not "matching" to their appearance. e.g reading about human philosophy and psychology when they obviously look like they do not understand basic English (personal deduction only) Anyway, they like to remove books in the bottom row to create a big "lobang" among the books. I saw one of them doing it once and when he noted I looked at him, he moved away quickly. Out of curiosity, I take a look at the books and the lobang he created and guess what I saw...<br>Opposite the lobang is an office lady squatting down unknowingly, exposing a full view of her transparent panties. You can see every strand of hair down there in great view as she open wide, thinking that she is exposed to nobody as she is facing a shelf. It is too tempting for a teenager like me. However, as a timid and no-gut teenager, I had to disappear fast before I got discovered....<br>Occasionally after the incidents, I still saw people doing that but I dared not try again for fear of being caught .....
