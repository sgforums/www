I'm glad that you actually bring up this topic coz i've encountered such a thing..but it's not me lor...it's my fren kenna....also the same case as you..but abit diff. coz she pregnent and also wanna commit suicide...she knoe my fren kinda likes her and soft-hearted..so she approached him for $$$ saying tat she dun wan the baby..i was still with my fren that time when she sms him...Right in my mind...i was thinking...hey manz..i do not believe in this kinda shit..but my fren,..an idiot though seek my advices and opinions..still went to lend her the $$$...not knowing whether if she really is pregnent or not coz she told him she's two months pregnent...so the stomach will not show any diff..so that idiot fren of mine lend her $500 bucks to do the operation(So called Operation..din even know if it's true she realli go for it) So...after the "Operation" period is over..my fren tried to contact her n c how well she's doing(not wanting back the $$$$)..but cant get thru for almost a week or so...c wat i mean? The 2nd part came...she called my fren n guess this time wat's the reason? She din not have $$$ to pay for her hp bill n so her line was cut n now she's asking for $$$ to pay her bills...wat a real damn shit...(Wondering how come she can use her hp to call my fren since her line is being cut)..well..money-lending...and then this idiot kenna again...lent her $300..hey..though it's not a big $$$..but this can't go on 4eva..<br>Too much stories in between to tell here...but anyway..the ending is that my fren(that idiot) was betrayed by his fren n that girl and this was known to that guy n gal...and since then..she never called him up again..though i feel sad for my fren...but that's a lesson learnt for him...hope this will help you to tink whether you shld lend or not?<br>Be wise...this's not your 1st time lending her $$$$ even though she's your Ex...she looked for you is maybe becoz you're her EX and she knows you well or maybe she knows that you'll give her wat she wan...<br>See how she react when you tell her that you dun have $$$...maybe till then you'll see answer? maybe... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From all your posting on your ex, I think u should not "give" her the $$. Have had a previous experience once, similar to yours. Ended up got borrow no return.<br><br>Next, even IF you still likes her, your should not lend her the $$ oso. Although you did not mentioned anything about who initiated the broke up (when she was with you). Her latest ex may have broke up with her due to the $$ issue, which you said that you have lend here a few $K already.<br><br>Bro, think again...<br><br>As what firelce mentioned, if you really wanna help, get her to some family ctr or help group. By lending her $$ is not helping her.</div>

I'm glad that you actually bring up this topic coz i've encountered such a thing..but it's not me lor...it's my fren kenna....also the same case as you..but abit diff. coz she pregnent and also wanna commit suicide...she knoe my fren kinda likes her and soft-hearted..so she approached him for $$$ saying tat she dun wan the baby..i was still with my fren that time when she sms him...Right in my mind...i was thinking...hey manz..i do not believe in this kinda shit..but my fren,..an idiot though seek my advices and opinions..still went to lend her the $$$...not knowing whether if she really is pregnent or not coz she told him she's two months pregnent...so the stomach will not show any diff..so that idiot fren of mine lend her $500 bucks to do the operation(So called Operation..din even know if it's true she realli go for it) So...after the "Operation" period is over..my fren tried to contact her n c how well she's doing(not wanting back the $$$$)..but cant get thru for almost a week or so...c wat i mean? The 2nd part came...she called my fren n guess this time wat's the reason? She din not have $$$ to pay for her hp bill n so her line was cut n now she's asking for $$$ to pay her bills...wat a real damn shit...(Wondering how come she can use her hp to call my fren since her line is being cut)..well..money-lending...and then this idiot kenna again...lent her $300..hey..though it's not a big $$$..but this can't go on 4eva..<br>Too much stories in between to tell here...but anyway..the ending is that my fren(that idiot) was betrayed by his fren n that girl and this was known to that guy n gal...and since then..she never called him up again..though i feel sad for my fren...but that's a lesson learnt for him...hope this will help you to tink whether you shld lend or not?<br>Be wise...this's not your 1st time lending her $$$$ even though she's your Ex...she looked for you is maybe becoz you're her EX and she knows you well or maybe she knows that you'll give her wat she wan...<br>See how she react when you tell her that you dun have $$$...maybe till then you'll see answer? maybe... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>aiyo...how come your fren's situation so similar to mine one....sad ah...u treat pple good, pple take u for granted...then when u don bother abt them, they'll say all the good guy die liao.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
