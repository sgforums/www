If she can cheat on her man with me, I don't think I'd like to start a deep relationship with a cheater.  And she's got to know that if she wants to have something with me whilst being with her man.  But who knows, right?<br><br>Besides, there're heaps of single women (and men for the women) out there.  They're the ones that you should start afresh with.  You only want to play on someone else's turf because it's human nature to want what you can't have.  Isn't it true that women are more attracted to married or attached men and vice versa?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

A player who knows the rules will know when a woman says no, he backs off.  But a player always tries.

It is his decision to get with the other girl or the her decision to get with another guy.  The player is simply looking out for himself, nothing more.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Chivalry and gentlemanly ways are tools of any single guy.  t's just how well he uses it.  And he has a sense of honour as well.  He will honour his word when he backs away from the lady.<br><br>However, it won't be an honourable act if he's attached or was married and decides to play for he dishonours the trust that his woman has given him.<br><br>But what about a woman who tries to lure an attched guy with her charms and sensuality?  How many women even know the extent of the word 'honour'?  To most women, their honour is just about them., and them only.  Do they even think about honour when they try to get their best friend's boyfriend?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
