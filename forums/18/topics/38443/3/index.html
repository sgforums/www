But, just to make things clear, if you'd read my earlier posting, you'd realise the title could be twisted around.

I will never be able to stop anyone from hitting on my woman.  Never.  Hell, of course I wouldn't want anyone to touch my woman.  But I can't stop them, can I?  So it's up to my woman to tell the other dude to bugger off.  It's not up to me... unless she needs help.  This applies for women too.  You'd want your man to tell the other women to bugger off.  If you have to step in, it's not good.<br><br>Let's be honest here.  I don't know your experiences, but my thoughts are definitely based on mine.  What if the woman allows you to hit on her despite you knowing she's attached?  I know of women who do that, and I'm sure you do too.
