I duno..depends on individuals..but you can keep in contact with her, as a good fren, share her troubles, etc...(Provided that she find you)...this's not "Waiting for her"...you shld, in fact, try to know more girls n who knows, she's juz out there...you never know..<br><br>So..what i would suggest to you is that you shld start to move a step forward...do not stay still in your current position...you need to move a step ahead to know what's the answer lies ahead of you...step by step....i know you've the patience...<br><br>Good luck n all the best...</div>
