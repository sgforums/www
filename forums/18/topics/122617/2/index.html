But I have my fair share of single women both attached and those who just must have a married man. I had an ex-colleague, who would only sleeps with married man as she claims that they can treat her better and also "screw" her better.<br><br>I had also on a few occassion strayed with an office girl, and she had to beg me to f*ck her as I was hesitant to go all the way, and was contended with heavy petting, kissing and touching her, but she just could not stand after our third outing, with all the teasing, that she would have rape me that night if I didn't do it. She cried, and we had to go look for "MaMa" shop to buy condoms. That night, she first blow me off, claiming that it would make it harder for me to come, so she can ready enjoy. We f*cked 3 times and needless to say we both did not go home, and she took MC while I applied for urgent leave the next day. The next morning, as we had ran out of condoms, we when ahead and screwed our hearts out, but I withdraw before cumming. We had a dozen more session and cool off after that, we are still colleagues in different department today.<br><br>So I think you are NORMAL. Live &amp; let Live.
