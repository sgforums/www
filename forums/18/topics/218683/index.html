            <div class='col-md body'>Sitting on the soft bed, hand on her forehead holding the towel in place, I had a full view of her athletic figure as she lay immobile. The unbuttoned polo T revealed one of a small glimpse into the beginning of her cleavage. I had not noticed this before, but it looked like there was a hint of a sexy mole that lay semi hidden by the fabric, right where the bottom of the valleys met.<br><br>It felt like I was sitting there for an eternity, reveling in the view I had of this colleague of mine whom I thought so badly of just a couple of hours ago. Underneath that workaholic exterior was still a woman who needed tender loving care and concern.<br><br>Feeling a bit of grogginess myself from the liquor intake, I did not intend to stay very long with Yumi. Â“If only events would have turned out like what the waiter had imagined.Â” I thought wistfully.<br><br>Â“Never shit where you eat.Â”<br><br>This long forgotten tip from an ex-colleague of mine came to me as sudden as an oncoming train. I wonder how much of it is put into practice these days as affairs and one night stands are more apparent amongst Singaporeans lately.<br><br>Shaking that thought away and really yearning for my own bed in my room, I shook Yumi slightly and was rewarded with her tired eyes opening and looking up directly at me.<br><br>Â“Yumi, I need to go and rest. Drink the tea when you can ok?Â” She nodded her acknowledgement as I stood up and proceeded to leave her room.<br><br>Back where I belonged, I felt too heady and tired to take a shower. The warm bed was too inviting as I crept in, turned off the lights and tried to fall asleep. Whenever I drank too much, it always felt as if I could hear my own heartbeat and feel my blood rushing to my head with every pump. It was hard to sleep, always.<br><br>I replayed my dinner date over and over again. The waiter. The words he said. Yumi laughing. Frankly, if it all ended up in a sexual encounter, even though nothingÂ’s going to come out of it, I am fine with it. I have gone beyond desperate, just short of paying for sexual services.<br><br>The ringing of the phone broke the silence. What was it this time? Did I forget something at the restaurant? It wouldnÂ’t have been anyone from the office as they would have called my mobile directly.<br><br>I leaned over and picked it up, expecting it to be a call from the hotel staff, thinking of a few snide comments if it was something minor for them to interrupt me trying to get to my dreamland.<br><br>Â“Grimnar-san, hello.Â” A very sensual female voice came over the other side. It was Yumi. Interesting. Now maybe the night wasnÂ’t going to end after all.<br><br>I smiled into the phone and replied, Â“Yes Yumi? Do you need any help?Â”<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s ok. I just want to say thank you. You are very sweet.Â” It felt like we were secondary school kids in courtship being so courteous to one another.<br><br>Well it was only a simple call to say thanks, what was I expecting. Â“You are welcome. Now go and have a rest ok? If you need anything just call me.Â” I was feeling half grumpy from being disturbed and half disappointed from thinking that this is all that is going to happen.<br><br>Â“Grimnar-san?Â”<br><br>Â“Yes?Â”<br><br>Â“Tomorrow we try again? I want you to get lucky like the waiter said. Good night.Â” As soon as she said this, the line went dead and I was left holding on to the handset, taking in the words that she has just said.<br><br>Was that spoken in her drunken stupor? Or was it a sign from the gods, yet again?<br><br>Laying back down, I could feel my heart working even harder as I tried to absorb this change of events. I was trying to be my analytical self once again. But as usual, whenever it came to affairs of the crotch, analyzing be damned!<br><br>I didnÂ’t know when I fell asleep but when I opened my eyes, it was sunny Friday. It was tonight she was referring to. And would the curse upon me which made Sex reject me like a handsome gay saying no to a hot woman be lifted? I had less than 24 hours to tell.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Just added a short update to the story and want you guys to know I am still updating the blog.<br><br>Feel free to drop by at http://storytellingtime.blogspot.com<br><br>Working on finishing this and then moving on to more tales for your reading pleasure.<br><br>Grimnar</div>

Hope you people can support.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br>The soft and sweet voice of Yumi came on, Â“Mushi-mush, Grimnar-san. Are you sleeping?Â”<br><br>Â“Not anymore.Â” I grumbled, slightly irritated from being woken up and yet inquisitive at what Yumi wanted at this hour. Â“How was the drinking?Â”<br><br>Â“IÂ’m outside your door now.Â” She skipped my question but the reply made me get out of bed and opened the door to see what she wanted.<br><br>Yumi looked far more intoxicated as compared to yesterday night. Her face and neck were flushed red and her eyes looked glassy. Her vest was hanging on her arm and I could tell she was wearing a red bra underneath her neat white shirt.<br><br>Â“Do you need help? Drink a lot Â–Â“ Before I could complete my question, she took a few steps into my room and closed the door behind her. Pushing me gently against the wall, her arms went around me, and we locked lips and kissed.<br><br>I could taste liquor from her lips as our tongues started to play the cat and mouse with one another. Her hands moved up and down my back, slowly pushing my T shirt higher until she felt skin. I thoroughly enjoyed the welcome tingling sensation as I felt her fingers feeling every inch of my back.<br><br>In return, I caressed her back and nape, giving small gentle pinches to the back of her neck. She has a firm and soft butt and I subconsciously moved my hands to feel them and lingered there longer as compared to the rest of her back.<br><br>The kissing continued furiously, both of us not wanted to break the bind we had to one another. I ran my fingers through her shoulder length hair and pushed her face closer to mine, embracing her tightly and reveling in the closeness we shared, my fatigue slowly fading.<br><br>No words were exchanged as we kept our lips together and moved our bodies closer to the bed. Somehow during the short trip, I managed to unbutton her shirt and get access to her smooth skinned torso. The bra cups, being the only barricade to her luscious breasts were deftly gotten out of the way with a quick flick to the catches at her back. I cupped her right breast and massaged it as we sat on the bed, still kissing with fervor.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Getting out of the washroom, I decided to go nude and give her a warm welcome, not to mention a Â“standing ovationÂ” when she arrived. I did feel a sense of longing especially waking up alone without Yumi beside me earlier. I had given myself the expectation of making out with her, a long and loving session in the morning, before anything else happened.<br><br>But all I could see was an empty space beside me, the only indication that she did lay there was the flowery smell that was so prevalently hers.<br><br>Irregardless, I did have an SMS that read, Â“Grimnar-san, get yourself ready at noon. I will come back and give you the best day!Â”<br><br>Smiling as I saved that message in my Saved Messages, Â“It isnÂ’t that bad. DonÂ’t they always say Â– Absence and longing makes the heart grow fonder?Â” I could open that message in the future and remember Yumi, always.<br><br>Time passed by as I sat naked, watching the local news and willing as hard as I could to make time pass. Time was not co-operating. The seconds passed by as if it was being held back by an unknown force, making me feel more restless by the minute.<br><br>I switched channels as fast as a bored 7 year old, at the same time, holding my privates to keep them warm from the air conditioning whilst imagining the way she held me just last night.<br><br>Â“If only she would not go off like that. She could have woke me so I could have given her a sending off that would make her stay.Â” I wished I would have been more aggressive whenever it came to things like that. In all my encounters, IÂ’ve always been semi-passive, waiting for something to happen. But my point of view is, I do not want to seem overtly sex hungry and scare off the women. Not to mention that, personally, satisfying my lady is always priority, not the other way round.<br><br>11.50am. The roomÂ’s phone rang.<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Full story @ <a href="http://storytellingtime.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://storytellingtime.blogspot.com</a></div>
