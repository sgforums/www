I wish life could be everything tht we dream of but sometimes, it just doesnt happen that way.<br><br>I am a guy and I would agree to a certain extent that my answers may probably be different if I am a girl... but I wonder though...<br><br><strong>Let me stress again, I recognise that [b]sex is an important aspect of life and of relationship</strong>.  <strong>Nobody can deny you this right</strong>.  I respect your views about the importance you place on the value of having good sex and yes, bad sex can be a cause for break up that is for sure.[/b]<br><br>But at the end of the day, I guess what some of the people here are saying is that you need to be comfortable with your choice but choose wisely.<br><br>Its exciting to have sex at this age bec its something new and totally enjoyable and immensely intense... like nothing that you have ever experince!  That is only right bec that is what SEX was intended and created for!!!<br><br>but the importance of sex diminishes with age for both parties.  by the time you are in your 30s to 40 that is the age where initmacy takes over from sex and that is where alot of people starts feeling unfulfilled.  Moreover, again, no matter how great sex is, after sometime, it becomes routine for most people!<br><br>There are plenty of divorce people who had great sex lives but why do they still divorce?  bec there is the failure to communicate and have intimacy in their relationship.<br><br>Its the longer term view that I am looking towards... its that after sometime, when you get older, you determine how attractive a person is unconsciously by looking beyond the face etc... you actually start looking inward.  When you reach that stage of life, you will start finding uncommon beauty in the common people around you!<br><br>So What am I saying?<br><br>You need to get someone who is compatible with you, someone who has similar drive (yes - sex drive but also please include similar level in energy towards life - ie one sporty one book worm - not impossible but already one difficulty to work through)<br><br>You need to determine in your mind and heart what is truely important to you and your future - that is where longer term view comes in.<br><br>Now as to how important a DD is, again its subjective between person to person.. like I said... yours is not the first case of a woman being dissatisfied with size but people do work through it.  Q - Is it so small that you are not able to feel it or would improving your sex life by having more and better foreplay help??? that is ususally one of the ways to compensate and a much better gauge of sexual iinterest and ability and ULTIMATELY more fulfilling sex than even a bigger tool can provide in the long term.<br><br>For fear of going round and round in circles... at the end of the day, only you can decide one way or another what is important to you.  No one in this forum even the girls will be able to tell you and convince you that a larger DD is important to you bec they are not you and their mental and emotional need is different.<br><br>May I suggest that you relook the relationship... is there any reason why you are dissatisfied with this person apart from the sex issue? bec often times its not purely as simple as him having a small DD that is the cause of your current rethink!  Also why back to the ex?? something in the past that has come back alive in your heart that you never let go off?  some promise made or hopes that you never gave up even after going out with your current??<br><br>So its not so simiple... as whether size matters... the fact that you have experienced it suggests that you not only prefer but would require a certain calibre of DD and if so, you have your answer already.  but think about everything else too before you deicde.. that is only fair to him and to you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't lie to yourself. If you are unhappy in the relationship, you are unhappy. Be it due to sex or any other reason, it will never help if you lie to yourself and your partner. This deception will only place a strain on your relationship and sooner or later you'll just explode.<br><br>Do what you have to do and choose what you feel is right, although I think it's quite selfish to do so. But it's better than prolonging the misery and exploding later on. Don't just think about what your ex can give you but also what you'll miss out if you leave your current bf. Can you really bear to leave him? Can you really forsake all that your current bf has done for you and not regret leaving him? But if you really can't see a future with him then stop wasting his time. He could be happier with someone else who appreciates him more.<br><br>Think about what you really need and want. Choose carefully, sex may seem fun now but how long can it last?</div>
