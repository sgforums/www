At age of 21, I met Mr.Big (my hubby), I gave him everything after few months together. About 2 years later, we broke off. Few months later, I met Mr.Nice, and our relationship lasted for about a year. After separated with Mr.Nice, about 9/10 months later, I met Mr.Big again at my friend's birthday party, and at that time he is still single, so do I. So, he started to invite me out for movies, lunch, dinner (no xxx activities). After about a year, he ask for patch up, and I feel touch for what he has done for me, we married, and now we have 2 kids, and plan to have our 3rd one next year.<br><br>By that way, I don't have D-cup, I just have a pair of C-cup normal size assets. I never ask for the largest tool. Some guys just need to understand, women will never look for the largest, we just want something that can fulfill/satisfy us.<br><br>Well, if you are not a woman, you won't know that kind of disappointment when the small didi goes into your XYZ, you canÂ’t even fill a thing inside. No matter how large a woman hole, is a guyÂ’s job to satisfy her. Of course if you have a small one, you canÂ’t do the job like a man. But the Big guy will be able and know how to do it. Eventually, all women will have a big hole when age comes.<br><br>Hey, again, woman never look for the largest, but at least can do the job like a man, can satisfy a woman. At least you donÂ’t lose to a piece of plastic toy.<br><br></div>

That does not mean I go around expecting and demanding that my partner should have big this or tight that. We are all made differently. It is bad enough if one is blessed with a small dick. To have a gf who chooses her bf freely then starts to complain about his size does say one obvious thing...  that the size of her heart and brain when put together, is no bigger than her bf's dick!</div>
