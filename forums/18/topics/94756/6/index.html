I think they were probably speaking out of their convictions, beliefs and possibly relational experiences!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Of cos we shall never know what it feels like to be filled up just like you said and I shall not deny the fact that sex is definitely important.<br><br>Sorry but lets look at it again... May I ask what do you wish to build your relationship on? love or sex??  <strong>Yes I agree that it does not have to be mutually exclusive.  There must be nice guys with nice tools just as there are great guys with inadequate tools. But there are definitely plenty of nasty guys with magnificent tools... </strong><br><br>You mention something about proposal and being a wife etcÂ… this makes the consideration more important.<br><br>Miumiu said it herself that not just anyone with a big tool can be her bf.  That is great!  Everyone knows that sex with the person you love will be so much more intense and pleasurable and the bonds stronger than sex with just a tool!<br><br>Along this line therefore it must be that if your relationship isnt going anywhereÂ… I am not sure that having the most magnificent tool to have sex with can save the marriage.  You probably will not even want to come close to it!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Please do not forget, sex for most people can be and does become a routineÂ…   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> no matter how good it was before and how wonderful the tools of trade were!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> This is a fact which must never ever be overlooked!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Great sex can never save a marriage.  If you are not communicating and loving and being kind and generous to each otherÂ…. Your marriage will be under a lot of pressure from the beginning with or without great sex! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Oh please O please if you do have a good sex life after many many years of sex with the same person .... more power to you.  But please do not send a post saying... " no I disagree bec I have good sex for xyz years and still enjoying it blah blah.." cos it would mean that you clearly missed my point. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Think about it, how long can his sex drive last?? How long can yours last?? howmany years?? What about marriages without sex?? That must be even worse than having sex with a small DD right?  But before viagra, many relationship survives and flourish inspite of and in the face of impotency!  Impotency hits more man than you care to know!  Thats why they are depressed cos they cannot raise their magnificent tools!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Why are we even talking about this??? Well its bec of the longer term objective of being in a healthy and successful relationship.  Again please, I am not discounting the importance of sex but it should not be the only or BIG BIG factor to determine and peg your happiness to.<br><br>Like I said, there are nice guys with nice tools.  So if you think you have the chance, go ahead and do a swap.  But if you do have to choose between the two, I hope you will choose wisely and not merely on the basis of the tool box alone!<br><br>There are plenty who marry for love and their relationship survives.  There are many who marry for sex and theirs donÂ’t!  Please do not mistake love for sexÂ… what you think is love may not beÂ… I have seen many examples ....... of divorcing couples.  Often the reason for the divorce has to do with Â“defectsÂ” in 1 or both parties personalities.  Of cos there are definitely sex related issues but usually sex is not the original causeÂ… the cause normally lies much deeper than just the non enjoyment or inadequacy of sex alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>For fear of going way out of threadÂ… IÂ’m just going to end with thisÂ… There is very little that can replace a kind generous and merciful spirit in a person, definitely not the biggest hottest sex or DD or anything.  But its possible to make up for certain amount of sexual inadequacy with tons of loving care, compassion and emotional intimacyÂ… donÂ’t believe meÂ… check out Mr SupermanÂ’s life.  He cannot walk anymore let along have sex but he is still happily married. Talking about a frustrated wife!<br><br>So if your ex is first a loving person etc plus has a nice tool box, great you have your answer.  But if he is not a nice person but is one you can live withÂ… then I am wondering if you are doing yourself and your future a disfavour by turning down your current esp if he can satisfy you emotionally mentally and with intimate companionship etc.  (I am only guessing hereÂ…  his tools may be small but I do not believe its inadequate for the job!  There is a big difference but I shall not argue this with you cos you know what you like)<br><br>So I guess the bottom line may look something like this..<br><br>a)  if the first donÂ’t satisfy emotionally etc but great tool kitÂ…<br>IÂ’ll say forget him.<br><br>b)  Current satisfy but it really bothers you that you really need nice tools box and that techniques and foreplay will not helpÂ…<br>then I say forget him too!<br><br>c)  Then its back to what some of the guys ahve already saidÂ… you should go try your luck and hope you hit the jack pot!<br><br>All the best.
