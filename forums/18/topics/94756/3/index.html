            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by polpolx:</div><div class="quote_body">Go for what you wanted most.<br><br>Similar case happened to me before. Few years back, I broke off with my BF, the reason is rather silly, because he is very busy, thus lack of time for me. After broke off, I met the New BF. He is a nice person, patient, and caring. He has desire for sex, his skill is ok, but one thing, his size is rather small (max about 4inc, not very hard). At first I am ok with it.<br><br>But after sometime, I started to miss my Ex's tool, his bigger than 4inc, and it's very very hard. It's not that my sex desire is very high, but it makes me feel like lacking something in life. Just imagine, a small one can't even make you feel that you are complete, and fulfilled. I like the feeling of being fill with the big thing. So, I ask myself, is that fair to cheat myself, and most importantly cheat my New BF that he is the one that I really want?<br><br>No doubt he is a great guy, but to me, I feel that there is something missing.  It's not fair and it's selfish to keep him beside me just because he is a nice person. Yes, like somebody said, he deserve better. So, I decided to break off with him. I never let him know the real reason. Well, telling a guy his size can't satisfy me is really hurt. So, why should I hurt a nice guy? After few months, my Ex patch up with me, he is a naughty guy, and he is impatient. To me, overall I give him 60% as compare to the nice guy, which I give him 90%. But again, this naughty guy is a super man on the bed.<br><br>Most importantly, when I saw the small little didi, I don't have the same excitement as when I saw the big one. Don't mention about the skill, just watching the big thing is enough to turn me on. Some might say skill is more important, but I can say, size is important too.<br><br>Let say,<br><br>1) a guy has a big tool, but skill sucks, he score 40%, failed<br>2) a guy has a small tool, but super skill, he might score 70%, pass<br>3) a guy has big size + super skill = 100% excellent<br><br>Well, if you can't go for excellent, it's not bad to go for pass. Skill can always improve, but size is gift from god. People always say, skill is more important, but do you know that a guy with big size can have very good skill too? How many guys out there who have big gun will not appreciate this gift from god by using it with super skill? DonÂ¡Â¯t tell me some guys who has super tool but trying to use it with lousy skill, purposely? I wonder. Well, again, skill can always improve by experience and training. But sizeÂ¡Â­<br><br>So, go for what you want.  I married with my 60% naughty guy, and we have 2 kids now. He loves me, as I do, but he is not perfect. If you ask me again today, I still choose this 60% guy rather than the 90% nice guy. Perhaps I don't deserve the better one.<br></div></blockquote> Hi, thank you for the advise.  will consider.</div>

The situation here is so simple. If you have a pair of size36 (or above) to offer your bf, then obviously you have the right to wish for a bigger manhood from him. If you have acquired super performance in bed then you have the right to ask for improvement in his skill. If not....<br><br>Girls out there, don't ask for a Brad Pitt when you are a version of Whoppi Goldberg with no ASSet$. Ha ha ha ha ha.....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go for what you wanted most.<br><br>Similar case happened to me before. Few years back, I broke off with my BF, the reason is rather silly, because he is very busy, thus lack of time for me. After broke off, I met the New BF. He is a nice person, patient, and caring. He has desire for sex, his skill is ok, but one thing, his size is rather small (max about 4inc, not very hard). At first I am ok with it.<br><br>But after sometime, I started to miss my Ex's tool, his bigger than 4inc, and it's very very hard. It's not that my sex desire is very high, but it makes me feel like lacking something in life. Just imagine, a small one can't even make you feel that you are complete, and fulfilled. I like the feeling of being fill with the big thing. So, I ask myself, is that fair to cheat myself, and most importantly cheat my New BF that he is the one that I really want?<br><br>No doubt he is a great guy, but to me, I feel that there is something missing. It's not fair and it's selfish to keep him beside me just because he is a nice person. Yes, like somebody said, he deserve better. So, I decided to break off with him. I never let him know the real reason. Well, telling a guy his size can't satisfy me is really hurt. So, why should I hurt a nice guy? After few months, my Ex patch up with me, he is a naughty guy, and he is impatient. To me, overall I give him 60% as compare to the nice guy, which I give him 90%. But again, this naughty guy is a super man on the bed.<br><br>Most importantly, when I saw the small little didi, I don't have the same excitement as when I saw the big one. Don't mention about the skill, just watching the big thing is enough to turn me on. Some might say skill is more important, but I can say, size is important too.<br><br>Let say,<br><br>1) a guy has a big tool, but skill sucks, he score 40%, failed<br>2) a guy has a small tool, but super skill, he might score 70%, pass<br>3) a guy has big size + super skill = 100% excellent<br><br>Well, if you can't go for excellent, it's not bad to go for pass. Skill can always improve, but size is gift from god. People always say, skill is more important, but do you know that a guy with big size can have very good skill too? How many guys out there who have big gun will not appreciate this gift from god by using it with super skill? DonÂ’t tell me some guys who has super tool but trying to use it with lousy skill, purposely? I wonder. Well, again, skill can always improve by experience and training. But sizeÂ…<br><br>So, go for what you want. I married with my 60% naughty guy, and we have 2 kids now. He loves me, as I do, but he is not perfect. If you ask me again today, I still choose this 60% guy rather than the 90% nice guy. Perhaps I don't deserve the better one.<br><br>Glad that you shared your real-life experience to others and indeed a very culturative issue for generations X Y Z here.<br>Just curious, how long are you with the 60% guy before you call it off a day and how long are you with the 90% guy before you pull the trigger on him and last how long you marry 60% guy when you patch back and never look back.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>miumiu<br><br>There alws a mountain higher than the hill..simply there are no ending as comparing. If you are back to your big tool ex-guy after sometime - another bigger tool guy will be around. Its never end. If you really love big tool guys, you should open your option to "ang Mos" who is have extra inches to the their tool and very romantic ppl.<br><br>Off the record, if you decide to go back for more pleasure, ,please do so, and end it once for all before you turning into a Bitch cos I pity the Mr Nice guy who treat you well enough but lost cos his tool is not big enough.</div>
