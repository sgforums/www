(well many guys also jealous of that guy coz he can win my god sis's heart).<br>one night when we talked on the phone she suddenly talked about sex topic and at first i wanted to avoid it but still i asked her how about hers. she told me that she was quite disappointed that her bf's penis is actually quite small. coz she expect his penis to be bigger. the moment she saw his penis, she was like: oh, like this only? (i was surprise that she told me this coz we never talked this kind of topic b4).<br>although she was very happy with him, but when she was horny and seduce him he seemed to catch up very slow. even if they were doing it he also din manage to satisfy her, she complained that he performed very badly although she taught him and guide him several times oredi.<br>after she told me this, the first thing came across my mind: gals need QUALITY sex in their life. now she is going out with another guy, and i know she had made a right desicion coz she knows what she needs very well. when i think back, my gf was also like this. b4 she got to see my penis, she was very curious and wanted to know so she asked me and without second thought i told her just open it and see for urself. (ooops, got abit "out of topic"...)<br>guys, what miumiu is requesting from her bf is not wrong, afterall, we guys also sometimes prefer sex more than love. sorry if this statement offend anyone. miumiu is seeking our opinion, so, we should help! hehe...</div></blockquote>and an opinion i gave...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> am 29 now. At age of 21, I met Mr.Big (my hubby), I gave him everything after few months together. About 2 years later, we broke off. Few months later, I met Mr.Nice, and our relationship lasted for about a year. After separated with Mr.Nice, about 9/10 months later, I met Mr.Big again at my friend's birthday party, and at that time he is still single, so do I. So, he started to invite me out for movies, lunch, dinner (no xxx activities). After about a year, he ask for patch up, and I feel touch for what he has done for me, we married, and now we have 2 kids, and plan to have our 3rd one next year.<br><br>By that way, I don't have D-cup, I just have a pair of C-cup normal size assets. I never ask for the largest tool. Some guys just need to understand, women will never look for the largest, we just want something that can fulfill/satisfy us.<br><br>Well, if you are not a woman, you won't know that kind of disappointment when the small didi goes into your XYZ, you canÂ’t even fill a thing inside. No matter how large a woman hole, is a guyÂ’s job to satisfy her. Of course if you have a small one, you canÂ’t do the job like a man. But the Big guy will be able and know how to do it. Eventually, all women will have a big hole when age comes.<br><br>Hey, again, woman never look for the largest, but at least can do the job like a man, can satisfy a woman. At least you donÂ’t lose to a piece of plastic toy.<br></strong><br><br>All I can say, you are fated to be with Mr BIg whether he is big/small or him good or bad. Correct me if im wrong, in total time you took 3 years to patch back with Mr Big from the day  u two broke off. I was oso wondering are you still incontact with Mr Nice now.How did he take it when you broke off with him?<br><br>Size matter or not is very subjective. Though sex is an important issue but love play rather a more important role in the relationship. Without love there is no sex- With love the sex is more pleasure. Making out make the bond stronger.<br>Man and woman thinks differently. Man can have sex with any woman just for the basic law of ejection but woman do not let you penetrate her for her philosophy of achieving orgasm.<br><br>Simply put it whether woman have A B C or D cups doesnt matter to guys either, when a man have true love on a  woman, he will see all this flawless and accept who she is.<br><br></div>
