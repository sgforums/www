              <p><em>This is a true story of my friend Karen and the "relationship"
                              we had which lasted 2 years. The content of the story is true to the best of my
                              memory, but the names have been changed to protect the privacy of the
                              individuals involved. She is after all happily married now.</em></p>
                      <p>The story started a few months after I graduated from NUS. I was then
                              working as a project coordinator in a large MNC (let's called it ABC Company).
                              As I was a fresh graduate, I was full of energy and enthusiasm. I was also very
                              ambitious and my only focus in life was to do well in my career so that I can live
                              the Singapore dream (also known as the 5Cs). As a result, boy-girl relationship
                              has taken a back seat. I have been single for a long time - since the 2nd year of
                              my NUS study when I broke off from my last gf. But getting attached was the
                              last thing on my mind. My only goal then was to scale the corporate ladder!</p>
                      <p>Karen came into my life about 6 months after I started working for ABC
                              Company. I can still vividly remember that fateful Friday morning when the
                              manager walked into the office with Karen in tour and introduced Karen as our
                              new colleague. It was then that I first set eyes on Karen and she literally
                              took my breath away - with her calm composure, her sweet smile and a damn attractive
                              figure!  For the first time in a long while, money and career have taken a
                              back seat. On that fateful Friday morning, I experienced something which I have
                              not experienced for a long time - love, and perhaps lust.....</p>
                      <p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
                      <p>Before I continue with the rest of the story, I thought it may be apt at
                              this juncture to give a brief introduction of Karen:- Karen was 21 yo when she
                              first joined ABC Company. Like me, she was a fresh graduate on her first job (except
                              that she graduated from NTU instead of NUS). Karen is what you would describe
                              as "petite". She is about 1.55m tall and probably weighs no more than
                              45kg. She has shoulder-length hair (straight and black), wears a pair of Sarah
                              Palin's lookalike rimless spectacle (she changed to contact lens a few months
                              later) and is always immaculately dressed. She has a nice tan (from her regular
                              swimming ritual), a slim figure and a pair of firm B-cup boobs (which appear pleasingly
                              large on her petite frame). In short, I would describe Karen as an active
                              sportsgirl, a home-loving person and a sexy pin-up all roll into one. <span> </span>Not surprisingly, Karen was already attached
                              when she first joined ABC Company - she had a bf from NTU.</p>
                      <p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
                      <p>Karen and I worked very closely at ABC Company as we were both assigned to
                              the same project team. We got along particularly well in the team partly
                              because we were the only 2 in the same age group (20-something), whereas the
                              rest are already "uncles" and "aunties" in their 40s. Over
                              time, we got very comfortable with each other and we ended up spending a lot of
                              time together, not just in the office, but during lunch as well. We would talk
                              about our past, our ambition, our family, our friends, our failed relationships,
                              and everything else under the sun (except stuff which are of a sexual nature).
                              In a nutshell, we were just like the best of pal. I have never expressed my
                              true feelings for Karen - partly for fear of the office gossip and partly
                              because I respected her relationship with her bf.</p>
                      <p>My relationship with Karen changed suddenly as a result of an incident which
                              happened about 6 months after Karen joined ABC Company. Karen came into the
                              office one morning wearing a collar-tee (which is unusual because she almost
                              always wear a dress to work). On closer examination, I realised that Karen was
                              trying to use the collar of her shirt to hide a love-bite on her neck!</p>
                      <p>Needless to say, she ended up being teased mercilessly by me that morning.
                              Although she initially denied that it was a love bite (she claimed that she had
                              accidentally scratched herself), she finally admitted sheepishly that the
                              "scratch" was the result of a love-making session with her
                              over-passionate bf the previous night. Upon further "interrogation",
                              she revealed that she and her bf (Anthony) were at the movie the previous
                              night. As it was a weekday, the cinema was quite empty. So the movie date
                              became a "petting" session in the cinema and ended up with them
                              having sex in Anthony's car after the movie. As Karen was relating the incident
                              to me, erotic images of Karen were flashing through my mind - images of Anthony
                              squeezing Karen's wonderful boobs in the cinema, images of Karen sucking
                              Anthony's c?ck like some hardcore Japanese AV star, images of Karen's boobs
                              bouncing wildly as Anthony's hard c?ck pounds into her tight p?ssy, images of
                              Karen moaning in ecstasy as Anthony cummed into her p?ssy.</p>
                      <p>As expected of any hot blooded young man, I had a tremendous hard-on in the
                              office. I could feel sticky pre-cum already oozing from the tip of my c?ck. I
                              did the unthinkable. I excused myself discretely and wanked off in the office
                              toilet. I had a fabulous orgasm within minutes, spurting streams after streams
                              of hot semen into the toilet bowl as I “replayed” erotic images of Karen in my
                              mind.</p>

              <p>My relationship with Karen changed dramatically after that incident. The
                  incident has somehow deepened her trust in me and sex-related topics were no
                  longer off-limit in our daily conversations. It was through these conversations
                  that I realised Karen is a fun-loving, flirtatious and sexually adventurous
                  young woman – and certainly not the “prim and proper” office executive whom I
                  have known for the past 6 months.<span>  </span>It was
                  also through these conversations that I learnt of Karen’s fetishes for
                  sunbathing topless, sleeping in the nude and making love on the beach.</p>
              <p>There was once when we were having lunch, we saw a Caucasian woman walking
                  around braless in the food court. So that naturally became our conversational
                  centrepiece for the day. Being open-minded, Karen insisted that there is
                  nothing wrong with women not wearing bra. It was then when I jokingly dared her
                  to come to work braless. I have never expected Karen to take my challenge seriously.
                  The next day, Karen turned up for work in a suit (which is not unusual
                  especially when we need to meet clients). During the morning tea break, she
                  came over to my cubicle, flashed me an impish grin and declared “I am braless
                  today.” Her abrupt declaration caught me by surprise but I was certain that she
                  was just teasing me so I jokingly admonished her “Don’t bluff me, lah!”</p>
              <p>She said nothing, but simply smiled, looked me straight in the eyes and started
                  unbuttoning her office jacket –one button at a time. When the buttons were all
                  undone, she pulled her jacket apart to expose the blouse underneath. Wrapped
                  behind that ultra thin and figure hugging white blouse was Karen’s braless
                  boobs - full, round and firm - just like I had imagined. The outline of her
                  erected nipples (either caused by the air-con or the sexual tension) was clearly
                  visible. My c?ck went from a flaccid state to a full-blown hard-on in an
                  instant. There were moments of awkward silence as I ogled her braless boobs and
                  then we both burst out in laughter almost simultaneously. While the laughter
                  may have ease the sexual tension, it failed to alleviate the aroused state of
                  my c?ck.</p>
              <p>Karen was amused when she noticed my erection and teasingly suggested that I
                  should wank off in the toilet so that I could concentrate on my work later. I
                  had to summon every ounce of my will power to resist the temptation to wank
                  off, as I did not want to be at the receiving end of her endless teasing.<span>  </span>Nonetheless, she still gave me a nickname - “Wanker”.
                  In retaliation, I called her “Peaches”.</p>
              <p>That’s how we got our nicknames.</p>

              <p>I wrote the story in MS Word and then copy and paste here. That's why there was some gibberish in the earlier post. That does not mean that the story is fake. Who in the right mind will write a 10-page story directly onto a forum?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I take your comment as a compliment. Your suspicion about me plagiarising the article is proof that the story is well written. A badly written article will never be accused of being copied. Thanks!</p>
