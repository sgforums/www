              <p>Two incidents happened in quick succession which further elevated my close relationship
                      with Karen. These incidents happened about 10 months after Karen joined ABC
                      Company.</p>
              <p>The first incident was the breakup between Karen and Anthony. <span> </span>It came as a huge surprise for me as there
                      were no prior “symptoms” of any deterioration in the relationship between the 2
                      of them.<span>  </span>I only learnt about the breakup
                      when I found Karen all quiet and teary one morning. Until today, I am not sure
                      what triggered the breakup. Karen has never revealed to me the real reason behind
                      the breakup despite our close friendship. She would always give some lame
                      excuses and try to evade the issue whatever I ask her for the reason. I suspect
                      that I may somehow be the underlying cause of the breakup.</p>
              <p>While the breakup may have provided an ideal opportunity for me to move in and
                      occupy the spot vacated by Anthony in her heart, I was careful not to do it too
                      hastily as I did not want to prey on her weakened emotional state and be
                      branded an opportunist. At that point of time, our close relationship has already
                      generated a lot of gossips among our colleagues. I was not confident that Karen
                      would be mentally prepared to start an office romance knowing that it would only
                      stir up juicer and more frequent gossips from our colleagues.</p>
              <p>The second incident happened shortly after her breakup. Karen has been
                      head-hunted by one of our competitors and she decided to “jump ship” because
                      the new company offered her a significantly higher salary - although I suspect
                      that she also wanted the opportunity to get away from all the office gossips.<span>  </span>While I was initially saddened by her sudden
                      departure, I soon realised that her departure would allow our relationship to develop away from the prying eyes of our colleagues.</p>
              <p>We continued to keep in close contact after Karen left ABC Company. We would
                      meet almost every weekends (she was quite free during weekends as she was not
                      attached anymore) and keep in touch through msn during the weekdays (often
                      until late into the night). Having gotten over the breakup, Karen was back to
                      her usual fun-loving and flirtatious self. During our msn chat sessions, we
                      would tell dirty jokes and share erotic stories (just like in the good old days
                      when Karen was working in ABC Company).</p>
              <p>During one of our msn sessions, Karen was wearing a tight tank-top which
                      clearly outlined the shape of her boobs and showed off a fair amount of cleavage
                      (we both had our webcams on). <span> </span>I complimented
                      Karen on her “nice pair of boobs”. In response, she teased me by pulling her
                      tank-top downward to expose an even larger area of cleavage. Karen was clearly
                      in a super flirtatious mood that night. Knowing that I am a “boobs man”, Karen then
                      went on to tease me with a sensuous display of boobs massage through the
                      webcam. <span> </span>Karen cupped both her breasts
                      with her small hands and then slowly caressed and massaged them in an erotic manner.
                      After about 5 mins of teasing, Karen reached behind her back and unclasped her
                      bra. In one swift motion, Karen pulled out her bra from under her tank-top,
                      leaving her braless in front of the webcam. She continued to grope her braless
                      boobs as I looked on with a throbbing hard-on. At one point, she even lifted up
                      her tank-top to show off the lower half of her boobs – almost exposing her
                      nipples! Unfortunately, despite my repeated and often desperate pleadings, Karen
                      refused to show me her whole boobs.</p>
              <p>The entire display was conducted in a fun manner with Karen laughing and
                      giggling throughout. But it was nonetheless super erotic. Karen was so damn hot
                      that she left me totally breathless and with a seriously hard c?ck. Throughout
                      the erotic display, I was stroking my c?ck under the table (away from Karen’s
                      sight). As a result, my whole c?ck was already coated with a thick layer of pre-cum
                      by the time Karen ended her show some 10mins later.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, I masturbated immediately after I terminated my msn session
                      with Karen.<span>  </span>I fantasised myself groping
                      Karen’s wonderful boobs, playing with her nipples and finally sandwiching my c?ck
                      between her warm boobs and giving them a good f?ck. Already super aroused by
                      the show, it did not take long before I cummed. I achieved a powerful climax
                      which propelled my semen several feet into the air and left me exhausted.</p>
              <p>End of Part 4 (To be continued)</p>

              <p>sometimes, things are all the same..</p>
              <p>like how sex is just sex. no matter how u write it, it's actually similar. just the story about the kinkiness that plays with our minds..</p>
              <p>I think the story so far so good.. maybe the names used are very common in that kind of stories?</p>
              <p>like a typical storyline,</p>
              <p>"it was a monday night. I logged onto msn again just to meet up with karen again like we always did at 8pm. normally she'll log on in her silky sleeping dress or just wrapped in a baby blue towel.</p>
              <p>we talked about the usual, especially about a common colleague at ABC company that she knew before she left, on rumours between him and one of the other female colleague in her early 30s.</p>
              <p>Sandra doesn't look like she's in that range though. She looked as if she just graduated from uni and she maintained her figure well from all the yoga and pilate classes she told us about. I haven't been very experienced with figures though, but I could tell Sandra's about a firm 34B cup with trimmed waistline and a perky ass. just like my ex. hmmph.</p>
              <p>anyway, it was said that during one late night in the office where andrew and sandra was having overtime. they found themselves a way to destress apparently by disappearing together into the ladies only to be caught by the security cam. Although we don't get to see sandra's hot body but Andrew surely enjoyed that 3 hours in the toilet!? wth.</p>
              <p>"why didn't we do just that when you were around huh?"</p>
              <p>karen gave a little pout on screen and that is definitely the cutest look I ever seen. "you didn't wear tighter pants like andrew, do u?" thinking back, my closet has been filled with a number of size 33 pants for my height of 1.75m...</p>
              <p>karen demanded immediately that I had to put on my tightest pants for her right now in exchange she'll put on her shortest skirt she ever had. great deal? I rushed to my closet in a split second and change into it.</p>
              <p>"nice. seems like you do have a cute butt after all. wait okie? I need to change as promised!"</p>
              <p>in 2 mins, she appeared again close to the camera.</p>
              <p>"errr it's been some time since I last wore them.. "</p>
              <p>"oh come on! show me!"</p>
              <p>karen moved away from the screen and there, you could see her slim slender legs. tanned but looks absolutely delicious. meanwhile, she typed a message over.</p>
              <p>"guess the colour that's underneath and if you're right, I'll make it wet in front of your screen.. "</p>
              <p>___________________________________________________</p>
              <p>end story for now.. me just anyhow write for I think 40 mins.. pardon me, i don't write such stories at all.. :P and no edit or what.. all typed in as it is...</p>
