              <p><em>This is a true story of my friend Karen and the "relationship" we had which lasted 2 years. The content of the story is true to the best of my memory, but the names have been changed to protect the privacy of the individuals involved. She is after all happily married now.</em></p>
              <p>The story started a few months after I graduated from NUS. I was then working as a project coordinator in a large MNC (let's called it ABC Company). As I was a fresh graduate, I was full of energy and enthusiasm. I was also very ambitious and my only focus in life was to do well in my career so that I can live the Singapore dream (also known as the 5Cs). As a result, boy-girl relationship has taken a back seat. I have been single for a long time - since the 2nd year of my NUS study when I broke off from my last gf. But getting attached was the last thing on my mind. My only goal then was to scale the corporate ladder!</p>
              <p>Karen came into my life about 6 months after I started working for ABC Company. I can still vividly remember that fateful Friday morning when the manager walked into the office with Karen in tour and introduced Karen as our new colleague. It was then that I first set eyes on Karen and she literally took my breath away - with her calm composure, her sweet smile and a damn attractive figure!  For the first time in a long while, money and career have taken a back seat. On that fateful Friday morning, I experienced something which I have not experienced for a long time - love, and perhaps lust.....</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Before I continue with the rest of the story, I thought it may be apt at this juncture to give a brief introduction of Karen:- Karen was 21 yo when she first joined ABC Company. Like me, she was a fresh graduate on her first job (except that she graduated from NTU instead of NUS). Karen is what you would describe as "petite". She is about 1.55m tall and probably weighs no more than 45kg. She has shoulder-length hair (straight and black), wears a pair of Sarah Palin's lookalike rimless spectacle (she changed to contact lens a few months later) and is always immaculately dressed. She has a nice tan (from her regular swimming ritual), a slim figure and a pair of firm B-cup boobs (which appear pleasingly large on her petite frame). In short, I would describe Karen as an active sportsgirl, a home-loving person and a sexy pin-up all roll into one. <span> </span>Not surprisingly, Karen was already attached when she first joined ABC Company - she had a bf from NTU.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Karen and I worked very closely at ABC Company as we were both assigned to the same project team. We got along particularly well in the team partly because we were the only 2 in the same age group (20-something), whereas the rest are already "uncles" and "aunties" in their 40s. Over time, we got very comfortable with each other and we ended up spending a lot of time together, not just in the office, but during lunch as well. We would talk about our past, our ambition, our family, our friends, our failed relationships, and everything else under the sun (except stuff which are of a sexual nature). In a nutshell, we were just like the best of pal. I have never expressed my true feelings for Karen - partly for fear of the office gossip and partly because I respected her relationship with her bf.</p>
              <p>My relationship with Karen changed suddenly as a result of an incident which happened about 6 months after Karen joined ABC Company. Karen came into the office one morning wearing a collar-tee (which is unusual because she almost always wear a dress to work). On closer examination, I realised that Karen was trying to use the collar of her shirt to hide a love-bite on her neck!</p>
              <p>Needless to say, she ended up being teased mercilessly by me that morning. Although she initially denied that it was a love bite (she claimed that she had accidentally scratched herself), she finally admitted sheepishly that the "scratch" was the result of a love-making session with her over-passionate bf the previous night. Upon further "interrogation", she revealed that she and her bf (Anthony) were at the movie the previous night. As it was a weekday, the cinema was quite empty. So the movie date became a "petting" session in the cinema and ended up with them having sex in Anthony's car after the movie. As Karen was relating the incident to me, erotic images of Karen were flashing through my mind - images of Anthony squeezing Karen's wonderful boobs in the cinema, images of Karen sucking Anthony's c?ck like some hardcore Japanese AV star, images of Karen's boobs bouncing wildly as Anthony's hard c?ck pounds into her tight p?ssy, images of Karen moaning in ecstasy as Anthony cummed into her p?ssy.</p>
              <p>As expected of any hot blooded young man, I had a tremendous hard-on in the office. I could feel sticky pre-cum already oozing from the tip of my c?ck. I did the unthinkable. I excused myself discretely and wanked off in the office toilet. I had a fabulous orgasm within minutes, spurting streams after streams of hot semen into the toilet bowl as I “replayed” erotic images of Karen in my mind.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My relationship with Karen changed dramatically after that
              incident. The incident has somehow deepened her trust in me and
              sex-related topics were no longer off-limit in our daily
              conversations. It was through these conversations that I realised
              Karen is a fun-loving, flirtatious and sexually adventurous young
              woman – and certainly not the “prim and proper” office executive
              whom I have known for the past 6 months.<span> </span> It was
              also through these conversations that I learnt of Karen’s fetishes
              for sunbathing topless, sleeping in the nude and making love on the
              beach.</p>
              <p>There was once when we were having lunch, we saw a Caucasian
              woman walking around braless in the food court. So that naturally
              became our conversational centrepiece for the day. Being
              open-minded, Karen insisted that there is nothing wrong with women
              not wearing bra. It was then when I jokingly dared her to come to
              work braless. I have never expected Karen to take my challenge
              seriously. The next day, Karen turned up for work in a suit (which
              is not unusual especially when we need to meet clients). During the
              morning tea break, she came over to my cubicle, flashed me an
              impish grin and declared “I am braless today.” Her abrupt
              declaration caught me by surprise but I was certain that she was
              just teasing me so I jokingly admonished her “Don’t bluff me,
              lah!”</p>
              <p>She said nothing, but simply smiled, looked me straight in the
              eyes and started unbuttoning her office jacket –one button at a
              time. When the buttons were all undone, she pulled her jacket apart
              to expose the blouse underneath. Wrapped behind that ultra thin and
              figure hugging white blouse was Karen’s braless boobs - full, round
              and firm - just like I had imagined. The outline of her erected
              nipples (either caused by the air-con or the sexual tension) was
              clearly visible. My c?ck went from a flaccid state to a full-blown
              hard-on in an instant. There were moments of awkward silence as I
              ogled her braless boobs and then we both burst out in laughter
              almost simultaneously. While the laughter may have ease the sexual
              tension, it failed to alleviate the aroused state of my c?ck.</p>
              <p>Karen was amused when she noticed my erection and teasingly
              suggested that I should wank off in the toilet so that I could
              concentrate on my work later. I had to summon every ounce of my
              will power to resist the temptation to wank off, as I did not want
              to be at the receiving end of her endless
              teasing.<span> </span> Nonetheless, she still gave me a
              nickname - “Wanker”. In retaliation, I called her “Peaches”.</p>
              <p>That’s how we got our nicknames.</p>

              <p>Hi Rednano. Thanks for the encouragement. I am still halfway through Part 3. Will try to get it done asap. I don't have much time lately as I have to work late almost every night. It is not a simple 5-mins "cut and paste" job like some idiots are insinuating.</p>
