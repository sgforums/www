But I reckon he was asking for your views on shared toilets.  His actions when he entered one was his view. What's yours?<br><br>Well, here's my take. I had the privilege of having shared bathrooms whilst I was in uni.  It was a residential college.  and the cubicles were not your totally enclosed spaces.  The partitions were high enough at eye level so you would be really obvious if you tried to peer into the other cubicle.  I thought it was really an eye-opener comign from an Asian background.  But I really enjoyed being able to chat with my female friends about how their day went whilst we take our showers.  Oh...  did I mention that while we were showering, some dude would usually be in the toilet cubicle not too far away taking a dump and joining in the conversation as well?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div></blockquote>heyz.. did u ever PCC while chatting wif them?!<br>keke</div>
