Straight into prostitution? The landlord wasn't demanding the entire $11,000 immediately. Of her earnings so far she only paid a third to the landlord. Like some forumites have pointed out, she could have given tuition, which can bring in quite a lot of $. The pimp she met gave her an alternative - she could have tried being a social escort  who offered just companionship for a start. But she chose to become a call girl coz it paid the most, fastest.<br><br>Hmm ... the interesting choices that people make  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
