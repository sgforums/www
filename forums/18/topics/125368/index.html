            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted from New Paper<br>Customer threatens undergrad, another abuses her. Yet...<br>She does hazardous job to pay off family debt<br>April 05, 2005<br><br>HER world used to be bright, cheery and full of hope.<br><br>Candice (not her real name) was close to getting her university degree.<br><br>A promising future lay ahead.<br><br>But now all that seems like an impossible hope.<br><br>Within a month, the Singapore undergrad's world has become dark and dreary.<br><br>Candice, in her 20s, is now a freelance call girl - who charges $250 for each assignation.<br><br>MORE THAN 30 TIMES<br><br>From early February, she has accepted such bookings more than 30 times with 12 complete strangers.<br><br>She has done this despite the risk of being abused and getting infectious diseases.<br><br>And the risk of her secret getting out and blackening her reputation.<br><br>What makes her do this?<br><br>Her reason: To pay off her family's debt which amounts to around $11,000.<br><br>Her woes started two years ago, she said, when her father became the guarantor for a relative, who had borrowed heavily from loan sharks.<br><br>When the relative ran away, the loan sharks came knocking on their doors, demanding payment of over $100,000, she claimed.<br><br>To pay the debt, the parents sold their HDB flat last year and used the cash proceeds and family savings to pay off the loan sharks.<br><br>The debts were cleared and the family later moved into another flat in the same neighbourhood, renting it for over $1,000 monthly.<br><br>The rental was high byt Candice said the landlord was a relative's friend and he had indicated that they could delay the payments initially.<br><br>She said: 'Also, I didn't want my parents to stay in a smaller flat, after living so long in a more spacious flat.'<br><br>But after 10 months of non-payment, the outstanding rental accumulated to around $11,000, The landlord then got impatient and threatened legal action, unless the family pays a portion of the rental weekly.<br><br>Candice said: 'It was very stressful to see my parents worrying over the family problems and possible legal action. Being grown-up, I felt that I had the responsibility to help them.'<br><br>Her father is a labourer who earns around $1,000 monthly when he has jobs.<br><br>Her mother is a housewife. Candice has a brother who's still studying.<br><br>But given the relatively small debt of $11,000, could she have tried seeking other forms of help, instead of prostituting herself?<br><br>NO WORK FOR MUM<br><br>Could her mother find work?<br><br>Candice said: 'My mum's uneducated and has been a housewife for years. She's also quite sickly.<br><br>'Who'd want to employ her? Also, even if she works, she cannot earn enough to pay the debts.'<br><br>What about seeking help from her boyfriend, whom she has been dating for some time?<br><br>Said Candice: 'He doesn't earn much. And I don't like to borrow money from people. And he's my boyfriend, I don't want to burden him.'<br><br>Had she sought help from her relatives and friends? Or the town council, the community development council and even her university?<br><br>Candice said her father was a 'very proud man' who refused to seek financial help from relatives when she suggested it.<br><br>Seeking help from welfare bodies was also out of the question because these organisations would have to speak to her father to assess the family situation.<br><br>She said it was also impossible to find any job that could help her pay the rental.<br><br>To Candice, she was in a 'no way out' situation.<br><br>She said with a sigh: 'You think I would be doing this if I had other alternatives? I know people won't ever understand.'<br><br>In her desperation, she responded to a newspaper advertisement which promised good money for KTV hostesses.<br><br>She called and was told to meet a man in the lobby of a downtown hotel. He turned out to be a pimp recruiting social escorts.<br><br>He told Candice that she could either be a social escort who only offered companionship or one who was willing to have sex with the customers.<br><br>NEEDED MONEY<br><br>Candice said though she was resistant to the latter idea, she eventually agreed because she felt she needed money fast.<br><br>The pimp would take 40 per cent of her earnings.<br><br>On that day itself - barely two hours later - the pimp set up the first customer for Candice. One that she still remembers vividly.<br><br>'It was terrible.<br><br>'I was very scared when I entered the hotel room because I had never had sex with strangers before,' she said.<br><br>'I told the man that it was my first time and I didn't know anything.<br><br>'He had to teach me what to do step by step.<br><br>'The whole session lasted only 20 minutes, but it felt like an eternity for me.'<br><br>In fact, straight after her first session, Candice had to rush off to meet another customer.<br><br>After the two back-to-back sessions, she wandered alone on the streets, gazing at people and envying happy families and couples.<br><br>'When I thought about my family and my own boyfriend, and how I had to do this, tears just flowed,' she said.<br><br>'I felt like a slut and felt very 'jian' (cheap in Mandarin) for doing this.<br><br>'But who would want to do this unless she really had no choice?'<br><br>Most of her business comes from repeat customers.<br><br>Candice said she's so naive and simple-minded that some of her customers have had to teach her some tricks of the trade.<br><br>Such as collecting payment from her customers before having sex with them, buying a prepaid phone card to call them instead of using her personal line and withholding personal information from them.<br><br>Candice stopped working under the pimp after two weeks because she wanted to earn more.<br><br>She claimed that her customers included a lawyer, a broker and a businessman.<br><br>All are mostly married men in their 30s and 40s.<br><br>Candice charges $250 for each hour-long session.<br><br>A top-notch KTV hostess can command around $250 for each session while mid-range prostitutes charge around $120 to $150.<br><br>Said Candice: 'I always tell the men beforehand that they can change their mind even after they see me.<br><br>'I tell them that I need the money urgently for my family.<br><br>'Maybe some of them don't mind the high price because I'm an undergraduate.<br><br>'They would ask to see my matriculation card.'<br><br>So far, she has earned about $7,500, of which $1,500 has been paid to her pimp.<br><br>This left her with about $6,000, out of which she's given $3,000 to the landlord.<br><br>The rest has been spent on household bills and expenses, she claimed.<br><br>Candice said she was so depressed at one point, she saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed her as 'suffering from severe depression'.<br><br>Candice's ambition was to graduate from university and be a teacher.<br><br>But now, she's not so sure if she can still achieve them.<br><br>She said: 'I'm just trying to solve my family problems quickly and hope this will end as soon as possible.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>She looks shy and thin<br><br>THE New Paper on Sunday learnt about Candice after a concerned reader contacted us about her plight.<br><br>The reader wrote: 'If she is doing her final-year studies as she claims, then she really needs some assistance and counselling help.'<br><br>When Candice turned up for the meeting, she appeared slightly depressed and sad.<br><br>Wearing no make-up and dour-looking clothes, she was what one would describe as a typical plain Jane, with girl-next-door looks.<br><br>Her pencil-thin body made her look underweight.<br><br>She even took half of this reporter's tube of Mentos mints.<br><br>After we identified ourselves as reporters, Candice was initially hesitant, But she soon opened up and even showed us her university matriculation and identification cards.<br><br>Subsequent checks confirmed that she is indeed a local undergraduate.<br><br>Candice, who appeared shy and soft spoken, recalled some of her terrible encounters.<br><br>There was a Chinese man in his 40s who treated her roughly from the moment she stepped into the hotel room.<br><br>ROUGHLY TREATED<br><br>Candice said: 'He force-kissed me and then threw me onto the bed and flipped me several times roughly.<br><br>'He kept trying different positions and even bit me on my neck.'<br><br>Other customers have also forced her to have unprotected oral sex with them.<br><br>She said one man threatened to report her to the police and even her faculty dean.<br><br></div>
