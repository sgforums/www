If you strictly feel about the baby in this manner, then you should make it very clear to her that this is your stand on the baby. If she still insist on having the baby...you are in deep shi*?

I guess he must nt have sex anymore to prevent this from happening again. He doesn't have the responsibilities and duties to any of his present and future gfs.....<br><br>To abort, the mental n health of the gf will cause damage.  This relationship wont last too. To have the child, forced marriage will only result in bad marriage and irrespinsible and violent parents which may result divorce. To have her keeping the child and he go n find another gal immediately, gf will put hatred on the child or even unhealthy up bringing. On the positive side, she might be able to have better life without him, then find a better guy who love her and the kid.<br><br>I used to know a guy with the same mentality like him. For so many years, he's still the same, make his gfs pregnant, then avoid like a rat. If gf wants the child, he will accuse them of trying to make him get married and settle down.<br><br>So the gfs left, dunno wat happened to them, but I know most have dark shadows in their life. I know one of them... poor gal.. when she was pregnant, she went to see doc herself, do everything herself, the guy doesn't even want to know. When she was thinking whether to keep or abort, the guy has the same reaction. I guess fortunate for her, she has a fall and had miscarriage. After that, she just left.  Dunno how is she liao.......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>
