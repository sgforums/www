            <div class='col-md body'>i found something regarding decision making- suited for this kind of situation...<br><br>read...<br><br>The story given below is quite interesting and really gives us an insight into DECISION MAKING.<br><br>Which one will you choose?<br><br>A group of children were playing near two railway tracks, one still in use<br>while the other disused. Only one child played on the disused track,<br>the rest on the operational track. The train came, and you were just<br>beside the track interchange. You could make the train change its course<br>to the disused track and saved most of the kids.<br><br>However, that would also mean the lone child playing by the disused track<br>would be sacrificed.<br><br>Or would you rather let the train go its way?<br><br>Let's take a pause to think what kind of decision we could make.<br><br>Most people might choose to divert the course of the train, and sacrifice<br>only one child. You might think the same way, I guess.<br><br>Exactly, I thought the same way initially because to save most of the<br>children at the expense of only one child was rational decision most<br>people would make, morally and emotionally.<br><br>But, have you ever thought that the child choosing to play on the disused<br>track had in fact made the right decision to play at a safe place?<br><br>Nevertheless, he had to be sacrificed because of his ignorant friends who<br>chose to play where the danger was.<br><br>This kind of dilemma happens around us everyday. In the office, community,<br>in politics and especially in a democratic society, the minority is<br>often sacrificed for the interest of the majority, no matter how foolish<br>or ignorant the majority are, and how farsighted and knowledgeable the<br>minority are.<br><br>The child who chose not to play with the rest on the operational track<br>was sidelined. And in the case he was sacrificed, no one would shed a tear<br>for him,because he plays on the track.<br><br>The friend who forwarded me the story said he would not try to change the<br>course of the train because he believed that the kids playing on the<br>operational track should have known very well that track was still in use,<br><br>and that they should have run away if they heard the train's sirens.<br><br>If the train was diverted, that lone child would definitely die because<br>he never thought the train could come over to that track!<br><br>Moreover, that track was not in use probably because it was not safe.<br><br>If the train was diverted to the track, we could put the lives of all<br>passengers on board at stake! And in your attempt to save a few kids by<br>sacrificing one child, you might end up sacrificing hundreds of people to<br>save these few kids.<br><br>While we are all aware that life is full of tough decisions that need to<br>be made, we may not realize that hasty decisions may not always be<br>the right one.<br><br>"Remember that what's right isn't always popular" and<br>"what's popular isn't always right."<br><br>Hope you make the right decision in your entire life.<br><br>----------------<br><br>we choose the what's best for us, and not what's best for others.</div>
