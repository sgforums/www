Only went to read the last two to three pages and form what I see, only ditzy is giving any good contructive comments.<br><br>Somehow Mr Shaunlaw, I get the feeling you're more interested in flaming and agitating Mr Goh here but that's my opinion. True, you can post anything you want. No matter how wicked, how insulting, how spiteful. But if you say you want to help the girl, I don't see how flaming him would help.<br><br>Can't you see he's bugged about the matter? Flaming him like that won't help. You're doing more harm than good by making him more worked up over the issue.<br><br>If he's as wicked as you say, he would have just broken up with her and leave her to deal with the baby alone. So at least he's seeing through the matter with her.<br><br>You need to think further as well, it's not simply just keeping the baby and starting a family, such a decision is for life. Moreover, if he really can't make her happy, and if he really doesn't love her, they may feel misereable together next time. And with a baby to look after, things will get worse.</div></blockquote>U have ur option to say whatever u want to but one simple thing. If u think i am not thinking further, ask urself this question: "Things are not simple and yet he stil has the time to go play and come here to say his big tok?"<br><br>If hes bugged and really want to solve it, then he would have tot seriously abt it. So does everyone think I am flaming him or does he deserve some scolding?</div>

Whether to scold or not is one thing. But your 'scolding' doesn't seem useful here. I just feel that ditzy has been more effective in helping anyone here.</div>
