            <div class='col-md body'>Can understand ur bein lost and caught in tis dilemia..<br><br>It is not wat anyone will want to get into.. But once u got into it.. It has become a fact n u can't run from it..<br><br>Try to see it from your gf pt of view... I think she cry is coz.. She herself too is lost, and upset.. Gals no matter wat, tend to be more emotional than guys.. It takes 2 hands to clap.. Not only she is responsible for the pregnancy.. But u r also involved.. It isn entirely her fault nor ur fault.. No one expected for tis to happen.. Rather than losin ur temper at her.. Shouldn u be more manly.. N show her more concern?<br><br>Mayb the both of u could sit down n have a heart to heart talk to as wat to do.. U can't based on ur decision alone. Would u lik her to mak the decision on ur behalf if u were in her shoes? Hear her out first.. N talk with each other wat to u actually want..<br><br>As many as mentioned.. Goin thru an abortion is not as easy as wat abortion is defined as. The trauma, the emotional hurt etc. I strongly feel tat the relationship will certainly have changes regardless of wat ur decision mayb..<br><br>The baby is jus an innocent party.. There r many options tat u both may consider.. Abortion usually comes into mind first whenever an unwanted pregnacy has occured.. The reason bein - It is the most convivent method. U jus pay a sum of money and all ur prob is solved. Has it really been so? CAn u leave with the guilt tat u might think u won feel at all?<br><br>I feel tat.. U should respect her choice watever it is.. After all.. she should have the say.. Who be the one givin birth? Who be the one goin thru all the pains of abortion? She.. So? U both too could consider adoption..<br><br>Sometimes i feel.. Alot documentaries show.. Mothers.. YOung mothers.. Huggin their bundle of joy.. After goin thru so much sufferin n pain, they had given birth to a baby.. And at first sight.. No matter how hard or against someone has against children.. U will be in awe lik.. hey.. Tis cute infant here is my baby!<br><br>I duno.. True.. 19 yrs old is too young to be parents. But u should be responsible for wat u have done.. U can't jus shrink responsiblites lik tat.. Jus be with ur gf.. Hug her n jus keep quiet.. Let her cry all she wants.. Then when she is stable.. Talk with her.. See the doctor.. I think they should be able to give u advice tat u need...<br><br>Wishin u all the best..</div>

Who noes, they may be happy to hv a grandchild so soon (it did happen to my friend too).<br><br>3rd, discuss calmly with yr parents on issues like how to support the baby. You can repay them back when u started working in future. If not, u can work part-time but not forgoing yr study plzzz...<br><br>I hv to mention tat even if u r from a poor family, there's still way to support yr child. If no, does tat mean that poor people cannot start a family??? no rite... be positive n be good to yr gf... let her noe tat u will be responsible.

            <div class='col-md body'>The frustration felt by both parties is understandable. Afterall, you did not plan to have any children at this age. Either decision made, there' may be one seriously upset party.<br><br>Apparently, abortion would leave a deep scar on the girl's life and may also adversely affect her health. If you see her as your future life partner, would you bear to hurt her health?<br><br>On the other hand, forced responsibility may result in an unhappy family, unless your mindset is changed -- i.e. accept the responsibility whole-heartedly and work hard to support your new-found family. If you calm down and decide to take up the responsibility like a mature man, I'm sure you can look forward to a blissful life.<br><br>Since your parents may not provide you with patient listening ears, how about going for a counselling session with 1 of the many family service centres in Singapore? I volunteer with such an organisation, so am confident that they can provide you with professional help and link you to people who are experienced in handling such situations. (Obviously, no one in your family has faced such an issue before, so an expert in this field could give you much more reliable advice based on a wide range of perspectives.) The sessions are either free or very affordable, depending on your family income.<br><br>Your feelings are as important as your girlfriend's, so in order to ensure that both of you make the right decision and fully understand the rationale behind the decision, do try out counselling services.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well my advise is go tell your parents no matter what it is what U decide parents got to know it all.... and both of u r under 21 U will need parents consent to go through the abortion process unless is those pte type than i'm not sure... BTW put yourself in your gf shoes n think from her point of view... most likely after the abortion she will not want to be with you any more no matter how much U "LOVE" her.... N you know what, if after the abortion she is not able to conceive U would have successfully destroy her hopes in future to have any babies n not forget her future husband's hope of having a complete family with kids<br><br>wise up dude U maybe free from problems after the abortion but she is not</div>

(this is a cause you intended to make.) and you might regret (eg: loneliness for life &lt;-- this might be the effect of the cause you made.)<br><br>We can only advise you but the decision is up to both of you..

            <div class='col-md body'>Friend... If you are a MAN, please be responsible. If you want to "song" with her, you have to pay the price. If you love your gf, you have to always comfort her, take care of her.<br><br>Dun anyhow give excuses so that you can avoid this problem like a chicken. Remember that "YOU ARE A MAN". You are a man who "ding tian li di". If you have no courage to face your problem, please chop off your dick and live in your chicken life.<br><br>Dun be heartless, otherwise you surely will end up with losing someone you love in your life. You will regret forever, might fall into a deep depression valley. I saw too many cases like this. Even though the girl is willing to undergo for abortion, later she mostly will get depressed, never trust guys anymore or start to sleep around with other guys (duo lo). It is you who lead her to darkness.<br><br>Go and tell both parents so that they will help to solve this problem.<br><br>I am sure that you received all the reply here before my turn. Friend, be wise and responsible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, guess lots of pple have commented abt him to be responsible &amp; get the baby... but personally feel dat frm his comments &amp; stuff, he's not ready for a baby or the respnsibility of bein the head of his own family... &amp; the kid's gonna suffer in yrs to come... abortion is an option, though not recommended... Goh, dun take it as the only way out... kinda like the most selfish way out... Seriously feel dat putin the kid for adoption is the best option, cuz not only the kid's alive, at least he/she can be kept by a family dat is truely able to provide &amp; love him/her...<br><br>however, adoption is not ez as tot too... the gf'll soon have emotional ties wif the baby &amp; might jus wan to keep the baby... den guess it's time for responsibilty to take place...<br><br>jus my 2 cents worth of opinion...<br><br>let God's Will be done...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand what you are going thru. I have dated gals that have related such instances to me before and more than 1 occasion I put myself into such a situation and wondered what would I do.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that, as a guy, <strong>you HAVE to stand by your gf</strong>. I assume that you're not lying about loving her, because many guys lie in such situation (ie. she go thru so much for me, yet I dun love her, that makes me evil... blah)<br><br>I really do not think you're ready for such a big responsibility, but if she wants the baby, then you MUST respect her decision. <strong>Marry her, keep the baby  and be a REAL man</strong>.<br><br>My experience has always been that the gal dun want the baby even tho the guy is willing to marry her. The gals dun want to be stuck with low paying army officers (these gals I know are very rich, and they want to stay that way)and bring up a baby with him. They are the ones telling the guy they want the abortion.<br><br>You have NO choice in this matter of keeping or aborting. You both of course must think thru and see if you can keep the baby. Cost, maturity, exam stress, environment to bring up the child, etc. Put in every factor. And for once in your life, THINK.<br><br>I'm not asking you to shirk responsibility and push decision to your gf, but I really feel that you 2 are not ready for a baby. The gals I know are 20-25, filthy rich. Cost is not a problem. Yet the gals want to abort because they are not ready to start a family.<br><br>As for you, too bad, be a man. If you have problems doing that, read the preceeding posts, some of them do teach you how.</div>
