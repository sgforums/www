            <div class='col-md body'>Just my worthless opinion.<br><br>They aren't ready to handle a kid.  They're not mature enough, nor have the right attitude, nor reached a level of responsibility to look after one.  Yes, its wrong to rid a life, its heartless, its just not right.  But then again, if the child was born, can their marriage solve anything?  If the girl does find someone else alot more willing to take up the responsibility, that would be good, but remember that's still a big if.<br><br>I'm not taking sides on any basis, just my opinion.

Did you ever stop to think what kind of burden you will put on this poor girl? SHE is the one that has to carry the child or SHE will be the one that has to go through the very painful and emotional abortion and you have the nerve to complain about the burden on you??<br><br>You ever hear of a condom? I think you need to go back to school again and learn about sex ed. They should just hang your ass out to dry for being such an immature prick!! I feel really sorry for the girl.
