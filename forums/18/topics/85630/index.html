Dun think u really love her so much... you are just used to her companionship...<br><br>IMO, u will be able to pick up urself soon....<br><br>You might also be feeling... Bu Gan Xin that she picked someone else instead of u...<br>but Since you have been yearning for a break up and got what u wished for, then u shouldn't be so upset... go out and have a break...<br><br>Enjoy urself... come back and have a good sleep... dun look back anymore..<br><br>Cheerios...</div>
