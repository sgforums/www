I hope nobody donated because of being forced by the host...you think he's a JEDI MASTER? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I think the force is strong with me...so I never surrendered to his Jedi Mind Tricks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Take it easy, afterall...they're entertainers...and pretending and acting is part of their job. Don't think any of those actors and actresses enjoys participating in those charity shows every month, it's simply ridiculous. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Think Mediacorp has taken this charity thing too far...they'll probably keep doing it until somebody dies from accident while performing in the charity show. There's simply no need to put anybody's lives at risk during those shows. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To make the show safer but still challenging, they could ask the actors/actresses perform 1000++ sit-ups or push-ups. It could promote healthier lifestyle to the public and yet challenging enough to convince the public to donate. Now that's real efforts! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>They could also ask an actor/actress who is very poor in singing to sing until the donation quota of $10k is achieved. And $10k is only for stopping the poor singing. Then the host could say "Everybody please kindly donate until the $10k quota is reached so that this poor actor/actress can stop singing!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hmm...I hope the government can come out with some social welfare scheme to provide free medical for us, the citizens of Singapore. Kinda missing some common sense here, the people works hard to build and improve the country throughout their lives...but when they're old and sickly, they're subjected to pay the impossible medical bills till they expires from this world. The citizens take cares of the country and shouldn't the country take cares of it's citizens? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck, hope nobody will ever need to fall sick...we simply cannot afford to fall sick. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></div>
