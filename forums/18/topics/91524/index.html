Afterall, the title is a question rather than a statement. It's a vague title so your accusation of him may be due to a biased mindset of the person that is Sir_Horny.<br><br>As for his decision to put it in BAR, he had already explained his reasons so from my point of view, he may not have done the right thing but neither do i see malicious intent on his part.<br><br>Perhaps you may know something that I don't, afterall, maybe you know his IP address and all.
