[12] However, some studies suggest that Asians have less hair is due to less sensitive hair follicles, not the amount of testosterone. [13] [14]<br><br>[edit] Gangster stereotype<br>A common Asian stereotype is that of the rowdy, uncontrollable young male. In Asian cultures parents take special care in upbringing their children to be well mannered and respectful to others. [15] While this of course depends on the conditions of the child's upbringing (such as economic stability), Asian people are renowned for being honorable and respectful. Despite this, many view Asians (particularly those who have immigrated from their homeland to a Western country) as being disrespectful, violent and untrustworthy criminals. As a result of these two contradicting views, Asians are categorized by Westerners into two groups. The studious, polite and intelligent group and the violent, destructive "gangsters". This image has been further fueled in the Western world by Asian drug hoarding circles. It is those such as Bali Nine drug ringleader Andrew Chan who contribute to the creation of such image.<br><br>[edit] Misogynist<br>A common stereotype of Asian men is that they are misogynist, too sensitive and disrespecting to women. They are commonly referred as male chauvinists. [16] [17] [18] This stereotype originated from Asian media that portray Asian men as sexist. [18]<br><br>The Joy Luck Club is particularly consistent with this racial cliche because it portrays Chinese culture (especially Chinese males) as being negative and restrictive to the freedoms of Chinese females. This in turn might allow for a refreshing picture of white men to somehow liberate Chinese women. About the time the movie made its debut in theatres, many Asian Americans (many of them Chinese American) were offended by the negative portrayal of Asian men in this film. Such screen portrayals are consistent with the restriction and/or absence of Asian American masculinity in the western media. [1]<br><br>[edit] Stereotypes of Asian women<br>Main article: Stereotypes of East and Southeast Asians (media portrayal) #Asian women<br><br>[edit] Hypersexuality<br>See also: Asian fetish<br>Asian women have been portrayed as aggressive sexual beings. Western film and literature has promoted stereotypes of Asian women, such as depicting Asian women as cunning "Dragon Ladies",[19][20][21] as servile "Lotus Blossom Babies", "China dolls", "Geisha girls", war brides, or prostitutes.[22] Japanese media have also at times sensationalistically promoted the stereotype of Japanese women overseas as "yellow cabs".[23] UC Berkeley Professor of Asian American Studies Elaine Kim has argued that the stereotype of Asian women as submissive sex objects has impeded women's economic mobility and has fostered increased demand in mail-order brides and ethnic pornography.[24] Other contributors to these stereotypes come from the widespread proliferation of pornography, especially on the internet and the globalization of the industry. Japan, especially, has one of the largest adult video markets in the world[25] and many of these are exported overseas, contributing to a highly sexualized image of Asian women in general.<br><br>More nuanced treatments of stereotypes come from movies like The World of Suzie Wong (1960) (also a book) where the Asian woman's appeal comes partially from her "orientalness" expressed through their clothing, language and attitudes, and from the fact they serve as cultural and gender guides for foreign men. In these movies, white men are fairy-tale knights and their love functions as a redemptive force for fallen Asian women. Staci Ford of University of Hong Kong concludes that stereotypical depictions of women in general created by sexist white men continue to haunt movies even though they now have a disguised form.[26]<br><br>Stereotype of unassimilation<br>According to political science professor/author/scholar Claire Jean Kim, Asian Americans have been racially triangulated in American society in relation to America's preexisting deeply-rooted black-white bipolar racial dichotomy. This theory is the intersection of the model minority stereotype and the Perpetual Foreigner stereotype. In America's preexisting system of racial valorization, whites have been considered the dominant "superior" group while blacks have been considered a subordinate "inferior" group, often stereotyped as being lazy, cultureless, and primitive throughout American history. Within this spectrum of racial valorization, the dominant group has valued Asian Americans as being "superior" to blacks, and are stereotyped as being a hard-working intelligent people (model minority) having an ancient venerable culture, but still "inferior". However, in the other dimension of this theory, both whites and blacks, regardless of valorization, are considered to be "insiders" to American culture; thoroughly assimilated and native to America. Asian Americans, on the other hand, despite their "superior" valorization by the dominant group in relation to other minorities, are still considered to be unassimilable perpetual "foreigners," inherently fixed in their own exotic Asian cultures and unable to adapt to American ways.[27]<br><br>all of these stereotypes come from this page...<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes_of_East_and_Southeast_Asians</div>
