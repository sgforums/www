Female infanticide was the result, he said.<br><br>"Historically infanticide was something that was practiced in poor places in China," Mosher said. "But when the one-child policy came into effect we began to see in the wealthy areas of China, what had never been done before in history Â— the killing of little girls."<br><br>In recent years, female infanticide has taken a back seat to sex-selective abortion or female feticide, due to the advent of amniocentesis and ultrasound technology as well as other prenatal sex selection techniques, many of which are now readily available in clinics and doctorsÂ’ offices.<br><br>"We feel it's a serious problem that everybody should be concerned about and aware of," said Wanda Franz, president of the National Right to Life Committee. "This is a form of abortion that, from our point of view is especially egregious. Abortion is claimed to help women; obviously in these cases, females are the direct victims, because women in these cultures are not valued.<br><br>"In our family we adopted a Chinese baby," she continued. "There have been thousands and thousands of them adopted since ChinaÂ’s one-child policy created this overabundance of baby girls in orphanages."<br><br>How bad are the imbalances between males and females in Asia?<br><br>Generally, the normal sex ratio at birth (SRB) is between 103 and 105 males per 100 females, and in rare cases 106 or a bit more than that.<br><br>Countries that are known to have or have had higher sex ratio at birth numbers include South Korea, which peaked at 115 in 1994, Singapore where the SRB registered 109 in 1984 and China, which has seen the numbers increase over the past two decades.<br><br>Published reports in China show the gender ratio for newborns in 2005 was 118 boys for every 100 girls, and in some southern regions like Guangdong and Hainan, the number has reached 130 boys for every 100 girls.<br><br>The 2000 Chinese census put the average sex ratio at 117, with Tibet having the lowest number at 103 and Hainan registering the highest at 136.<br><br>Nicholas Eberstadt, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research in Washington, D.C., attributes the large sex-ratio imbalances in places like China to a combination of factors: an enormous and enduring preference for boys reinforced by the low socioeconomic status accorded to women; the use of rapidly spreading prenatal sex determination technology for gender-based abortion; and the rapid drop in fertility in different populations, making the outcome of each birth even more important.<br><br>"The one-child policy intensifies this problem, but if that policy stops and fertility levels stay at one or two, the problem wonÂ’t entirely go away," Eberstadt said. "When the average number is down to one or two, there is an incentive for parents to meddle with the outcome. In places where fertility levels are high, there are few signs of sex selection."<br><br>In his presentation before the World Youth Alliance in New York City last April, Eberstadt warned that "The Global War Against Baby Girls" is expanding.<br><br>"There are gender imbalances in almost every East Asian country, but Japan," said Eberstadt, who has also noted alarming irregularities in Western Asia in places like Cyprus, Qatar and Pakistan, as well as in some countries on the African continent, including Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>China Holds On to One Child<br><br>However, China has pledged to keep its one-child policy in place until the year 2050, a policy which it admits is "related" to the large sex imbalances in the country.<br><br>"The implications are potentially disastrous," Mosher said. "The answer is economic development, not restricting the number of people."<br><br>This year, the United States sponsored a resolution at the U.N.Â’s Commission on the Status of Women that called for eliminating infanticide and gender selection. The resolution was withdrawn due to opposition from several countries, including China and India; however, the issue of prenatal sex selection was included in the final conference document.<br><br>Interestingly South Korea was one of the countries to support the resolution. Like China and India, it too has had its own problems with sex imbalances; however, progress is being made.<br><br>If the imbalances continue, Adam Jones, executive director of Gendercide Watch, sees another possible outcome.<br><br>"Because of the disparity, surviving women have greater market value," he said. "As a result, it may become more economically viable for families to have girl children, thus reducing rates of female infanticide and sex selection."<br><br>As China and India work toward solving their problems, Eberstadt points out that three large European countries are also showing disturbing signs.<br><br>"Greece, Macedonia and Yugoslavia betray some hints of prejudicial death rates for little girls in the post-war period," he said. While the numbers are very small, he notes they are "nonetheless curious and unusual.<br><br>"In the western hemisphere, Venezuela and El Salvador both have unnatural death rates for little girls and now also display unnatural sex ratios at birth," he continued.<br><br>Published reports point to problems among some immigrant groups in Canada as well. And even in the United States, Eberstadt said, some Asian-American populations have begun to "exhibit sex ratios at birth that could be considered biologically impossible."<br><br>"Since the mid-1990s, the issue of female infanticide and sex selection has been highlighted in several conferences and in several U.N. documents," said Samantha Singson, chief U.N. liaison for the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute. "Unfortunately the issue isnÂ’t getting as much attention as we feel it deserves."<br><br></div>

He put that number at 100 million and coined the term Â“missing womenÂ” to describe these females lost to the strong cultural preference for sons. The numbers from India and China were particularly disturbing, and continue to be so.<br><br>The Cases of India and China<br><br>For various reasons, areas in India and China exhibit strong son preference. Social norms require sons to provide for parents when they are older, a sort of social security for old age. Daughters on the other hand are doubly burdensome, not only are they traditionally not allowed to provide for aging parents (both India and China ), but parents must also spend a lot of money (in India ) in dowry and other wedding expenses to marry their daughters off. In China , sons are especially precious because of the one child policy. To combat this dearth of women that is reaching crisis proportions both India and China have taken steps to reverse the trend:<br><br>India and China have banned the use of ultrasound and amniocenteses to determine the sex of a fetus<br><br>China now provides cash incentives, free schooling and better housing for families who have a girl<br><br>India provides free schooling for girls in single-child homes<br><br>China has relaxed its one-child policy if the first child is a girl<br><br>None of these incentives seems to have made any real impact on the numbers of girls. Real change will only come when the strong son preference and low social standing of women is eradicated from the culture of the Asian peoples, because as ideal family size falls in the region, other countries are likely to begin having sex ratios resembling India and China's.<br><br>China has the most severe shortage of girls compared to boys of any country in the world today, as documented by China's surveys and censuses up to 2000. This article evaluates data on sex ratios in China since before the founding of the People's Republic, and shows that the relative dearth of girls has become more extreme during the last two decades, and that the problem is real and not merely due to undercounting of girls. Daughters are lost primarily through sex-selective abortion, secondly through excess female infant mortality, and thirdly through neglect or mistreatment of girls up to age three, in cities as well as rural areas.<br><br>go read if u know how...<br><br>http://www.endvaw.org/resources/gendercide.php<br><br>http://www.gendercide.org/<br><br>See unlike you ya racist fool..I can produce proof while u produce nothing but stereotypes and your own personal innuendo..and u suck at arguments<br><br></div>
