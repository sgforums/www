All the others are below par.<br><br>But not all ang mo like this lah, but definitely in term of family togetherness, they loose to us, they like to travel, go oversea, maybe even years never see their family. So they dun have that family cohesion, therefore in love relationship they also take it and go as they like. That's is why divorce is just like a piece of pizza to them.<br><br>And also Ang Mo are only good looking while young, by thirty, they look like old man and woman liao. Of course for those famous stars, they still can afford to do comestic surgery to look nice.<br><br>Ang Mo are good in creativity and invention, they invented and created good things for we asian to use....but along the way, they also bring along homosexual, porn, casinos, mafia, guns, wars, enemity, hiv and drug into our society.</div>

But beware such gal are for money and social status, they are very good in seducing man, that is their trademark. But the objective may not be love.<br><br>Many men in singapore are looking for foreign gals, and many gals in foreign land are look for a place in singapore. So it gel well. But then gal like me will be left in cold palace. So how? A big social issue ok.<br><br>So, our Singmen are attractive ya...my foot they are!!!! even the mdia corp star also look like shiity to me...because you cannot match the talent and education or even the beautiful and witty of Singgal, you source for poorer countryside gals in other 3 world countries.
