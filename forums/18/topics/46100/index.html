            <div class='col-md body'>In Jan 2003 this year I was arrested for a crime I did not commit (along the lines of molest). I was released a few hours later on bail as the so called Victim claimed that I touched her about 2 years + ago in a lift. No evidence, No Nothing and yet I have to be arrested  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   as she claimed to positiely identify me 2 years later near my HDB blocks as I later found out that she stayed in my block too... It's a new neighbourhood with new flats so we don't often meet.<br><br>Now I'm constantly worrying about the outcome of the case even though I know nothing will probably happen to me as I REALLY hate to remain a Suspect!!! The police have recommened "No Further Action" and all I'm waiting for right now after 2 statements taken is for the DPP to reply and return the IP(investigation papers) to the police to recomend them what to do. Sigh I found out police have to listen to them.<br><br>Can any kind police or lawyer guys or just anyone give me advice on what I can do except wait wait n wait ... Do the police really take that long to close a case like this or just all cases in general.

(i noe difft case) but i am juz trying to highlight about stressing them in giving u the reply...<br><br>on the other hand if u stress them some guai lan police officer will act impartially... so maybe u wanna choose to wait?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
