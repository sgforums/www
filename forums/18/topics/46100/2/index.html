            <div class='col-md body'>If he is in the lift alone. The lift stop at one floor and one lady step in, he will get out of the lift.....<br><br>After he told me this, I become more aware already. Be very careful OK.<br><br>Let me relate one incident, about three weeks ago:<br><br>I was in the MRT standing next to the veritcal bar between the doors. Train very crowded. I put my hands at my side. Then got one group come in I think TP or R place, office people. This lady, quite well dressed (that is why I noticed her) lean against the vertical bar. Then I noticed that another lady had her hand onthe bar already and this first lady is leaning against her hand around the back just above the butt area. It was so packed that the well dressed lady really can't move. Probably not aware of the hand initially. I am standing right behind the well dressed lady. Then the "hand" sort of move around as the crowd shifted and sure enough the well dressed lady turn her head around quickly.... she probably suspect that the hand on the bar is mine.<br><br>Shit man, I then scared..... I tell you. both my hands quickly go from my side to my shoulders. I put left hand or right shoulder and right hand on left sholder, like X in front. I don't even dare to touch the vertical bar even when the train swayed, Just try to balance on my two fee. The lady turn around sharply a few times as the hand move, I feel like waving my two hands in the air to show that I am not the one.....<br><br>Guys, better be careful, sometimes misunderstanding can happen and we are at the losing end.<br><br></div>

Your lawyer should be able to get the police to do something since I doubt you can do much but sit around and worry.<br>If you accept a warning, it IS something like pleading guilty so if you DO get into trouble next time, this warning will be against you.<br>Best get a lawyer or if you have patience and feel that waiting is not that much of a headache, you can wait loh.<br>More or less this two options lah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>I think a very important point to note here is whether your arrest would remain in police files or not...not charged doesnt mean that you will not have a "record" in the police files...meaning next time...if someone checks up on U via legal methods...would he find out that U have been arrested before?<br><br>Criminal records(convicted) and police records are two different things leh...<br><br>Furthermore..."no further actions" doesnt mean U will be OK till the end of your life...as long as you have not been charged in court with that offence...they can still charge you...and someone(I believe my source is reliable) once told me that police sometimes wait...if U commit an offence(whether U really do it or not is another thing)...they will add in this current one and charge U together...meaning U face not 1 charge but 2...<br><br>Another thing...IOs sometimes tell stories...but how can U be sure that the story actually happened?Dun get influenced by him...make your own decisions...<br></blockquote>Hi Xcert, I don't I ever will have to worry about a next time... I have always have a clean record all my life untill this unlucky moment  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  What's important for me right now is to have this case closed and hopefully my name cleared. My IO said that I'm innocent until proven guilty and I feel that he is also trying to help me end the case fast also... at least that's what he told me. He also told me that the girl's father might also be dropping the case. He did also mention that my lawyers will not be able to speak to the DPP so I can do nothing but wait, is that true?<br><br>I also said ok to going for the lie dector test but after the 2nd statement he told me the case will end faster as scheudling a test will take many months than I asked him if it was compulsary to go. He said "No" and the results cannot be used in court anyway. So I never had to go for any tests.<br><br>Is it true that DPPs take a long time to return a police file back to them? Lastly do they have the right to suggest to the police to charge me even if they have no evidence of any kind? If they can do that, than all girls in Singapore can easily point fingers to any guy to get him into deep shit...</div>
