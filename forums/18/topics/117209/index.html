There is a problem. The girl I love is unfortunately<br>&gt; someone elses girlfriend. I try to forget about her but cant.<br>&gt; Every time I see her I just cant resist her. Is there any way<br>&gt; of making her come to me and dumping her boyfriend.<br>&gt; Hoping to hear from you!<br><br>Subject: I Need Help With A Woman<br>&gt; Hi there Marius you may have forgotten about me but I have not.<br>&gt; About a week ago I was dating this girl, well we were kinda<br>&gt; dating we talked on the phone everyday and we were exchanging<br>&gt; e-mails (but we never went out because she is busy on my days<br>&gt; off and I am busy on her days off).I know she loves me<br>&gt; because she said it. Ok about 4 days ago I went to visit her<br>&gt; we talked and then when I was leaving she told me to call her<br>&gt; because she had something to tell me, So I called her later<br>&gt; and she told me that she needed some time off because she<br>&gt; just broke up with her old boyfriend.(They were dating for<br>&gt; 3 years), And that we were going too fast. She asked me to<br>&gt; give her some time to think about our relationship. But here<br>&gt; is the catch she told me 2 times she was going to call me but<br>&gt; she never did. First time I called her then she said she would<br>&gt; call me, but she didnÃ¢??t. Second time the same. Is she playing<br>&gt; with me or is she serious?My question is...what can I do to<br>&gt; make her love me more or call me? I really love her and<br>&gt; she broke my heart went to said that she should stop seeing<br>&gt; each other.<br><br>Subject: Help!<br>&gt; I have recently broke up with my girlfriend. She said that she<br>&gt; had too much on and that it was not fair on me. All that I want<br>&gt; to do is get back together with her. How do I go about doing so?<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Do you see a trend among these mails? I do.<br><br>About 90 percent of the emails I get contain questions<br>like:<br><br>1) "Why isn't she answering my calls?"<br><br>2) "I love her so much but she's ignoring me. Why?"<br><br>3) "Why did she cancel the date?"<br><br>4) "Why did she say I am 'too good for her'?"<br><br>5) "Why doesn't she want to go out with me anymore?"<br><br>Interestingly enough, these guys also get all "logical"<br>and analysis everything to bits. They like to fantasize in their<br>heads about all the "possible scenarios" of why a girl isn't<br>returning their phone calls or why she is breaking up a<br>"perfect" relationship. Often, they come up with reasons<br>such as:<br><br>1) "Maybe she isn't answering my calls because her<br>father is in town and she has to spend time with him"<br><br>2) "Maybe she is ignoring me because she doesn't know<br>how much I love her. Or maybe she's just playing hard to get."<br><br>3) "Maybe she cancelled our date because she has to work<br>the next morning."<br><br>4) "Maybe she said I am 'too good for her' because<br>deep inside, she loves me and wants me to be happy."<br><br>5) "Maybe she doesn't want to go out with me anymore<br>because of childhood trauma. She just can't trust nice<br>guys like me anymore."<br><br>6) Well, I am sorry, but if a girl is ignoring you or<br>breaking up with you, there's only one reason:<br><br>SHE ISN'T ATTRACTED TO YOU ROMANTICALLY.<br><br>It has nothing to do with a busy schedule orÃ¢?Â¦childhood trauma.<br><br>It also has nothing to do with how much you like her - You<br>could give her all your love and she could<br>still reject you. Or you could be totally disinterested<br>and she could still be all over you.<br><br>Here's my first dating secret for youÃ¢?Â¦<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>&lt;&lt;  Dating Secret #1: It's Not How Much You Like Her,  &lt;&lt;<br>&lt;&lt;  But How Much She Likes You That Counts!            &lt;&lt;<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Most guys let their feelings blind them as soon as<br>they meet a hot chick. They start fantasizing about spending<br>the night or even building a future with the "girl of their<br>dream", when the girl is clearing showing absolutely NO<br>interest in them. In some cases, the girl doesn't even<br>NOTICE the guy. Here's the bottom line: SHE HAS TO LIKE YOU<br>FIRST BEFORE YOU CAN START ANYTHING WITH HER.<br><br>When it comes to dating, women are the choosers.<br>Men pick, but women choose:<br><br>1) If she likes your style or looks, she will let you<br>approach her.<br><br>2) If she likes your approach, she will let you talk.<br><br>3) If she likes the conversation, she will give you<br>the phone number.<br><br>4) If she likes the first date, she will give you a<br>second date.<br><br>5) If she likes you holding her hand, she will<br>let you kiss her.<br><br>6) If she likes your French kiss, she will let youÃ¢?Â¦<br><br>Get it?<br><br>Most guys make the mistake of projecting their own<br>attraction onto the girl. They think: "I think she is the<br>most wonderful person in the world, so she must feel the<br>same way about me!"<br><br>Uh-huh. Wrong!<br><br>She doesn't care about how much you love her, she<br>only cares about how much SHE likes you!<br><br>Think about it. If a fat chick with a black beard<br>tells you she loves you, are you going to marry her on the<br>spot? No way! The same thing is true for women. If a girl<br>does not like you, then you're just like the fat chick with<br>a beard. No matter how hard you try, she's not going to<br>marry you because she is not attracted to you at all. On<br>the other hand, if you have a girl who loves you with all<br>her heart, then she will try her best to make you feel happy.<br>There are NO limits to what a girl would do for a man she<br>loves. She could be working a 60-hour job, but she's still<br>going to find time to go out with you Ã‚Â­ if she likes you<br>enough. Every once in awhile, you hear about a "bad boy"<br>abusing his wife or girlfriend. The guy hits and abuses the<br>poor girl every day, but when the guy gets arrested the girl<br>still stands up for him in court and even waits for him to<br>get out of jail. Why? Because the girl is super-attracted<br>to him!See what I mean when I say it's not how much you like<br>the girl, but how much the girl likes you that counts?<br><br>Listen, if she doesn't like you, SHE WON'T CHANGE<br>HER MIND NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU TRY TO CHASE HER.<br><br>GO ahead. Send her flowers. Buy her gifts. Ask her<br>out. She may be flattered. But let me tell you now: you AREN'T<br>going to win her heart. You're just going to be "used" as<br>a "friend" she takes out when she's between boyfriends. You<br>will NEVER get to spend your life with the girl of your dream.<br><br>But there IS a way around this. Instead of "chasing"<br>women like most guys do, try to ATTRACT THEM instead.<br><br>(c)2004 Marius Panzarella, All Rights Reserved.<br></div>
