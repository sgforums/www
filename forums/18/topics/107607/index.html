            <div class='col-md body'>Autofellatio is a sex act wherein a male performs oral sex on himself as a form of masturbation. This is usually not possible for most men, but can be achieved if the male is sufficiently well-endowed, or is sufficiently flexible. Gymnastics and/or yoga are potential methods by which votaries of this pastime may increase their flexibility, and thus their ability to perform this task.<br><br>Autofellatio has been featured in a few pornographic movies, although it is not one of the more popular subjects. Some adult film stars have expressed contempt for men who autofellate.<br><br>In Egyptian mythology, the god Atum (Ra) created the gods Shu and Tefnut by autofellatio; or at least, it is argued that a proper translation of certain texts demonstrate that the ancient Egyptians believed this. Other translations ascribe this creation to mucus, rather than semen. It has also been argued that the Ouroboros is a symbol of autofellatio.<br><br>Autocunnilingus for a woman is rumoured to be possible, but would be more difficult to perform since the subject's head must move a greater distance.<br><br>The topic has also been used as the basis for comedy. Bill Hicks elaborated an oft-quoted riff on the subject of fellatio:<br><br>A woman one night yelled out, "Yeah, you ever try it?" I said, yeah. Almost broke my back. [1] (http://www.centripedus.com/bhpage.html)<br>Moreover, Kevin Smith later developed a similar theme ("He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick") in his debut film Clerks. [2] (http://www.4english.cn/movies/scripts/clerks.htm)<br><br>Autofellatio is typically not pleasurable for those who are capable of practicing it. It has been hypothesized that humans respond to the sensation of their own lips against their genitals in the same way that animals respond to the cleansing effect of their own tongues. Dogs and cats do not derive pleasure from such activity, and thus - it is argued - neither do humans (cf. self-tickling).<br><br></div>
