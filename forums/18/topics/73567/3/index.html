            <div class='col-md body'>w00t~ troy, if all guys thought like you, we'd all be back in the stone-age... where men just dragged women they fancied by their hair, knocked em around and just had their way! i think its time you improved on your maturity quotient... your attitude is reflective of that which most guys have in like... sec2 or something... like "WAH CHIOBU AH! WANNA SCREW HER MAN!" or something along those lines... and even then i bet most boys by THAT age know consider the notion of being caring and considerate to a girl he likes... so i seriously think u have the emotional mentality of a duck... maybe you should get out more... read a book or something... something tells me you've led a very sheltered life... maybe you take after your dad, i dont know... but obviously something went seriously wrong in your upbringing ^_^</div>
