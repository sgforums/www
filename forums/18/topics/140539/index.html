If the marriage is meant to be, the $$ spend on wedding can be better use to improve the standard of living ...<br><br>I know some will say that the $$ spent on wedding can be recoupe back, but trust me, it never does. A wedding encompass alot many thing than just the dinner alone....<br><br>and yes, I was thinking about gathering just the few close family and friends....<br><br>in this way, if the other party has got a hugh family like 80 relatives ... then the initial $$ to fork out is tremendous .... come to think about, actually it's finding the  $$ to fund the wedding in the 1st place .... which I know most will borrow from parents first, isn't it?</div>
