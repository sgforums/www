How do i tell him? I told him to try watch por and control...like that good advice onot?</div></blockquote>Masturbation is portrayed and believed by many to be a healthy self-indulging activity. But how many know the consequences that come with it, no matter how good you think you are at controlling this activity?<br><br>The act of masturbating does not seem harmful at first, in fact, it almost never fails to bring sexual pleasure in some sense. BUT, if you even try to do it once, and you will crave for more, until it becomes a very daily habit, for a long, long time to come. Physically, you may feel ok, but for some, they find themselves having some issues with their urination or ability to stay sexually unaroused at almost every second, inside their head.<br><br>This self-indulgent activity affects one negatively in the long term in many aspects of his life. His mental and emotional state is very much warped in the sense that one constantly craves for the sexual excitement by external stimulation and is very much attached to his/her own sexual fantasies.<br><br>When one does intend to get married, you will still find that you can't stop masturbating after being married to a normal woman of normal sexual inclination. It may cause problems when you find that your wife can't satisfy you as much as your own habit. Or maybe when you need to watch more porn to create more sexual excitement when you masturbate, this will hurt your relationship with your wife when she does and will eventually find out.<br><br>Masturbation is a form of sexual addiction, like all other types of addiction (gambling, smoking, drinking, having casual sex etc).<br><br>And the good news is, you can do something about it, you can help yourself.<br><br>I have sexual addiction issues on my own and do intend to seek referral to addiction help programmes.
