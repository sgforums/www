            <div class='col-md body'>ok, this may sound weird but I'm trying to conceive but my bf is thinking otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  why am I doing this? It's not to entrap him or something  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> . We have a very stable relationship and marraige is something on the horizon but maybe not now but I've been having this very strong maternal instincts for some time already. We live togerther so I have no problem with it. Everytime we have sex, we use the withdrawal method. By the way, it has been proven recently pre cum has NO sperm in it... coz he usually ejactuates on my belly and then goes off to wash up, does anyone know if I move the sperm to my vagina opening, is it possible to get pregnant? Or any other ideas? I was actually thinking of telling him I'm on the pill so that he will ejactulate inside of me but if I get pregnant immediatedly won't it be too obvious? I also have worries about fertility. I had an ex who smoked loads of weed in the past (heard it impairs fertility) and so I always smoked it "second hand" and he always ejactulated inside of me and we were together for about almost a year.... but no baby. He recently got another gal preggers so is the problem with me I wonder... Hmmm  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Can anyone help???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's a sad fact but we all need more than "maternal instincts" to decide to have a baby nowadays. besides the usual mambo jumbo about having babies out of wed-lock, u're actually trying to decieve him in having one.<br><br>if u REALLY want a baby u both better be consenting.. if not let him know u'll go thru with it with or without him. and then there's always a sperm bank for artificial insemination. i dunno if laws and all that are involved.. if u're that convicted, i'm sure u'll find out.<br><br>i hope u give it more thought. it used to be natural to have babies, my grandma had 13 babies (not all survived) but it's different now.<br><br>good luck and please make INFORMED decisions....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, I know.... coz he's 29 and he did say he wants a kid before he's 30.... but it's kind of hard for me to broach the subject coz he's more of the typical male who does not like to talk much about stuff.... I'm the one usually planning for stuff... For me, marraige is not that important as this... I come from a very open family and was raised in the states so my thinking is radically different from his... we compliment each other well with out differences  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> it is just this baby thing has been really bugging me for the past few months... we've been together for almost three years now... this baby thing is something I would like to happen... just don't really know how to get around it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well guess you seriously have to let him know that since you want his baby, he has to ejaculate in you and not outside of you.  Maybe it takes a while for him to get use to it.<br><br>Well anyway if you really plan to have a kid, why don't you also plan for marriage.  I mean this will be better. I am not saying what but at least you still have a name, and the child aslo.  I mean as woman, we often loose out, hence better to be safe than sorry.  Of course..this is just my thoughts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
