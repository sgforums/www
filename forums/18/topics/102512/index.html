            <div class='col-md body'>after months and months of negotiation with the authorities, me, as a Talmudist from Odessa was granted permission to visit Moscow. i boarded the train and found an empty seat and at the next stop a young man got on and sat next to me. i looked at the scholar and thought: This handsome man doesn't look like a peasant, and if he isn't a peasant he probably comes from this district. if he comes from this district, then he must be Jewish because this is, after all, a Jewish district. On the other hand, if he is a Jew, where could he be going? i'm the only singaporean in our district who has permission to travel to Moscow. Ahh? but just outside Moscow there is a little village called Samvet, and Jews don't need special permission to go there. But why would he be going to Samvet? he's probably going to visit one of the Jewish families there, but how many Jewish families are there in Samvet? Only two - the Bernsteins and the Steinbergs. the Bernsteins are a terrible family, and a nice looking guy like him must be visiting the Steinbergs. But why is he going? the Steinbergs have only daugthers, so maybe he's their son-in-law. but if he is, then which daughter did she marry? they say that Sarah married a nice lawyer from Budapest, and Esther married a businessman from Zhitomer, so it must be Sarah's husband. Which means that his name is Ben Cohen, if I'm not mistaken. but if he comes from Budapest, with all the anti-Semitism they have there, he must have changed his name. what's the Hungarian equivalent of Cohen? Kovacs. but if they allowed him to change his name, he must have some special status. what could it be? a doctorate from the University for sure. at this point i turn to the scholar and says, "How do you do, Dr. Kovacs?" "Very well, thank you, miss." answered the startled passenger. But how is it that you know my name?" "Oh," i replied, "it was obvious."...</div>
