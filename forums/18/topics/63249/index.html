            <div class='col-md body'>actually i think we are still on track to Goal 2010. In fact, its not a dream or a goal.cos we have done it b4...remember? we won the Tiger Cup a few years back. The only difference is that we have to aim for Tiger Cup now...not World Cup!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  So lets change our goal...its now GOAL TIGER CUP 2010!!!<br><br>i feel that the society is also partly responsible..just imagine how much u would get for playing soccer professionally and u can only play up to a certain age. Even though u may say that u can become a coach or something after that, but is it all worth it? The injuries u suffered in the past will come back to haunt u when u are in ur "golden" retirement. If u r talking abt those players in EPL, then i got nothing to say. Their pay is higher than our ministers here per week....<br><br>Furthermore, i realised that most of the players or coaches involved in local soccer are malays. to tell the truth, i find that the local soccer scene is biased. i remembered going for a soccer trial in poly, my friend played quite well in a 5 min match. He did scored a goal...but the Malay coach didnt choose him.i was pretty suprised...in fact, he chose a malay guy who didnt even touch the ball once. Maybe he got a powerful lung? Like the coach was more impressed with his shouting skills than football skills.haha! Since they are all biased, i will not give a damn abt whats going on abt our local team unless they start to drop their "racist" selection.<br><br>Anyone here feel the same way too?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the tiger cup was won because 2 of the big teams decided that they'd lose so that they'll not face Vietnam... and wanted to face singapore!!<br><br>so an own goal, intentionally scored, settled it..<br><br>after that, they were so humiliated by their own people that they lost their pride...<br><br>after that, when singapore played vietnam, it took a fluke goal, scored off sasikumar's back in a mad wild leap against the very much shorter viet goalie..<br><br>remember that...<br><br>we won because of the disgrace of the favourites and a stupid fluke goal...<br><br>it was one of the most undeserved championships ever won!</div>

Just look at the two matches, attack 75% of the time and show for nothing, but the oppostion just had 2 or 3 good chances and they take it (just like malaysia and myanmar).... i quote from some of the presenters from the EPL show -- championship teams win even if they play badly, which means, when they play badly they take what ever chances they get and score just to win just 1-0 or 2-0, that is what exactly myanmar and malaysia did.<br><br>in conclusion, possesion is fun to watch, but it accounts for nothing it you cannot score.. it is as simple as that. SO what if they beat Cambodia 10-0 (which i think they will not) the team did not deliver when it mattered....</div>
