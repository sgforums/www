            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, open up yourself and think of the rights of everyone. Singapore had adopted the UN human rights act for so long. Freedom of speech rights, are there and there's nothing wrong about their actions. Since they did not specific which girl are they talking about. There's nobody rights affected in the conversation. Although you might say it's offended the women rights but there's no specific person involved here. And we surely can't assume that we offended the whole women population of singapore because we aired anything that's very sensative topic about the body.<br><br>It's so common in every western society and the modern society out there now. And don't see anything wrong to the action as there's no evil intention behide the action.<br><br>So just OPEN UP!!!</div>

'Ask about her lingerie'<br><br>I WAS taking my children to school around 6.40am on Wednesday and, as usual, they would tune in to the music on 98.7 FM.<br><br>During that programme, a young student called and asked DJs Glenn Ong and Sheik Haikel how he should approach someone he fancied in the bus he was taking to school.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I was horrified by what Sheik said over the air, to thousands of schoolchildren all over Singapore going to school and listening in. He told the listener to ask the girl whether she was wearing white panties.</span><br>Glenn, to his credit, tried to stop him by saying the boy might not even be 16 but Sheik continued by saying he should also ask if they were cotton or lace.<br><br>I turned the radio off immediately.<br><br>Such irresponsible, low-class and crude jokes or comments must never be aired. It's about time we had some guidelines as to what can be said over the airwaves.<br><br>LAU CHEE KIN<br></div></blockquote>Once read an interview done with Sheik and he said he has utmost respect for all women, particularly his mother.
