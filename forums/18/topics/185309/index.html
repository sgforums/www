Remember where it is in 5 seconds or less and you may continue to indulge.<br><br>Rule 1008 - No Illegal Dumping<br>You know the type - this is the person who takes so long to finish their beer that it has become warm and flat.  They try to sneak over to a bush or a sink and dump it out so they can go get a fresh refill.
