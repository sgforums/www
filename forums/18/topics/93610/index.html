            <div class='col-md body'>the true story is like this actually...<br>it happened many years ago when i was only 17, and then i always trained badminton for competition, sometimes 3 sessions a day. one day when i was bathing my feel very itchy at my balls there and i keep scratching it and the skin was too soft then it started to bleed a little. so farking itchy i cannot tahan. i apply some cream on it still cannot cure, no choice so i decided to go to see doctor.<br>it was my turn, then i went in and i saw the doctor was a malay female, age ard 25, quite fair and i think can say quite pretty la. then i told her my problem and she asked me to go to the bed there. i went to the bed and sit on it. then she came and pulled the curtain and told me to take off my pants and lie down. so i unzipped my pants and took it off, then i pulled down my underwear. it was the first time i let woman see my penis. she was wearing glove and she did touch my penis and my balls and asked several questions like: did u make love with gals, did u wear small size underwear, how i hurt the skin... like that.<br>she said the skin oredi got infected but not too serious so dun worry. i was not feeling horny or anything but was a little embarrased. the nurse was not allowed to enter the curtain area so only the malay doctor was inside. she waited until my wear back my pants then she pulled back the curtain again and i thanked her and then went out...<br>this is the real version hehe just now the other one only BUSHit only la. so after that incident i always prepare more underwears in my bags hahaha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Had this experience at a GP, kind of embarassing then, the lady doctor, not that old, about middle age, not bad looking was examining me cos I had frequent skin infection, growing all over me for months.  At one stage, it growth on the testicles.  This lady doctor requested me to remove my pants and udnerwear, started asking string of questions, as I told her my I had that problem for 6 months since started working at a particular company... probably cause by environement and working condition.  Worse, she later ask me to ly down and examine the under portion of my manhood, lifting it up at times to check for, ..I don't know whatever she was looking for.  But I guess she is rather professional too.<br><br>I heard from some radio talk Show in UK about interview on job hazard.  Once the topic was doctors who operate/deals with patient's organ and especially sexual ones.  this doctor was online to described his experience.  He said something like  that:<br><br>It might be initially fun seeing especially female sexual organs, but you have to profesional too, but soon, he admited, after all this years working in this area, he realised he had to consult Psychologist as his work has become part of job hazrd.  Why?  the Qs posed to him was,  " will he get sick of seeing such things so much so that it will turn him off when he made love to his wife"<br>He admitted that he initially could not handle this problem as he sometimes, feel that his wife is just another patients and thats' the turning off.<br><br></div>
