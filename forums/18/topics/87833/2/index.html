However, making an honest mistake, doesn't mean you are not stupid.<br><br>2. And therefore, doesn't mean it will be the last 'Honest Mistake'<br><br>3. Tell her the ball should be in HER court. She obviously did something (mistake or not) and the least of the consequences she should face up to is how to handle things. Her responsibility towards the child, and towards her relationship with you, AND to you - should be her decision.<br><br>4. It isn't fair for her to ask you that question. If she still loves you and want to be with you , then I think the least she can do is to tell you. And THEN, you decide if you want to accept her or not. And if you don't, well, think after being unfaithful to you, and she doesnt even respect you enough to bare her feelings and risk rejection - i have to say i think she is not just weak but also irresponsible - do you really want someone like this?<br><br>5. Having said that, even if you decide you can forgive but not 'forget', she is probably in an emotional fragile state at the moment so do be a friend. It's bad enough for a girl to get pregnant when she doesn't want to be, so don't have to rub it in. Though I think the fact that you care abt her enough to think about whether want to continue the rship is .. well gentlemanly enough.<br><br>6. Yes it's may have just been a mistake - but can you forget? If you or she cannot accept the emotional baggage that comes with infidelity, you may 'patch up' only to 'break up' later on again because of insecurity. Suspicion and distrust is a difficult shadow to live under.<br><br></div>
