            <div class='col-md body'>The night started off with a super long queue into Marina South, which is an empty patch of grass, with an ocean front and the Singapore skyline as a backdrop. Hoardes of cars, and busloads of babes flocked to the largest dance festival in South East Asia.<br><br>It was 10:30pm when I met my buddies at City Hall MRT, and off we drove towards a night to remember. Arrived, parked the car, goodness, couldn't believe it, parking was free for the first time in Singapore. Must've been charged to the SGD35 we paid.<br><br>And off to the queue. The babes and blokes of all kinds stormed the<br>entrance. It was a long queue, but it was moving fast. Guess who I saw, the Malaysian Chef, Chef Wan (who is known as a softie). Didn't know he raved. Now I do. Was in a white cowboy's hat, partnered with an ahkua. Okay, lets talk about the finer things in life..... braless chics, string bikini babes, busty angmoh's, babes with skirts that looked like hot pants , Damn...<br><br>So the night started, 4 tentages, 4 different sounds. Regional Arena(DJ's from the region inc Gabriel fr Malaysia. He's good), Global Underground (Sasha spun here. T'was like a sardine can), Velvet Underground (erm.. so so... ), Mambo Jambo (tunes that made me feel old coz I could sing to most of em, like GnR's sweet child, and other oldies.)<br><br>Got in the queue at 11:30pm, entered at 12midnite. These people are deadbeats in dance!!!! Friggin' heck, not a soul was moving when I reached there. I was flabbergasted at how people can stand still right in front of a DJ console when beats are spun. ALL OF THEM!!!! Geez... must've been the lack of alcohoo, coz 2 hours later, every butt was gyrating!<br><br>Oohhh.. and guys, best of all, the bikini babes were on the podium,<br>showing off their wares. Slim bods, busty busts, tight asses.... and I<br>could've won the perv of the night award for staring at them.<br>For the girls, you would've wet your pants (i guess), coz the guys were topless, and there were just so many bodybuilder lookalikes here. 'V' shaped bods, tits, bigger than A cupped girls, and biceps that really looked like rats. Vain vain Singapore. But you can't help but love the vain girls. Mmm Mmmm..... there weren't many of them, but thankfully the few babes that did care their bods, were probably with the best bods that night.<br><br>Tatoos, massage parlours, food joints, and carnival rides were also part of the festival. Best way to end the night, got to leave the place with 2 beautiful babes!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers to a party to remember!<br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/life/story/0,4386,201878,00.html?</div>
