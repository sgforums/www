            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. dis is getting common..<br><br>I haf a fren whose problem was rather similar to urs. For his case, everything was fine until he got his 1st child. His wife juz "switched off" &amp; refused to consummate with him. She had turned cold. He tried every means &amp; ways to solve the problem but to no avail. After 2 yrs, his patience &amp; efforts juz didn't pay off, finally he decided to call it quits.<br><br>Recently, another fren also revealed dat he's having this problem too. I couldn't believe my ears when he said dat thru his 6 yrs of courtship + marriage, he has never touched his wife b4. At 1st he tot his wife was against pre-marital sex. Little did he noe dat her problem was so serious. He tried to help her but she is reluctant to work it out. Till today, he's still sticking by her hoping for a miracle to happen.<br><br>Sex without love is cheap. Love without sex is not complete.  So i'd say, stay &amp; try harder to get to the root of the problem. If all else fail, leave. Gdluck.</div>
