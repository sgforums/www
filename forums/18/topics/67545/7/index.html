            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, stop condaming one another or whatever.  Before you say something, please use your brain to think.  If her song is not nice.  Then why she is top in the US chart for being No.1.  Don't tell me they are blind or the christian support her so they buy the CD.  And I also never buy her CD.  And one more thing don't assume you know everything.  CHC does not force people to donate.  It's their own willingly.  They have their own doing just like as. We also have our way of doing.  When don't u take them as in your own shoes.  How would you feel when someone condemn you????  If you think all this is bullshit, then you are being immature.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>basically i think we all shouldn't attack her statement over the fact that some of you think she looks ugly/sings badly- it has no connection whatsoever. I'm not from city harvest, nor am i a total anti-christian... i just hope we all can see it in a balanced thing and not just going on a flame run...<br><br>although some stuff she does are mega controversial (low cut dress, secular involvements), and she's reiterated the fact that she's not a pastor- we shouldn't write off CHC just like that, even if its a commercial church and all (by the way she's the CEO of CHC). from reading her story, the 42 boyfriends are more of a way to show that her life's been transformed after becoming a christian... and not to show that she's real popular and all that stuff.<br><br>anyway, although i disagree with some of her actions (like really trying to create a buzz and so on), i think much of the stigma we singaporeans have is that we assume that celebrities (whose image in our eyes is moulded by the likes of J.Lo and other "loose" sluts) cannot be involved in religious stuff, or lead religious organizations. just think... you'll see that our image of a pastor is that he's a pastor, and that celebs are just for being celebs and nothing else...<br><br>yeah so just for the record her songs are pretty popular overseas and all... and seriously the rubbish about christians buying records to support her, well, christians in singapore hardly number 10% of the population- how would it surpass 5566 unless it was something popular? and not to mention those countries overseas have even fewer percentage of christians... US would be a different story altogether, but i figure it'll have to be quite good to be on no.1 on the billboard chart.<br><br>as for attracting attention, i figure if she wasn't such a controversial figure it would be pretty normal... and we would treat her as well a celeb. and nobody even bothers about the fact that foster was damn excited about her... oh well we singaporeans didnt even care when fann wong hit hollywood did we?<br><br>btw is corraine may a christian? her lyrics sound very christian like...<br><br>yeah so for everyones reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Yeow_Sun</div>

Before you say something, please use your brain to think.  If her song is not nice.  Then why she is top in the US chart for being No.1.  Don't tell me they are blind or the christian support her so they buy the CD.  And I also never buy her CD.  And one more thing don't assume you know everything.  CHC does not force people to donate.  It's their own willingly.  They have their own doing just like as. We also have our way of doing.  When don't u take them as in your own shoes.  How would you feel when someone condemn you????

            <div class='col-md body'>If yr got nothing to say then don say loh. This is her business and is none of yr business.  Care so much for what.  Whether you like or don like is your own business and keep your mouth shut.  The way you are doing is the same as you are backstabbing someone.  Who you think you are to judge people.  You yourself is not even better.  Nobody is perfect, why look at others bad side of life.  Think before you say.  The way you judge people and one day people alo will judge you back.  She got her own lifestyle and each of us is diferent. Your are not EVEN related to her, so don't cross to her boundaries.</div>
