If u guyz argue that she sings not for fame, or for money, ok, fine, then she must be singing for God sake right, then, why this image? Clothes reflect who we are, a personality of an individual. Why businessman and political leaders wear formal attire during a meeting, to gain respect and be respected. For these ppl, if a Prime Minister wear a singlet, he not only disgrace his name, more importantly his COUNTRY;s image. So, if one wants to choose a religious path, make sure you do not tarnish the image of christianity. I dun care about her neither her image, but more on the image she is going to tarnish.<br><br>During ur first interview, will you wear a swimsuit, so i wont BUY the arguement that " Its only clothes" because clothes [b]DOES </strong>matter.

Is this what you are trying to say? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  We can only assume that concern Christians are praying for HYS. Contrary to some popular notions about "judging", Christians are accountable to each other. Probably one of the earliest teachings in the Bible is the concept of being "your brother's keeper". The accountability to the Christian community is a theme that has been brought up time and again. A good example is when Paul openly rebuked Peter for something that that latter had done wrong. Or how about the rebuking of the 7 churches in Revelations by John?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>the fact that you openly judged and criticised her already affects the image of christianity.  please go back and ask your own pastor if what you did is correct.<br></strong></blockquote>actually within the church community, various articles had been written against the health and wealth ministry that is similar to CHC, so based on your assumption that no one should criticise, the bulk of these Christian scholars are also wrong?<br>Actually, it is rather presumptious of you to assume that these comments  affect the image of Christianity. Which image are you referring to: the one where Christians are delusional people believing in a lie, or the one where "dynamic" and "charismatic" people use the religion as a money-tree.<br>People who dislike us will continue to dislike us, people who emphatise with us will continue to do so. At the end of the day, the image of Christianity is not something we Christians can control, it all depends on how you, as an individual sees it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally don't like her. She don't have the 'wah' look for a singer or say artist. But I got to say some of her songs are nice tho. And i seriously doubt her popularity... think its all pump up by her followers... just imagine the number of followers in that CHC.... A new tactic... ahaha..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chin Eng:</div><div class="quote_body">actually within the church community, various articles had been written against the health and wealth ministry that is similar to CHC, so based on your assumption that no one should criticise, the bulk of these Christian scholars are also wrong?<br>Actually, it is rather presumptious of you to assume that these comments  affect the image of Christianity. Which image are you referring to: the one where Christians are delusional people believing in a lie, or the one where "dynamic" and "charismatic" people use the religion as a money-tree.<br>People who dislike us will continue to dislike us, people who emphatise with us will continue to do so. At the end of the day, the image of Christianity is not something we Christians can control, it all depends on how you, as an individual sees it.<br></div></blockquote>i will not waste my time playing with words.  lets  just move on and continue to do what we each believe.  after all nobody can say what is right or wrong, including the scholars.  strictly speaking including the existence of GOD.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if anyone here had come across this book titled "Mister God, This is Anna". It contains a particular dialogue that goes as follows:<br><br>Anna: Why do we go to church, Fynn?<br><br>Fynn: To understand Mister God more.<br><br>Anna: Less.<br><br>Fynn: Less what?<br><br>Anna: To understand Mister God less.<br><br>Fynn: Wait a blessed minute. You're flipped!<br><br>Anna: No, I'm not.<br><br>Fynn: You most certainly are.<br><br>Anna: No. You go to church to make Mister God really really big. When you make Mister God really really <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> big, then you really <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> don't understand Mister God - then you do.</div>
