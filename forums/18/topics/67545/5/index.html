            <div class='col-md body'>Look like tis thread seems to keep reviving..<br><br><blockquote>1) About the church building....<br>someone mentioned that it is "extravagrant"; with swimming pool, plamas<br>TV.. well.. basically i don't see anything wrong with that. As Christians. we<br>do believe that the house of God should be built with excellence in mind..i think it is matter of perception.. the person who mentioned this point should not judge.. my question to this gentleman is ..." are you from CHC? Did u contribute anything?" , If not as an outsider, i guess it is only right that u respect other people's work.. if CHC wants to put plamas screen , swimming pool.. ( &amp; by the way, it is more of a baptism pool than a swimming poo).. why does it concerns u to criticise? </blockquote>Well, some nations never contribute to US cause in the Iraq war. So they can not criticise tis policy ? The fighting between the neighbours of joo chiat get dirtier by the day, I do not contribute anything to it so I can not comment on it ? I don't think tat is the case man... we r free to criticise anything we want, if we can give reasons for it. Tat is why it is called free speech isn't it ? If CHC guys only take in criticism and comments from its own members and not from other sources, then CHC guys r really shortsighted and cut off from the world<br><br>About building extravagant buildings, I believe tat there should have a limit to it. Sure... u can make it as excellent as u want... but at wat cost ? The money from 16000 for a 40,000,000 building just mean tat each member has contributed a whopping $25,000 on average. And tis is just the bottom line. They got to pay for the furnitures, plasma TVs, maintenance fees, the money for father kang and his bungalows and cars, HYS album buying etc, probably each member have to pay much more than tat. Some members r really too deep into the religion to think rationally. I am pretty sure not all the members r rich or even average. Imagine they still have to keep paying minimum of 10% of their money to the church AND the building funds for the church. I do know of some CHC people and boy r they scrimping and saving money just to tilth. U think tat is fair to them ? Their own house is like sh!t while the church to make god egoistic r so grand.<br><br><blockquote>2)Sun<br>At least she is honest to admit her past.. All of us have bad pasts..of course sun's intention is thru her testimony..she can bring hope and encouragement to those who have walked her past.. now i dun mean that the person will have 42 bf or gf..at least someone who go thru a similar experience will feel hey if sun who has failed in the past can stand up &amp; walk again.. y not me..?<br>Remember.." He who is without sin..let him cast the first rock.." </blockquote>Honest ? Who get to go through 42 boyfriends like her ? It appears to be like some bragging session where she get to boast of her high number of boyfriends. Give hope and encourgaement ? To me... it just show people tat those people suffering from depression r the kind tat is most vulnerable to join a religion.<br><br>Sure, everyone sin... but how much people "zuo jian zhi zi" or cheapen themselves like HYS here ? If u ask me "those who never cheapen themselves... cast the first stone". I am gonna cast it man... I am pretty sure generally singaporean girls have a higher respect of their body and reputation than HYS.<br><br><blockquote>whatever detractors may say.. CHC will still function as normal on a weekly basis,Sun will still carry on her life impacting concerts.... </blockquote>Watever u say, there will always be people talking about it everyday and everytime as well. Life impacting ? To her members only bah !<br><br><blockquote>" chc members are under spell and they don't know what they are doing just blindly follow &amp; give their money just like that..", my question is with a membership of 16 000 members.. i don't think all 16 000 are "so stupid" as to be conned.. if they pay their tithes, it means....they believe in a vision that chc leadership has set or according to the bible to tithe their income as stated in Malachi 3.. think about it.. what is the odds of "conning" 16 000 members</blockquote>U think too little of religion. There r certainly more than 16000 people attempting to suicide bombing of fight for their religion. Is tilthing money more difficult then killing himself ? Why don't I ask u, can u swear to me tat the majority of the people in CHC don't tilth more than 10% ?<br><br><blockquote>well u have a reason to criticise if they have build a building using tax payers' money.. if not just leave them alone.. it is easy for us to see the bad side of people why not focus on what they r doing to help the community ? building schools, orphanages in third world countries,feeding thehungry..they have a community service arm.. that reaches out to troubled teens, elderly &amp; the inteclectually disabled....surely they deserve credit fot these right?</blockquote>How about the members themselves ? R they being helped ? They spend too mch of their money and the practise of "miracle heals" r meant to cheat the members. There is even a forumers saying tat her sister refuse to go for medical treatment because she "believes" her religion has healed her, which clearly didn't, resulting in the situation where her conditions deteriote and need long term medication. Don't u think tat is cheating ? The church even claims tat donating more money accumulates "credit" to spiritual investments, allowing them to have a higher chance of getting into heaven. Isn't tat cheating again ? wat is the difference between pulling votes by promising members heaven in malaysia and CHC ? CHC use reliigon to pull money instead of votes instead ?</div>

If the people who goes there week after week is OK with it, who am I to say that they are not. I think that it is PT Barnum who said, "There's a sucker born every minute".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> The more pressing issue is the theology preached in such churches: is it real, or is it an a passing emotion so much so that a fix is required each week.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> The issue with HYS is really quite dead. The church official website no longer list her as a Reverend nor does it show her holding on to any theological office. IEven her original title of First Deputy Pastor no longer exist. It may be their little face saving way to undo all the controversy that had happened. As far as I am concern, she's now a pregnant overaged pop singer who is being adored by many including her misguided church members.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> An interesting thought.... who will the child look like?

            <div class='col-md body'>If I remember correctly, I think she was abused by her neighbour when she was very young. Even though many years had passed, she still felt very disturbed by it. She felt dirty and had lost respect for herself. So I think the reason why she had so many boyfriends when she was 16 is to seek attention, to feel loved. Only when she got to know God, that she realised that was not love. She realised that true love is the love from God.<br><br>She's not a slut. Something happened to her that made her fell into depression. Something that she did not ask to happen. But something else changed her life. That was God. She's just trying to spread the words of God and to share wat happened to her.<br><br>Give her a break. At least she's doing something good with her life. Are u?</div>
