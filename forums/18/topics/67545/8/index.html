U CAN wear shorts and singlet to work, u can, legally and ur own rights, but u may not. Why, u will get fired. So will u argue with your boss that geez, its not naked or semi naked.<br><br>This aint no office. This is image, image of Christ. If u guyz argue that she sings not for fame, or for money, ok, fine, then she must be singing for God sake right, then, why this image? Clothes reflect who we are, a personality of an individual. Why businessman and political leaders wear formal attire during a meeting, to gain respect and be respected. For these ppl, if a Prime Minister wear a singlet, he not only disgrace his name, more importantly his COUNTRY;s image. So, if one wants to choose a religious path, make sure you do not tarnish the image of christianity. I dun care about her neither her image, but more on the image she is going to tarnish.<br><br>During ur first interview, will you wear a swimsuit, so i wont BUY the arguement that " Its only clothes" because clothes <strong>DOES </strong>matter.</div>

If u guyz argue that she sings not for fame, or for money, ok, fine, then she must be singing for God sake right, then, why this image? Clothes reflect who we are, a personality of an individual. Why businessman and political leaders wear formal attire during a meeting, to gain respect and be respected. For these ppl, if a Prime Minister wear a singlet, he not only disgrace his name, more importantly his COUNTRY;s image. So, if one wants to choose a religious path, make sure you do not tarnish the image of christianity. I dun care about her neither her image, but more on the image she is going to tarnish.<br><br>During ur first interview, will you wear a swimsuit, so i wont BUY the arguement that " Its only clothes" because clothes [b]DOES </strong>matter.

In the <strong>begining,</strong> i accept the fact that she is singing for God's sake, but if you voice out that what WE know about entertainment career, hmm, can i ask u now, for God's glory or for money. Entertainment career world until the extreme of Janet Jackson becoming a porn star? So, if she is singing for Christ sake and to call back the lost sheep, this AINT a normal norm of ENTERTAINMENT CAREER.<br><br>It is not that i do not respect her, or girls. Do not generalise because respect is something that we earned ; i had mention it in my previous post. Would you respect a lady who is a thief? or a pastor who dress undecently? Respect to God would be the highest ( for those who believe ya  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  )<br><br>U asked, how well i know her, i do not know her. I dont even know the prime minister personally. But as a matter of fact, even u and the rest do not know the prime minister, he still can tarnish the name of the country. That is important. If people start praising her as a pastor, well one day ppl might forget her name , but they will remember that HEY, there was a girl who claims to be a pastor but wear like a prost.....<br><br></div>
