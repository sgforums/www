Unfortunately in most cases, that is why forum such as this one exists.<br><br>We never fail to comment on interviews done by celebrities be it entertainers or politicians.<br><br>While I agree fully that the point to HYS's interview is about asking young impressionable teenagers not to make the same mistake she had made, a couple of glaring points defocus her objectives.<br><br>One, who will in her sick mind puts a number to the relationships she had in the past, especially when such relationship reaches close to fifty. It is probably enough to say that one had quite a few without giving a specific number.<br><br>Two, by what definition would HYS consider a male to be a bf? I cannot believe that each of the 42 assumed bfs are aware that they are being "stalked". I'd assume that some of these relationships are one-sided and some may even be imagined.<br><br>Look at it this way, a converted ex-convict gives a testimony to potentially wayward kids. He says that he had robbed 42 people in the past two years and gives details of each robbery. Wouldn't you say that such a testimony gets bogged down by the details that the testimony itself loses its value?<br><br>A person with such an educated and learned background should not make the mistake of over-embellishing one's story. By and large, the entire episode seems like "another poor communication" by HYS. Whether this poor communication is intentional or not remains to be seen.</div>

It is probably enough to say that one had quite a few without giving a specific number.<br><br>Two, by what definition would HYS consider a male to be a bf?

I'd assume that some of these relationships are one-sided and some may even be imagined.<br><br>Look at it this way, a converted ex-convict gives a testimony to potentially wayward kids.
