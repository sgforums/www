If you people posting are Christians, you should all the more understand the price we have to pay to obey God's words. Persecution will arise, no doubt.

And that was b4 she accepted Jesus as her Lord and Saviour. She's just trying to show how God has changed her life. btw, does any of you know she used to suffer from depression? That was why she's had so many bfs.. Whether people choose to attend church or not, it's is largely by their own choice. Not everyone will accept the gospel with an open heart.

After removing the HYS link for while, it is now back, though smaller (right side scroll down lowest button - <strong>Check out the latest on Sun at www.heyaosun.com</strong>) So it is a clear demonstration of the adulation of a specific church member, occasionally pastor, the sun goddess.<br>Of course, in spite of her busy schedule jetting from US to China, the sun goddess is still the First Deputy Senior Pastor, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President CHBTC as well Music Pastor.<br>It is amazing as to how much she is suppose to be doing just looking at her portfolio. Obviously most of this titles are honorific too. Seems that her entire life is a farce and nothing more than excellent marketing.</div>

To plaster the interior with plasma screens and extravagant decor would be ostentatious and a waste of donations and funds. Such funds can be better utilised, by helping needy church members or organising activities for the church.<br>Perhaps someone should scrutinise how such monies are used less this becomes another "Father Kang" scenario  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Can't really comment on her singing coz dun really listen 2 her songs ... but her looks ... aiyoh ... its like a plain Jane tryin 2 hard 2 be a Barbie doll ... definitely a thumbs down ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

But why be a pastor.<br>Same then if you want to be a PASTOR then be it and stop you nonsense that you had on 16(the past). By being a pastor and STAR(singer)..... i think its a kind of continuing her nonsense only in another form.<br><br>Since that you regreted what u done in the past then u must concentrate on your teaching as a pastor in teaching and preaching and not making so much attention and rubbish.<br><br>She wears like XXXX more than pastor. There are lots of singer who also wear subtly or not flashly.
