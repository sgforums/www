Something on the light side would be shower... Can be just gentle feel... Can be messy but LIGHT.... Ever proceed on to bed while both parties are still wet...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  One common 'mistake' which I think people make while moving from the shower room to the bed for sex is they often wipe themselves DRY... Which I think TOTALLY defeat the PURPOSE of the shower... In the process of drying yourselves (even if it's only for a few seconds) the 'feeling' and intensity might slowly go downhill ESPECIALLY for the female... It also defeat the purpose of the 'foreplay'... If possible, try proceeding to bed while they're both still WET and hot (?)....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Hehheh... With the fan or air-con SO COOL, you'll both be DESIRING for some HOT COSY SEX <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>The <strong>2nd stage </strong>I guess would be the BATH-TUB... Often varies by the SIZE and the depth of the water.... REMEMBER, these two things play an IMPORTANT part... Not forgetting TEMPERATURE of the water (usually more often applicable to showers and bath-tub only...)... If you think you can choose between having sex in a cold or hot swimming pool, then you might be able to have a GENERAL temperature preference for that....<br><br>1. SIZE :<br><br>- Limits the number of people to be completely soaked in the tub.<br>- Limits the kind of manevours you can perform.<br>- Determine how comfortable both of you can get.<br><br>2. Depth of water :<br><br>- Determine RESISTENCE in manevours.<br>- Efficiency of temperature control (ie. more warm water can keep you warm better)<br>- Determine ease of change between manevours.<br>- Might set some limitations to certain manevours.<br><br>3. Temperature :<br><br>- Determine how long you'll feel comfortable in the water.<br>- Warmer water tends to put people in a more relaxed mood while colder water makes people urge for the 'heat' from the other party.<br>- NOTE : Not SO HOT or COLD that one (or BOTH?) party got COMPLETELY switched off....<br>- In TEMPERATURE CONTROL ALWAYS WATCH OUT for your 1st SPRAY!!!<br><br><strong>3rd stage</strong>.... SWIMMING POOL.... You would usually have a CHOICE of doing your 'warm up' inside or outside the pool... Presuming that the water is COLD.... (Especially so if you're doing it in the middle of the night...) Always try to warm each other up 1st (Err... Using whatever way..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) before dipping yourselves in the water to avoid the CHILL SHOCK.... You may also start by rinsing some water over each other's body to get used to the temperature of the water (For regular swimmers should know... BTW, try not to skip this step if no proper 'warming' was done UNLESS you're used to swimming in REAL COLD water...) One NICE way of starting off would be having your foreplay with your legs dipped in the water or just part of your body in it....<br><br>A few words of CAUTION :<br><br>1. Always TRY to keep your VOLUME LOW if it's in the middle of the night.<br>2. Always watch out for TALL BUILDINGS (if you're in the OPEN). And also check out any LOW walls if possible to prevent people from peeping...<br>3. Try not to go into DEEP water unless you're both EXCELLENT SWIMMERS!<br>4. Try to stick to the sides of the pool for your own safety and better 'manevours'...<br><br>Even if you're not going into the water, can always try out having it just by the pool... The CHLORIDE smell, nice atmosphere and sound of gentle water is gonna make everything SO DIFFERENT!!!<br><br><strong>4th stage</strong>, in the SEA... But hear some advices 1st... Sea waves can be real rough at times... Make sure you're on good balance if you don't wanna break 'something' accidentally...? If doing it at night... It can be REAL DARK at certain areas.. (Depending on where you're doing it...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) Know your area well.... To avoid slippery rocks and such... DON'T go into depth which is too far and unnecessary... It could be REAL DANGEROUS.... Don't expect alot of manevours usually...<br><br>Advantages would be... Dark concealment..? People can't see you well...? And waves sounds can also cover up the 'noises' you're making...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>BONUS STAGES</strong><br><br>1. <strong>RAIN</strong><br><br>UNLIKELY as it might be to be it in the rain OPENLY... You would have BETTER CHANCES if you're in parks and such.... But ALWAYS expect things to be MESSY in the RAIN! &lt;- The BONUS is, you should try to make it STEAMY TOO!! If direct SEX in rain FAILS you, don't be discouraged... Try having a 'quickie' in some APPROPRIATE shelters around... Should be EQUALLY STEAMING and STIMULATING...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> It's always GOOD to have some 'foreplay' in the rain beforehand... Some might even wanna end up in someone's room or hotels..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2. <strong>By the SEA</strong><br><br>If you like the SEA SO MUCH and doing it in the sea isn't EXACTLY your cup of tea... You can always try having it in tent set up near to the sea so that you can HEAR it and SMELL it...?  &lt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>OK! TALKED TOO MUCH liao... May you people out there have BETTER SEX...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Can be just gentle feel... Can be messy but LIGHT.... Ever proceed on to bed while both parties are still wet...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  One common 'mistake' which I think people make while moving from the shower room to the bed for sex is they often wipe themselves DRY... Which I think TOTALLY defeat the PURPOSE of the shower... In the process of drying yourselves (even if it's only for a few seconds) the 'feeling' and intensity might slowly go downhill ESPECIALLY for the female... It also defeat the purpose of the 'foreplay'... If possible, try proceeding to bed while they're both still WET and hot (?)....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Hehheh... With the fan or air-con SO COOL, you'll both be DESIRING for some HOT COSY SEX <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>The [b]2nd stage </strong>I guess would be the BATH-TUB... Often varies by the SIZE and the depth of the water.... REMEMBER, these two things play an IMPORTANT part... Not forgetting TEMPERATURE of the water (usually more often applicable to showers and bath-tub only...)... If you think you can choose between having sex in a cold or hot swimming pool, then you might be able to have a GENERAL temperature preference for that....<br><br>1. SIZE :<br><br>- Limits the number of people to be completely soaked in the tub.<br>- Limits the kind of manevours you can perform.<br>- Determine how comfortable both of you can get.<br><br>2. Depth of water :<br><br>- Determine RESISTENCE in manevours.<br>- Efficiency of temperature control (ie. more warm water can keep you warm better)<br>- Determine ease of change between manevours.<br>- Might set some limitations to certain manevours.<br><br>3. Temperature :<br><br>- Determine how long you'll feel comfortable in the water.<br>- Warmer water tends to put people in a more relaxed mood while colder water makes people urge for the 'heat' from the other party.<br>- NOTE : Not SO HOT or COLD that one (or BOTH?) party got COMPLETELY switched off....<br>- In TEMPERATURE CONTROL ALWAYS WATCH OUT for your 1st SPRAY!!!<br><br><strong>3rd stage</strong>.... SWIMMING POOL.... You would usually have a CHOICE of doing your 'warm up' inside or outside the pool... Presuming that the water is COLD.... (Especially so if you're doing it in the middle of the night...) Always try to warm each other up 1st (Err... Using whatever way..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) before dipping yourselves in the water to avoid the CHILL SHOCK.... You may also start by rinsing some water over each other's body to get used to the temperature of the water (For regular swimmers should know... BTW, try not to skip this step if no proper 'warming' was done UNLESS you're used to swimming in REAL COLD water...) One NICE way of starting off would be having your foreplay with your legs dipped in the water or just part of your body in it....<br><br>A few words of CAUTION :<br><br>1. Always TRY to keep your VOLUME LOW if it's in the middle of the night.<br>2. Always watch out for TALL BUILDINGS (if you're in the OPEN). And also check out any LOW walls if possible to prevent people from peeping...<br>3. Try not to go into DEEP water unless you're both EXCELLENT SWIMMERS!<br>4. Try to stick to the sides of the pool for your own safety and better 'manevours'...<br><br>Even if you're not going into the water, can always try out having it just by the pool... The CHLORIDE smell, nice atmosphere and sound of gentle water is gonna make everything SO DIFFERENT!!!<br><br><strong>4th stage</strong>, in the SEA... But hear some advices 1st... Sea waves can be real rough at times... Make sure you're on good balance if you don't wanna break 'something' accidentally...? If doing it at night... It can be REAL DARK at certain areas.. (Depending on where you're doing it...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) Know your area well.... To avoid slippery rocks and such... DON'T go into depth which is too far and unnecessary... It could be REAL DANGEROUS.... Don't expect alot of manevours usually...<br><br>Advantages would be... Dark concealment..? People can't see you well...? And waves sounds can also cover up the 'noises' you're making...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>BONUS STAGES</strong><br><br>1. <strong>RAIN</strong><br><br>UNLIKELY as it might be to be it in the rain OPENLY... You would have BETTER CHANCES if you're in parks and such.... But ALWAYS expect things to be MESSY in the RAIN! &lt;- The BONUS is, you should try to make it STEAMY TOO!! If direct SEX in rain FAILS you, don't be discouraged... Try having a 'quickie' in some APPROPRIATE shelters around... Should be EQUALLY STEAMING and STIMULATING...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> It's always GOOD to have some 'foreplay' in the rain beforehand... Some might even wanna end up in someone's room or hotels..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2. <strong>By the SEA</strong><br><br>If you like the SEA SO MUCH and doing it in the sea isn't EXACTLY your cup of tea... You can always try having it in tent set up near to the sea so that you can HEAR it and SMELL it...?  &lt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>OK! TALKED TOO MUCH liao... May you people out there have BETTER SEX...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/b]</blockquote> wah!!! v pro wor ermmmmm wer my dar??<br>www u got c wad he write?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
