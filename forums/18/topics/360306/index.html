              <p>A sex theme park in southwest China that exhibits naked human sculptures, giant genitals and boasts a sex technique workshop is stirring up howls of protest, according to state press.</p>
              <p>"Love Land", billed as China's first-ever sex theme park, is slated to open in Chongqing municipality in October, but detractors hope the project will never see the light of day, the China Daily reported.</p>
              <p>"We are building the park for the good of the public... to help adults enjoy a harmonious sex life," the paper quoted park manager Lu Xiaoqing as saying.</p>
              <p>"Sex is a taboo subject in China but people really need to have more access to information about it."</p>
              <p>Besides displays on sex history and techniques, the park boasts a giant rotating statue of the lower portion of a nearly naked woman bent over at the waist.</p>
              <p>The announcement of the opening of the park elicited numerous comments from Internet users, with the majority of postings voicing opposition to the park.</p>
              <p>Officials also registered their disquiet with the explicit images on offer.</p>
              <p>"These things are too exposed," the China Daily quoted Chongqing policewoman Liu Daiwei as saying.</p>
              <p>"I will feel uncomfortable to look at them when other people are around."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'evil 'China sex park <span style="color: #ff0000;">torn down</span>: state media</span></strong></p>
              <p>A sex theme park in southwest China that featured giant genitals and a sex-technique workshop has been torn down after officials said it had an "evil influence" on society, state media said.</p>
              <p>"Love Land" was due to open in Chongqing municipality ahead of China's national day on October 1, but it was ordered to close following an investigation by local authorities, the Global Times reported.</p>
              <p>Besides displays on sex history and techniques, the park boasted a giant rotating statue of the lower portion of a nearly naked woman bent over at the waist.</p>
              <p>The Global Times published a photo of workers in the Nan'an district of Chongqing pulling down the statue from a podium covered in flowers.</p>
              <p>"The investigation determined the park's content was vulgar and that it was neither healthy nor educational," an official was quoted as saying.</p>
              <p>"It had an evil influence on society and had to be torn down immediately."</p>
              <p>He Shizhong, head of the municipal publicity department, said the company behind the park had "ignored its social responsibility and was interested only in profiting from sensationalism," the paper reported.</p>
              <p>Images of the park's content found their way on the Internet last week and sparked widespread debate and controversy, with the majority of comment opposed to the site.</p>
              <p>But some people expressed disappointment that the park had been torn down.</p>
              <p>"The park was above board, so why was it pulled down? How can a country get powerful if it doesn't open its mind?" one person was quoted as saying in the newspaper.</p>
