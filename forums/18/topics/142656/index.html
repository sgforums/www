I lost my virginity to a guy I knew for only a week. I was an unwilling partner but did not press charges. It was the same with the second guy. I have also slept with my cousin, and my future brother-in-law.<br><br>None of my close friends and my family know about all this. They don't even know that I'm no longer a virgin.<br><br>Recently, I was raped by two men on the same night. They were my close friends, but they betrayed my trust. I was physically and mentally affected but I did not seek medical help and did not report it to the police.<br><br>I want a normal life. I want to worry about grades, about my social life, about school work, and be in a relationship with decent guys my age.<br><br>I don't want to worry about sexual relationships, financial issues, family matters, pregnancy or about getting a sexually-transmitted disease.<br><br>Some female friends I've told my life story to either look down on me or totally avoid me, and they blame me for whatever has happened.<br><br>I have no one to turn to and can't trust anyone.<br><br>I feel I've lost everything - my virginity, my friends, my dignity and pride, my self-respect, my confidence. I feel cheap and used. I want to change and stop all this but don't know how.<br><br>What can I do? -- Lost<br><br>A I'm so very sorry that so many bad things have happened to you, and others have betrayed your trust in them.<br><br>All of us would like a normal and happy family life. But isn't 'normal' what you make of it?<br><br>Even though there is nothing you can do about the past, there is a lot more you can do to ensure that situations do not repeat themselves, and that you can take steps to eventually achieve the goals you have set for yourself.<br><br>The issue which is of grave concern is the one about men intimidating you into having sex. What message are you giving if you allow them to threaten you to get what they want? I think it is time to get help from your family and even confide in your mother to gain her support.<br><br>You may want to consider alerting the police too.<br><br>With regards to the other issues in your letter, you have made a wish list which seems clear and simple enough to follow. I guess the next step is to find strategies to achieve them.<br><br>So, what is stopping you? Sometimes, coming up with a list of 'wants' is just the first step. You will need to follow through with some action.<br><br>If all of this seems too difficult, which is possible when you feel like you are drowning in non-stop problems, consult a professional counsellor who can help you break it down to simpler steps to work on.<br><br>The only good thing about being in the pits is that there is only one way out, and that is up.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
