            <div class='col-md body'>Dude first ur wife's telling u she's the kwai type of woman and now after 10yrs of marriage u find out she's actually quite kinky, whats up with that? Personally i feel u should ask urself can u handle ur wifey's confession, if u can thats wonderful, pls continue to have many, many more great years of sex wif her.<br><br>If u can't hack the fact that actually ur better half is actually quite a wild one,me thinks U should think abt why did she lie in the first plc. Maybe she was afraid that u couldn't handle the truth? It might leave a bad impression nd scare u off?  I've always believed in telling the truth, i'm very open-minded and i don't want the past to come back to haunt me and i'll confess everything to a girl before she decides if she wants to have a realtionship wif me.(Usually involves she picking up her jaw from the floor and a few min's of blank stares to let the info sink in.) The sad fact is that some guys aren't that open-minded, 10yrs of marriage huh, hum so i'm guessing ur abt late 30s to early 40s? Are males of that generation less open abt women being sexually active?(Hey i'm guessing, so pls don't flame me.) But i do think that ur wife found a "good catch" and didn't what she did in the past affect her chances.</div>
