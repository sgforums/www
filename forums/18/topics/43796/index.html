            <div class='col-md body'>How to Choose Sports Bras<br><br>The most important piece of clothing a woman can wear is a sports bra. A good-fitting bra will provide support and comfort; a poor-fitting sports bra will not only be uncomfortable, but can cause permanent breast tissue damage.<br><br>Step 1: Determine Your Activity<br><br>Taking your body type into consideration (whether you're small-, medium- or large-breasted), choose a sports bra designed for either low-, medium- or high-impact activities.<br>Low-impact activities include hiking, cycling, weight training and yoga.<br><br>Medium-impact activities include fast walking, skiing and inline skating.<br><br>High-impact activities include running, aerobics and mountain biking.<br><br>Step 2: Types of Sports Bras<br><br>Shimmels are tank tops with an integral shelf bra that provides support for low- or medium-impact activities.<br><br>Compression sports bras use the stretch of the fabric for support and come in two basic options. Scoop-back styles work well for small- and medium-breasted women during low- or medium-impact activities. Racer-back styles are more supportive and are for medium- and high-impact activities.<br><br>Encapsulation-style sports bras separate and support to avoid the "uni-boob" look. They provide larger-breasted women excellent support for medium- and high-impact activities.<br><br>Step 3: Features to Consider<br><br>It's smart to equip yourself with several different styles of sports bras for different activitiesÂ—some with more support for high-impact activities, and some less constrictive ones for low-impact activities. Consider the following features:<br>Wicking and breathability are important to move moisture away from your skin and keep you comfortable during aerobic activities. The more supportive a sports bra is, the less effective it will be at wicking moisture because of sturdier fabric and construction.<br><br>A wide band around the bottom is necessary for high-impact activities since it provides more support than narrow bands.<br><br>Wide shoulder straps provide more support and are less likely to cut into your shoulders during high-impact activities.<br><br>Step 4: Test for Fit<br><br>Sports bras should fit tighter than regular bras, but they shouldn't be uncomfortable. When trying on a sports bra, check the following things:<br>There should be no chafing around the armholes, shoulder straps or seams. If the sports bra has hooks or snaps, make sure those don't chafe, either.<br><br>The straps shouldn't dig into your shoulders.<br><br>To make sure you have the right size, raise your hands over your head. If the elastic band moves up your rib cage, you need a smaller size.<br><br>Test the bra's support by jumping or running in place. You'll be able to feel whether it's sufficiently supportive or not.<br><br></div>

A good-fitting bra will provide support and comfort; a poor-fitting sports bra will not only be uncomfortable, but can cause permanent breast tissue damage.<br><br>Step 1: Determine Your Activity<br><br>Taking your body type into consideration (whether you're small-, medium- or large-breasted), choose a sports bra designed for either low-, medium- or high-impact activities.<br>Low-impact activities include hiking, cycling, weight training and yoga.<br><br>Medium-impact activities include fast walking, skiing and inline skating.<br><br>High-impact activities include running, aerobics and mountain biking.<br><br>Step 2: Types of Sports Bras<br><br>Shimmels are tank tops with an integral shelf bra that provides support for low- or medium-impact activities.<br><br>Compression sports bras use the stretch of the fabric for support and come in two basic options. Scoop-back styles work well for small- and medium-breasted women during low- or medium-impact activities. Racer-back styles are more supportive and are for medium- and high-impact activities.<br><br>Encapsulation-style sports bras separate and support to avoid the "uni-boob" look. They provide larger-breasted women excellent support for medium- and high-impact activities.<br><br>Step 3: Features to Consider<br><br>It's smart to equip yourself with several different styles of sports bras for different activitiesÂ—some with more support for high-impact activities, and some less constrictive ones for low-impact activities. Consider the following features:<br>Wicking and breathability are important to move moisture away from your skin and keep you comfortable during aerobic activities. The more supportive a sports bra is, the less effective it will be at wicking moisture because of sturdier fabric and construction.<br><br>A wide band around the bottom is necessary for high-impact activities since it provides more support than narrow bands.<br><br>Wide shoulder straps provide more support and are less likely to cut into your shoulders during high-impact activities.<br><br>Step 4: Test for Fit<br><br>Sports bras should fit tighter than regular bras, but they shouldn't be uncomfortable. When trying on a sports bra, check the following things:<br>There should be no chafing around the armholes, shoulder straps or seams. If the sports bra has hooks or snaps, make sure those don't chafe, either.<br><br>The straps shouldn't dig into your shoulders.<br><br>To make sure you have the right size, raise your hands over your head. If the elastic band moves up your rib cage, you need a smaller size.<br><br>Test the bra's support by jumping or running in place. You'll be able to feel whether it's sufficiently supportive or not.<br><br></div></blockquote>Are you wearing 1?</div>
