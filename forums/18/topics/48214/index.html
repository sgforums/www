            <div class='col-md body'>What's the phsychological background of an SPG/local women and caucasian expat? Why do some local women go for white guys over asian?<br><br>I believe they are as follows.<br><br>Caucasian, either or all of below<br>wants a PR<br>wants to know what ladies from the far east tastes like<br>wants company while on overseas trip (most got no<br>intention to settle down)<br>thinks that asian girls are easy, which I don't deny<br>some ARE at the sight of a white man (S.L.U.T).<br>thinks asian guys are at the bottom of the food chain.<br><br>SPG/local women, either or all of below<br>thinks its cool to hang our with a white male<br>thinks her caucasian bf's gonna bring her far far away<br>to disneyland.<br>thinks he's more romantic<br>thinks asian guys are at the bottom of the food chain.<br><br>Am I jealous? I don't deny to a certain extend that caucasians are sharing a portion of my pie.<br><br>What pisses me of is how they are exploiting our local ladies.. being if they are SPG or not.<br><br>Though there are some asian/caucasian couples happily married, there are IMO more Singaporean women being exploited by caucasian expats.<br><br>A couple of my female friends(rather hot looking in my opinion) that dates foreigners and ended up jilted again and again when they "have to go back home". Now, they are in their 30's and are not married yet(probably too late for them by now). Could they have been street wise and realistic, they would have been married with children by now.<br><br>What pains me is seeing the cream of our crop, being eaten by vultures and the core of the fruit being thrown back at us local guys.<br><br>Don't believe me? Try logging on to a caucasian/american/european forum and see what they are talking among themselves...<br><br>When I was studying in States, had a conversation with a redneck(american version of ah beng). He told me that "Oh, you're from Singaopre? Singapore girls give good blowjob!" How degrading can that be? So much for our hospitality for the white people. This also concludes that local ladies cannot differentiate between a redneck and a caucasian. So long as its white, its gotta be gold.<br><br>In my opinion, I think a large majority of professional caucasians living in Singapore are pretty cocky. I got no proof to back that up, only experiences.<br><br>I would like to call up to all Singapore males to open up their eyes, don't be oblivious to this situation..... TOGETHER, we can prevent Singapore from being a pick-up point and a w.h.o.r.e house for all these white thrashes.<br><br>Come on guys, the sight of a caucasian man and an asian girl is nothing to laugh about. Would you all want a society with caucasians being the alpha male?<br><br>It is our responsibility to show our girls love, concern, and care. We know our ladies better than a foreigner. There's nothing to be afraid of. All we need to do is to lift a finger. If not, in no time, the cream of our crop will all be taken over by foreigners.<br><br>IMO, foreigners should not be viewed as exotic. Rather, their difference in culture and thinking could make them rather dull.<br><br>ya'll white people..I can read your mind, I can see it through your eyes....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  but for all the Caucasian people with a heart...peace out.<br><br>And for those local women who are happily married to their white counterparts, that donÂ’t mean that those married to local guys are any less than you even if you might be speaking with a 5 year old accent.<br></div>
