            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large"><strong>Thru The Rapist's Eyes</strong></span></span><br>You may be well-aware of the recent rape case happened to a student who<br>was being followed by a man and she fell from the stairwalk, hurt, backbone<br>broken and still being raped by the rapist under the stairway. This was all happened in day time at 2.30pm!! So, please read on this message. A group of rapists and date rapists in prison were interviewed on what they look for in a potential victim and here are some interesting facts:<br><br>(A) WHO<br>(1) The first thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle. They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed. They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair. Women with short hair are not common targets.<br><br>(2) The second thing men look for is clothing. They will look for women who's clothing is easy to remove quickly. Many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing.<br><br>(3) They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered.<br><br>(B) WHERE<br>(1) The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the early morning, between 5:00a.m. and 8:30a.m.<br><br>(2) The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store.<br><br>(3) Number two is office parking lots/garages.<br><br>(4) Number three is public restrooms/toilets.<br><br>The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry about getting caught. Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years. If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isn't worth it because it will be time-consuming. These men said they would not pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that can be used from a distance, in their hands. Keys<br>are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon. So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth<br>it.<br><br>HOW ?<br>Several defense mechanisms he taught us are:<br>(1) If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with<br>you in an elevator or stairwalk, look them in the face and ask them questions like " what time is it? My friends are supposed to be here 10 minutes ago." etc. This is to show that your friends are on the way, so it's not worth for him to take the risk. Secondly, it shows that you're a CONFIDENT person and you're not the type that look timid and can be easily take over. Thirdly, now you've seen their face and could identify them in a line-up if they are caught. So, with this you lose appeal as a target to these rapists.<br><br>(2) If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you and yell "Stop or Stay back!". Most of the rapists this man talked to said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back. Again, they are looking for an EASY target.<br><br>(3) If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it and he also carries pepper spray with him wherever he goes,) yell to the rapist: "I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY!!" and holding it out will be a deterrent.<br><br>(4) If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you can by<br>outsmarting them. If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh - HARD. This instructor was told by a woman in his class of defence, said that she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and the rapist was so upset as she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands!! - the guy needed stitches. Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it; it hurts.<br><br>(5) If you slap a guy's parts it is extremely painful. You might think that you'll anger the guy and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble.<br><br>(6) When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible. The instructor did it to me without using much pressure, and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly.<br><br>IN ALL CASES, DO NOT PANIC!!<br>By the way, it is also worth to leave scratched mark on the rapist any part of his body for easy identifcation if he is caught. Of course the things we always hear still apply. Always be aware of your surroundings, take someone with you, eg to the toilet, to the car park, if possible if you can and if you see any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts. You may feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was a trouble.<br><br>PLEASE READ THEN FORWARD THIS TO ANY WOMAN YOU KNOW, OR TO GUYS THAT HAVE A WIFE, DAUGHTER, OR GIRLFRIEND. AND TO YOUR SONS-AS YOUNGSTERS ARE NOW TEMPTED BY THE WORLD AND THEY COULD BE LURED BY FRIENDS AND INVOLVE IN DATE RAPE/GANG RAPE. TEACH YOUR SONS/MEN TO RESPECT WOMEN. SO, PLSE SEND OUT<br>-<br>IT'S SIMPLE STUFF THAT COULD SAVE A LIFE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MANZINI, Swaziland - Bus conductors in Swaziland vowed on Friday to assault and rape female passengers who wore miniskirts, sparking outrage among womenÂ’s groups in the conservative African kingdom.<br><br>The threat followed this weekÂ’s arrest of two conductors and a bus driver who were charged with indecently assaulting an 18-year-old high school student.<br><br>The student was attacked at a bus rank in Manzini, SwazilandÂ’s commercial center, by a group of men who shouted at her for wearing a miniskirt, cut it off and then gang-raped her, witnesses told local media.<br><br>Dangerous showdown<br>About 1,000 women marched on the bus rank on Thursday to protest against the attack. They were met by bus crews carrying signs reading: Â“WeÂ’ll get them with our brushesÂ”Â—a reference to the reported use of a brush handle in the rape.<br><br>Â“We will teach these women respect. We will fix them with our brush handles,Â” Simon Ndwandwe, a bus conductor from Manzini, said at the bus rank on Friday.<br><br>A bus conductor calling himself only Licandza said: Â“Women who wear miniskirts want to be raped, and we will give them what they want.Â”<br><br>The bus drivers banned miniskirts on buses earlier in the year, saying they were distracting and encouraging lustful thoughts.<br><br>Although there have been incidents of women having their clothes ripped off at the bus rank, this was the first reported case of rape. There have been no reports of similar attacks on women at other bus ranks in the kingdom.<br><br>Fighting back<br>Â“This is madness. This has no place in modern society,Â” said Nomhlanhla Dlamini, director of a local NGO, the Swaziland Action Group Against Abuse.<br><br>Dlamini said three women had since come forward to her group to report being raped at the bus rank earlier this year.<br><br>Â“We are talking to the bus owners. We want them to make a code of conduct. We are urging the Road Transportation Board to revoke the operating licenses of the involved buses,Â” she said.<br><br>The kingdom does not have a state transport system and relies on privately owned minibus taxis to fill the gap.<br><br>Police, who were criticized by the studentÂ’s grandmother for being slow to arrive on the scene, said they would be vigilant in case of a repeat of the incident.<br><br>Â“No one has a right to harass anyone because of what the person is wearing,Â” Superintendent Vusie Masuku said.<br><br>Swazi women generally wear modern Western clothing and have worn miniskirts since the 1960s, although the government at one stage considered banning them on moral grounds.<br><br>Some tribal chiefs, however, do ban women wearing miniskirts in their traditional areas.<br><br>Systemic discrimination<br>The governor of the royal village Ludzidzini, the most powerful traditional figure in the kingdom, has stopped women from wearing trousers in the village and at the royal palaces.<br><br>Speakers at ThursdayÂ’s protest said the attack was symptomatic of a society that discriminated against women.<br><br>Â“There is a connection between customs that say we cannot own property or be parties to legal contracts, and bus conductors who want to dominate us by telling us what to wear,Â” said one speaker.<br><br>The government said it condemned the crime.<br><br>Â“What the young woman was subjected to could be tantamount to murder, as the health status of the perpetrators is not known,Â” Prime Minister Themba Dlamini said.<br><br>Swaziland, a small country tucked between South Africa and Mozambique that is ruled by sub-Saharan AfricaÂ’s last absolute monarch, has one of the highest rates of AIDS in the world.</div>
