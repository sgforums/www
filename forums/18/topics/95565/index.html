            <div class='col-md body'>No offences... Sorry to those whom it may offend... Found tis article on a website n found it interestin... The article is as follow:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Rapes and molests are still high. A few thoughts that may help a victim.<br><br>A gutsy woman saved herself from rape at Yishun recently because she wore the right clothes and did the right things. She wore jeans that were difficult to strip, made a lot of noise. She kicked and fought back.<br><br>She attracted enough attention to force him to give up and got arrested.<br><br>It reminded me of a e-mail advice I received from a friend recently on what a victim can do to minimise and beat off an attacker.<br><br>It involves an interview with a group of rapists (including date rapists) in prison on what they look for in a potential victim.<br><br>The first thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle. They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid, or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed. They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair. Women with short hair are not common targets.<br><br>The second thing men look for is clothing. They will look for women whose clothing is easy to remove quickly. The preferred choice is overalls because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut.<br><br>They choose the time when the women are using their hand phone, searching through their purse or preoccupied with other activities while walking because they are off-guard and can be easily overpowered.<br><br>The rapist looks to grab a woman in a deserted spot, quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry about getting caught. Only 2 per cent said they carried weapons because rape carries a 3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years.<br>If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realise that going after you isn't worth it because it is risky and time-consuming.<br><br>Rapists said they would not pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that could be used as a weapon to fight back. Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon. So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it.<br><br>Several considerations are:<br>* If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage, or with you in an elevator or stairwell, look them in the face and ask them a question, like what time is it, or make general small talk, I can't believe the traffic is so bad or something like that. Now you've seen their face and could identify them in a lineup, you lose some appeal as a target.<br><br>* If someone is coming towards you and you strongly suspect his intention, hold out your hands in front of you and yell "Stop" or "Stay back!" Most rapists said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back. They are looking for an EASY target. If you carry pepper spray (useful to carry it) hold it out as a deterrent.<br><br>* If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you can try to outsmart them. If they grab your wrist, pull your wrist back so your hand is in waving position (palm facing forward) and twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away. It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way. They stumble towards you and you stumble back, so you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the forehead, nose or teeth.<br><br>* If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh - HARD. One woman used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands - the guy needed stitches. Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it; it hurts.<br><br>* After the initial hit, always go for the groin. It is extremely painful. Some women are afraid that it will anger the man and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing these rapists told the interviewer that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble. Start causing trouble, and he's out of there.<br><br>* When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible.<br><br>* Always be aware of your surroundings, take someone with you if you can, and if you see any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts. You may feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble.<br>Feb 27, 2001<br></div>

She thought she was locked up.. climbed the fence, but fell over.. passed out.<br>Got into the house, next thing she knew, her boyfriend was home with blood all over himself. No clue at all.. not even any memory of signing his credit card out of the bar..<br>Man... i am not going into that club anytime... at all.</div>
