            <div class='col-md body'>i notice that... many guys in this forum really like to boast abt their sizes, but who knows if they just have a small one. and some guys even feel very embarrased coz their dick is small, i myself also used to feel like that, the fact is it is not as small as u think it is. let me share with u guys...<br>the different of my flaccid and erect dick is quite big, when its flaccid it can be as small as a young boy's but when its erected it has a normal length of 5 inch. the first time when i were asked by my gf to show her my dick i was so afraid, i know that she will be disappointed for sure. then i asked her is it small or not? she said its ok, but make sure ur dick can erect! and even more important is it must be real hard... since that i got the key oredi, women dun mind if we men dun have a very long dick, but it must be hard and skill is important too. so for those guys who still lack of confident, dun let it bother u too much, when we are feeling cold or "less horny" its normal that our dick become rather small, get a gf and start ur life.</div>
