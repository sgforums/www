            <div class='col-md body'><strong>But Lill remained silent as Kimi rubbed her hands up and down Lills back, feeling the soft skin. She dared to try more. Kimi moved her hands lower, the lower back. Lower still, Kimi placed her hands onto Lills tight ass, she must work out, and gave a gentle squeeze.<br><br>Lill gasped in surprise and Kimi broke away instantly. Out of the fire of her passion that had caught her up in the moment, embarrassment was beginning to douse the flames. Lill slid backwards into the wall and Kimi stared at the floor, her face growing hot with embarrassment.<br>"Lill I'm so sorry." She said in a shaky voice. "I don't know what came over me. I'm sorry."<br><br>Lill stared at Kimi with wide eyes and an open mouth. Kimi had just felt her up. But what freaked her out was the fact that it wasn't freaking her out.<br>"I...Kimi, I...liked it."<br><br>Kimi stared at her. Did Lill just say what she thought she said?<br>"What?" She asked dumbfounded. Lill leaned forward and gently gripped Kimi's hand and lifted it up and laid it onto her breast. Kimi pulled it away and looked at Lill like she'd gone insane.<br>"I thought you weren't gay." She challenged. Lill nodded.<br>"I'm not." She Took Kimi's hand and laid it onto her breast again. "But I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I was more than a little curious."<br><br>Kimi couldn't think, what was Lill trying to imply? She knew the answer but it was like her brain was split into two the side in control had all the questions and the other side had all the answers and wouldn't give them.<br>"I don't... I mean...we... I've never." Kimi said in an endless stream of garbled words. Lill put a finger to her lips and Kimi fell silent.<br>"You've never been with a girl have you?" She asked gently. Kimi blushed brightly and nodded her head. Lill smiled leaned in close.<br>"Neither have I." She whispered and kissed Kimi on the cheek.<br><br>Kimi pulled back and stared at Lill, she had kissed her. Lill had really kissed her and she had liked it. Lill stared back, her whole body trembling with a mixture of nervousness and excitement. The two girls leaned their heads toward each other, tilting to avoid noses. Their lips connected and Kimi felt a fire erupt inside of her. She was really doing it; she was kissing a girl and t felt so right to her.<br><br>She wrapped her arms around Lill and pulled her close. Her hands exploring Lill's naked flesh. The curve of her back, the softness of her shoulders. She squeezed Lill's ass and Lill gasped, not from surprise, but excitement this time.<br><br>Lill took her own steps. Kimi felt something pushing against her lips, it was Lill's tongue and she opened her mouth to accommodate it. Lill slid inside and the two lovers mouth wrestled. Lill held onto Kimi tightly as if loosening her grip for half a second would make the girl disappear.<br><br>Suddenly Kimi found her clothes too hot and tight. She felt uncomfortable in them and wanted to tear the garments away from her body. Was this how Lill felt all of the time? She didn't have the mind to explore the question. As much as she didn't want to Kimi pushed Lill away. Lill stared at her in shock, thinking that Kimi was abandoning their lovemaking. She smiled again when Kimi began to pull her clothes away.</strong><br><br>the following is a femslash adult fanf fiction of the cartoon "All grown up" titled "All grown up and how" written by "englishwitch"...<br><br>Please don't let Bar die T_T</div>
