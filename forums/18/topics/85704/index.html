The other few car next to me also saw these and all of us were shocked and it took us a while to drive off even after the lights turned green. And she didn't even lift a finger to pull her skirt, somemore turn back and look at us with smiling face.<br><br>So, do gers nowadays think it is fashionable to show as much panties as possible ? Or should I say wear as little panties as possible and show it.<br><br>I notice lately that gers (mostly ladies in their thirties) don't bother to cross their legs anymore when they sit, some even spread it a little, if you pay attention as you drive along the roads you will see them at the bus stops in the morning/evening rush hours, or during lunch time at hawker centres try sitting opposite a lady in mini skirts, I assure you will see something when she sit, or when she is about to stand or try to cross her legs.<br><br>School girls are oso very chio, some don't even wear panty, got see only malay girl in uniform at fast food chain sitting leg open and below lips smiling at whoever want  to see.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br></div>

Let newbee uncle tell you wat I saw which I call purposely.<br><br>About two weeks ago at the junction of Shenton Way and "Lau Pah Sat" I was in my car at the first row waiting for the traffic lights to turn green. As the "Green Man" started to flash, a lady about 24 yr in a very short black mini skirt with a slit up her left thigh, begin to run from my right to the left, as she ran her skirt flapped backward showing the whole front of privates, she was wearing a very transparent white panties, and I swear you could see every single hair down there.
