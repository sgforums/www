            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The 3 Chinese Tortures</strong><br><br>A young man is wandering, lost, in a forest when he comes upon a small<br>house. Knocking on the door he is greeted by an ancient Chinese man<br>with a<br>long gray beard. "I'm lost," said the man. "Can you put me up for the<br>night?" "Certainly," the Chinese man said, "but one condition. If you<br>so<br>much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three<br>worst<br>Chinese tortures known to man." "OK," said the man, thinking that the<br>daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.<br><br>Over dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful<br>and<br>had a fantastic body. She was obviously attracted to the young man as<br>she<br>couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old<br>man's<br>warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. During the night he<br>could<br>bear it no longer and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He<br>was<br>careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near<br>dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.<br><br>When he woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a<br>large rock on his chest with a note on it that read: "Chinese Torture<br>#1:<br>Large rock on chest."<br><br>"Well, that's pretty crappy," he thought. "If that's the best the old<br>man<br>can do then I don't have much to worry about.." He picked the boulder<br>up,<br>walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so, he<br>noticed another note on it that read: "Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to<br>left<br>testicle."<br><br>In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting<br>close<br>to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration he<br>jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted towards the<br>ground he saw a large sign on the ground that read: "Chinese Torture 3:<br>Right testicle tied to bed post."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Shot the Dog</strong><br><br>One day, during a holdup at a bank, a young woman pregnant with<br>triplets was<br>shot 3 times by the bandit. She was taken to a hospital, found to be in<br>good<br>condition, and since there was no threat to her life or to the fetuses,<br>was<br>allowed to continue her pregnancy. The bullets were left in place. All<br>went<br>well and the woman delivered her triplets without a problem. 15 years<br>later,one of the children came to his mother and said, "I just had a<br>scary<br>thing happen. I peed and a bullet came out." His mother then told him<br>about<br>the event when she was pregnant. Two weeks later, the second of the<br>triplets<br>told his mother that an unusual thing happened. "Yes," she said,"I<br>know, you<br>had a bullet in your urine." And she told him about the shooting event.<br>Several weeks later the third came to his mother and was very upset.<br>"Something horrible has just happened," he said. "You had a bullet in<br>your<br>urine?" said his mother. "NO" he replied. "I was upstairs masturbating<br>and I<br>think I shot the dog!!!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Inventions</strong><br><br>Henry Ford dies and goes to heaven. At the gates, an angel tells Ford,<br>"Well, you've been such a good guy and your invention --- the assembly<br>line<br>for the automobile --- changed the world. As a reward, you can hang out<br>with<br>anyone you want to in Heaven." Ford thinks about it and says, "I wanna<br>hang<br>out with God, Himself." The befeathered fellow at the Gate takes Ford<br>to the<br>Throne Room and introduces him to God. Henry Ford then asks God, "Hey,<br>aren't you the inventor of Woman?" God says, "Ah, yes." "Well," says<br>Ford,<br>"You have some major design flaws in your invention<br>1. There's too much front end protrusion<br>2. It chatters at high speeds<br>3. The rear end wobbles too much, and<br>4. The intake is placed too close to the exhaust."<br>"Hmmm..." replies God, "hold on." God goes to the Celestial<br>Supercomputer,<br>types in a few keystrokes, and waits for the result. The computer<br>prints out<br>a slip of paper and God reads it. "It may be that my invention is<br>flawed,"<br>God replies to Henry Ford, "but according to My Computer, more men are<br>riding my invention than yours."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE TALE OF THE VOODOO DICK.</strong><br><br>There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long<br>business<br>trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try<br>to get<br>her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't<br>much<br>like the idea of her screwing someone else.<br>So he went to a store that sold sex toys and looked around. He thought<br>about<br>a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him.<br>He was<br>browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please<br>his<br>wife, and started talking to the man behind the counter.<br>He explained his situation. The old man said, "Well, I don't really<br>know of<br>anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special<br>attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her<br>occupied for weeks, except -- " and his voice trailed off.<br>"Except what?" the man asked.<br>"Nothing, nothing."<br>"C'mon, tell me! I need something!"<br>"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the voodoo<br>dick.'"<br>"So what's up with this voodoo dick?" he asked.<br>The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden<br>box,<br>carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very<br>ordinary<br>looking dildo.<br>The businessman laughed, and said "Big fucking deal. It looks like<br>every<br>other dildo in this shop!"<br>The old man replied, "But you haven't seen what it'll do yet." He<br>pointed to<br>a door and said "Voodoo dick, the door." The voodoo dick rose out of<br>its<br>box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The<br>whole<br>door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle.<br>Before the door could split, the man said "Voodoo dick, get back in<br>your<br>box!"<br>And the voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there,<br>quiescent once more.<br>"I'll take it!" said the businessman.<br>The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally agreed<br>to<br>$700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a<br>special<br>dildo and tha! t to use it, all she had to do was say "Voodoo dick, my<br>pussy."<br>He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was<br>gone.<br>After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She<br>thought<br>of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she<br>remembered<br>the voodoo dick! She took it out, and said "Voodoo dick, my pussy!"<br>The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was a<br>religious<br>experience - she'd never experienced anything like this before!<br>However. after three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried<br>to<br>pull it out. But it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and<br>tried<br>to get rid of the damn thing, but nothing worked. Her husband had<br>forgot to<br>tell her how to shut it off.<br>So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put<br>her<br>clothes on, got in the car and drove to the hospital, quivering with<br>every<br>thrust of the dildo.<br>On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she<br>was<br>pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked<br>how<br>much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she<br>hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy,<br>and<br>wouldn't stop screwing.<br>The officer looked at her for a second, and then said "Yeah Right -<br>VOODOO<br>DICK MY ASS!!!!"<br></div>

Now go to your room for two hours. When<br>you<br>come down, you may play with your trains as long as you use proper<br>language."<br>Two hours later, the mother was still working in the kitchen when her<br>son<br>came out of his room and resumed playing with his trains. The train<br>stopped<br>and the mother heard, "All passengers who are disembarking the train,<br>please<br>remember to take all of your belongings. We thank you for riding with<br>us<br>today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. For those just boarding,<br>we ask<br>you to stow your hand luggage under the seat and we hope you enjoy your<br>trip.
