              <p><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Looking at the time displayed on my company's laptop, it reads close to 8.35pm. Taking a quick curious glance over the top of my cubicle, it dawned on me that I am the only no-lifer left in the office; that's the term my friends constantly use on me. Quick check on my Outlook hinted that I could leave whatever that is left of my tasks for the next day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">As I stretched and yawned loudly to signal the commencement of my freedom after hours of tiring labour, an ever so familiar voice immediately made me froze in record time. Turning to the direction where the voice came from, a few cubicles from where I am seated, I was corrected of the thought that I was alone. A petite girl, looking around mid 20ish had all the while been hidden in her cubicle by the oversized company jacket that was perched atop her armchair.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Engulfed by the quantity of work that was assigned to me, I must have overlooked her presence. I guess she was on the phone with her parents as I overheard something about coming home late and telling them there’s no need to reserve dinner for her. We had only exchanged a few glances and ‘Hi’ over the course of my 6 months in this new MNC I am working for.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Being the curious guy that I am, I walked over to her desk on the pretense that I am just passing by her desk on the way to the vending machine. I faked noticing her and for the first time I spoke to her with a full sentence, not just 'Hi'.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Hey hi, you are working late too?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Even though as if she gotten a shock by someone jumping out of the dark scaring her, the expression on her face was quite cute.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Oh.. hi. Umm.. yea, got to finish converting these data to charts for the meeting tomorrow.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Looking at me with an unfamiliar expression on her face gave me a hint that I hadn’t actually properly introduced myself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Haha, sorry for being a total stranger. I forgot that we haven’t been introduced properly. I’m Chris. We’ve actually exchanged a few Hi’s”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Smiling at me “I remember because you always walk by my cubicle every morning, and I guess you know my name since there’s a label on the cubicle. Umm.. I have to finish some work.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Just being my usual self, without a notion of being flirty I offered to wait for her to finish her work giving an excuse that I am waiting for an email before I could go off. She accepted my offer, I took my laptop over and pulled a chair to sit next to her while admiring her concentration towards her work.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I thought of how lucky I am to be given the chance to actually speak to her. I have a bad reputation when it comes to having no luck with women due to my very young looks despite me being in my mid-20s. The pin-drop silence of the vacant office didn’t help to conceal what was probably the most embarrassing event which is about to take place. My iPhone rang notifying me of a newly received SMS. Innocently, she turned and looked at the source of the noise and gazed long enough to absorb the contents of the SMS.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Hey fuckface, it’s been like forever since we heard you got laid. Wanna hangout for drinks and see if lady luck is smiling upon you?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I fumbled for the ‘Close’ button as though my life depended on it and quickly pick up the phone from the desk. I looked blankly at her as if it was helping me to gather whatever leftover respect she has towards me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Hehe, that was a cute message. Do boys normally talk like that to each other?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">She caught me off-guard with her nonchalant reply as I was worried about the kind of expression she might have towards me after knowing that my friend converse in such a way with me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Haha, you know. Long time buddies usually talk like that.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">She gave me a cheeky smile and continued with her work. If my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me, I am sure she was still smiling while facing her laptop.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I busy with my iPhone this time on Facebook and without noticing the time, she stood up, did a stretch. I was treated to a full frontal view of her pleasant petite figure, nicely shaped waist and an okay sized breast. The semi-transparent white office blouse she was wearing paired with her black pen skirt did little to hide the black brassiere underneath. Her slim figure accompanied by her nicely shaped bust and buttocks aroused me a little but I managed to subdue the dirty thoughts of office affair that was brewing within my mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Finished already?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Not yet, just a little more. You sure you don’t want to go home first? Very late already hor.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I looked at the time on my iPhone, it displayed 9.20pm.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“You also know how to say late, how can let a girl stay in office alone at this hour?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Somehow, the ice broke itself between us. I guess I have to thank my friend for the SMS. It feels easier to have a conversation with her now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“I am going to get some drinks from the vending machine outside, you want any drinks?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Green tea please.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I came back with the drinks and pop open the can for her. I noticed that she already had all the programs closed and only a clear Windows 7 desktop can be seen on her laptop.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Finally done already huh?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Yup, finally done. Now can relax, and I think I’ll come in later tomorrow.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Like the SMS earlier, the silence of the empty office didn’t help but rather enhanced the rumbling of my very hungry stomach.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Haha, I heard that. Want to order something to eat? Lazy want to go out, can straightaway take cab go home after this.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It is understandable as our company is located in Ang Mo Kio industrial area, and the closest food outlet is a good 5 minute drive away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> We sat around, sipping our drinks, waiting for our delivery while gossiping about the weird people in our office, the horrible bosses and overlord clients. She laughed comfortably as if she was having a good chat with an old friend. It was long before our gossip session got interrupted by yet another SMS by my friend.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Eh, so wanna hang out and try your luck tonight or not? I’m feeling lucky tonight man! Maybe you can finally get laid, lol!!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I totally forgot about replying my friend. Not knowing how to reply and especially after she once again saw the embarrassing SMS which my friend sent to me. I gazed at my phone until she broke the awkward silence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Tell you friend you have a dinner date and you might get lucky tonight even without his help.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Did my hearing deceive me? Am I hearing things correctly? Did she just gave me a hint that my fantasies of office affair might become reality? I reasoned with myself and doubted it, since girls here at home are usually conservative in nature when it comes to these kind of things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">However, I couldn't help but stared blankly at her. Surprised was probably written all over my face.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Tell you something.” She giggled. “My colleague was telling me about how you always walk by my cubicle every morning. She said you might be stealing glances at me.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">My mind totally went blank after that. I always thought I am prepared for all kinds of remarks thrown my way, but this time I was unprepared.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“So, is it true that you walk by just to make me notice you and are you stealing glances at me? Because the other entrance is nearer to your cubicle you know.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Haha, I guess you could say that. Now I know why there’s a saying that women have sixth sense.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“I kinda noticed you during my first week here because to be honest because you know.. here got more aunties than young ladies”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Hoping that my cheeky reply would ease the awkward air, she giggled. We remained silent for awhile and she said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“My neck is kind of sore after staring at the laptop for so long.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I took it as a hint that she is giving me the green light to have a physical contact with her.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Want a neck massage? I am not an expert but I should be able to squeeze necks”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">That came out wrong, I thought. She smiled and turned her back to face me while moving her waist length hair to the side. I stood up, told myself not to screw this up and started to gently squeeze her neck with my right hand while holding her left shoulder firmly with my left. She gave a soft moan and complimented me that it is not bad.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I proceed to massage her shoulders and tried my luck by bringing up the, me being lucky tonight question.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“So.. you said I might be lucky tonight. What does that mean?” Trying to sound as innocent as I could.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">She avoided my question and told me to massage her arms as she’s been typing a lot. I guess she was just joking about that reply she suggested earlier and didn’t want me to get bullied by my friend. I innocently lowered my hands to massage her upper arms. She leaned back and arched her head back resting on the armchair’s backrest. Standing behind her, I am treated to a pleasant tiny peek of her cleavage between the collar of her blouse and it got me fantasizing of the mounds beneath the blouse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">My fantasies got the better of me and without noticing, my other head is getting erected. I caught a glimpse of her eyes and noticed that she was looking at me. I quickly look away to her laptop pretending I didn’t just perversely look at her cleavage, but I guess it is too late as her head was arched back, my already hard-on crotch accidentally brushed against her head.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I hope she didn’t noticed. I withdrew my hand back from massaging her upper arms to get back to massaging her shoulders only to brush against the side of her breast making my hard-on even harder which is pressing against her head. Embarrassed and afraid she might noticed, I took a step back.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">She sat straight and turned to look at me, and I couldn’t help but stole a glance towards her bosom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Why are you looking at my blouse? is there something on it?” She asked innocently as she undid the top button of her blouse and folded the right side back a little to check on it. This time, I am able to see the top of her breast as she was still sitting and I am standing. Her actions isn’t helping me to subdue my hard-on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“I can’t see anything.” She undid another button from the top of the blouse. I knew at this point she was just pretending. I tried my luck yet again, naughtily suggesting</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Perhaps if you can have a better look if you took off your blouse”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">She glared at me playfully.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Why don’t you take it off for me?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Am I dreaming?! Is this really my luck tonight? I couldn’t believe it but I knew that if I didn’t take this chance, there might never be one again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Alright, if you insists” I reached out both my hands towards the third button from the top of her blouse, and slowly undid it. I couldn’t believe what is happening. My heart is racing super fast and tried to control my hands from shaking. As I was unbuttoning her fifth button from the top. She took hold both of my wrist and slipped my hands onto her breast from the top of her bra. I was fully erected this time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I gave her breast a gentle squeeze as she moved to hold my waist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“Let’s keep this as our secret okay?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I nodded in agreement and moved closer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We locked lips and our tongues explored each other. I undid the rest of the buttons and pull off her blouse. I fondled her breast and gently squeezed her erected nipples with my thumb and index finger. She let off a soft moan. I could felt her hands roaming to my crotch and unzipped my pants. She pushed my underwear aside and let loose my manhood, stroking it with her right hands while I unclasp her bra.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I took a slight step back to absorb the memorable view of this petite colleague of mine with her breast bare and right hands on my manhood still stroking it. She knelt down and to my surprise, took the whole of my manhood into her moist mouth. Her head bobbed in and out while twirling her tongue around the head of my manhood. Sucking on gently, audible slurps could be heard. My mind was running fast, my heart throbbing. Looking around to check for security guard or cleaners, there was none.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Feeling safe, I enjoyed every moment of this amazing blow-job. Feeling close to climax, I stopped her. Not wanting to end this night without even feeling her pink lips yet. Moved the laptop aside and sat her on the table. I pulled off her panty with ease and slid my finger on her already engorged clit. My index finger slid into her vagina while my thumb was rubbing her clit with gently rhythmic strokes. Her soft moans encouraged me to make her orgasm. Her breast was not spared. I sucked on her right nipples, my right hand fondling her left breast while my left hand continued to pleasure her luscious wet vagina.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I noticed that her breathing getting harder. I knew she was about to have an orgasm. I hasten the stroke on her clit and the rhythm of the fingering. She hugged my head tightly against her bosom and she moaned soon after signalling her climax with noticeable increased wetness in her vagina. I stopped and look at her panting. My finger still in her, feeling her vaginal muscle continued to contract and relaxed as her body twitched lightly with satisfaction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“That was the best massage I had in my life. Let’s finish this up before the delivery comes” she said naughtily as she tried to catch her breathe.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I positioned myself in front of her spreaded legs, ready to feel my manhood inside her luscious moist pink lips. As my manhood entered fully into her vagina, the phone suddenly rang. We jumped and got a shocked of our life; I pulled out from her and she hurried to get dressed while I answered the phone as I was zipping up my pants.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It was the delivery guy calling to inform me to collect the food and make payment at the guard house because he can’t come in. What a way to end such an erotic encounter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I went down to pay and collect our dinner. We laughed about what just happened and exchanged some naughty ideas. She cheekily reminded me again to keep this as our secret and hinted that my luck may fare better next time. The thought girls being conservative in Singapore flew out of my mind. I guess she was the rare few open minded and modern kind of women. Although I was scolding and blaming my bad luck, I guess it wasn’t all that bad since I was able to fulfill part of the fantasy..</span></p>
