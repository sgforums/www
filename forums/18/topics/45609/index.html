She is always like in a rush to somewhere or answer some call secretly. Finally i asked her what wrong, does she have a problem or something i can help.<br><br>Then she knew that i suspected something, she confessed to some shocking thing to me, She actually have a sexually affair with someone she met on the chatroom, when we are dating.
