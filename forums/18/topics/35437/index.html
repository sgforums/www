            <div class='col-md body'>Wah lau..... dunno wat people do in public toilet nowadays.<br>Here are some examples that i encountered.<br><br>(i)  Buona Vista MRT.  Years ago, when i was still student, i got off from mrt at Buona Vista to walk to school.  But becoz got nature call, so i go to toilet at mrt station.  I went into a cubicle to do my business, noticed the floor was wet, so could see a very vague reflection of the next cubicle.  And then i saw *omigod* someone jacking off himself in the reflection. No doubt, could clearly see the back and forth flashes in the reflection.  Wah piangz, how come liddat wan??!?!<br><br>(ii) Last week, was at Clementi mrt.  Wah paingz, this time can feel the shits coming, so i rush to the mrt toilet.  toilet got four cubicles, and three were occupied.  I went into the empty one but came out again, coz i realised there was no pang sai paper.  then i wait and wait outside, finally i heard a flush, and one guy came out from the second cubicle, i go in after him, but was disappointed coz this one also no pang sai paper.  Wah piangz, i pissed off liao, how come mrt toilet so lousy wan, no money to buy toilet paper meh?  Then it was at this moment that the first cubicle door unlocked and this indian guy came out, holding on tightly to his bag.  I push the cubicle door gently, and wanted to rush in liao, but was surprised that the door continue to close.  Then it hit me that, oh this toilet had doors that was installed with hydraulic dampers, so need to wait for it to fully close b4 can open again.  So as it closed, i was going to push it open again, when suddenly *click* the door was locked from inside.  -WHAT THE...?!?-  it dawned on me that that was ANOTHER person inside that cubicle.... how come got another person inside?!?!?  Eeeeeww...... yucks!!!!</div>
