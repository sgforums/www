Reports says that this model of the SeiFeiLous have not passed the testing and qualification stage on the hull and engine design. Mr Cooper of Nissin Corp however denies such a critic and is even on his way now on an appeal to the Court of Law. Our kaypoh reports caught up with Mr Coop while he is on the X-mas cum New Year holidays at Hotel Califoniamania in a Santa suit having fetish acts with his wife (who were dressed as a witch).<br><br>"Such acts are against the Law and the better of Nissin Corp!" says Herr Coop. "Nissin Corp has always been producing gut und reliable cars and we are always good with our braking systems! We specialize in fluid for brakes ya know! The reason why we released this new model to our consumers is because this design actually got the thumbs up and go-ahead green lights from the WDO - World Design Organization.<br><br>Our KPO reporters held a press conference this afternoon soon after the crash and got hold of Senior Station Inspector PJ Gam Gam from the TP department.<br><br>Â“Such a design of cars should be stopped! It was a good thing no one was hurt in this accident!Â” commented Mr Gam Gam. Â“ The department has every reason to believe that the too-creative design of this new SeiFeiLou was the root of the problem. It has two steering wheels which are too small even for a babyÂ’s hand to hold. Moreover, the whole machine is controlled by two gear meshing system. Having too many multiple inputs causes the car to loose control.Â” Added Mr Gam Gam.<br><br>As shown in our artistic photos taken by our good used-2-b-porno-photographers, the new car can be driven by 2 naked men with only one-hand control. No gear shifting is required on the driversÂ’ side. As you can see depicted in the photos, the gears are self-control and multiple inputs can be sent to the engine at any one time.<br><br>Since the following photo are too creative and may be unsuitable for minors, pls click on the following if u want to view the photos taken on model SeiFeiLou at prototype stage.<br><br><a href="http://www.sggirls.com/photos/sgGirls.com_-_00056759.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.sggirls.com/photos/sgGirls.com_-_00056759.jpg</a></div>
