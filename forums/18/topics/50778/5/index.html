            <div class='col-md body'>How's it going, ya'll?<br><br>Been some time since I posted.  Phew...  Heaps have been happening in my absence, aye?  Here are my views.<br><br>I'm glad homosexuals are finally being recognised.  Now I noticed how 99% of the arguments in the thread were towards male homosexuality.  Even though it wasn't sepcifically mentioned, it was implied very strongly.  Only near the end did we see someone mentioning about lesbians.  Does that imply the reality that lesbiansim or female homosexuality (homosexuality still) is more readily accepted?  That's somewhat biased, no?  Don't think I saw any ladies in the forum voicing out against lesbians.  And gee...  what do you know?  Groups like Tatu hit top charts, and some lady singing 'I kissed a girl' hits number one a few years back.  When was the last time we heard a guy sing 'I kissed a boy'?<br><br>Look, listen, homosexuals bleed red, and so do heterosexuals.  Who really (and I mean, really) said it was against nature?  Your mum?  Dad?  Pastor?  God?  Preacher?  Priest?  Teacher?  Government?  Friend?  Brother?  Sister?<br><br>Remember how the Afro-Amricans were discriminated?  They were treated like animals.  And even to this day, they're not equal.  Sure, life ain't fair.  But what would you say when you're being discrimanated against?  Trust me, it ain't nice.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
