            <div class='col-md body'>Let me tell u something abt a friend of mine. He is real man and we used to go called chicken. But a few years ago, he got to know a group of gay friends, so they always go clubbing together. My friend is 1.85m tall and big size, chinese/malay mixed cha zeng. I did joked with him whether the ah gua got kam ur lan  chao or not but he told me no leh, they are very friendly, nice and rich too. They foot the bill also. U know what happen to my friend now??? Chow chee bye, he become a fucking gay!!!!! So be careful, some gay dont just come to u and tell u " ai kam mai ", they will be friend with u first then slowly turned u into one like them. During my NS time, my camp got some many gay but most of them are friendly and they dont touch here touch there, and I feel ok with them but of coz I very careful when I talk to them lah, try not to mention sex or sodomy, wait aroused them u r dead meat. This a real thing, not a make up story. I would say not all gay are bad but u hv make ur stand clear and thing should be fine. Just tell them that u r straight if they try make advancement, but dont hurt their feeling loh. HAHAHA</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sigh.. as i said in other post there is no right or wrong in this world... its just how ppl choose their path... but somethings have to be control like stealing or raping .. etc... the society must control it so they came up with law... law evolve from moral ethics.. btw homosexuality is present not only in this era... ancient china already got homo liao leh.. not sure which poet.. but i noe a few of them are gays... so gay or not gay.. let it be.. as long as u happy can already.. but for the problem of parents getting upset.. tat one har.. as long as u not gay...
