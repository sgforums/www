Love Endureth Forever<br><br>1. The Differences Between Sex and Love<br><br>Love is primarily in the will, not in the emotions or the glands. The<br>will is like the voice; the emotions are like the echo. The pleasure<br>associated with love, or what is today called "sex," is the frosting<br>on the cake; its purpose is to make us love the cake, not ignore it.<br>The greatest illusion of lovers is to believe that the intensity of<br>their sexual attraction is the guarantee of the perpetuity of their<br>love. It is because of this failure to distinguish between the<br>glandular and spiritual--or between sex which we have in common<br>with animals, and love which we have in common with God--that<br>marriages are so full of deception. What some people love is not a<br>person, but the experience of being in love. The first is<br>irreplaceable; the second is not. As soon as the glands cease to<br>react with their pristine force, couples who identified<br>emotionalism and love claim they no longer love one another. If<br>such is the case they never loved the other person in the first<br>place; they only loved being loved, which is the highest form of<br>egotism. Marriage founded on sex passion alone lasts only as long<br>as the animal passion lasts. Within two years the animal attraction<br>for the other may die, and when it does, law comes to its rescue to<br>justify the divorce with the meaningless words "incompatibility,"<br>or "mental torture." Animals never have recourse to law courts,<br>because they have no will to love; but man, having reason, feels<br>the need of justifying his irrational behavior when he does wrong.<br><br>There are two reasons for the primacy of sex over love in a<br>decadent civilization. One is the decline of reason. As humans give<br>up reason, they resort to their imaginations. That is why motion<br>pictures and picture magazines enjoy such popularity. As thinking<br>fades, unrestrained desires come to the fore. Since physical and<br>erotic desires are among the easiest to dwell upon, because they<br>require no effort and because they are powerfully aided by bodily<br>passions, sex begins to be all-important. It is by no historical<br>accident that an age of anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, such<br>as our own, is also an age of carnal license.<br><br>The second factor is egotism. As belief in a Divine Judgment, a<br>future life, heaven and hell, a moral order, is increasingly rejected,<br>the ego becomes more and more firmly enthroned as the source of<br>its morality. Each person becomes a judge in his own case. With<br>this increase of selfishness, the demands for self-satisfaction<br>become more and more imperious, and the interests of the<br>community and the rights of others have less and less appeal. All<br>sin is self-centeredness, as love is otherness and relatedness. Sin<br>is the infidelity of man to the image of what he ought to be in his<br>eternal vocation as an adopted son of God: the image God sees in<br>Himself when He contemplates His Word.<br><br>There are two extremes to be avoided in discussing married love:<br>one is the refusal to recognize sexual love, the other is the giving<br>of primacy to sexual attraction. The first error was Victorian; the<br>second is Freudian. To the Christian, sex is inseparable from the<br>person, and to reduce the person to sex is as silly as to reduce<br>personality to lungs or a thorax. Certain Victorians in their<br>education practically denied sex as a function of personality;<br>certain sexophiles of modern times deny personality and make a<br>god of sex. The male animal is attracted to the female animal, but<br>a human personality is attracted to another human personality.<br>The attraction of beast to beast is physiological; the attraction of<br>human to human is physiological, psychological, and spiritual.<br>The human spirit has a thirst for the infinite which the quadruped<br>has not. This infinite is really God. But man can pervert that thirst,<br>which the animal cannot because it has no concept of the infinite.<br>Infidelity in married life is basically the substitution for an<br>infinite of a succession of finite carnal experiences. The false<br>infinity of succession takes the place of the Infinity of Destiny,<br>which is God. The beast is promiscuous for an entirely different<br>reason than man. The false pleasure given by new conquests in the<br>realm of sex is the ersatz for the conquest of the Spirit in the<br>Sacrament! The sense of emptiness, melancholy, and frustration is<br>a consequence of the failure to find infinite satisfaction in what is<br>carnal and limited. Despair is disappointed hedonism The most<br>depressed spirits are those who seek God in a false god!<br><br>If love does not climb, it falls. If, like the flame, it does not burn<br>upward to the sun, it burns downward to destroy. If sex does not<br>mount to heaven, it descends into hell. There is no such thing as<br>giving the body without giving the soul. Those who think they can<br>be faithful in soul to one another, but unfaithful in body, forget<br>that the two are inseparable. Sex in isolation from personality does<br>not exist! An arm living and gesticulating apart from the living<br>organism is an impossibility. Man has no organic functions<br>isolated from his soul. There is involvement of the whole<br>personality. Nothing is more psychosomatic than the union of two<br>in one flesh; nothing so much alters a mind, a will, for better or for<br>worse. The separation of soul and body is death. Those who<br>separate sex and spirit are rehearsing for death. The enjoyment of<br>the other's personality through one's own personality, is love. The<br>pleasure of animal function through another's animal function is<br>sex separated from love.<br><br>Sex is one of the means God has instituted for the enrichment of<br>personality. It is a basic principle of philosophy that there is<br>nothing in the mind which was not previously in the senses. All<br>our knowledge comes from the body. We have a body, St. Thomas<br>tells us, because of the weakness of our intellect. Just as the<br>enrichment of the mind comes from the body and its senses, so<br>the enrichment of love comes through the body and its sex. As one<br>can see a universe mirrored in a tear on a cheek, so in sex can be<br>seen mirrored that wider world of love. Love in monogamous<br>marriage includes sex; but sex, in the contemporary use of the<br>term, does not imply either marriage or monogamy.<br><br>Every woman instinctively realizes the difference between the two,<br>but man comes to understand it more slowly through reason and<br>prayer. Man is driven by pleasure; woman by the meaning of<br>pleasure. She sees pleasure more as a means to an end, namely,<br>the prolongation of love both in herself and in her child. Like Mary<br>at the Annunciation, she accepts the love which is presented to her<br>by another. In Mary, it came directly from God through an angel; in<br>marriage, it comes indirectly from God through a man. But in both<br>instances, there is an acceptance, a surrender, a Fiat: "Let it be<br>unto me according to thy word." (Luke 1:2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> The pagan woman who<br>has not consciously thought of God is actually half woman and<br>half dream; the woman who sees love as a reflection of the Trinity<br>is half woman and half Spirit, and she waits upon the creative work<br>of God within her body. Patience thus becomes bound up with her<br>acceptance. Woman accepts the exigencies of love, as the farmer<br>accepts the exigencies of nature, and waits, after the sowing of the<br>seed, the harvest of autumn.<br><br>But when sex is divorced from love there is a feeling that one has<br>been stopped at the vestibule of the castle of pleasure; that the<br>heart has been denied the city after crossing the bridge. Sadness<br>and melancholy result from such a frustration of destiny, for it is<br>the nature of man to be sad when he is pulled outside himself, or<br>exteriorized without getting any nearer his goal. There is a closer<br>correlation between mental instability and the animal view of sex<br>than many suspect. Happiness consists in interiority of the spirit,<br>namely, the development of personality in relationship to a<br>heavenly destiny. He who has no purpose in life is unhappy; he<br>who exteriorizes his life and is dominated, or subjugated, by what<br>is outside himself, or spends his energy on the external without<br>understanding its mystery, is unhappy to the point of melancholy.<br>There is the feeling of being hungry after having eaten, or of being<br>disgusted with food, because it has nourished not the body, in the<br>case of an individual, or another body, in the case of marriage. In<br>the woman, this sadness is due to the humiliation of realizing that<br>where marriage is only sex, her role could be fulfilled by any other<br>woman; there is nothing personal, incommunicable, and therefore<br>nothing dignified. Summoned by her God-implanted nature to be<br>ushered into the mysteries of life which have their source in God,<br>she is condemned to remain on the threshold as a tool or an<br>instrument of pleasure alone, and not as a companion of love. Two<br>glasses that are empty cannot fill up one another. There must be a<br>fountain of water outside the glasses, in order that they may have<br>communion with one another. It takes three to make love.<br><br>Every person is what he loves. Love becomes like unto that which<br>it loves. If it loves heaven, it becomes heavenly; if it loves the<br>carnal as a god, it becomes corruptible. The kind of immortality<br>we have depends on the kind of loves we have. Putting it<br>negatively, he who tells you what he does not love, also tells what<br>he is. "Amor pondus meum: Love is my gravitation," said St.<br>Augustine. This slow conversion of a subject into an object, of a<br>lover into the beloved, of the miser into his gold, of the saint into<br>his God, discloses the importance of loving the right things. The<br>nobler our loves, the nobler our character. To love what is below<br>the human, is degradation; to love what is human for the sake of<br>the human, is mediocrity; to love the human for the sake of the<br>Divine, is enriching; to love the Divine for its own sake is sanctity.<br><br>Love is trinity; sex is duality. But there are many other differences<br>between the two. Sex rationalizes; love does not. Sex has to justify<br>itself with Kinsey Reports, "But Freud told us," or "No one believes<br>that today"; love needs no reasons. Sex asks science to defend it;<br>love never asks "Why?" It says, "I love you." Love is its own reason.<br>"God is love." Satan asked a "Why?" of God's love in the Garden of<br>Paradise. Every rationalization is farfetched and never discloses<br>the real reason. He who breaks the Divine Law and finds himself<br>outside of Christ's Mystical Body in a second marriage, will often<br>justify himself by saying: "I could not accept the Doctrine of<br>Transubstantiation." What he means is that he can no longer<br>accept the Sixth Commandment. Milton wrote an abstract and<br>apparently a philosophical treatise on "Doctrine and Discipline of<br>Divorce," in which he justified the divorce on the grounds of<br>incompatibility. But the real reason was not what he set down in<br>the book; it was to be found in the fact that he wished to marry<br>someone else while his wife was living. What is important is not<br>what people say, but why they say it. Too many assume that the<br>reason people do not come to God is because they are ignorant; it<br>is more generally true that the reason people do not come to God<br>is because of their behavior. Our Lord said: "Rejection lies in this,<br>that when the light came into the world men preferred darkness to<br>light; preferred it, because their doings were evil. Anyone who acts<br>shamefully hates the light." (John 3:19, 20) It is not always doubt<br>that has to be overcome, but evil habits.<br><br>From another point of view, sex seeks the part; love the totality.<br>Sex is biological and physiological and has its definite zones of<br>satisfaction. Love, on the contrary, includes all of these but is<br>directed to the totality of the person loved, i.e., as a creature<br>composed of body and soul and made to the image and likeness of<br>God. Love seeks the clock and its purpose; sex concentrates on the<br>mainspring and forgets its mission to keep time. Sex eliminates<br>from the person who is loved everything that cannot adapt itself to<br>its carnal libido. Those who give primacy to sex for that reason are<br>anti-religious. Love, however, does not concentrate on a function,<br>but on personality. An organ does not include the personality, but<br>the personality includes the organ, which is another way of<br>repeating the theme: love includes sex, but sex does not include<br>love.<br><br>Love concentrates on the object; sex concentrates on the subject.<br>Love is directed to someone else for the sake of the other's<br>perfection; sex is directed to self for the sake of se]f-satisfaction.<br>Sex flatters the object not because it is praiseworthy in itself, but<br>rather as a solicitation. It knows how to make friends and<br>influence people. Most sound minds resent flattery because they<br>see the egotism behind the screen of altruism. The ego in sex<br>pleads that it loves the alter ego, but what it loves is really the<br>possibility of its own pleasure in the other ego. The other person is<br>necessary for the return of the egotist upon himself. The egotist<br>finds himself constantly being encircled by non-being,<br>purposelessness, meaninglessness; he has the feeling of being<br>exploited. Refusing to be related to anything else, he soon sees<br>that nothing is for him: The whole world is against him! But love,<br>which stresses the object, finds itself in constantly enlarging<br>relationships. Love is so strong it surpasses narrowness by<br>devotedness and forgetfulness of self. In history, the only causes<br>that die are those for which men refuse to die. The more love<br>grows, the more its eyes open to the needs of others, to the<br>miseries of men, and to compassion. The remedy for all the<br>sufferings of the modern brain lies in the enlargement of the heart<br>through love, which forgets itself as the subject and begins to love<br>the neighbor as the object. But he who lives for himself will<br>eventually find that nature, fellowman, and God are all against<br>him. The so-called "persecution complex" is the result of egotism.<br>The world seems against him who wants everything for himself.<br><br>Sex is moved by the desire to fill a moment between having and<br>not having. It is an experience like looking at a sunset, or twirling<br>one's thumbs to pass the time. It rests after one experience,<br>because glutted for the moment, and then waits for the<br>reappearance of a new craving or passion to be satisfied on a<br>totally different object. Love frowns upon this notion, for it sees in<br>this nothing but the killing of the objects loved for the sake of<br>self-satisfaction. Sex would give birds flight, but no nests; hearts<br>emotions but no homes; throw the whole world into the experience<br>of voyagers at sea, but with no ports. Instead of pursuing an<br>Infinite which is fixed, it substitutes the false infinity of never<br>finding satisfaction. The infinite then becomes not the possession<br>of love but the fruitless search for love, which is the basis of so<br>many psychoses and neuroses. The infinite then becomes<br>restlessness, a merry-go-round of the heart which spins only to<br>spin again. Real love, on the contrary, admits the need, the thirst,<br>the passion, the craving, but it also admits an abiding satisfaction<br>by adhesion to a value which transcends time and space. Love<br>unites itself to being and thus becomes perfect; sex unites itself to<br>non-being and thus becomes irritation and anxiety. In love,<br>poverty becomes integrated into riches; need into fulfillment;<br>yearning into joy; chase into capture. But sex is without the joy of<br>offering. The wolf offers nothing when he kills the lamb. The joy<br>of oblation is missing, for the egotist by his very nature seeks<br>inflation. Love gives to receive. Sex receives so as not to give. Love<br>is soul contact with another for the sake of perfection; sex is body<br>contact with another for the sake of sublimation.<br><br>A body can exhaust itself, but it cannot nourish itself. If man<br>needed only nourishment, he could devour love as he devours<br>food. But having a Spirit which needs the Divine Love as a unitive<br>force, he can never be satisfied by devouring the love of another<br>person. A potato has a nature; a man is a person. The former can<br>be destroyed as a means to an end; the human may not. Sex would<br>turn man into a vegetable and reduce a person to an animal. Sex<br>makes hungry where most it satisfies, for the person needs the<br>person, and a person is a person only when seen in an image of<br>God.<br><br>Your cruellest pain is when you think of all<br>The honied treasure of your bodies spent<br>And no new life to show. O, then you feel<br>How people lift their hands against themselves,<br>And taste the bitterest of the punishment<br>Of those whom pleasure isolates. Sometimes<br>When darkness, silence, and the sleeping world<br>Give vision scope, you lie awake and see<br>The pale sad faces of the little ones<br>Who should have been your children, as they press<br>Their cheeks against your windows, looking in<br>With piteous wonder, homeless, famished babes,<br>Denied your wombs and bosoms.<br><br></strong></div>
