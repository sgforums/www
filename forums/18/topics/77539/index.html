            <div class='col-md body'>Two rednecks met in a bar and agreed that they weren't going anywhere in life, so they decided to go to college in order to get ahead. So they hop in a pickup truck and drive to the nearest college. While the second one waits out in the hall, the first goes into one of the rooms and finds a professor, who advises him to take math, history and logic.<br><br>"What's logic?" asked the first redneck.<br><br>The professor replied, "Let me give you an example: Do you own a weed eater?"<br><br>"I sure do," grinned the redneck.<br><br>"Then I can assume, using logic, that you have a yard," replied the professor.<br><br>"That's real good," the redneck responded in awe.<br><br>The professor continued, "Logic also tells me that since you have a yard, you also have a house."<br><br>Impressed, the redneck shouted, "Amazin'!"<br><br>"And since you own a house, logic dictates that you have a wife."<br><br>"Betty Mae... this is incredible!" (The redneck is catching on.)<br><br>"Finally, since you have a wife, logically I can assume that you are heterosexual," says the professor.<br><br>"You're absolutely right! Why that's the most fascinatin' thing I ever heard of. I can't wait to take this here logic class."<br><br>The first redneck, grinning ear to ear with pride at the new world opening up to him, walked back into the hallway where his friend was waiting.<br><br>"So what classes are ya takin'?" the friend asked.<br><br>"Math, history and logic," replied the first redneck.<br><br>"What in tarnation is logic?" asked his new friend.<br><br>"Let me give you an example. Do ya own a weed eater?"<br><br>"No," his friend replied.<br><br>"You're gay, aren't ya?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Russian and an American wrestler were set to square off for the Olympic gold medal.<br><br>Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer came to him and said, "Now, don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match because of this 'pretzel' hold he has. Whatever you do, don't let him get you in this hold! If he does, you're finished!"<br><br>The wrestler nodded in acknowledgment. As the match started, the American and the Russian circled each other several times, looking for an opening. All of a sudden, the Russian lunged forward, grabbed the American and wrapped him up in the dreaded pretzel hold.<br><br>A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands -- he knew all was lost. He couldn't even watch the ending. Suddenly, there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to watch the Russian flying up in the air.<br><br>The Russian's back hit the mat with a thud, and the American collapsed on top of him, making the pin and winning the match.<br><br>The trainer was astounded. When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asked, "How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!"<br><br>The wrestler answered, "Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment I opened my eyes and saw this pair of testicles right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could."<br><br>"So," the trainer exclaimed, "that finished him off, did it?"<br><br>"No, but you'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own testicles!"<br></div>
