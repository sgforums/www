He (Your Boyfriend) is fully exploiting the maxim, 'Absence makes the heart grow fonder'. After this episode, U will be more relenting to 'his request'. (I thought U gals were very gd at games like these) Well, then again , maybe I'm wrong, maybe he's just pissed. In that case, if he really loves U, he will reconcile the matter soon enough. If he doesn't, I think you should question yourself on whether this relationship should go on.<br><br>Be patient. Go shopping with your Galfriends. Enjoy Life. Patience is the key.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All relationships will encounter challenges, and it is how the couple ride through it that affect how the relationship matures.  One very poor approach to building relationship is the adversarial, also called win-lose, approach.  Unless one is looking forward to a final showdown, I would say respectfully that what was advocated in the earlier few mails may not be the way to go.<br><br>I must qualify that what was advocated in earlier post has its merits and is appropriate in certain circumstances.  However, I believe it is not in the best interest of the couple to apply it here.<br><br>First and foremost, I must reiterate that "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus", something that we are so prone to forget.  The problem in many relationship arose because we forget that men and women are different, and have different needs, and think differently.

Contrary to what you think, your partner may not know actually how you want to be loved.  Ask your partner how he/she wants to be loved.  You maybe loving your partner the way you want loved, not the way he/she wanted to be loved.<br><br>In your communications, do not judge nor draw conclusions.<br><br>Compromise + patience<br>Through your communications, you will discover differences between the ideal situation and the actual situation.  Let's call this "tension".  The best way to reduce this tension is to lower the ideal, and raise the actual at the same time.  This is call compromise.<br><br>Compromise will mean change, and changes sometimes takes place very slowly.  Do not rush things and expect things to go your way at the blink of an eye.  In fact, some difference will never be entirely resolved.  Couples who lasted a life-time found their way to "agreed to disagree".<br><br>Just contributing my two cents worth, and I wish all couples have long-lasting relationship.<br><br>To dulex: glad that you have gotten the help you need.
