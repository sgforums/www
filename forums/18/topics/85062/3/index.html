Bringing a gal back to where you first met is nice, but don't make it obvious. Just drop a line casually saying that, hey, this is where we 1st met (or got together), followed by a little hug or a great big grin. Subtle and sweet. haha! (I'm a really really simple person.. don't like the flashy stuff.)<br><br>Try to add an element of surprise when you bring her out. It'll impress her more. I do think that a nice dinner (a chance for her to dress up, and for you to compliment - SINCERELY) at a good restaurant, and a night at a quiet place like Marina South, West Coast, some park, etc will do just fine.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, as long as she love and like you, then with you by the side, she is very impressive already!<br>Well, i can suggest you eat in the most expensive and luxury restaurant in town! Of course, with flowers and red wine. Then ask some violinist to play a wonderful song~ Then, with cakes, and simply say today is the 10th day we have gone out or anything so we ought to celebrate or just tell her the truth that you trying to impress her and make her happy! I guess the first action of her will be run forward to hugz and kiss you (If she likes you), or turn around and run away (Freak Out).<br>LoL~<br>After that, you can bring her to a park for a stroll or the beach or anywhere as long as she felt comfortable~ Then chat... At there, tell her how you feel about her, how beautiful she is, how silly you are when you try courting her (They will laugh), and tell her how you wish this moment the time freezes and remain forever like this so you can hold her, hug her and have her by your side! If can, well, sleep together in car or body by body means leaning together until the sunrise. Watch the sunrise together.. then go eat breakfast and offer her home. Arrive home, then tell her that you have a wonderful night out and give her a gentle kiss and say good night and you will call her if once you got home but if she too tired, then simply cancel it and tell her that you will call her that night~<br>End~<br>Huh~ This should be able to impress her!<br>Hope so<br>Good luck, Dude!</div>
