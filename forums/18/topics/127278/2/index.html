The power of wind is able to carry dirt over continents. it has been scientifically proven. with all the industrialization, cancer is a growing trend - even amongst non-smoker. the fumes we breathe in everytime we walk on the street. they maybe invisible to you, they maybe odourless - but fact is, we are taking in them into us all this while - whether u like it or not. we can't stop breathing right?<br><br>the restriction that will be imposed is fine with me. inconsiderate people exists in every social levels and groups, smoking was singled out because smoke can be seen and smell. as it is, many people have suffered from gambling, and alcohol abuse. y not discriminate them? why not ban 4d, toto, horse-racing etc etc countless have suffered due to alcohol abuse. personally i think they are worst, as drinking intoxicate the body and deny one's body from reacting or think coherently. coffee shop brawls are common - not to mention wife-beaters. some resulting in death (i mean the coffeeshop brawls).<br><br>whoever say smokers couldn't care less, this whoever is probably right - having said that, do this person really care less about others when you burnt incense (I do burnt incense on occassion - I am talking about any religion or traditional practices that requires to do so - no offense - just citing an eg)? when you let your dripping wet clothes out to dry (in the flat)? do you stop driving or stop taking public transport because it is infact killing the air? huh? oh, dun tell me about mrt runs on electric - where does our electricity comes from?
