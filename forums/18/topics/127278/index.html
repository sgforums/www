Â“They donÂ’t care for their lungs, do you expect them to care for your table?Â”<br>She replied, Â“TrueÂ”.<br><br>How true is this.<br>Smokers muck up their lungs, would they care for yours?<br>Would they care for the environment?<br><br>Would a person whose backyard is untidy, cluttered and dirty, see to it that your backyard is tidy, neat and clean.<br><br>Smokers can smoke all they want. ThatÂ’s their choice.<br>It is the callus disregard for others that is the bane of our society.<br></div></blockquote>Well, I never have such problem because I don't invite smoker to my home... I don't like it even if they smoke outside because after smoking they still smell when they walk into the house, so house rule, no smoker allowed.  Even family member, that's why my brother never come to my house.  Is a price to pay, but you make the choice .... although I agree most smokers are inconsiderate consider the butts thrown in public places ....</div>

Only on festival that they are done outside.  Smoker also smoke within one house BUT smoker smoke every minute out in the street.  I said most smoker are inconsiderate. Why u so edggy, u r one of them..  Have u ever being 2 function or dinner..When u 1 2 use toilet, can't even find a proper place to use it cos of the thick smoke...  there is alway a big group of smoker smoking together and it make it impossible for other user 2 use...  try excerising on the staircase, chances is u will get more smoke in the lung more than the benefit u get from the workout.   Look around everywhere, u can always find cigerattee butt ...  toilet urinating bowl, toilet bowl, cigerattee burnt mark on wall door and basin.. drain, lift... in short u can find them everywhere, so throw them huh ??  non smoker ???   you want 5 storey mansion, let your family know and they can burn for u when die of lung cancer ..... then u don't worry u got no smoke ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I invite ppl to my place, I bear in mind that amongst them there are many smokers.<br><br>Before even inviting them, I lay a house rule for them: Smoke outside my house... No, not outside my door on private property, outside the gate on public property. Finished, disposed of the cig in any manner you like, then re-enter my house.<br><br>I know its a bit rude... ok rather rude, but at least there is no misunderstanding and most smokers are rather understanding, they won't mind.<br><br>Its a matter of telling them that you do not discriminate against them, but its a personal preference. They usually are very nice about it. In fact, most of my smoker friends won't even bother going out for a smoke... They wait till the event is over and smoke on their way home.</div>
