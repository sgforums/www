I had this prob earlier on too with my ex gf. She knew i still had feelings for her for e past 2-3 years after we broke up. We stop keeping in touch after we broke up.. i didn't wanna think about it...didn't wanna talk to her or see her.. then suddenly she look me up and do e sweet little things to me.. then after some time she cool off and stop calling me... its been a torture to me and its been like a few years already..everytime i got e determination to forget her..she comes back. why i am saying all these is becoz i thought we were in e same plight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  we did have sex too...she initiated it.<br><br>Now that i have gotten over her... really fearing that she might look for me again... coz i know i cant resist it coz e feeling is still strong. Guess what u can do is to be with friends to forget your sorrows... true friends will be there for u. Don't go to bed when u are not tired.. do things till u are damn tired then go to bed.. coz e hardest time for me was going to bed.. i cant sleep but kept thinking.<br><br>Hope u get over it and get on with your life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div></blockquote>that is also what i'm afraid of. what if when i feel much better, move on a few steps, getting a bit more happy, and he come and tell me he love me that kinda nonsense. then i fall for it again?<br><br>i feel so trapped.<br><br>or i think to far away already? i still haven't move yet. at least not from my computer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
