            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to say something here.Can it be u hurt him too deep? Or can it be other reasons.Cos i have a friend who's very tempremental but he truly loves his ex. His ex wanted to break up wif him and he felt like commiting suicide. In the end it was his mom who stopped him. Ever since then he changed. Just feels that maybe its pointless to be a good guy anymore,sometimes i feel this way too. But lucky for him he didnt changed to the extend of ur ex. What i am trying to say here is don always look at things at one side try to see it at different angles. Anyway, that guy ought to be called a bastard for doing this to a girl. I am glad that u have overcome ur past and hope that u will find ur happiness one day.</div>
