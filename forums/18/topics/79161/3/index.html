I think there are really very nice singaporean girls out there who love sex as much as we guys. Because of the asian values, they are afraid to let go her animal self.<br>Like my GF, she the goody girl next door type. I told her my all sexual fantasy and fetishes, and we are very open about it. Look what happen? She feels comfortable with our relationshaip and sexual pleasure.<br>What I think it that all of us have our sexual fanyasy, if you don't tell your partner, she will never know. Mind you... she won't be the 1st to tell you. If both of you click.... then you will have the most wonder sex life.<br>She is not the my 1st GF I am so open about. My GFs's reaction are almost the same.<br></div></blockquote>Woah!!! Kudos! You also put aside your asian values of shyness and went straight to the point sia.<br><br>Good for you my friend.<br>I mean, maybe there are some girls looking at my post with digust.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>But seriously, what's the point of having a girlfriend but whom you cannot share wat you're feeling and not knowing who you really are?<br>Having a girlfriend is a very comfortable relationship not intending hide any truths about self. A more fufilling relationship too.<br>I can't agree more with Dutch, but not only in sexual terms only, also Relationship as a whole.<br><br>Girlfriends reading this. If you can't except him, then don't be with him.<br>If you don't know him well....you better find the hidden devil's tail sooner.<br>Then to knowing a hypocrite.<br></div>

Most girls are more open minded.<br>They will like to know how we guys feel. If they are able to digest, then they will tell us theirs. I do feel that sex and relationship go hand in hand. If one breaks, the other will eventually. Everyone has their needs.</div>
