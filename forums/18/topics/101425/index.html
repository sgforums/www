But her mother tearfully begged her not to.<br><br>Why would a teenager want smaller breas-ts?<br><br>Well, because her breas-ts were literally a weight on her shoulders. She was a 34-DD when the average breas-t size for a Singaporean woman of her build would be about a 34-B. (See breas-t Sizes below.)<br><br>Ms V, now a 36-year-old wife and mother, who finally had the operation done this year, said she was in constant pain.<br><br>'My bra strap was constantly biting into my shoulders so there were these permanent dents in my shoulders. I could never wear anything strapless,' said Ms V, a former air stewardess whose colleagues jokingly called her 'Megatop'.<br><br>She also suffered from neck and back pains, migraines and painful menstruation.<br><br>'I would always know before my menstrual cycle started. I would have severe pain in my breas-ts. It was pretty bad,' she said.<br><br>For every 10 to 15 women who want a breas-t enlargement, there is one woman who wants a breas-t reduction, said six plastic surgeons interviewed by The New Paper.<br><br>And unknown to most, these women suffer enormous pain.<br><br>When Ms V was 19, she decided she had had enough. She scheduled herself for a breas-t reduction operation.<br><br>Mum begged her not to do it<br><br>But the night before, her mother begged her not to do it.<br><br>'She was crying. She wanted me to at least wait until I was married, until after I had babies. She was not sure if the breas-t reduction would affect my ability to breas-tfeed,' she said.<br><br>She listened to her mother and cancelled her operation.<br><br>Still, she felt that at 1.66m tall and weighing 55kg, her breas-ts should be smaller.<br><br>She met her husband, a foreigner who is now a Singapore PR, in 1991, married in 1993, and gave birth to her daughter in 1995.<br><br>For nine years, she lived abroad, in India, the US, Netherlands and Hong Kong, before moving back to Singapore recently.<br><br>'All those years, I paid a fortune for bras. Do you know how expensive it is to buy proper bras for someone with breas-ts my size? It costs at least US$60 ($96) for one,' she said.<br><br>Although her husband knew of her desire for smaller breas-ts, they never felt comfortable enough in any of the countries they lived in to undergo such a major operation.<br><br>Then, early this year, she felt so miserable, she consulted Dr Woffles Wu, a consultant plastic surgeon in private practice.<br><br>He was willing to perform the surgery for her.<br><br>As it was a costly operation - $25,000 - and one which she felt she needed for medical reasons, she checked with her husband's company insurance to see if they would cover it. They sent her for a second opinion from one of their doctors.<br><br>'The doctor was so sweet. She immediately said of course it's a medical problem and supported Dr Wu's recommendation,' she said.<br><br>She flew here in February to be operated on by Dr Wu. At that time, she was still living Hong Kong. The operation took five hours.<br><br>Large number of cystic lumps<br><br>When she woke up, her breas-ts were smaller. She found out Dr Wu had removed a large number of fibre cystic lumps.<br><br>'It was a shock to me. I never expected to have lumps. Because my breas-ts were so big, I never felt them.'<br><br>A sample of the lumps were sent for testing to see if they were cancerous. Thankfully, none was.<br><br>'This is actually a blessing in disguise because now all my lumps have been removed,' she said.<br><br>'Before my surgery, my left breas-t was also bigger than my right breas-t. Now both are the same size. There are no visible scars.<br><br>'There is one set tucked in the nipples and another running under the bottom of my breas-ts. Can't be seen. It's a great job,' she said.<br><br>'I feel so much more freer now. I even leave the house sometimes without a bra!'<br><br>She's now a 34 B cup and has happily given away all her DD-cup bras to a friend.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>breas-t SIZES<br><br>A bra size consists of two measurements - the circumference of a woman's chest, denoted by inches or centimetres, and how full her breas-ts are, denoted by alphabets ranging from A upwards. So a 34-B means her chest measures 34in and her cup size is B.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Only for those who really have a problem<br><br>DR Woffles Wu said that Ms V had a full breas-t reduction.<br><br>This involved making incisions around the nipple and all the way down to and including the breas-t crease.<br><br>This is an operation that patients have to 'earn' as the scars are so extensive that they really have to want to have this operation badly because of their symptoms.<br><br>'It's not a vanity thing as the scars or the consequences such as keloids - an overgrowth of scar tissue - can sometimes not be aesthetic,' said Dr Wu.<br><br>He usually classifies overly big breas-ts as a medical condition because patients may not be having a good life at all, contrary to popular belief.<br><br>'They are clumsy, embarrassed, develop sweaty rashes under their breas-ts, the bra strap cuts into their shoulders, they have neck, shoulder and back pains and are generally miserable,' he said.<br><br>But he will never do this operation for patients who come in with relatively nice breas-ts with only a slight sag.<br><br>'Then they are just being greedy and will usually never be able to tolerate the ensuing scars,' he said.<br><br>For such patients, he may perform a minimal circum-areolar incision (around the nipple) only but even then the scars can be quite bad.<br><br>'She (Ms V) and many others like her who fit the correct profile for this five-hour operation are usually the happiest of all plastic surgery patients because it is such a relief to not have all the problems mentioned above,' he said.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Who are they?<br><br>THOSE who ask for breas-t reduction surgery are usually Caucasians, Indians or Malays.<br><br>Chinese women rarely ask for it.<br><br>Said Dr Andrew Khoo, president of the Singapore Society for Cosmetic (Aesthetic) Surgeons: 'Chinese tend to come for mastopexy which is a breas-t lift without a reduction in volume of the breas-t.'<br><br>The cup sizes of those who ask for the surgery range from D to F.<br><br>Said Dr Martin Huang, consultant plastic surgeon in private practice: 'Women with overly developed breas-ts suffer social embarrassment, neck and shoulder aches.<br><br>'They are usually size E and above and want to go down to a size C or below.'<br><br>In his practice, most of the women asking for breas-t reductions are Caucasians, with a few Chinese.<br><br>There are two methods of reducing breas-t tissue:<br><br>Conventional breas-t reduction; and<br><br>Liposuction.<br><br>Conventional breas-t reduction is usually done as an in-patient procedure under general anaesthesia.<br><br>This removes breas-t tissue and skin and will reduce the size of breas-ts. The surgery takes four to five hours and the patient can expect to stay in hospital for two days and be off work for seven days.<br><br>For moderately sized breas-ts, it is possible to reduce the breas-ts through liposuction. This is a much simpler operation and can be done as day surgery.<br><br>But as Dr Leslie Kuek, consultant plastic surgeon and former president of the Singapore Society for Cosmetic (Aesthetic) Surgeons, warned, breas-t reduction is not easy.<br><br>'Compared to breas-t augmentation, the potential for scarring is much greater,' he said.<br></div>
