            <div class='col-md body'>having sex when you are very young is a waste because there are so many things you don't understand and when you meet someone that you want to spend the rest of your life with you can never tell them that they are the only one you've been with. There will always be that person out there that has experienced you. Just save yourself for the one person you want to stay with forever. It will be much better in the long run and more enjoyable, more safe, more sacred, more happy etc.  My niece's friend got pregnent age 13, such a waste and very hard. Even if that person didn't get pregnent both the guy and the girl might have a hard time with relationships later on. Not to mention STDs are common, no one wants genetal warts right?  Plus once you have sex and it feels good, you will seek out more sex instead of looking with your heart. But at least wait till your 19~20. The human brain is still in developement till the age 18.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>can't really agree or disagree that having sexual experience early is bad. given enough exposure and education - very importantly, sex won't be all that bad. we often link early sex = bad, based on the assumption that teenagers or even kids are not mature enough. they beg to differ.<br><br>no amount of complains or lamenting would turn the trend around. rather, increased exposure and education on sex, its consequences, STDs is to be done. allow these young "adults" to experiment safely, make mature decisions on sex. likewise, parents and the older generation should learn to accept this trend, and be more open talking about sex, and not see it as something taboo, or something to be ashamed of. you see, the forbidden fruit is always more enticing.<br><br>studies and statics shown that increased exposure of sex education in the european nations has indirectly led to the decrease to teenage pregnancy. if people, the "young adults" feel less ashamed buying condoms, even birth control pills, teenage pregnancy could be reduced.<br><br>sex should be something that is to be enjoyed, not be "eee..", "eeeww" about.</div>

Or abandon the kid and let them grow up in substitute families and live in disadvantage never know love, and living as live examples of neglect and regret.<br><br>I saw the show <span style="font-style: italic;">Child of Our Times</span> by BBC and it showed the kids and how the mother's marriage life affected them indirectly. There are a couple of really messed up mothers in the show. 1 woman had 4 boys and all the fathers left the mom. And all the 4 boths had different fathers. Another was such a messed up person and she hoped from one r/s to another. Had a black daughter, a white son, and a white husband who left and now is hooked up with a black man and it didn't work out either. there was also another girl had a shot gun marriage and 3 months into the union, the guy had a string of affairs. Couple years later, they separated and she found another guy and the biological father is so jealous.<br><br>These things can happen in Ang Moh country and AngMoh men are more open to taking in Single moms, although I must say, they are a limited few plus some of the new fathers did not like the kids at all. But mostly these single moms represent one thing - easy targets. Asian men in general do not like to "wear old slippers" no matter how "open" we have become. Even if you ask me if I as a woman can accept a guy who comes along with kids. I find it extremely hard - although I might try.<br><br>But kids choose to see selective things, parents who did not bother to teach proper responsibilities will only bring high social costs to all.<br></div>

I live in the USA and I still don't like the idea of kids having sex so early. First of all, the reason why kids would have less teen pregnancies due to education is that they are just using better contraceptives. Kids are immature, I was a very mature kid in junior high and high school, but still I didn't know a lot. If you take sex as just a pleasure act for mere enjoyement, then why don't we all become monkeys? Sex is of a primal state of being, it is the reason why we procreate, yes it is hard wired into us, but that's the thing. If you take sex as just means to an end for pleasurement you gain nothing and revert more to an animal state only looking for more sex and whatever else that can get you off.  Sex is suppose to be something that lovers share, a sacred act, not a pass time.  If you don't hold anything sacred what is the point? What is the point to love? If you love someone you share everything with them and hold back from others to show your love one that they mean more to you than anyone else, and that goes with sex. You save yourself to show that when you share youself with them that they are the only one that will ever know how you feel. But if you have sex with anyone who is willing to give it up you end up not having anything left sacred. And when you have sex without the begining process of love real love, not "oh, he brings me food" like you understand each other, they make you want to be a better person, you want to do anything for them, you can talk to them without any resistance, then you will be lost and it will always just be lust, not real love.  It's like anything else in the world, you don't teach a kid Calculus before he learns algebra. They have to learn to love and understand love before giving away one of the most sacred parts of them to whoever is willing to take it.</div>

Men are often facinated by women's breast. Especially when we see women who dress up sexily, revealing her cleavage, we just can't stop ourselves looking them. But as for the men in New Guniea (dunno how to spell), these men are rather indifferent seeing women's breasts since most or all women in their culture and society go topless.[/u]</div>
