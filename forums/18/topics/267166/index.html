When they didn't get it, they decided to rob someone. And when they couldn't find a victim, they decided a prostitute would do.<br>By Joycelyn Wong<br>07 July 2007<br><br>THEY were itching for a fight. When they didn't get it, they decided to rob someone. And when they couldn't find a victim, they decided a prostitute would do.<br><br>Khairul Zaman Mamon Basir, 18, and his friend, Yusry Shah Jamal, 17, pleaded guilty to robbery with common intention.<br><br>They were given probation and the prosecution is now appealing for a heavier sentence.<br><br>The duo also stood nearby while their three accomplices allegedly raped a prostitute, a Chinese national in her 20s, in Geylang. The attack took place at about 5am on 1 Apr last year.<br><br>Earlier, the group had planned to confront some youths over a staring incident, according to court documents.<br><br>When they could not find them, they decided to rob someone instead. They drove around but failed to find one.<br><br>One of the other three men then suggested that they rob a prostitute. Khairul Zaman and Yusry Shah agreed.<br><br>Khairul Zaman, Yusry Shah and another alleged accomplice got out of the car. The other two drove off and picked up a prostitute at Geylang Road, offering her $80 for sex. The car then headed back to where the other three were waiting.<br><br>The three men allegedly punched their victim's face and head and kicked her while Khairul Zaman and Yusry Shah stood by. They took her handbag and jewellery before the alleged sexual assault. The group then drove off and later entered Malaysia through the Woodlands Checkpoint.<br><br>The woman later reported to police that she had been raped and robbed. She said she lost a gold chain with a diamond pendant, a gold earring and a ring, worth $1,020 in all. Also gone was her handbag, which contained a handphone worth $420, $260 in cash, her passport and a plane ticket.<br><br>A medical report showed she had bruises on her head and body.<br><br>Yusry Shah was arrested at a block of flats in Marsiling Drive on 24 Aug last year. Three days later, Khairul Zaman was arrested when he tried to return to Singapore.<br><br>Both were charged with robbery with common intention. While out on bail, Yusry Shah stole a $29 T-shirt from Causeway Point on 28 Jan this year.<br><br>For this, he pleaded guilty to a charge of theft.<br><br>In their mitigation, Yusry Shah and Khairul Zaman said they were first-time offenders. Both are Singaporeans but lived in Johor with their families.<br><br>Khairul Zaman was given two years' probation by District Judge Aedit Abdullah in March. Yusry Shah was given two and a half years' probation by District Judge Jasbendar Kaur in May.<br><br>Khairul Zaman's appeal will be heard today. He is represented by Ms Christine Sekhon. For robbery with common intention, they could have been jailed 14years and caned at least 12 strokes.<br><br>Their alleged accomplices, Mohamed Fadzli Abdul Rahim, 27, a Singaporean, and Mohamad Norhazri Mohd Faudzi, 21, a Malaysian, will face trial in the High Court next month on rape and robbery charges. A fifth man, a Malaysian, remains at large.<br><br>i want to be raped by them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
