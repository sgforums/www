It is what i will call poor construction of sentences. Basically, a pull stop will suffice in the situation.<br><br>My point is if you wish to put forward an argument, the least you can do is present them in understandable English and by this i'm referring to natural_boy's posting.<br><br>And frankly speaking, you need to work on your "logical construction" more than me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
