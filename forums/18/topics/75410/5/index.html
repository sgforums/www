            <div class='col-md body'>I believe its all up to individual preference.  It all comes down to character and personality.  Like for me i'm in love with a guy whose family is in KL but he's born in SIngapore... sometimes u can see how very mat m'sian he can get but i'm not in love with him for where he is from but because he is who he is...</div>

After all, local men who are less capable tend to settle for something less by going for simple minded and easily satisfied gals. Btw i dun think a 'boy wearing blue' understands what sophiscation stands for.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About Malaysian guy, it all depends which group you are talking about. Obviously I am referring to the PRs here ....first of all to clear up the air, as the gov has mentioned , this group of people are in fact better educated compares to the local.
