He probably speaks 'Malaylish'. As shown above, i've highlighted a few of his grammatical mistakes, poor construction of English sentences and inappropriate use of past &amp; present tenses. Kids, do not try this at home. You may end up with F9 for English if you're not careful.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> (Gosh the sentences are so poorly constructed that almost everything has to be highlighted, but i did try my best to give him some credit whenever possible)<br><br>1) Maybe it <span style="color: red;">WAS</span> true (haha...he should get a lawyer to sue his English teacher)<br><br>2) <span style="color: red;">Attack me back</span> Sounds offensive.
