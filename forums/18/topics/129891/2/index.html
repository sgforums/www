However, u're heading in the right direction by being unafraid to admit u're les. Who cares what people think or accept.<br><br>We have to be selfish at times when our personal happiness is concerned. Besides, we live in an age of change, being homophobic is increasingly seen as being uncool, so hang in there and we'll have the last laugh. of course u already see some homophobic people posting here. they look pathetic having to pick on the sexual orientation of others don't they? Ignore the poor misguided fools, and be who u are.</div>
