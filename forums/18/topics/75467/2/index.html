            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, a big thank you to all who posted his/her reply. Many of you talked about sorcery involvement in my situation. Although I cannot safely reject this conclusion, I do not think this is the case.<br>Kamen Rider - I do not exploit young gals. No doubt that I did pay for sex, I did it with her because I was really attracted to her on 1st sight. In my 4 days in Bangkok, I resisted sex, body massage and so on until the last night. In fact, that was the first time that I had commercial sex. I did it out of a liking for her than satisfying my needs.<br>Sylvia - I do understand what most young Thai gals have to go through in your country, and on retrospect, I think that our local gals are really blessed. But I could not figure whether I wanna bring her back more of out of piteous or that I really like her. Though I feel both for her.<br>I met this gal at a pub where I was watching soccer. And as most of you who have been to Bangkok knows, the pubs there have ladies whom you can have them sit beside you in return for a couple of drinks, and you can always pay to bring them back. This gal speaks good English by Thai standard and she told me that she's in the line for only a week. I do believe her as her bottom was pretty tight.<br>I am still rational and somewhere at the back of my head, I know that I shouldn't be harboring these thoughts. But I need someone to show me the light. I do agree that I am in need of companionship/gf, but why can't she be a prostitute? Why are we so receptive towards a Sg gal who virtually makes out with every man that picks her up in Zouk and not a poor Thai-Chinese gal who has to ply the sex trade to make ends meet?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe u need not marry her at once, but if u really think u love her, jus give it a shot. tell her to stop 'working' and maybe u can help pay for her expenses... yes, its like keeping a mistress but maybe u can use this time to see if u really like her for anything other than sex.. if both of u have feelings for each other, by all means, get married. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> sure, there will be social stigma bk in sg.. but then again, love overcomes all.. gd luck!</div>

In fact, while I was making out with her, I treated the session more of having sex with a gf than as engaging in commercial sex. During the session, everything I did with her was with passion. I acutally told her that I wished she was my gf, which she responded that I should perhaps marry her. I do not think that she said that in jest and I am actually comtemplating her suggestion. I know that she may be trying to find an easy route to a better life and I am not her only sex partner, but I am really having difficulties forgetting her. This Thai gal is pretty, caring and attentive and I believe that she would make a good gf/wife. What do the good people in this forum think? Am I crazy to fall in love with a prostitute?</div></blockquote>I tink you kena gong tao.... very common in thailan leh... go find a thai monk to cure u.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
