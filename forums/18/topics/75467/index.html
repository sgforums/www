            <div class='col-md body'>I had sex with a young Thai-Chinese gal in Bangkok just a few days again, and although I'm back in S'pore now, I could not get her off my mind. In fact, while I was making out with her, I treated the session more of having sex with a gf than as engaging in commercial sex. During the session, everything I did with her was with passion. I acutally told her that I wished she was my gf, which she responded that I should perhaps marry her. I do not think that she said that in jest and I am actually comtemplating her suggestion. I know that she may be trying to find an easy route to a better life and I am not her only sex partner, but I am really having difficulties forgetting her. This Thai gal is pretty, caring and attentive and I believe that she would make a good gf/wife. What do the good people in this forum think? Am I crazy to fall in love with a prostitute?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Dangerboy_19792003:</div><div class="quote_body">I had sex with a young Thai-Chinese gal in Bangkok just a few days again, and although I'm back in S'pore now, I could not get her off my mind. In fact, while I was making out with her, I treated the session more of having sex with a gf than as engaging in commercial sex. During the session, everything I did with her was with passion. I acutally told her that I wished she was my gf, which she responded that I should perhaps marry her. I do not think that she said that in jest and I am actually comtemplating her suggestion. I know that she may be trying to find an easy route to a better life and I am not her only sex partner, but I am really having difficulties forgetting her. This Thai gal is pretty, caring and attentive and I believe that she would make a good gf/wife. What do the good people in this forum think? Am I crazy to fall in love with a prostitute?</div></blockquote>You still want to marry her? Eventhough she have slept with so many men after being with you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thai women (generally) are so very gentle and submissive, indeed they do make up good life long partners (hey, i dont go pros, just past experience). its no wonder dangerboy falls in love, and he'll probably want to marry all that he comes across.<br><br>actually thai pros are very poor thing, most are forced into it by the harsh condition in life. so please give them some respect in this forum.<br><br>i do agree that if given time, dangerboy will forget about the marriage thing. and shame on you dangerboy, for exploiting these poor girls.</div>
