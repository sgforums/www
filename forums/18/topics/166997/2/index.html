It quite a pity to know how  pathetic your life has come about. What has your society degrade you into? And I could had imagine the world which you come from lacks anything but brains and dignity. Or rather you had reflected badly on the world you come from. I'm quite surprised you are condone to a life where all the woman in your families and you knew live off their life by assisting men as sick as you are and yet you're so proudly owned. You must be really proud of it to give such a statement. So proud of your own mother/wife/girlfriend/sister serving sick man as brainless as you are making a living to support your futile existance in this world? I bet you can't even list a single contribution you had done to this world. I'm pretty fortunate that most of the female I knew couldn't even see you fitting of an intelligent  pest.  Frankly you does not impress us with any of your words except for that fact that awe us your incestious background.<br><br>I quite pity you of the kind of life you come from. Were you abused when young? Where you tramatised when you're a child? Hullucinating and living in the world of self pity and deception?<br><br>Educated, discreet, respectful,  - I think my pet dog has more education and respect than you. Maybe the following few words are more fitting to you.<br><br>Educated as a Chimpanze<br>Discreet as a Cockoo bird.<br>Respectful as a housefly on a piece of Dung<br><br>Interested in finding a female companion who enjoys showing me around - Pathetic that you are miser enough to even save little $$ visiting the escort svc and trying to find girls online?

You win on this one I had never seen a man as retarded as you are.  In fact spastic seems too intelligent a word to describe you.<br><br>Rainee: no, I am not working in Singapore - just visiting. So, forgive my ignorance not knowing that sin city prevents you from reading an internationally acclaimed encyclopedia. While you may have arranged yourself with an imposed limitation on your right to know and to learn, don't assume that everyone else is aware of your pitiful situation.<br>And something else, if you want to communicate coherently on an international message board, work on your (pigdin) english. - Yes we forgive you of your ignorance and we forgive you of your idiotic behaviour too. There's still a long list  to forgive don't wanna carrry on but you're right we are unable to read your online "Internationally acclaimed encyclopedia" Brittanica.com, you seems to live in a more "Higher learning" part of the world which your internet seems to be able to access.
