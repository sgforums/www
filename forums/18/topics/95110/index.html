            <div class='col-md body'>Do you remember how we first met? Ong had arranged a drinking bash and we ended up facing each other at the table, although I tried to glance in your direction ever so often I was too shy to strike up a conversation at first. I was really attracted to you and yes I did notice your confidence and good looks.<br><br>The drinks loosened everything and everybody up and pretty soon we were talking like old chums. You offered to give me a lift home because I halfway there, I accepted partly because of the novelty and flattery of being driven home by a pretty girl like yourself at the first meeting but mostly because I couldnÂ’t tell my left leg from my right.<br><br>Somewhere along the way you gave me your number (I have to confess I donÂ’t know when or how) and on waking up the next day called you when I realized I had left my new cigarette case somewhere and Â“did I leave it in your car?Â”<br><br>You have to agree that things went on pretty good from there and although I initially resisted you moving in because I was worried about you Â‘cramping my styleÂ’, the curtains slowly evolved to some corny floral pattern you liked and the CD case was increasingly filled with your soppy Â‘love lasts foreverÂ’ love songs.<br><br>I guess it all stated unraveling when I had to do that project in Bhutan, I remember looking forward to hearing your voice everyday and talking about how much we missed each other and the little things like Â“what did you have for lunch?Â”. Those mindless conversations made me miss you so much that my heart would literally ache. The second week the calls were started to go unanswered and you were increasingly busy or doing your hair when I did manage to get you.<br><br>You shouldnÂ’t have gone there, you must have known that Brandon was an old school mate and that he would tell me, didnÂ’t you?  I think you must have intended to send me a message, but I have to say you could have done it in a less hurting manner. You didnÂ’t have to ask Brandon to get you a room upstairs and bring those two guys up with you. Yes I know you have said time and again that Â‘we only went up for a drink because the club was closingÂ’ but I think that was just regret talking, wasnÂ’t it?<br><br>I have never told you this but I read your filofax, I read your mindless notations on the days you had sex with that guy who worked in shipping and drove some fancy car and the days when the sex was good.  Reading your scribbled notations was like an arrow through the heart. My only consolation is that I knew our relantionship would go wrong for didnÂ’t somebody say that love reaps no interest?<br><br>I guess all good things must end but I hope you know that we had something special and you threw it away like a dirty rag. I sincerely hope you find happiness and that life treats you good. I wish you fond memories of the times we shared for they are gone forever and life brings but little joy.<br><br>Left<br></div>
