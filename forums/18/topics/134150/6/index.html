Just a mear "O" Level. Secondly..I'm not defending for a space neither am I fighting for a space. I'm just another human like everyone else on earth why should I need to fight for a space?<br><br><strong>u guys have long way... and are struggling too keep your ass or lips tight over the basic issue of asian family values...<br></strong><br>Please explain to me what is the basic issue of asian family values? To me...no matter what kind of family I'm in...Love is what I respect and follow. I love my parents and I love my siblings and I take good care of them. So what's the issue here? Before you try to convince me about the family value issue..please do ask yourself what's your family issue and looked back and ask yourself how much have you done for the family.<br><br><strong>if gays have been an acceptable by society since long long ago, long long by now the straights would have been the minority... </strong><br>How do you know that str8s are minority and queers are minority? You count them?<br><br><strong>yah... yah... u can say the state of mind... blah... blah... but look around you... ... if u really think the society is open... then go to your employer and HR dept and let them know that you are a gay.. and proud of it as well... see what happens... </strong><br>I'm proud of you..you actually am so honest about your personal life to your employers and HR. What has my personal life gotta do with my work? And besides...my ex-boss knew I'm gay..everyone in the office knew. One thing..I never ANNOUNCED that i'm gay..they just happen to know and I never deny. So? In fact my boss is quite impressed with my work and being gay doesn't make me worse or help me much in my work.<br><br></div>

Then 400 years ago, u must be one of the many fools who mainstreamly believed the Earth to be the center of the Universe. Or perhaps 2 millenias ago u were one of the fools who thought the earth was flat? Hey in their days, these were mainstream ideas, but did that mean they were right? Nooooooooo. It meant they were too narrow minded to be open to what may be the truth. Your fallacy in applying the logic that if it is mainstream, it must be right here is simply wrong.<br><br>As well, your lack of knowledge is also stunning. Homosexuality was widespread in ancient Greek and Roman societies. So yes Gays were not only, in your own words, "acceptable by society since long long ago", they were also considered as normal as being straight was. My suggestion to u is that if u want to argue your feeble arguments with historical references, maybe u better know what u are talking about 1st.<br><br>This brings us to the fact is that there is no wrong or right with regards to sexuality. In ancient Greek and Roma civilizations, there was no distinction between being "straight" or "homosexual". there will always be both straight and homosexual people, and the only reason that homosexuals are in the minority now is largely due to social conditioning. Many people who have had homosexual thoughts simply suppress them because they fear society will reject them. A fear which bigots like you happily spread, just because u are too narrow minded to see that something that is mainstream is not necessary right.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>I think homosexuality was also documented in ancient China, of all places. Some of the Chinese Emperors were known to be gay. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
