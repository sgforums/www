If you are a conscientious objector, you do not have to take part, so what's the problem?<br><br>The problem is that with an increasingly vocal gay community, detractors are concerned that their children may begin to feel that homosexuality is an acceptable alternative lifestyle, which goes against their religious and cultural beliefs. It is also difficult to argue against the rights of a parent to bring up his or her children after the religious and cultural norms of his family. Conflict becomes inevitable.<br><br>If the gay community in Singapore wants to avoid discrimination and the sort of robust opposition they have encountered in recent days, I suggest they should tone down and keep a low profile. The vast majority of the population in Singapore does not embrace homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. They can be persuaded to be accepting and tolerant of gay people provided homosexuals do not attempt to challenge the religious and cultural beliefs of the majority. The sort of gay activism we see in recent years will only serve to firm battle lines and inadvertently create a more homophobic population.</div></blockquote>1) Your point about gay community being vocal.<br><br>I don't think this is the case. The only occasions when we see any news about the gay circles are usually news made by the straight communities. For example, the Nation party, or a straight reporter pretending to be gay to go to a gay sauna, or the recent Aids issues. I have yet to see any gay groups standing up to fight for their rights. In fact, gay groups are not even allowed to be registered as a society, it is deemed illegal.<br><br>2) Discrimination.<br><br>The discrimination comes in with all the policies that favour married couples, especially with children. But the fact is, gays are contributing to the tax returns. Gays are discriminated even without the need to be vocal. Some of the rules include the purchase of flats, the grant given to married couples for flats. Sure, the rules are loosening up on the flat purchase, but that it's an after thought. After countless flats were left unoccupied. If this is not discrimination, what is?<br><br>3) "Out of sight, out of mind"<br><br>One of the "concerns" with the gay community seems to be the rampening aids. The best way to resolve the issue is not to clamp down Nation (Since flying to Bangkok cost only $100-$200 these days). The best solution is to recognise that gays exist. And a different tact and messaging is needed to reach this group. Pretending the group is non-existent will not resolve the underlying Aids problem. In fact, the police has been actively clamping down these advertisements campaign targetting at the gay population. Why? Because some kids took back some of these advert cards to their mother's horror. But wait, aren't these cards available only at gay spots? If their sons are not gays, why on earth would they visit a gay spot? Keep denying the problem will not resolve the problem.<br><br>4) Promoting alternative lifestyle<br><br>There are tonnes of papers that suggest that gays are borned, not made. Although there is one paper published by Robert Spitzer about ex-gays. You will realise that something is wrong with his sample and data collection mode. He did not even bother to find out whether his sample is exclusively gays? bisexuals? or straights (since 15% of them did not have sex with the same gender before). At the end of the day, if you are gay, just accept your orientation and move on. If you are not gay, chances of you "trying out" the circle is minute cause the circle isn't as "exciting" or "fun" as assumed by many others.<br><br>5) I applaud you<br><br>Finally, thanks for bringing up such valid points instead of pure bashing. And for that, I salute you.</div>

For that reason, subsidised public housing and even certain resale flats at one time were not available to singles like myself. So this form of discrimination is not targeted at the gay community.
