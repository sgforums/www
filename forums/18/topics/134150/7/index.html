These bi-montly talks are organized in association with Looking Glass - an email counseling service by women for women. For more information on Looking Glass, visit http://www.geocities.com/lookgglass/<br><br>Most of us long to be in relationships with that special someone. And yet we find a multitude of challenges Â– from lack of role models, social support to dealing with our own and our partnerÂ’s hangups Â– pop up before us constantly. What makes a healthy relationship? How do we deal with trials that pop up in every relationship? How do we negotiate our relationship commitments? What sacrifices do we have to make to maintain a relationship? How do our biological families fit in, if at all?<br>Come and hear our panel of gay and lesbian persons share the up-downs and sorrows-joys of their relationships. Walk with Kim as he shares about the twist and turns of his 20-year partnership with Leong. Share with Cephas and Elsin about the thrills and challenges of being in love with another woman and Jo and Jorg about their long distance stint and why they decided to get married after a 10-year partnership. And for good measure, Lehlim a married mother of two toddlers will share her own journey of life and growth with Kim her husband and children.<br><br>The panelist will share the lessons they've learnt about being human, being strong, finding empathy and learning to love from their unique and yet common journeys. Come hear them share about their ups and downs, their own growth and the celebration of each others' lives. The sharing will be followed by a question and answer time and hopefully we grow together from this mutual sharing.<br><br>Topic: Loving A Partner Â– What It Means and What It Takes?<br>Date: Tuesday, 5 July 2005<br>Venue: Utterly Art, 208 South Bridge Rd, #02-01<br>Time:<br>7.30pm - 8.15pm : Panel Sharing<br>8.15pm - 8.45pm : Questions and Discussion<br>8.45pm - 9.00pm : Summary and Thoughts<br>9.00 - 9.30pm : Light Refreshments<br><br>Admission is free.<br></div>
