That's more sick I think.<br><br>I've known of les couples who had been together since they are in their 20s and now they are old woman in their 80s and still as loving. That kind of love is what I admire and respect. It's not about being homosexual or hetersexual but more like how much do you love your partner and how much are both willing to give each other and for how long.</div>

No matter how my child is, he/she will always be my child and the one and only I love and protect with my life. Who am I to tell him/her what is right and wrong when there's no definitions to that? All I can tell them is, don't break the law and being homosexual isn't breaking the law. It's the sex that breaks the law.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>HOMOPHOBIA</strong> is...<br><br>...the irrational hatred, intolerance, and fear of lesbian, gay and bisexual people.<br><br>its like calling someone a "faggot", "butch". Its the belief that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is "just a phase", that same sex attraction is unnatural, sick abnormal.<br><br>Homophobia hurts EVERYONE. Like racism, sexism and other forms of prejudice, homophobia makes society a much more unsafe and restrictive place for people to live.<br><br><strong>HETEROSEXISM</strong> is...<br><br>...the assumption that everyone is heterosexual and that being heterosexual is better, preferable or superior to being lesbian, gay or bisexual. It's the belief that heterosexual or mixed sex relationships are somehow better than same sex relationships.<br><br>It's the belief that only straight people should be allowed to marry or raise families. It's the idea that lesbian, gay and bisexual people are demanding "special status" when they ask for basic civil rights such as the right to safety at work, in the home or on the street. Heterosexism allows straight couples to walk down the street holding hands, whilst same sex couples are accused of "flaunting" their sexuality by doing the same thing.<br><br><strong>TRANSPHOBIA</strong> is...<br><br>...the irrational hatred, intolerance, and fear of transgender and transsexual people.<br><br>It's the belief that transsexual women are not "real women" and that transsexual men are not "real men". It's the assumption that transgender people are sick or psychologically unstable. It's the belief that transsexual people are only acceptable if they "pass". It's the belief that transsexuals are gay people who cannot accept their sexual orientation and so undergo gender reassignment to hide their true nature.<br><br>Transphobia hurts EVERYONE. Sexism and gender stereotypoing are some of the root causes of homophobia, forcing everyone into strict gender roles.<br><br>I conclude by saying anyone who is into transphobia, heterosexism or homophobia, are no better than the white people when they were being racist in Africa, nor are they better than the KKK.</div>
