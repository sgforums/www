            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Housing policies in Singapore reflect the society and the government's stated objective of promoting core family values. For that reason, subsidised public housing and even certain resale flats at one time were not available to singles like myself. So this form of discrimination is not targeted at the gay community. As for taxes, I can honestly say that I pay far more taxes than my married colleagues and consume less of the society's resources. Of course it's not fair for me...<br><br>The fact is that my single lifestyle and the gay lifestyle of some others fall outside the mainstream of society. Singlehood and homosexuality are not considered to be desirable traits in our society and so we are 'tolerated', as long as we keep our personal preferences to ourselves. To demand for more egalitarian treatment is to challenge the deeply held values of the majority at a time when the society is, by and large, not ready for such a change.<br><br>I fear a backlash is building up against the gay community as a result and it is quite conceivable that even the few liberties that were once permitted would now be withdrawn. I see the issue involving the gay parties as a case in point.</div></blockquote>1) Single cannot be equated with gays<br><br>Thank you for bringing this up. And I totally agree. In fact, you have just put forth an argument for gay marriage without realising it. Yes, Single is just a sub-set of Straights, be it male or female. However, in the gay community, there are single, those in monogamous relationship, those in open relationship, etc, etc... Why can't a monogamous relationship between 2 persons of the same gender be considered as a marriage? At the end of the day, isn't this the definition of marriage? Singlehood can be a choice, but being gay is not.. As a gay, you can choose to remain single, or you can choose to settle down. If you decide to settle down, do you have sex in your parent's house? Do you see the complexity of the issue now? Unless you want to claim that all gays should be like single.. But we are not, as clearly pointed out by you in your argument.<br><br>I know I've jumped the gun.. But just listing this as a discussion point.<br><br>2) A clearer discrimination<br><br>Okay, let me point out an even more fundamental discrimination then. In Singapore, the only permitted sex is the "regular" intercourse with a male genital and a female genital. You can perform fellatio (oral sex) but only as a foreplay. You can not have oral sex just for the sake of having it. All other kind of sex can be criminised. Do you consider this as a discrimination then?<br><br>3) Gay lifestyle<br><br>Most people use the term Gay lifestyle and gay community interchangeably. Or more specific, they use gay lifestyle in a degrading manner to describe the hedonistic lifestyle which involves only sauna, pub, gym, bedroom. The gay community has a part to play in giving this impression. But then, the hedonistic lifestyle is not the only lifestyle in the gay community. Very much like a single lifestyle. A single can be single because he prefers the freedom? Couldnt find a mate? Not active in looking one? etc, etc, etc.. The same thing can be said of the gay community.<br><br>4) Backlash<br><br>I have addressed this issue earlier. Since the formation of gay groups are disallowed officially. Gays do not have weights in the political arena. Simple as that. You have been talking about gays fighting for rights. Yes, it might be the case in San Francisco, in New York, in other parts of the world. But definitely not in Singapore. Hence, where's the backlash. If you have any specific examples, could you please bring it up?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Why can't a monogamous relationship between 2 persons of the same gender be considered as a marriage? At the end of the day, isn't this the definition of marriage?<br></blockquote>This may be what you want marriage to mean but that is certainly not the current definition in many jurisdictions. Legally, marriage is a contract that has implications relating to numerous issues such as inheritance, property, child custody, etc. To recognize same sex marriage will involve a very fundamental re-look at many legal issues. It is not impossible, but there many legal obstacles to overcome, and that's the reason even the UK is not keen to change the current definition.<br><br><blockquote>You can not have oral sex just for the sake of having it. All other kind of sex can be criminised. Do you consider this as a discrimination then?<br></blockquote>You are alluding to the Chief Justice's ruling on an earlier case. The issue is whether oral sex falls under the definition of 'intercourse against the order of nature' in section 377 of the penal Code:<br><br>"Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine."<br><br>The CJ indeed ruled that oral sex is considered an unnatural act unless it is part of foreplay, prior to usual sexual intercourse. There has been legal debate about this ruling but it is not directed at gay people. In fact, the case in question involved heterosexual activity. Oral sex alone between man and woman is illegal, based on the current understanding of the law.<br><br>Is this discrimination? Back to my argument about how you cannot leave moral and religious questions out of this debate. The reason why this offence of unnatural carnal intercourse appears almost draconian (maximum punishment is life imprisonment) is because it has come to us right out of the pages of the Bible:<br><br>Eg. " 'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads." Lev 20:13<br><br>At a time when society regarded the teachings of the Bible to be the basis of social behaviour, the laws reflect such a view. What I am saying is that our society still holds these values and does not intend to change them.<br><br><blockquote>they use gay lifestyle in a degrading manner to describe the hedonistic lifestyle which involves only sauna, pub, gym, bedroom. </blockquote>No, that is not my understanding of the term 'gay lifestyle'. That is reading too much into the phrase. I am a simple man. I understand it to mean the way of life for a gay person, period.<br><br>You take pains to argue that because gays are born, society must allow them liberty to live as they have been designed to do, even if the majority feels repugnant by that behaviour.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">This may be what you want marriage to mean but that is certainly not the current definition in many jurisdictions. Legally, marriage is a contract that has implications relating to numerous issues such as inheritance, property, child custody, etc. To recognize same sex marriage will involve a very fundamental re-look at many legal issues. It is not impossible, but there many legal obstacles to overcome, and that's the reason even the UK is not keen to change the current definition.<br></div></blockquote>Marriage in the most fundamental sense is the union of 2 people. Law has make it complicated. Yes, you have brought up many issues like inheritance, property, child custody, etc... But other than the child custody, shouldn't inheritance and property affect gays too. After the passing away of one of the gay couple, shouldn't he pass on the property, money, etc to his other half, by default? As for child custody, what's the difference between a gay couple and a couple that does not reproduce? There is a difference between what is right in principle and what is right based on the law. It's even worse to argue that it's difficult to change the legal constitution and hence, let's do nothing about it. But then again, I did mention that I've jumped the gun a bit. We have not even address the more fundamental issue yet. That of gay sex being criminised.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">You are alluding to the Chief Justice's ruling on an earlier case. The issue is whether oral sex falls under the definition of 'intercourse against the order of nature' in section 377 of the penal Code:<br><br>"Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine."<br><br>The CJ indeed ruled that oral sex is considered an unnatural act unless it is part of foreplay, prior to usual sexual intercourse. There has been legal debate about this ruling but it is not directed at gay people. In fact, the case in question involved heterosexual activity. Oral sex alone between man and woman is illegal, based on the current understanding of the law.<br></div></blockquote>I dont know why you can't see the difference between how such a ruling has different implication between the gays and the straights. The straights can continue to have "natural" intercourse. But the gays can't. They will have to end off with anal sex which is again, being criminalised. Hope I am as clear as I can now. Oral sex by itself = criminalised.. Anal sex after oral sex = criminalised.<br></div>

Back to my argument about how you cannot leave moral and religious questions out of this debate. The reason why this offence of unnatural carnal intercourse appears almost draconian (maximum punishment is life imprisonment) is because it has come to us right out of the pages of the Bible:<br><br>Eg. " 'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads." Lev 20:13<br><br>At a time when society regarded the teachings of the Bible to be the basis of social behaviour, the laws reflect such a view. What I am saying is that our society still holds these values and does not intend to change them.<br></div></blockquote>Yes, I agree that religion is the biggest obstacle to gays having rights now. But wait, isn't it just Christianity. Or Christian fundamentalist? There are progressive church elsewhere in the world that do not hold so much grudge against gays. Have you ever questioned why? Differences in the interpretation of the bible?<br><br>An even more fundamental question is Singapore is a multi racial, multi religions society. So must the law but based on Christianity? Some kind of egoistic beliefs on your part?<br><br>And where did you quote the Book of Leviticus from? Or which translation did you use? Based on the following link:<br>http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=3&amp;chapter=18&amp;version=31<br>The actual quote from the book is "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable." Where does the part on "They must be put to death" come into picture?<br><br>Among other things, the same book also has this paragraphs:<br>"Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams, you may eat any that have fins and scales. 10 But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scalesÂ—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the waterÂ—you are to detest. 11 And since you are to detest them, you must not eat their meat and you must detest their carcasses. 12 Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be detestable to you."<br><br>Which means people who eat prawns are as detestable than people who lie with a man. In fact, People who eat prawns should even be more detestable since the bible devoted a whole paragraphs just to condemn these people. Is this your stand?<br></div>

You have effectively done a Dan Brown here. The fact that homosexuality has been removed from psychopathology is a fact. The rest is obviously false. I happened to be a graduate in Psychology and currently working as a Psychologist. The main reason why homosexuality was removed was because it is not seen as an abnormality anymore. Period. But then, Psychology is a huge area. There's a new field set up which is devoted to studying homosexuality.<br><br>http://www.apa.org/about/division/div44.html<br>The American Psychological Society has set up a division that look into the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Issues.
