It's the bases for most people who don't think homosexuality is right.

You're more likely to see a bigger gap in your age groups.<br><br>Social evloution, a little, yes.  It also shows the results from the darker side of our society leaving behind moral ethics and values.  Homosexuality is a result of social environments in many cases (i'd like to believe all of them but I know many would disagree).  It could be just me but the people who I have met or actually known who are or have been or thought about being gays and or lesbians became so only after a traumatic event (plus gradual events leading up to), not so great home life (single parent, unhappy and fighting parents), stress or were rebelling against the 'strict social order'.  I know some scientists have tried to prove that it's in the DNA but from my personal experience, I don't buy it one bit.<br><br>Now that everyone knows where I stand, I just like to add that no I don't believe in condeming anyone for whatever choices they make.  Especially, in the name of God.  He's the judge and well, none of us are part of the jury.  It does say in the bible to love the sinner and hate the sin.  For those who dislike gays and lesbians, show a little love.

It's the bases for most people who don't think homosexuality is right.  What other ways would you like to look at it?<br><br>From a practical (scientific) point of view, Homosexuality is no good either.  Such a union does not contribute to the population.  You're more likely to see a bigger gap in your age groups.<br><br>Social evloution, a little, yes.  It also shows the results from the darker side of our society leaving behind moral ethics and values.  Homosexuality is a result of social environments in many cases (i'd like to believe all of them but I know many would disagree).  It could be just me but the people who I have met or actually known who are or have been or thought about being gays and or lesbians became so only after a traumatic event (plus gradual events leading up to), not so great home life (single parent, unhappy and fighting parents), stress or were rebelling against the 'strict social order'.  I know some scientists have tried to prove that it's in the DNA but from my personal experience, I don't buy it one bit.<br><br>Now that everyone knows where I stand, I just like to add that no I don't believe in condeming anyone for whatever choices they make.  Especially, in the name of God.  He's the judge and well, none of us are part of the jury.  It does say in the bible to love the sinner and hate the sin.  For those who dislike gays and lesbians, show a little love.  If I am right (which I think I am here *read above), love is just something that missing here.</div></blockquote>Bigger age gap? Isn't it because the straights are not producing as much as they used to? But how would being gay be immoral? Just like all Jews are immoral to you? Or 200 years ago when Niggers are treated as a sub-class of human beings?<br><br>You idea about traumatic events and problematic families makes me laugh.. So now we have the license to blame everything on our parents?<br><br>I have cut and paste a very interesting article below.. Do take some time to read.. Esp the conclusion.. It might raise more questions than it gives you answer.. But then, it's a more accurate reflection of the true state than the Freudian perspective you stated earlier..<br><br>http://www.leaderu.com/jhs/satinover.html<br><br>As to you comment abt God love the sinner, hate the sin.. I think it's hypocrisy.. If a gay does not engage sex with the same gender, he/she will not be a gay anymore..</div>

China's population is growing because people are chauvanistic and sexist and so they give birth till they get a boy???<br><br>Ever heard of China's one-child policy?<br><br>OK, there are exceptional cases where people can get away with it, but the cases are so small that they don't contribute to the entire population growth.
