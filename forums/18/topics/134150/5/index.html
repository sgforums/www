Was trying to find out the context which this was written and the following paragraph holds the key:<br><br>"21For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. "<br><br>I finally understands why Christian gays are so confused. According to the above, if you do not believe in God, you will turn into gays. If you believe in God, you will not become gays.<br><br>Let's just do a simple observation. How many of your Atheistic friends are Straights (aplenty I guess, but why arent they gay since they do not believe in God)? And how many of your Christian friends are gays (smaller number but still quite a handful but how would that possible? They believe in God, didnt they?).<br><br>Viola! The argument surrounding the above paragraph is disproved.<br><br>In fact, you can type Christian gays in google to look at some of these groups. They love Jesus and God as much as the other churches. And yet, why can't their sexual orientation changed by their beliefs in God and Jesus?<br><br>Or if you have the chance, go watch "Angels In America". A HBO produced mini-series. A Mormon gay gets married and fight his inner "demons" (demons only in his eyes) for 6 years without wanting to have sex with his wife. A long six years. The only thing he had gotten is complete sexual abstinence, a very confused mind, but not in the change of his sexual orientation.<br><br>I know using a drama might not be the best line of argument. But it does contain certain truth. Since we all know Christian gay friends struggling to find meaning in life.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<br><strong><br>There are other passages on this subject but the wording requires an understanding of the original Greek, as the wording is less obvious, being translated into words like 'perverts' as in 1 Tim 1:10.</strong></div></blockquote><strong>I will not be too alerted if the word "perverts" appear everytime without linking directly with gays.

The term "perverts" can refer to anything, like what you have said. It is a categorical label. Without defining it, no one will exactly know what does it mean.<br><br>In Buddhism, "sexual pervasions" are linked to "sexual misconducts" activities. It's based on principles. It encourages tolerance and the interpretation of Buddha scriptures based on context. Do read the following article for more info:<br>http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_budd.htm<br><br>When such a word in used in a categorical manner in a sentence, you have to ascertain the meaning of that word before judging whether it's applicable to the sentence.<br><br>Very much like the "too much voice will draw backlash" example earlier. It's only through much discussion that we've agreed the too much noise can be used to refer to gay parties and nothing else.</div>

However, if you are interested in anal sex, and fearful of whether it will bring harm to your spouse, please refer to the following website written by straights and for straights:<br><br>http://www.askmen.com/love/love_tip/sextip20.html<br><br>For your second question. Nope, I'm not a confused gay. I'm rather clear of what I need. I used to have a girlfriend prior to coming out. But I couldn't even bring myself to hold her hand. She broke up with me after 6 months, citing reason that she didn't feel my love. I'm glad for her, actually. Else, I would have misled a nice girl into a relationship which will cause more harm than good to her.<br><br>And asking a gay whether they have screwed a straight woman or not is similar to asking you whether you have screwed a man or not.<br><br>Finally, from your post, it reflects your state of mind. The ability to process only one single piece of information at a time. However, if you can broaden your mind, able to see diversity in things. You will find yourself more accepting. This world is in such turmoil now because of such narrow-mindedness.</div>

Living like sheep blindly follwing the leader, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, does not appeal to me.

Then 400 years ago, u must be one of the many fools who mainstreamly believed the Earth to be the center of the Universe. Or perhaps 2 millenias ago u were one of the fools who thought the earth was flat? Hey in their days, these were mainstream ideas, but did that mean they were right? Nooooooooo. It meant they were too narrow minded to be open to what may be the truth. Your fallacy in applying the logic that if it is mainstream, it must be right here is simply wrong.<br><br>As well, your lack of knowledge is also stunning. Homosexuality was widespread in ancient Greek and Roman societies. So yes Gays were not only, in your own words, "acceptable by society since long long ago", they were also considered as normal as being straight was. My suggestion to u is that if u want to argue your feeble arguments with historical references, maybe u better know what u are talking about 1st.<br><br>This brings us to the fact is that there is no wrong or right with regards to sexuality. In ancient Greek and Roma civilizations, there was no distinction between being "straight" or "homosexual". there will always be both straight and homosexual people, and the only reason that homosexuals are in the minority now is largely due to social conditioning. Many people who have had homosexual thoughts simply suppress them because they fear society will reject them. A fear which bigots like you happily spread, just because u are too narrow minded to see that something that is mainstream is not necessary right.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
