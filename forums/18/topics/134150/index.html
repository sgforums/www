It's the bases for most people who don't think homosexuality is right.  What other ways would you like to look at it?<br><br>From a practical (scientific) point of view, Homosexuality is no good either.  Such a union does not contribute to the population.  You're more likely to see a bigger gap in your age groups.<br><br>Social evloution, a little, yes.  It also shows the results from the darker side of our society leaving behind moral ethics and values.  Homosexuality is a result of social environments in many cases (i'd like to believe all of them but I know many would disagree).  It could be just me but the people who I have met or actually known who are or have been or thought about being gays and or lesbians became so only after a traumatic event (plus gradual events leading up to), not so great home life (single parent, unhappy and fighting parents), stress or were rebelling against the 'strict social order'.  I know some scientists have tried to prove that it's in the DNA but from my personal experience, I don't buy it one bit.<br><br>Now that everyone knows where I stand, I just like to add that no I don't believe in condeming anyone for whatever choices they make.  Especially, in the name of God.  He's the judge and well, none of us are part of the jury.  It does say in the bible to love the sinner and hate the sin.  For those who dislike gays and lesbians, show a little love.  If I am right (which I think I am here *read above), love is just something that missing here.</div>

Singapore is trying to increase the birth rate, so should condemn it for the time being.</div></blockquote>You're taking my point all the way to outer space.<br><br>We all know why China has a population problem, it's got more to do with the male chauvinistic/sexist ideas of the Chinese culture.  Give birth until you get a boy.<br><br>My point is that homosexuality is un-natural even from a scientific point of view.  If it wasn't then male-male or female-female relations should bear 'fruit', should it not?  Like I said, homosexuality is a product of society not nature.   Look at animals without "social skills", you do see male dogs humping on male dogs, do you?  Their function to reproduce wouldn't work very well, would it?</div>
