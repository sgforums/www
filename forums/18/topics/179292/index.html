Where if you do it over a long period of time you become better and better at it.<br><br>After a gambling the stock market for a thousand years does not mean that your luck will become good all the time after that. It is and will always be dependant of luck even after a thousand years.<br><br>As long as it depends on luck, everybody sooner or later runs out of luck and lose all their money.<br><br>If you are lucky and make money, the market is always there waiting for you to run out of luck.<br><br></div>
