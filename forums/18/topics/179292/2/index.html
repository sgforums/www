That with proper planning and study; one can actually predict the direction of the price movement. They do not see that you can plan and study all you want but it still boils down to luck.<br><br>I am not saying that there is an element of luck; I am saying that it is pure luck all the way. That you win because of planning and study is an illusion. The markets have discounted everything. The unknown cannot be predicted and can only be guessed at and so luck is paramount. When it is dependant on luck, gamblers speculating the stock markets and playing the casino will end up losers, big time.<br><br>There is also the problem of "mental illness" that precludes your abilty to control yourself when you are a pathological gambler.<br><br><strong>So Problem gamblers should be seeking help even if they are in the winning phase. But they never will until they have attempted suicide.</strong></div>
