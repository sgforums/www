He is to be commended.  His wife had no right to assault him and if I were him I would go to the police if she does it anymore.  Ding, grow some balls man.  Don't let people hit you without giving it back to them with a thousand times more force.  You really should start considering whether this is the type of wife you want.  Do you want to tolerate this type of behaviour from her for the rest of your life?  I know what I would do if I were in your situation but you should at least consider a divorce.</div>
