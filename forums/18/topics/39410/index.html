            <div class='col-md body'>www.toostupidtobepresident.com<br><br>I mean no harm or insult to anyone, I just want to change your thinking...if it needs changing by now.<br><br>Ok... from all the material that I have read in the previous forum topic "are caucasians better" or some silly title like that. The material is stuff from talking cock. com; as well as some posts from asian men. This material has convinced me of the following in S'pore:<br>1. Caucasians (at least you people think so) are better than Asians; in terms of appearance, vocals, love etc etc.2<br>2. You people like or want to have a caucasian love partner<br>3. You people are jealous that others have a caucasian love partner if you do not.<br>4. SPGs are only attracted to caucasians...and in engaging in relationships with them, they believe that they are higher in status than their asian compatriots who don't have caucasian partners.<br>5. You people think that association with any caucasian object (clubs, "angmoh" places to even the caucasian in the flesh) sets you at a higher standard than others who do not.<br>6. some singaporeans get hair dye and fake contact lens to look more caucasian... aka maybe spgs.<br><br>Make no mistake when I say "you people" i am referring to the people in that particular forum.<br><br>I am sad that you people think this way...although none of you openly say those 5 points, I can decipher and sense it by reading your angry posts full of hate.<br><br>Ok my main point is this... Why do you all have this kind of thinking? Can anyone tell me why?<br><br>Firstly I want to say, you are all wrong in your thinking. Caucasians are not better, and even if you are thinking of saying shit like "most of them are", it is not true.<br><br>I am guessing that you only think this way because of the films that depict being caucasian as glamorous, you also think this way because of some racists caucasians are insulting with their white supremacy nonsense.<br><br>And sometimes the way you talk is like, anyone can get a gf/bf if he is white...but it is simply not true. I know many of my caucasian friends who cant get a girl friend in Singapore, I am one of them, and although I wish I am like some of the local guys (so i can be accepted), I don't feel frustrated against any race. So my point is, not all white people can find partners...so your thinking is wrong.<br><br>And last note: You cannot judge the entire batch of caucasians by just a few bad relationships... neither can you say white is the best cos they get more gfs and bfs... this thinking is wrong and disgraceful, pls snap out of it. There are nice asians and there are nice caucasians, there are nasty ones too. So that's about all i have to say.</div>
