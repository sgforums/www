It does not mean that she has any special feelings for that guy.  Just that maybe bec they are such good friends she was willing to forgive.<br><br>I think as a lifestyle, whether fren or not, it is always good to forgive otherwise, it will be hard for the person emotionally and mentally to move on.  It sounds like she has moved on.<br><br>meetin once in a blue moon should not be a problem... but raise your concern to her that she ought to be very careful when meeting that guy.  But as to whether you have a say in her breaking off all contacts, that is difficult to say.  If you trust her and she is a sensible person capable of taking care of herself, she has the right to decide.  Just voice your love and concern that you do not want her to be harmed by this guy and tell her to be careful.  she will appreciate you more that way than if you tell her "STOP!"<br><br>As to whether is there any issue with someone who has been molested etc... She was violated.  How can anyone use that against her... least of all a bf or someone who is interested.  so I would not have any issue with it.<br><br>Just ask her to be very careful<br><br></div>
