Last week, a young lady was sitting alone at 1 of the 2 seats, falling asleep. The seat beside here was left empty.<br><br>Then, the door opened and in rushed a bunch of Aunties. Of course, 1 of the Power Aunties spotted the empty seat and whizzed to sit there. Another of her buddy whizzed there as well and actually attempted to squeeze in between her &amp; the young lady!!! How can the 2-seater area accomodate a gal &amp; 2 BigMAc size Aunities!?!?! Of course, the way she thumped her weight onto the poor sleeping lady jolted her from her beauty sleep, while the spectators watched in unbelief.<br><br>Fortunately, the latter Auntie realised the impossibility of the task and chose to stand instead.... Phew........</div></blockquote>Yeah... Think I've seen something like this before...??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reminds me of this another weird and funny incident...<br><br>I was trying to rush for a train transfer one day.. Then there was this UNCLE infront of me... At 1st taking his own sweet time and blocking up the way.. When I tried to ask him to let me through the escalator to catch the train, he just walk upwards (quite slowly) instead of letting me through.. On that level, he then realised that his train (the one I wanted to catch) was there....<br><br>Now here is the DRAMATIC PART.. People were getting out from the train... I tried to cut (overtake) him at 1st as he was VERY SLOW.. He upon his realisation.. He started to swing his arms VERY RAPIDLY (like what they do in a walk-a-jog) but didn't move an inch! It was SO CARTOON!! And I was like expecting him to AT LEAST make a slow run or something... He REALLY DIDN'T MOVE AT ALL...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> "<br><br>In the end I was like totally GAVE UP and went for the other door instead..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
