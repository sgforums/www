              <p>Thanks that you give a reasonable reply! I think in most cases you are absolutely right.</p>
              <p>Originally my Claudia  wanted to try it "only for once" with a young thai guy. She told me openly that she felt (..and still feels) sexually very much attracted by the dark smooth hair, black eyes, the athletic bodies and the soft skin of some young thai guys. Attributes which I, as slightly overweighted westener, can not bring with me.</p>
              <p>On the other hand my girlfriend is quite aware that there is a deep cultural gap between her and the type of guys she favours. So a relationsship of whatsoever kind was NEVER planned...and in no case with a paid money boy (...which usually guarantees that it IS and WILL be only about sex).</p>
              <p>But not all things go as planned, especially when it comes to love and sex: I cannot  not deny that my girl felt an --emotional attachment-- after he gave her that perfect sex she dreamed of and after they came together a couple of times in a Bangkok hotel room.</p>
              <p>The young guy was clever enough to find out that she got more emotionally involved than planned and he was willing to get much more money and fun out of my girl. When he succeeded to break my weak resistance and deliberately humiliated me in front of my girl with his macho-behaviour, Claudia did not oppose any longer her 'take over' by the young dominating guy. To the contrary, in the long discussion we had later back in Germany, she honestly admitted to me that she wanted her 'take over'  at that stage as much as the thai guy wanted it. Although she knew all of it was unreasonable and much unfair to me, and although she was for the guy a walking ATM and big fun.....she still wanted <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HIM</span></strong> to bed her for the rest of our holiday. If there is an emotional attachment the cruel laws of attraction favour the stronger guy with the better skills and there seems to be no space for reasonable behaviour: I had to accept to share my girl with a young thai or otherwise lose her.</p>

              <p>Simply you have two options.  1. Dump her. 2. Stay with her.</p>
              <p>Your sense of maturity, compassion is being appealed to accept her as she is. That she is a human being. Forgive her past and all that. You still love her. These are  the same reasonings used by a guy who wants to marry a prostitute. This is only one side of the coin. Your side. The relationship may work or it may not. It will be a constant struggle dealing with thoughts of the past, it will not disappear because <strong>it is there</strong> all the time.</p>
              <p>The other side of the coin is her side. What are her feelings towards you, now? She cannot forget the tryst in Thailand. It will always be there in her mind. Whether she can deal with it successfully or not, no one knows. But like it or not, she should be considered spoilt. Physically she is alright, (if she hasn't caught AIDS), but mentally she's ruined, as far as you are concerned. You would be for the lifestyle she is accustomed to in Germany, while her heart and mind would be in Thailand. That could be the context of her relationship with you. She would want that dream holiday again.</p>
              <p>Also consider, like a junkie, she could be could be cured or have a relapse.</p>
              <p>Now, what do you want? Think carefully, what do you want in life? And then make your decision. You have to consider the effects of the events that happened in Thailand, and how the both of you would deal with it in later life.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hallo,</p>
              <p>thank you for your advice and not using abusive language.</p>
              <p>Yes, I am still together with my girlfriend. Indeed, Claudia has become my fiance. I know quite well, if we go again to South East Asia for the next holiday....it will happen again, and I know I will have to accept it or lose my girl. Having sex with the young thai was one of her best experiences she had and of course she cannot simply forget it. Anyone knows that the sex drive is a very strong one, and well, if you want something special you might become a junkie. But she will not have sex with ANY young asian. SHE will look for a suitable partner by her self and SHE will chose a young strong dragon for sex...but again, ONLY for sex.</p>
              <p>Claudia knows that I went public with her Bangkok sex affair on the internet and she did not oppose it. Instead, when I told her that I want to go public to find out if other western guys had also to share their girls with young asians, she was first surprised but then she laughed at me. In the end she gave me a hug and a kiss and said I could go public if it helps me. So I did and published everything first in 2007 on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.personalthailand.com/">www.personalthailand.com</a>  where there was an article about western girls who pay for sex with young asians. A lot of western wifes must accept that their husbands have sex with young thai girls....but it is a total taboo if a white ladies takes an athletic young thai to penetrate her. If someone of our families or friends in Europe would find out that she had spread her legs to get insaminated by a 20 year old thai boy in a Bangkok hotel room, it will be an absolute catastrophal situation for the both of us.</p>
              <p>My girl loves sex and she is honest enough to me to say that she prefers mostly  young asian guys for sex. But it is not only and all the time about sex. It is also about playing around with guys, making them hot and disappointing them. For instance, last summer a guy from Taiwan joined the same seminar at the Uni in Berlin my girl was in. This guy was eagerly trying to get a white girlfriend. Although Claudia told me she did not like him much enough to consider to get bedded, she played with him and made him hot. He started calling our home to date her (...and I became jealous again). Finally she went out with him to a beer garden on a hot summer day, only to introduce me as her boyfriend. I could see how the guy was really desperate after her and we all got a little bit drunk. At some point Claudia went to the toilet, took of her panties from under her summer skirt, went back to our table and gave him her panties in front of me. Then she told him to piss of....she did not want to see him anymore and I was really happy on the one hand  but on the other hand aslo jealous because of the panties. The guy grabbed the panties and we never heared of him again. I asked her why she did this and she told me she did not consider to get bedded but on the other hand she found the idea "amusing" (that is how she called it) that this guy would sniff her panties and later masturbates thinking of her.</p>
              <p>In daily life we understand very good and we have seldom any arguments, it is only the sexual side where she has maybe quite unusual urges. So it would be hard to say good-bye only because of sex-side of the coin. So I will go ahead with her and will have to accept it.</p>
              <p>I have put some pics from the internet on SGforums, which come close to the situation which I had to go through in Bangkok. They might symbolize my experience: Attractive white girlfriend which looks quite similar to Claudia, a thai gigolo who is sharpening his penis for white girls and so on....</p>
              <p>The only thing what I did in my desperate situation in Bangkok in 2007 (...in the nights when the thai gigolo bedded my girl in the Golden Palace Hotel some floors away from my room), were some sketches of HER and HIM. I draw this sketches jealously in my diary. I imagined how she met him, how they went to the room, how she paid him, how they got undressed....and how HE was finally was on HER. Trying to cope with what happened, this sketches and going public helped me a lot...you are so jealous, you somehow must try to imagine what they did when you are deliberately excluded....it is a real nightmare. Many times I imagined and sketched the positions they made it....his thrusting, her moaning, two young bodies sweating and fucking like wild animals! (...sorry for my language). But strange enough, after it happened, believe me, you do not disgust your girl but you even want her more into your bed back (probably instinctively trying to prove that YOU have the better skills them HIM! But you know well, it is too late, you are the boyfriend but for some holidays HE is the new boss in her bed. HE wants it, SHE wants it! It is a personal thing...and an indivdual way I cope with a situation that my girl was bedded from a thai and to know:SHE had fun! </p>

              <p>Hey RainerH,</p>
              <p>I feel kind of sad for you having to endure the "image" of your girlfriend with the Thai guy. I think that if it would happen to me, I would have pissed off and gave up on her. But that's your choice, you just have the scars of the Thailand trip for the rest of your life if you continue on. </p>
              <p>Just curious, I know it's a bit weird to ask but are all the girls in western country that "open-minded"???</p>

              <p>RainerH,</p>
              <p>I can understand that the feeling sucks like hell and really admire your "generousity" and being so "open minded" to your gf's fantasy. I'm sure you have images running thru your mind about how your gf being thrusted by the thai boy, and her facial expression, moaning etc.</p>
              <p>I'm not quite sure what u expect out from posting here but maybe let me help by giving you some suggestion:</p>
              <p>Q1) have you ever thought that perhaps u can just join in the fun ?</p>
              <p>Q2) would being watched be part of her fantasy too ?</p>
              <p>Q3) perhaps threesome ? or maybe even foursome by engaging another thai female in the act ? Well since you cant beat them, then join them.  At least u still can participate and maybe also give you the opportunity to display some of your "skills" .  After which, you can even give a more detailed accounts of what actually happen behind the scenes rather than having to sketch and image.  What you think dude ? Does that helps ?</p>
