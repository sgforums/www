In fact, most of us here probably realised that too. It's not so much that he actually did it that pisses the ppl in this forum. Rather, it's his attitude towards the whole thing after the incident. And he has only continued to show everyone here how unfeeling he is towards his now ex-gf and to girls in particular.<br><br>Besides, I think the whole story is false anyway. It's just some lamer trying to get attention. Some loser who's never even so much held hands with a girl. Let alone have a threesome with his imaginary girlfriend and her equally unreal best friend.<br><br>It is Cortez in disguise!</div>
