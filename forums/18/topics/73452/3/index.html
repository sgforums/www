If she really means alot to you, go ahead and look for her at her place. Explain everything to her personally of what you have told us in this forum on how you feel about her and the entire affair. Sure it will give you a better result than whining about it in this forum. Be a man and settle it for yourself.<br><br>To put it bluntly, why ask her best friend to settle it for you? Do you really hope that somebody will clear up your mess? I'm sure after what has happened, asking her friend to approach your girlfriend will only end up making things worse...your girlfriend might think that you are closer to her best friend than her because you would rather approach her best friend and tell her about your troubles than her.<br><br>Everybody will make mistakes in life, how you make up for the mistakes will let her know how sincere you are to her and how special she is to you. Don't wait for tomorrow, go and look for her before your relationship expires.<br><br>Hehehe...go and make us guys proud! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hahahaha......<br><br></div>
