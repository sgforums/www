            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I haven't been on this forum for a while, so this is my first post after a long while.<br><br>Stud Queen, regarding on your NSA r/s, I think things just start off with two hands clapping. I had been in one before and I am considering to get into another.<br><br>Just like anybody else, I had a bad experience in a previous relationships. I am pretty sceptical to commit in another now. It is probably going to be a short term mindset, but noone knows for sure. Even I don't know myself being involved without commitment will last for how long?  But one thing I am sure of, it won't last forever. Someone is bound to jump out or be hurt if feelings start to develop. (You can't deny the fact that it might just happen)<br><br>Here is my two cents worth. I haven't made my mind if I should 'get involved but stay not committed'. I am still sorting out the battles in my mind.<br><br>Have a nice day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

Even if I'm to be rent asunder by love, I'll pick myself back up, and continue to love that person... and never give up on love...<br><br>Else the other route is to give up on my humanity... to have loveless relationships, to lust without love, to go through the motions of "lovemaking" without the tenderness of love that makes physical sharing of love special...<br><br>oh well... I rant on... I guess this type of no-strings relationship will never be for me.</div></blockquote>Hi bear,<br><br>I wish I had the chance to love the person that I truly love again. Things have been different, she avoids me. I do still love her and I will always do. Its hard to explain my situation but I do know she is with another guy and are happy with the ways things are. Commitment means something to me, I had said lots of nasty things to her in the heat of anger, guess she is not willing to forgive that. Not just yet. I wouldn't know. I had hurt her feelings.<br><br>What had hurt me the most is the last day that I have met her and 'I don't love you anymore' is what she said. 'I still care about you, the times we had been together is because you are so nice to me, its hard to say no to you, you 're a good company.'<br><br>That had made up my mind and I had decided to let her go. (after a long mental struggle) She is the one for me, but I am not to her.<br><br>I have phobias now in commitment, and I am still trying to heal myself from that. Commitment or not, depends on the both of you.<br>Someday, I hope once again, I will be able to have a touch of true love.<br><br>Thanks for sharing bear.<br><br></div>
