            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to share my experience with all of you who are keen on exploring what I have explored. It will be a great experience without any doubt!! Guys and Girls are welcome.<br><br>What really happen is, I was having this body ache and decided to have a good massage. So I was browsing through net and found this special website in Singapore which says that this guy who is experienced for almost 10 years in all kinds of massage including "Sensual Massage". As I have not done any sensual massage, so I decided to give it a try. There was his hand phone no. And I send him a massage that I'm interested in having the sensual massage and asked him the chargers. His reply was $50 for 1 hr and I can come to his place in Admiralty (mrt station). I decided to go for it and once I reached the admiralty station, I messaged him and he gave me his home address. When I went up to his house, this guy was a mixture of Thai and Malay and had a fair complexion. Good build body and macho too. He welcomed me in and obviously. Nobody else was at home except a cat.<br><br>He locates me to his master bedroom, which was fabulous and cozy. He told me take a shower and the toilet itself was like a 5 star hotel. After me taking a shower, he asked me whether itÂ’s ok with me to be fully naked for the massage as itÂ’s more to a sensual massage. So I agreed and he too stripped down his clothes. Now, both of us were fully naked and he told me to lay back. He did a back massage, which was great!! Then slowly, he reached my balls...rubbing them slowly and reaching for my penis too. I had this sensual feeling which made me lift up my body a little for him to hold my penis easily. He rubbed my penis and told me to turn in front. Understanding that my penis was already standing up for Singapore!!! He grabs it with his mouth and start blowing and sucking. He is really experience and you should trust me!! Then he passed me a condom and told me to fuck his ass. I did fuck him with pleasure and turn once my pleasure was over; he cleaned me up and told me to turn back again. This time around my thoughts were that is he going to fuck me?? I told him that IÂ’m a person who only fuck people and donÂ’t allow anybody to fuck me. He smiled at me and said that he is not going fuck me but is going to do a solid massage again.<br><br>And trust me...his massage was the best I have ever had in my life!!!<br><br>Interested people can leave me a massage and I will pass you guys the info.<br><br>This guy is very kind and remembers that, for all the fucking, sucking, shaking and solid massage cost me only $50.<br></div>
