Some think about 2 guys, others like kinky like leather and some women are perverse...  Actually in my opinion, its just that the women want to have harder and rougher and more dominent guy so as for variation in their encounter with their bf/hubbie...<br>Similarly for guys, most also dream about 2cow 1 bull, having multiple partners, having ONS, se* with strangers, being dominated and etc<br><br>Other people act out their fantasy with dire consequences. If you want to read about real rape case and the rapist... you will get a sense that fantasy and reality cannot mix. Go see pic from russian web sites about rape and the brutality of it to the raped and the evilness of the rapist ... I am sure these women will not want the real thing...<br></div>
