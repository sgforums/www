Since there are so many people viewing why do you guys want to catch attention here? To let everyone know you guys are hero?<br><br>I think and I hope you guys are not those talking on the hand phone in cinema.<br><br>Most guys wank , even doctor never say bad for health. why care whether you wank or I wank?<br><br>You wank and you wnat to stop youngster to wank?<br>Even they shoot on their monitor also not our monitor.<br><br>You just can't stop all of them lah!<br><br></div></blockquote>oh, i don't plan to. but doesn't mean i can't comment on them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
