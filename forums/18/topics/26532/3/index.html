            <div class='col-md body'>Don,<br><br>Before I start lemme say, PLEASE use paragraphs.. i don't have money to buy new specks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I respect your decision to remain a virgin till you're either married, or till u meet the gal that u know will be your wife.<br><br>I really don't see a point in your post. I'm trying to find it with all the effort of a person who is deprived of sleep but I still can't really. But i feel a sense of great dislike from you towards people who, correct me if my interpretation is wrong, use open-mindedness as an excuse to fuck around and hurt other people.<br><br>If i am correct with the above statement, then I ask you if someone were to use another excuse to fuck around, would he be deemed ok? Say i went to a girl and said, "Let's fuck because I am horny" would that be deemed acceptable in your view?<br><br>I think you are hung up on guys that mislead girls into thinking that they not only should have sex with them because they are in love, but also because they're in the 21st century and everyone else is doing it. To a certain extent I agree that this is unacceptable. However I would like to remind you that unless it is a case of rape (or date-rape, which is actually pretty common) sexual activity is the result of two consenting adults. Of course, one of those adults could have been misled with sweet lies, but otherwise, it's pretty much a "chop and sign" case as far as I'm concerned. This is my point. Yes your friend may have attempted suicide because of some bastard, but she did consent in the first place. If it was rape, then it's a different story.<br><br>If men are bastards these days, then gals are not that stupid themselves. They can tell most of the time when a man is lying. Also, back to your friend attempting suicide, I will put a wager on her hurting not because she lost her virginity to a bastard, but because the guy cheated her feelings. She loved him, but he did not. It's as simple as that. It's simple, but it fucking hurts. It happens to guys too.<br><br>Another thing to take note is that sometimes a girl succombs to guy's wishes to get accepted. They know that the guy doesn't really love her, but so as not to lose him, they consent to his wishes. We should tell our loved ones who are female not to degrade themselves in such a way. We will support them and do whatever we can to advice them, but they make the final decision. And if the decision will lead them to strife, there is nothing we can do, because love is sometimes blind. We will then, once again, support them on their road to recovery, and we'd expect her to learn from her experience. Mind you, some NEVER do.<br><br>My post seems as fragmented as yours was in the use of white space. I just hope I didn't lose the point.</div>
