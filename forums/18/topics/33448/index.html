            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm...hmmm...hmmm<br><br>wat peppermint say was right,but u got to make it known to her not just urself knowing it,how to make it known to her,depends on ur skills,point is to get her to know that u r not the typical type of guy she will see everyday.<br><br>from my experiences...i dun think u should just go n confess to her at her workplace that will only result in crash n burn.ktv girls mostly goes for $$$ n looks but there r the few that really work in this line for their family as i knew some of those who does.seems like this girl u met might be one of the few or u wouldnt think abt her that much just bcos she said something to u.<br><br>i used to have go after ktv girls too,so far never lost a battle.but the girls which i used to chase at ktv,they would see me nearly everyday or at least 5 days a week,dun think i am that rich aint me footing the bill.ahhh those were the days...<br><br>ok back to the subject,if she's the kind of girls that belongs to the fewer kind as i said,she is sure to have some sad history,try asking her out after 3am maybe for supper or watever,if u can manage to ask her out for supper u have already accompish half for she feels comfortable with u,u might want to take her to a place with some class,give u a place...central mall,in chinese the place is call golden stick jade leaves,then maybe after that seaside to chat but have to ask her if she feels tired n want to go home,show her the caring part of u,girls always like caring guys.well thats all i can say for i dun know the situation u r in therefore couldnt give any more opinions,n dun ever give a call b4 6pm,lol[/quote]</div>
