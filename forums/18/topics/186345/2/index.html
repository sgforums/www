I feel girls who have it easy in life, like those from wealthy family, they tend to have higher standards for guys. they at least want to be as comfortable as b4 after they get married. it's very hard to take a step down when you have been on the top. of coz there are always exceptional girls who are not like that.<br><br>it's easier to be with a girl who comes from similar background as you. coz the prob is that sometimes the girls parents will also judge you on the family background you come from. such is the fact of life.<br><br></div>

We're talking about the same thing lah. I'm saying relationship both need to give and receive in more or less equal amounts and you're saying the same thing that "both wanna give". Read my post properly leh. Still spit at me asshole.<br><br>Dont you think the "I LOVE MY MUMMY" guy seems to give the idea that he wants a girl like his mom (he says so), and just sit back - let her do all the work, look after all his needs, expect unfailable love - whilst he does absolutely nothing at all?!?! He is AIMING insults at girls only, he keeps harping on how we need to work more to fufil his needs, his love, his bullshit. BUT WHAT DOES HE SAY ABOUT WOMEN? Even his mom??? NOTICE: <strong>he never even says how much he appreciates his mom, or how he actually RETURNS all that she has done for him</strong>. He just complains. Typical sheltered boy. i bet he has never done his own (and his family's) laundry before. Its all one-sided. He expects to receive, but never mentioned anything on his part.<br><br>i wont be surprised if all the girls that you have met are like that, mummy-guy. Because i bet you never showed them more than an ounce of affection like what your mom has showered you all your life, yet you EXPECT the same amount from a girl that <strong>doesnt owe you anything</strong>. You'll never find a girl.</div>
