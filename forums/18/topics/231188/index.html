            <div class='col-md body'>Men who have sex with drunken women will be at risk of being convicted of rape under new laws to be considered by ministers.<br><br>The legal shake-up would mean a woman would be considered incapable of giving consent to sex if she had been drinking heavily.<br><br>Police would be asked to carry out blood and urine tests on a woman who complained of rape to find out how much alcohol is in her body. They would then used "back calculations" to work out how drunk she was at the time of the alleged attack.<br><br>A "drink and sex limit" would sweep away the confusion and controversy in the courts surrounding the issue of when a man accused of rape can claim he believed a woman gave her consent to sex.<br><br>But it would open the way to prosecutions of husbands or regular boyfriends who have sex with drunken wives or partners as well as fierce arguments over medical evidence and real levels of intoxication of alleged victims.<br><br>A consultation document is to be published by the Home Office in the New Year that will lay down the basis for new laws and try to meet Labour's aim of forcing up numbers of rape convictions. At present only one rape accusation in 20 ends in a conviction and ministers are convinced that means rapists are getting away with it.<br><br>Almost all disputed rape cases are of "partner", "acquaintance" or "date" rape in which both parties were known to each other before the alleged attack happened.<br><br>A rape law making it an offence to have sex with a woman who has reached a set level of drunkeness is to be proposed by the Home Office committee that four years ago recommended the disastrous reclassification of cannabis that made possessing the drug less of a crime.<br><br>The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is to report next month suggesting the use of medical tests and back calculation.<br><br>A study carried out last month for the Association of Chief Police Officers suggested that a women could be expected to show 'marked intoxication levels' after drinking the equivalent of two bottles of wine.<br><br>It found that in 120 cases of sexual assault examined by researchers, in 119 cases the woman had been drinking.<br><br>But because of "marked time delays between the collection of samples and the incident", alcohol could be detected by tests in only 62, just over half, of the cases. Blood tests can find alcohol in the body 24 hours after drinking and urine tests after 72 hours.<br><br>The ACPO research found that in 31 cases alcohol levels at the time of the incident could be estimated by "back-calculating".<br><br>It said it was "significant" that 22 cases showed the woman had 200 milligrams of alcohol for every 100 millilitres of blood.<br><br>This level is equivalent to eight 175 milliletre pub "standard" glasses of wine, or two and a half times the drink driving limit.<br><br>But the ACPO report warned that there are "caveats about the approximate nature of the calculations".<br><br>Back calculations usually work on the basis that the body breaks down one unit of alcohol - half a pub standard glass of wine - every hour. However, alcohol breaks up in different bodies at different rates.<br><br>The ACPO report said: "If one considers a social drinker, one could expect marked intoxication at levels of 200 milligrams per 100 millilitres and symptoms could include reduced inhibitions, disorientation, impaired judgement and co-ordination, drowsiness, memory loss and, at higher levels, unconsciousness."<br><br>The law already suggests that a woman who is asleep or unconscious is less likely to have consented to sex. Since 2003, a man accused of rape has had to show he had "reasonable" grounds for believing a woman consented. Before then, he had only to demonstrate that he believed she had consented.<br><br>Solicitor General Mike O'Brien is considering the drink and sex limit among proposals for new rules that could also include fresh guidance for juries on matters of consent and the right for defendants to call experts on rape who would explain to juries how damaging to a victim the offence is.<br><br></div>

Anyway I think the law is good... coz if the girl gives consent why would she report the man? Then again... there might be abuses too coz woman can make use of it to threaten the man.... so in any case... if the man are in the situation... ask himself why in the first place... he wans to be in tat situation.</div>
