I believe strongly in womens equality and many of my female friends are liberated to the point of being against the Womans Charter - diff topic, which I won't get into - However, it's very relevant to how I treat a woman; As a woman... Not as a little girl.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>for ladies to carry condoms is a form of self protection, us in case guys use corny excuses such as running out of condoms....<br>for a guy to use the above mentioned excuse,and yet to judge a lady by whether she has prepared condoms b4 hand as being mature or not, is  unfortunately more presumptuous than my any of my statements. in which case, it exhibit the guy's im-maturity to have not take the liberty to get more condoms.<br></strong></blockquote>First of all.. these things really do happen and only the most immature of men would simply use it as a corny excuse, as you put it.<br><br>Second, judging a woman as mature because she has forsight is not the same as condeming her a immature just because doesn't.  Her having that condom with her just serves, to me, as an indication that she knows she is sexually active and has put thought towards her own protection.  Same as if she was on the pill.  That she is aware of the dangers in what she is about to do and does it willingly as an adult.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>perhaps to you singapore's society is not tat all open as compared to where you came back from, may i add that we do have 24 hours convience stores such as Cheers and 7-11 where one could always get condoms.<br></strong></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br><br>...and yes, that is always a viable option should we both be out of condoms.
