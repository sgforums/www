            <div class='col-md body'>i think no matter whatever the situation, boyfriend should escort her girlfriend home right to the doorstep. anything bad can just happen just round a corner. regardless of whether robbery, rape or etc, it can take place at any time of the day or night so don't think that it is safe when it is broad daylight. it can be still very dangerous.<br><br>if your girlfriend doesn't want you to accompany her to the doorstep, the next safest thing which you can do is to watch her enter her home safely from a close distance. remember that you can only leave after she has entered her home and locked her door.</div>
