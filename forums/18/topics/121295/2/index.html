            <div class='col-md body'>I'm all for this law too. Yeah.. while the smokers are relaxing after a hard day's work, the non-smokers are inhaling all the 2nd hand smoke as well.<br><br>Smoking isn't the only cause of cancer... Sure.. that's beyond doubt and is in fact a pretty dumb statement to make.  Smoking IS a MAJOR and a DEFINITE proven cause of at least a dozen cancers and chronic lung problems.<br><br>And for ppl who can't afford the price hike of the ciggies... its time to quit. Why raise the prices? Cos of the rising healthcare costs! Who's paying the hospital bills of irresponsible smokers who get chronic lung diseases 20 years down the road? Who else? The taxpayers.... Us.  That's why the price hike. Those who can still afford to support this expensive habit probably can afford their bills in future. Those who can't, well.... quit or smoke less, or contribute more to the taxes.. so that your lungs would be taken care of in future.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I think the government is really too much to limit smoking to such extent. Some people can say, if u can't afford the cigarette price, quit smoking. But I know smoking is quite hard to quit, although I myself is not a smoker, but I've heard from friends. It's really ridiculous to even propose that smoking be banned at kopitiams, I say the uncles and ah bengs will all start to complain if smoking is banned at kopitiams.<br><br>Like some people say, if they want to ban smoking at places like kopitiam, ktvs, pubs, then they may as well ban smoking throughout Singapore, don't even think of importing cigarettes then. But banning smoking in Singapore will never happen, cos of $$$. I'm still unhappy that chewing gums are banned in Singapore...even after so.... many years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like i said earlier, inconsiderate smokers are the cause of the policy...<br>and i think that inconsiderate "chewers" were the cause of the banning of chewing gum. damn "chewers" spit gum all over the place. we seem to do just fine without gum.<br><br>smoking in kopitiams.. hmm.. i think they're not gonna implement it ah? they're saying they're gonna designate portions of the kopitiams rite? i think open air part can smoke and the indoor portion cannot bah? not sure, but i really dun think they'll ban it altogether at coffee shops.</div>

Let me put it this way, why are pubs booming? Pubs refill beer by the kegs weekly while you hardly see them replenish their wine selection list that quickly. There is als an increasing number of alcoholics and alcohol dependencies showing up.<br><br>Fatty food is everywhere. You think your ceasar salard is not fatty? Think again..  If we are all so healthy, why do we have a deluge of adverts selling slimming products to rid of fats, oil, carbos and etc. While the health ministry is advertising about eating more vege.  Going to any hawker center and buy anything.. its most likely to be laden with reused fats. To eat fat in moderation is quite difficult in our hawker culture. Most food we eat are filled with either fats, preservatives or both.<br><br>So tell me why is that a jump in the number of aid patients in singapore if people are into protected sex. Why did the gov want to pass a law to enforce aids testing in preggies. And the estimate that for every case of aids discovered, 2-4 are still undiscovered. Use Rubber?<br>Tell this to the teen/adult preggies who threw their babies down from their house and those babies who died and remain undiscovered. You so sure ppl use rubber?  Maybe I am wrong, but now kids as young as 12 are engaged in sex without knoweldege of protection. Men visit china, batam pros and do not want to use rubber.<br><br>Age do not cause cancer, but as cells age, they are more likely have genetic mutations. There is also a higher chance of getting cancer when you are older thus people of certain age are asked to go check. The Implication is there, ppl just don't get the message.<br><br>Stress is a factor of our lives. perhaps you do not feel it cause you are mostly a student. Try having a job like stock broker. There are at current no tests that links stress to cancers or there might be. Thus, you cannot say in absolute terms that stress does not cause cancer.<br>it could be  possible but I suppose you would only see your own point. Because, you miss the point of the message. Its not about proving all that or disproving smoking is harmful. Its about the hard handed manner that the gov takes on these sort of laws. Its about being a hypocrite and its about taking away choices for people in the name of "protecting" us from ourselves.  You think the ban on gums is a great move? I think it could have been better handled than an absolute ban.  Its selective and prejudiced.<br><br>If simply smoking causes so much problem just like chewing gums, then have an absolute ban on it. Why don't the gov just do that and be so hypocrite and increased the tax till the price of a pack is ridiculous. This is my point.<br><br>Now gambling also destroyes lives. So why is the gov all for gambling.<br>Why are somethings that is harmful to society now allowed to go through, without  consideration on the voice of the people. Isn't it going to add a social costs to all of us. So why did gambling sudden become OK?<br>My point is, the selective, myopic, and hypocritical ways of the system.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Smoking not only harms the smoker, but also to the people beside him/her. If he/she wants to smoke, he can smoke himself/herself to death for all i care. But just don't affect and kill other people by the second-hand smoke. Too many teenagers are silly enough to freaking TRY out the cigarettes. Its doing them harm and slowing killing them. Another thing, even if the government bans smoking in all public places, they can always smoke at home. People like my father, who is inconsiderate, smokes right in front of me with no concern for my health. The best way, i say, is to BAN IMPORT OF CIGARETTES TO SINGAPORE! Thats the best way! Let those smokers crave to death! For all I care!</div>

If he/she wants to smoke, he can smoke himself/herself to death for all i care. But just don't affect and kill other people by the second-hand smoke. Too many teenagers are silly enough to freaking TRY out the cigarettes. Its doing them harm and slowing killing them. Another thing, even if the government bans smoking in all public places, they can always smoke at home. People like my father, who is inconsiderate, smokes right in front of me with no concern for my health. The best way, i say, is to BAN IMPORT OF CIGARETTES TO SINGAPORE! Thats the best way! Let those smokers crave to death! For all I care!</div></blockquote>inconsiderate like father like son  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Let me put it this way, why are pubs booming? Pubs refill beer by the kegs weekly while you hardly see them replenish their wine selection list that quickly. There is als an increasing number of alcoholics and alcohol dependencies showing up.<br><br>Fatty food is everywhere. You think your ceasar salard is not fatty? Think again..  If we are all so healthy, why do we have a deluge of adverts selling slimming products to rid of fats, oil, carbos and etc. While the health ministry is advertising about eating more vege.  Going to any hawker center and buy anything.. its most likely to be laden with reused fats. To eat fat in moderation is quite difficult in our hawker culture. Most food we eat are filled with either fats, preservatives or both.<br><br>So tell me why is that a jump in the number of aid patients in singapore if people are into protected sex. Why did the gov want to pass a law to enforce aids testing in preggies. And the estimate that for every case of aids discovered, 2-4 are still undiscovered. Use Rubber?<br>Tell this to the teen/adult preggies who threw their babies down from their house and those babies who died and remain undiscovered. You so sure ppl use rubber?  Maybe I am wrong, but now kids as young as 12 are engaged in sex without knoweldege of protection. Men visit china, batam pros and do not want to use rubber.<br><br>Age do not cause cancer, but as cells age, they are more likely have genetic mutations. There is also a higher chance of getting cancer when you are older thus people of certain age are asked to go check. The Implication is there, ppl just don't get the message.<br><br>Stress is a factor of our lives. perhaps you do not feel it cause you are mostly a student. Try having a job like stock broker. There are at current no tests that links stress to cancers or there might be. Thus, you cannot say in absolute terms that stress does not cause cancer.<br>it could be  possible but I suppose you would only see your own point. Because, you miss the point of the message. Its not about proving all that or disproving smoking is harmful. Its about the hard handed manner that the gov takes on these sort of laws. Its about being a hypocrite and its about taking away choices for people in the name of "protecting" us from ourselves.  You think the ban on gums is a great move? I think it could have been better handled than an absolute ban.  Its selective and prejudiced.<br><br>If simply smoking causes so much problem just like chewing gums, then have an absolute ban on it. Why don't the gov just do that and be so hypocrite and increased the tax till the price of a pack is ridiculous. This is my point.<br><br>Now gambling also destroyes lives. So why is the gov all for gambling.<br>Why are somethings that is harmful to society now allowed to go through, without  consideration on the voice of the people. Isn't it going to add a social costs to all of us. So why did gambling sudden become OK?<br>My point is, the selective, myopic, and hypocritical ways of the system.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes yes... I totally appreciate what you are trying to say. But I fail to see your point in what "fatty food" and "stress" and "Rubber and ADIS" has to do with the harmful effects of smoking.<br><br>Hell yeah... You are goddamn rite bout age, stress, beer watever... resulting indirectly or directly in cancer.. but I can't help but sense some gross misconception or misunderstanding.<br>We are not talking 'bout BASELINE risk here... we are talking 'bout EXCESS risk.  The baseline risk of someone getting lung cancer could be low... but someone who smokes would have an EXCESS risk of x10 or more....<br><br>And aren't you going to appreciate the additive effects of the risk factors? Say,  a thin, lean and mean stockbroker who doesn't smoke compared to a sedentary, obese student who smokes 3 packs a day. Who is gonna get the big C? Probably the student ya...<br><br>Risk factors are additive. Lowering one makes a hell of a difference in the cumulated risk.<br><br>Hoho... AIDS on the rise? YEah! Why? COs ppl don't use rubber? YEAh! What are we gonna do bout it? Tell them to use rubber!! Are they gonna to listen??<br>We don't know.. but we gotta try!!!<br><br>That's the whole point... trying! You mean if you know AIDS is on the rise, ppl are having sex earlier and ppl hate to use rubber means "oh yeah.. ppl are not listening.. AIDS is on the rise.. let's all no use rubber then..lets die."<br>No i guess... they dont' use it 'cos they're ignorant. And its everybody's job to raise the awareness.<br><br>Well.. the reason why there isn't an absolute ban on smoking like gum has to be due to the different social and economic implications and their own inherent differences. For one, the reason behind the ban is different and I won't bother to elaborate.<br><br>As for gambling... Well... there's one whole discussion in itself. As for myself, I'm more against than for it and I have to say the government is indeed, not getting more public opinion before they decide on something.<br><br>Perhaps... they should let us vote on both issues.</div>
