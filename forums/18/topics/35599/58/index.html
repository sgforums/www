            <div class='col-md body'>Woman on Top 1. - The male lies on his back while his partner straddles his torso. She controls the rhythm and depth of penetration. He lies flat with movement restricted somewhat by her weight and his lack of leverage. Some women prefer to lay forward so she may kiss her mate, while others choose to sit up straight. Regardless of which you prefer, an interesting idea is to just rock back and forth or in a circular motion while resting on your partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s body. There is more clitoral stimulation this way, and it also has the advantage of the feeling of deep penetration, which some women really like. Another great advantage is that this motion is less stimulating for a man, and he can often last longer this way.<br><br>Woman On Top 2. - Open and Closed The man lies on his back with his legs spread apart. She straddles his torso and allows him to enter her normally. She then lies on top of him closing her thighs. Because her thighs are closed, more pressure is placed on the penis which can be pleasurable to both men and women. The sensations are intense and this position will normally bring most men to orgasm quite quickly. Of course he is not the only one being pleased.<br><br>Woman On Top 3. - About face This position requires that the woman sit with her back to him. The male lies on the bed and the female straddles his torso, kneeling on either side of him. From this position she can put her hands on his knees, giving her the leverage to lift off. This position forces the penis into an uncommon angle, which many women find extremely exciting. If she wants to give him additional stimulation during this position she can reach down with one of her hands and massage his balls. Gentle pulling or massaging is often very desirable for men.<br><br>Woman On Top 4. - The Ultimate Embrace This position is not simple sex, itÃ¢Â€Â™s true lovemaking in the complete sense of the word. Begin with the female on top position. The woman should sit up straight and get comfortable. Now, the man sits up with her, holding her in his arms and she holding him. Now the important part: do nothing. DonÃ¢Â€Â™t move, just look at each other, hold each other or talk lovingly to one another. Kiss for a while, laugh, close your eyes. For the next while, just enjoy the feeling of ultimate closeness and tenderness. Those deeply in love will relish this one the most.<br><br>Rear Entry Position 1. -Also known by some as "doggy style" the rear entry position is fairly easy to assume. The woman gets either on her hands and knees or lays stomach first on the bed with her lover behind her. He is on his knees or sometimes his feet, and develops leverage by grasping on to her hips. Depending on preference the man's legs can be inside of the women's legs or outside of them. Couples may wish to have the woman's legs closer together because it creates more friction between the penis and vagina.<br>In this position a man has a great deal of freedom for thrusting. Her movement is somewhat restricted but this can be easy modified with an ottoman or low bed. The woman can then rest the upper half of her body on a supporting structure. This in turn gives her more freedom to move her hips and pelvis. The rear entry position offers the couple a chance at experiencing new sensations because the angle of entry is different while deep thrusting is made much easier. All these factors contribute to a particularly intense experience if you are with the right partner. Most men find that it is difficult to prolong their orgasm while in this position. The stimulation is often too intense or overwhelming. Consequently the couple may wish to save the rear entry position as a way to end their lovemaking session.<br><br>Rear Entry 2. - Forward for Pleasure While the man lies on his back on the bed, the female approaches him and straddles his hips with her back to him. The true joy comes when she leans forward as far as she can. Some women may want to grab onto their partner's legs and pull themselves down to the bed. In so doing she drastically alters the angle of penetration. Some couples may find that it is uncomfortable until they adjust the angle of her hips a little. Once this adjustment has taken place she will find sensations unlike any other. She can then rock back and forth with his legs for support or he may wish to support her hips with his arms to assist her movement.<br>Although it is very pleasurable this position provides little clitoral stimulation. Consequently women who enjoy direct clitoral stimulation may not enjoy this position as much as their partner.<br><br>Rear Entry 3. - The Chair Revisited. That wonderful recliner can be used for another very satisfying, very relaxing sexual position. This one is particularly great for those men who have limited mobility due to accident or illness. The male just sits comfortably upright in a chair while the woman sits down on his lap as if she was using the chair as well. Her back is pressed to his chest. The onus is on the female to provide all the movement in this position but this movement is extremely easy. With the support of her arms the female can use her legs to move rapidly or slowly.<br>If a chair is not convenient for you then you may wish to try a similar position on your bed. The male kneels down with his buttocks on his ankles. The female is directly in front of him allowing themselves to be elegantly joined. There is not a great deal of movement available to the couple but this position is very sensual and is recommended for afterplay. When the couple is sitting joined, the male can fondle her breasts or even massage her back. Often it is very satisfying just to sit and hold her with soft music in the background. From this position you both can move in unison and lay down on your sides allowing greater comfort for both partners. Fucking does not have to revolve around thrusting; it can be slow, intimate and tender.<br><br>Rear Entry 4. - Face down The female lies face down on the bed with her legs spread apart. The male then straddles the female's thighs from behind. To enter easily it is useful to place a pillow underneath her abdomen to shift the angle of her hips. Also she can place a pillow beneath her head for added comfort. Most men will find that establishing a rhythm with this position is quite difficult. The problem is that the penis has a tendency to slip out of the vagina forcing the couple to restart their lovemaking. Take your time and start with slow shallow thrusts until you get your rhythm.<br><br>Rear Entry 5. - Face Up The male lies on his back on the bed while the woman lays on him with her back pressed against his chest. For the men who can support her weight comfortably this position is a delight. It allows the man easy access to the clitoris which can be massaged during the act. This position is excellent for pregnant couples because it puts no stress on the front part of a womanÃ¢Â€Â™s body. Spicing up this position is quite easy. Massage oils can be applied by the male to the female's breasts, shoulders and stomach. Some oils will heat up when they are applied which can add extra stimulation to the experience. If you are using condoms make sure that no oil comes into contact with the condom that is in use. Other interesting ideas to add to this position may be a vibrator. She can hold a powerful vibrator near her clitoris which vibrates the vagina as well. Both male and female will experience the stimulation.<br><br>Rear Entry 6. - Spoons Both partners face the same direction and lay on their sides, man behind woman. The man may have to slightly angle his body so that entry is more easy. Although thrusting and movement is inhibited in this position, it is very close and intimate and may be a perfect way to begin lovemaking.<br><br>Missionary Position 1. - The Missionary has often been thought of as un-adventurous and amateurish. Nothing could be farther from the truth! The female lies on her back with her legs spread apart. The male then lowers himself on top of the female with his arms supporting his weight. From this position the male has the freedom to thrust or make circular movements with his thighs. If he lowers himself closer to her and rests some of his weight on top of her body, his pubic bone may be able to provide gentle clitoral stimulation. The female can thrust her middle body towards the man using the support of her legs, or grasp the man from behind controlling somewhat his thrusting movements.<br><br>Missionary Position 2. - Lifting Legs The woman can lift and bend her legs slightly with her feet flat on the mattress. Many women find this position more comfortable than the traditional missionary position. It allows for greater access to the vagina, which means that both partners will enjoy more intense stimulation. This position can be further enhanced if the woman can put her feet on her partner's buttocks. Adding a particularly delightful feel for the female as the male's pubic bone gently rubs against her clitoris.<br><br>Missionary Position 3. - Locking Legs The woman raises her legs higher and locks them around her partner. The higher she can raise her legs, the deeper the penetration because access to the vagina is easier. If she has the flexibility to lock her legs around her partner then she can contribute to his leverage by squeezing him close to her or just hold him with her thighs. Many men find that the feel of their partner's legs around them to be a real turn on. One significant drawback of this position is that some men find it results in hurried orgasms. For this reason we might suggest that you leave this position towards the end of your lovemaking.<br><br>Missionary Position 4. - Over the Shoulders The woman places her legs on her partner's shoulders, on both sides of his head. From this position lovers can attain the deepest possible penetration. Be aware that this position can allow too deep a penetration, causing irritation for the woman. The man should always take his cues from his partner and move slowly. The further back her legs are the deeper the possible penetration.<br><br>Missionary Position 5. - Kneeling Male This is not a position designed for speedy movements or rapid lovemaking, but rather a slow and intimate encounter. The female lies on her back on the bed with the male kneeling and sitting on his ankles between her thighs. From this position he grabs her thighs and brings her to him. Her bottom and lower back are elevated while her ankles or lower legs rest on his shoulders. To add to her comfort you can place a pillow under her lower back and a couple under her head. There can still be some muscle strain experienced by the woman so this position can not be held for a prolonged period. The female can massage her clitoris manually in this position, or her partner can apply pressure with his thumb, since her weight is supported by her partner and the bed. The man can view the penetration easily which for many is an exciting sight. It also allows the man to deliver a sensual massage of his partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s stomach, breasts and arms.<br><br>Missionary Position 6. - Using your Bed The female lies on the bed with her legs draped over the edge and her feet resting on the floor. The male then kneels on the floor between her thighs. The success of this position depends heavily on the elevation of the bed, which for some is not quite at the height required. One of the beautiful things about this position is the range of movement possible for both partners. A woman has more control over movement as she can press herself against him to add to the penetration or rotate her hips for interesting stimulation. The male also has an unparalleled amount of leverage and freedom of movement.<br><br>Missionary Position 7. - Legs get Together Most women enjoy the missionary position with legs apart. This is not necessary and many couples prefer positions where the woman can keep her legs closed. Added stimulation and unique sensations are usually what result. When her legs are closed, a womanÃ¢Â€Â™s vagina tightens around her partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s penis giving more intense stimulation to both partners. This position also forces the man to enter from a sharper angle towards the clitoris adding more stimulation for the woman. The man in this position may also close his legs, placing all his weight on his partner. Careful here, some women appreciate this feeling, others are burdened by it!<br><br>Missionary Position 8. - Tantric Essences This is an enjoyable and very special position often found in Tantric literature. In this position the woman lies on her back on the bed. Her partner kneels sitting on his ankles close to her buttocks. From here he hoists both of her legs onto one of his shoulders. A little bit of guidance from his partner and you are both in a deliciously unique position. This one is not for those who have problems with flexibility. You will both be surprised at the unique angle of penetration which many women find delightful. The penis massages the side wall of the vagina which does not get the same attention with other positions. If the female wants to try massaging the opposite wall of the vagina then all you must do move her legs to the other shoulder. The movement in this position is mostly up to the male. Some men may find it difficult to thrust with both legs on their shoulders but with time it becomes easier. Allow yourself some time to become accustomed to this position because it is a tricky one to master.<br><br>Missionary Position 9. Ã‚Â­ T Position The female partner lies on her back. The man, laying perpendicular (making a Ã¢Â€Â˜tÃ¢Â€Â™) straddles the womanÃ¢Â€Â™s leg farthest from him. For example, if the man lays on the left side of the woman, he straddles her right leg. The other leg lays atop the man. This position exposes the clitoris for stimulation, which either partner can do. Slowly rocking back and forth, thrusting the penis gently in and out.<br><br>some examples....<br><br></div>
