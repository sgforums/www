            <div class='col-md body'>TANTRA &amp; KAMA SUTRA<br>Tantric &amp; Sacred Sex &amp; REAL SEX<br><br>"Tantra teaches that lovemaking between a man and woman, when entered into with awareness, is a gateway to both sexual and spiritual ecstasy." Nitya LaCroix from her book The Art of Tantric Sex<br><br>There are many ancient reference books about lovemaking positions. The Chinese Taoists, the Arabians, the Hindus and the Japanese, to name a few, have all written extensively on the topic of sexual positions. But it is the Kama Sutra text that comes to mind when we think of exotic sex and wild new lovemaking positions.<br><br>Asanas (Sanskrit for posture or positions) for lovemaking hold erotic mystery and sexually charged adventure for most of us today, as they did for people in the past. The ancients that developed these postures over the millennia knew that they were healthy both for our physical bodies and for our internal spirit and emotional balance.<br><br>When we bring some of this understanding to our modern, hurried lives, we see that the positions that we so desire to be good at and the techniques that we aspire to learn can take us deeper. Greater levels of awareness and consciousness can be achieved at the core level of our being. It becomes something way beyond putting the Lingam (Sanskrit for penis) in the Yoni (Sanskrit for vagina) for friction and release. We can experience Magic if we stay open and alert to the possibilities.<br><br>The goals may be many and varied for each of you exploring these pages.<br>HereÃ¢Â€Â™s some of the information you will find; the benefits will follow:<br><br>A variety of new positions for you to learn and experiment with<br>Techniques that enhance each position and make them more viable<br>Positions that will enhance G-spot stimulation<br>Positions that will allow the man greater ejaculation control<br>Positions that will facilitate intimacy and connection between the couple<br>Great additions that will add more orgasmic potential to your lovemaking<br>The use of aphrodisiacs<br>Breathwork for couples<br>Conscious sex and the female orgasm<br>The benefit of kama sutra workshops &amp; seminars<br>Oral sex and other lovemaking techniques<br>Male multiple orgasms<br>Tantric sexuality and sacred relationship<br>In addition, youÃ¢Â€Â™ll find:<br>- Links to hours of streaming audio describing positions, techniques and more.<br>- A wonderful catalog filled with select products that will make you the sensitive, unique lover you know is inside of you!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Animal Positions<br><br>The ancient Taoists and Tantrics, who studied manuscripts like the Kama Sutra, believed that animals had a lot to teach us about lovemaking and positions. They suggested that lovers go out into nature together and observe certain animals. Notice what tigers and lions do when it comes to making love. The male will typically mount the female from the rear and gently but aggressively bite her neck and pull her ruff. This position allows for deep thrusting and what appears like male control of the situation. Interestingly, though, the female can really have freedom and maximum stimulation with rear entry positions. They are also easy on the back. Without a doubt this is one of the best position groups there is. Rear-entry positions arenÃ¢Â€Â™t always the most appropriate, though. The moment must be right. I say this because often itÃ¢Â€Â™s more appropriate to be facing each other. Eye contact, breath connection, heart chakra connection and deepened intimacy are all facilitated through facing your partner.<br><br>Rear-entry positions enhance G-spot stimulation. In addition, they leave the manÃ¢Â€Â™s hands free to touch and stimulate the secondary erogenous zones along the back and buttocks and the breasts and chest, much like the tiger who uses his paws and teeth! Variety is easy to come by in this position. You can adjust the angle of penetration, the ways you move about and the depth of penetration in the basic position. This allows the woman to tailor-make the experience for herself while having a lot of room to increase the pleasure for her partner. It also enables the woman to stimulate her own clitoris<br><br>Try this position first up on your knees, instead of having the woman flat, on her stomach. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s best for her to support herself with both her hands so that she can keep her spine moving and undulating. Make a study of how it feels, as a base to explore from. Use the different "modalities" of rhythms and depths of penetration. Try pumping and squeezing your PC muscles in this position.<br><br>Now, try sitting down on your thighs. What has changed? Take notice. What works for you in this variation when you apply the different "modalities" of movement to the position? Lean forward and lie your head down. This is a good position to stimulate your partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s inner thighs. You can also help him stay focused on non-ejaculatory pleasure by applying pressure to his perineum (the external area between the anus and the scrotum that covers his Prostate Gland or G-spot). This will help him from going over the top, so to speak.<br><br>Keep these exercises soft, fun and explorative. Take your time and enjoy every delicious moment. You are becoming an artist Ã¢Â€Â“ enjoy it!<br><br>The Woman Superior Positions<br><br>In the Tantric pantheon of characters the primary god is Shiva and the goddess is Shakti. They stand as principles rather than religious icons and they represent the female and male or Yin and Yang in the universe. Their dance of partnership keeps the universe in balance and that is the metaphor they bring to modern couples.<br><br>Translated into our sexual lives, we see the Shakti energy, that of passion and creativity, come forth in positions that put the woman on top and in control of the action. These "woman superior" positions are excellent for G-spot stimulation. They also enable a more powerful sexual response from many women. A woman can subtly move her body to angle her pelvis and Yoni (Sanskrit for Vagina) just so, for maximum stimulation.<br><br>The basic position has the man lying on his back on the bed with the woman on top facing and straddling him. She can freely move up and down, back and forth and rotate her hips in this position. A description in the Kama Sutra likens this to a fluttering and soaring butterfly, dipping and swooping, sometimes lightly, sometimes more gregariously.<br><br>Variations on this theme include the woman having both feet on the bed, both knees on the bed or one knee up and one knee down on the surface. This later position allows greater movement in the hips and control of the G-spot region. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s also easier on the hips and legs because you can go back and forth between feet and relieve some of the pressure of being in the same position too long.<br><br>Some women find that they like to turn around and face their partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s feet while on top. Try this and see what you think. If you are really connected with your partner, though, you will probably want to be able to eye gaze and this variation makes that hard. One will sometimes see an old oriental love painting where the couple is holding a mirror or reflective object, in which they can gaze, to see each otherÃ¢Â€Â™s face. Try this Ã¢Â€Â“ itÃ¢Â€Â™s very intimate and erotic!<br><br>Try adding a thrusting pattern when you've gotten comfortable with some of these positions; perhaps six shallow then two deep and repeat. Experiment and see what works for you. Be bold! Breathe deeply! Flutter and Soar like the Butterfly!<br><br>Clasping Positions<br><br>The "Clasping Positions" come to us from the Kama Sutra and are ones in which the woman and the man maintain a straight legged, rather ridged posture in respect to each other. They can be very balanced, meditative postures where the focus is not so much on hard thrusting as it is a more gentle movement that allow the two to be in a kind of prayer together, holding the energy and channeling it. In particular, the front facing clasping positions give the opportunity for eye gazing and breathing together in unison. These are wonderful postures to relax into and simply enjoy the intimacy and closeness. They are perfect for after you have both had a few peaks in another position and you want to cool down and focus the energy you have created.<br><br>Clasping comes from the idea that the woman must clasp or hold onto the man's Lingam (penis) with her tight Yoni (vagina) muscles and thighs. Practice your PC Muscle Kegel exercises! These positions or Asanas (Sanskrit) don't allow for much movement. The couple can be lying in these combinations: woman on back/man on top, man on back/woman on top, woman on stomach/man on top face down, side by side facing towards each other, side by side/back to front as in spooning. The spooning position gives more freedom for undulating and moving in unison. Try either wrapping your arms around each other or stretching the arms up over your heads and clasping hands.<br><br>The clasping positions are particularly advantageous in the situations where the man has a very large Lingam and the woman has a rather small Yoni. Because the closed legs prevent the Lingam from deep penetration but do give a lot of friction, these positions can facilitate the love act for couples like this. A woman with a generous Yoni partnered with a man who may have a smaller than average Lingam may have trouble with these positions. The spooning variations of these positions are the best for those couples.<br><br>The front facing unions give better access to clitoral stimulation for some women. The really good thing about any position that allows for shallower rather than deeper penetration is that the woman's G-spot will get more action, as may her clitoris. These are excellent positions for older couples because they are generally very easy on the body.<br><br>Yab Yum Position<br><br>According to Nic Douglas, the Sanskrit word Yab is the equivalent of father and Yum mother. This would correspond to the Taoist Yang for male and Yin for female, as in Yin/Yang. The primordial balance of the universe is in perfection if one or the other of the partners isn't on top of the other, both physically and metaphorically.<br><br>What makes any position, from the long list the Kama Sutra has brought to us, Tantric is the consciousness one brings to it. In that respect, the ordinary can be transformed into the extraordinary. In the Sanskrit language the word for position is Asana. Asana is a word used by those who practice yoga, so you can see the connection.<br><br>A wonderful place to begin is the position known as Yab-Yum. In its classical form it has the man sitting cross-legged on a firm surface with the woman sitting facing him. She has her legs wrapped around him with her feet meeting at his back. Their arms are holding each other, not only for support, but also to call attention to the base of the spine and the heart center. Your partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s right hand is at the middle of your back and their left hand is at the base of your spine and you do the same.<br><br>This brings the two of you very close together. The breath is shared (love pheromones!), the eyes are open, soft and present, and the energy is upright versus horizontal. Gentle to active rocking and thrusting can take place and the womanÃ¢Â€Â™s G-spot has a lot of friction from this position.<br><br>A great variation on this position has the man sitting on the edge of the bed or on a hassock with his feet on the floor. This is a wonderful variation because it applies well to people with bad lower backs, those that are less supple and to couples were the woman is larger than the man. It is easy on the back and legs and still has the potential that the classic posture has. It can get you out of the bed and that adds excitement too.<br><br>Another variation that can be tried has the woman leaning backwards either slightly or all the way to the bed surface. The man should lightly pull her hips towards him to keep contact. Both partners can try leaning backwards simultaneously, also. Try a firm pillow under the buttocks of the woman in any of these positions to achieve the right angle and comfort level. In classical Kama Sutra pictures youÃ¢Â€Â™ll often see a beautiful crescent moon shaped pillow under the womanÃ¢Â€Â™s hips.<br><br>The Western Misionary Position<br><br>Tantric philosophy has the intimate<br>couple as deeply connected as possible.<br>That means:<br><br>Eyes wide open so that we may see our beloved.<br>Deep breathing to facilitate relaxation and the delivery of pheromones (our natural love chemicals) to heighten turn-on.<br>Arms to hold and caress,<br>Hearts touching and beating together.<br>The delicate smell of your partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s breath and body.<br>The ability to hear your partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s sounds, words of love and communication about what they like.<br>Great physical connection that maximizes pleasure for both partners.<br>The missionary position, or woman on bottom - man on top, is the basic way most humans make love most of the time. It can be satisfying at times and also get a little stale at times. It meets most of the qualifications above except the last one. Here are a few great variations on the theme that may help you maximize the pleasure too.<br><br>Men, as you assume the position and have entered your partner, lift up slightly so that your head gets closer to your partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s head and your pubic bone lines up a little better with your partnerÃ¢Â€Â™s. You are more parallel to each other. This will cause your pubic bone to rub on the womanÃ¢Â€Â™s clitoris, which is actually a difficult thing to accomplish normally in the missionary position. Try moving up and down together, versus in and out. You can get a rhythm going very easily. Your hearts are very close together and words are easily whispered into your loverÃ¢Â€Â™s ear.<br><br>The Kama Sutra recognizes many variations of the man on top positions. A very affective one is a modification of the Yawning Position. From the missionary position the woman moves to the position of having her legs on the man's shoulders while he is still on top. In this position the woman has a lot more control over the stimulation of her G-spot. She can rotate her hips and subtly shift her position to place the thrusting man at the perfect angle. DonÃ¢Â€Â™t be afraid to try this Ã¢Â€Â“ itÃ¢Â€Â™s not as difficult as it sounds. From this position, invent a thrusting pattern together that will really stimulate the woman and let the man last a little longer, like, 4 shallow and 2 deep. Repeat this. And remember, keep your eyes open!<br><br>Animal Positions<br><br>The ancient Taoists and Tantrics, who studied manuscripts like the Kama Sutra, believed that animals had a lot to teach us about lovemaking and positions. They suggested that lovers go out into nature together and observe certain animals. Notice what tigers and lions do when it comes to making love.
