            <div class='col-md body'>They do not put into consideration the consequences should such a circumstance occur.  To them, if it does, its like just one word can solve everything like that.  Just say the word "abort", problem solved.<br><br>Saying is one thing, doing it is another.  Its nothing to do with the cost.  Its more to do with the mentality.  Think before you do anything, consider the consequences of your intended actions.  "What ifs'" happen for a reason.  Do all it takes to make sure it doesn't or lower all chances of it happening.<br><br>No one say you cannot enjoy, but at least think beforehand.  Stupid excuses like "it was the heat of the moment." don't work at the end of the day.  What's done is done.  Theres no such thing as undone in the real world.  Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya  just sharing what I had seen of several of my guys and girls friends who had to deal with abortion and yes they regret it badly.  The girls really suffer!  and they suffer for many many years!  Its not something that you can just forget or pretend that it does not have an impact or dont bother you... that is just a cover.. deep down the pain is real.<br><br>I have spoken to the guys responsible too and yes bit by bit it affects them. there is this hurt within them... its really hard to describe but the pain is very real!<br><br>So guys and girls please spare a thought.  <strong>girls when you give outside marriage please protect yourself... you have nothing to fall back on!  No hubby, no family, no emtional or societal or even economic structure whatsoever to fall back on.  so the big looser is YOU</strong>.  <span style="color: red;">insist on protection.  no protect walk!</span><br><br>and guys dont be like that dog screwing that pikachu... love your partner enough not to put her through this.  even if you dont, at least love yourself!<br><br>Ok will not say anymore.</div>

Whether pre-marital sex or abortion is right in the first place is one issue, but who says that guys don't feel anything when it comes to abortion. Who says the guy has nothing to lose? If the baby is born he has a responsibility to look after the baby and give baby a good life. But if he can't, it's difficult choice to actually agree to killing off his own flesh and blood.<br><br>Pregnancy and abortion does affect the guy emotionally at least, although not physically. But heck, it's not an easy time for either of them.<br><br>You keep talking about how the girl loses out this and that, spare a thought for the guy too. He didn't want it to happen too. Of course I'm not saying all guys are good guys, but don't make sweeping statements. There are girls themselves who take unwanted pregnancies and abortions very lightly. They're not the type that fool around or what, just that they think lightly of it when they get pregnant. To them it's like ridding an excess flesh.<br><br>Just recently, I got to know this guy who had just overcome an abortion with his girlfriend. It was a trying time for both of them and it leaves both guy and girl with emotional scars for life. The guy still cries when he thinks about the daugther he almost had. And he feels sorry that there was no way he could bring up the child.<br><br>Not all guys are b@stards.</div>

A baby life is gone because people cannot take stress and irresponsible<br><br>So that guy just shed some tears and say he has no choice but to abort the unborn baby. Then we have to pity him n say he is correct? But who will shed tears for the unborn baby who is killed?</div>
