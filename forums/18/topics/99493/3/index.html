            <div class='col-md body'>i think the only consideration we should have is the irreversible physical damage done to the girl's body undergoing abortion. the death of an unborn baby is not an issue at all. personally, i've always felt the worth of someone's life is proportional to the impact it has created on someone else. therefore, an unborn baby even if it's mine, yet to be nurtured, having no life experience and no influence on anybody is as good as non-existant. in any critical event, i'd rather the mother's life be saved over the unborn baby's. no second thoughts at all. babies can be made anytime. a life partner is much harder to replace</div>

The more you keep talking about it, the more it really seems that you're off point. Quite honestly, if you do not understand the sensitivity of human life, then there's nothing to talk about.
