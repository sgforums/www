            <div class='col-md body'>I like the way this guy writes, though except the part on Americans I don't necessarily agree with him ...<br><br>From : <a href="http://main.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=tragicurlyhip" rel="nofollow">http://main.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=tragicurlyhip</a><br><br><blockquote>Wednesday, April 14, 2004<br><br>Geneocide saez::<br><br>So I read with great amusement about all the brouhaha over some pesky china boy commenting on Singaporeans and its government. Fancy Singaporeans getting worked up over some comments like that by a 18 year old cheena kid with a nick like Diablo3434. Someone ought to tell him that Diablo is so last season. It ended right about the beginning of this year when I started working.<br><br>Singaporeans. Quick to retort. Headlines. Forums. We do what we do best as patriots ?We COMPLAIN. Forget war, forget suicide bombing. Complain is the way to go.<br><br>Complaints are for whiners. Here at TragicurlyHip, we do things differently. We stick two fingers up and offer solutions our Garhmen (government) also don't dare say.<br><br>Below are excerpts from the newspaper article.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Singaporeans' brains are fed with pigswill, fat, have no intelligence, feel complacent even though they've only accomplished something small</span><br><br>&gt;&gt; Our achievements are out there for all to see. We're arrogant, unappreciative and hypocritical bastards. We've a lot of other things but we've certainly surpass being complacent fat and stoopid. That's the Americans.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Calling one of his Singaporean project mates 'stupid', he claimed that he could finish in a day what took that student four weeks to complete.</span><br><br>&gt;&gt; This is precisely why we Singaporeans hold management post and you do the work. And oh by the way, while our Singaporean women just take 1 min to shave off their armpit hair, you china folks take forever to do it and still figuring out how.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rest assured that we will not stay after we complete our studies. I will not return to Singapore even if you ask me to.</span><br><br>&gt;&gt; We give you study grants out of pity cos your mamas have been servicing ah peks at Chinatown just to give you an education. And you ingrate have been wasting your time playing Diablo. Prolly the only good use you'll ever find here is that of foreign talent in Massage Parlors. Cos the way you curl your tongues to pronounce your damn language can be put to real good use for just 30 bucks.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">He was one of 13 forum members who chided Singaporeans for forgetting their roots.</span><br><br>&gt;&gt; We all know that China was the first who founded America and other parts of the world. While China were satisfied with telling the inhabitants to sing praises to the emperor, the Brits and Yanks were smart enough to claim and colonize the world for themselves. Too late. Is this your subtle way of reminding us to shout your emperor's name before each and every meal? I tell you where my roots are. 25 years ago, I'm just a fucking sperm. Slow ones just withered away, unlucky one ended up on toilet tiles. I'm the best of the best to have made it this far. That's our roots. Why don't you take your pouty china lips and pucker up to your father's balls and then maybe I'll learn to talk like you chinks.<br><br>Geneocide's 3 ways to get back at those chink.<br><br>1. Make them take a shower and give them fresh change of clothes.<br><br>2. Tell them a joke while they are crossing the road. Notice how their eyes shut when they laugh. Then you laugh along when the dump truck runs them down.<br><br>3. Call Taiwan a country.<br><br>Posted 4/14/2004 at 12:03 PM - email it<br></blockquote></div>
