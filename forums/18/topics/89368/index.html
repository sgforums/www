He worried we dun read the papers??<br><br>Some others like Jamieyeo, i dun rely mind cause they dun flood the forum with too many posts.

Some of the forumites have just chosen to speak up what is wrong here. So you can complain about people then others have no right to complain? (You don't think the world revolves around you, do you?). Besides, you must realise how some people are prominent from just posting thrash and clone threads, and some who are only interested in provoking others and starting flame wars.<br><br>And what's wrong with people saying or hoping that BAR can be better? Is wanting a forum to be better a cheap thrill for you?<br><br>Anyway, since you say don't care, then just keep quiet. Don't words and actions don't tally.</div>

Sadly there still isn't much of any quality left among the other posts. I think forumites are getting bored with the forum and the lame threads as well in general, because people don't post as much in all the many threads by the same person anymore.<br><br>Guess let the thread die a natural death.</div>
