There was a hk movie abt women during this year's filmfest and a part of the show was about lesbians. women nowadays are more independent and they dont really need guys to feel good abt themself. they can caress each other in bed whole day w/o sex and they'll still be happy, they can go anywhere together, even to the toilet. There was a report of some lesbians whose periods falls on the same date after a lengthy time together so they'll know each other's pain. Think what they want is someone who really knows how to care for a women and also understand them lor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

It's like many other, what many would classify as, normal  BGR. Any normal person dun establish relationships just to satisfy their sexual hunger .... they bulid relationship becuase they genuiningly feel for each other and wishes to make a commitement to one another. Many of them may establish such relationships out of curiosity, peer pressure, family conflicts, attention seeking, coz it's the "in thing" or just for the sake companionship. Such reasons are common especially among teenagers, the period of a human life when you are most vunerable and quick to prove yourself. Other then that, it's just basically love. t's indeed easier to understand what your partner is thinking/feeling when you re of the same gender. And also like many other BGR, it has it's own issues, pressure, commitment and initimate moments.<br><br>As for sex, what the les are short of can always be replaced by mechanical tools like vibrators. Other then that everything else is about the same. It's also easier to get physically intimate like with someone of the same gender then with someone of the opp gender, at least in the girl's point of view.<br><br>Having babies, well there is always the option of sperm banks, surrogate mothers, adoption etc ... if there is a will there is a way ... not that difficult. Like any other normal couples who cannot conceive in the "normal" way....<br><br>It's just like a BGR, not much difference.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
