            <div class='col-md body'>Eh, kinda late to join the thread, but anyway...<br>There is no MUST in any relationship lor. C'mon even husbands get sued for rape. Touching is a 2-way thing, and i dun see the need for a girl to allow her bf to touch her cos she feels she should even thou she dun like it. Dun want means dun want, if the bf can't understand that, then well, shows how much he loves her doesn't it?<br>Of cos, if the couple has come to a stage where they're comfortable with each other's body, i dun see any problems with them engaging in any hanky panky  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's all come down to the confident &amp; comfortability between the couple lah.<br><br>Frankly speaking, 101% of the guys (I mean if his body has more male hormones than female hormones) do alway being carried off by their sexual desire. I realised this when I have experienced the process. However, guys, we must acknowledge the fact that we are human not beast. If you demand people's respect, 1st you must start to respect people around you too.</div>
