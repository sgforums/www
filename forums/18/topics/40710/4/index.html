            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Jasmine17,<br><br>Firstly, i do think that girls have the right to reject guys where they may have gone morally wrong.A girl should not feel pressured to go further with her boyfriend if she does not feel comfortable. People may say that they do things with their boyfriends but most of it isn't true. You don't need to please them and I am sure, if the guy really cares about the girl,he will not mind taking things slow.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Secondly, I know how awkward it is to start a rather touchy feely relationship with a guy which started as a really good friendship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I think you just need more time to adjust because feelings and emotions can get mixed up. Your best way to deal with this is to be honest with him about how you feel. Take things slower and don't<br>move faster then with what you are comfortable with. I am sure what you think about yourself no one else does. It you feel self conscious just remember that everyone has things they don't like about themselves. Just don't rush things and with time everything will work out.<br><br>If he really tells you that if you don't give me what i want to your body then i suggest to get rid of him. You don't deserve to be treated like that and you shouldn't wait your precious time on a guy that doesn't deserve someone like you. But if you feel strongly for him then tell him how you feel and try to make the relationship work. If he doesn't try then he's not ready for a relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Make Yourself Happy First! If he's not making you happy then find someone that does...don't waste your time on someone who can't handle a relationship and the responsibility that comes along with it. Find someone that can give you everything you ever wanted in a relationship and go for it.<br><br>Talk to him first and if nothing happens then get rid of him...then find someone that will make you happy...Good Luck<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
