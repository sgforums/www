            <div class='col-md body'>LIFE IS PRECIOUS, take care &amp; beware of strangers. when you're out there. Always have at least a friend to accompany you to the carpark. BE ON GUARD! On Friday night, 13th June, my beautiful cousin Canny Ong was abducted and our family were in so much anguish waiting for news of her disappearance. 4 days later, a charred body was found at a building site, about 3 miles away from where the car ( my aunt's) in which she was found. She was raped, tortured, stabbed, strangled, and her body set ablaze. All this because the murderer saw her at a restaurant, and found her very pretty, and slim and "fit"? The men are now caught and will face<br>the death penalty. As a woman, i think there are so many sick bastards out there. We cannot take things for granted. Please don't go anywhere alone. Canny only left her mum and friends at the Autopay machine to go to the car to get the ticket when 3 men grabbed her and pushed her into the car and drove off. She's gone now, there is nothing I can do to get her back. I will never get over it. wait 4 a while later post pics 4 u all 2 c........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><img src="http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/e2a367a9/bc/My+Photos/__tn_1.jpg?bcC6xD_AFMhiVXTg"></div>
