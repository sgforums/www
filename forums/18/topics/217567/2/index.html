An underage girl had intercourse with an underage boy. no matter who start first, even if the girl forced the boy to have intercourse, it's still considered as a rape case, the boy rape the girl, in the law.<br><br>case #2. A man ACCIDENTLY flashed in front of a woman. the woman can sue the man, and the man will be considered as immoral. His fault for not being careful. But if a woman ACCIDENTLY flashed in front of a man, she can sue the man too! The man will be considered as a pervert too for peeping the woman.</div>
