I stick to my stance that it should be done only after mrriage.I urge you to control your desires. It is simply not worth it to destroy another life.To repeatedly kill one person after another, it simply degrades you character.So please i beg you, why not wait for a couple of years later and settle down first before thinking of expending your urges?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, a mistake is a mistake.No need to try to paint black into white.While under you circumstances it was a neccesary proceedure, it could have been prevented by simply controlling your urges. Why don't you just accept that and learn from it?How many abortions can you make, or rather how many potential children will you kill before your spouse or girlfriend's body finally gets harmed?Please, i am not trying to impose my morals over you, but it is just that i don't see the worth of killing so many humans just because you want one night's pleasure.You are simply shaking off your responsibility as a person as a whole this way.Love is not just about sex.Love is the responsibility and the dedication involved with each other.You might as well go and have a one night stand if you want a sexual relationship so much.Please, learn to be a hman.Learn to love your girl friend as a person, not a reusable toy where your child is just an unwanted waste product destined for the dumps.I urge you not to commit the same mistake agin.<br><br>I wish you all the best.</div>

He picks and mixes worldviews and lines of reasoning to justify whatever he is doing without really even knowing what they imply, as I have shown quite clearly.<br><br>b)Basically, this show's he's not the macho or hot-blooded hero he makes himself to be here, uttering off supposedly macho rebuttals and vulgarities. But in actual fact, what a person he really is, is somebody who is broken, sad and frightened person. Basically an attempt to paint black to white is an instincive reaction to make him able to contuine.<br><br>c)Hence it can be concluded that the stuff he says here don't really hold water, they are not logical reasonings of a sound person, but a hastily knitted-together quilt of illogic and contradiction. A facade he sets up to prevent himself from collasping from the true grotesque nature of what he has done, to hide himself from the ugly truth.<br><br>Having said that, basically we can learn a few lessons from his sad case.<br><br>1.) Don't make such mistakes, think before you leap.<br><br>2.) If you go wrong, do your best to make it right rather then going for the easy way out that will only hurt others around.<br><br>3.) Don't whitewash them or justify them. It's better to admit the mistake and learning from it then deciding to embrace it and justify it. Which in the end, will only turn you into the monster he is rapidly becoming.<br><br>Basically the worst enemy of hoplite in this case in reality is not his parents, it's not his GF, it's not "morons" like us who point out the blatantly obvious to him, and it's certainly not his child, who is innocent but took the rap for him anyway (and you though it was the role of parents to protect their children).<br><br>The worst enemy of hoplite in reality, is himself. He has met the enemy, and it is him. He is his own worst enemy. Unless he decides to come out from his shell and face up to what he has done like a real man instead of hiding behind a false facade of cigar-chewing toughness (which anybody can see through the the real paethetic person you are in reality anyway), things will just be downhill in the future for him.<br><br>I know I have the conviction that in the future I can look my child straight in the eye and tell him that he never had a brother or sister that was not wanted and tossed away. That's something I think everybody should strive for.<br><br></div>

If u dun wanna be slagged by the pro-life ppl then why let them know in the 1st place? duh............ anyway.......... too bad something like that has happened........ im not religious but do pray for the soul of your baby...... what is done is done.

It can't be taken too seriously, it's only an extra avenue of new ideas. IMHO, hoplite and his gf will probably receive the best advice from a counsellor instead of weighing the  reasons here. The professionally trained counsellor will most probably advice him to abort though.</div>
