            <div class='col-md body'>Basically you are degrading the sanctity of life if you say that the fetus is not human. It largely depends on your viewpoints. It is a controversial issue here. Personally i think that it is a human life.<br><br>I would say that i do not support abortion. It should only be taken as the last resort. It is taking away of a life of a child by his very own parents. It can be called murder in a way - you actually devised a plan to kill the baby.<br><br>When i say last resort, it means in the scenario when the life of the mother is threatened by the baby, in which her life will be endangered in the process of giving birth to the baby. Only then i think aborting the child is justified. Other than that it's a no no.<br><br>If abortion is my last resort then what other way out is there given your current predicament?<br><br>So here's my answer:<br><br>A baby can always be given birth to and if you have no means of bringing him up, he can always be adopted by other parents who are infertile and barren.  It is a win-win situation. The baby gets good foster parents, infertile parents gets a child, you do not have to take care of the baby too since you are not financially independent as of now.  I would think that this is a more humane solution. Give the baby a chance to live.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hoplite, i understand your situation.I don't condone abortion nor do i condone pre maritial sex , but at the same time, i guess your situation calls or it.However, maybe you should try to preach against pre maritial sex rather than encouraging people to abort.A life is a life you terminate it, it is considered as  killing, whether it is legal or not.At the same time, i am just a bystander who does not have any rights to interfere with you life.I just hope that you won't commit such a mistake again.<br><br>Remember, you are responsible for yourself.At the same time, it takes a level of maturity to make sure you are on the right track. I just wish you and your girlfriend good luck, and value each other more  than ever.Don't commit the mistake again.<br><br>Maybe a couple of years down the road, when you and your girlfriend is presumably married, i hope you remember that you once had a child and i hope you will never forget about him and his sacrifices.<br>You sacrifice him so that you could be together with his mom. Make sure his sacrifice is just.<br>Tresure her, and don't make anymore meaningless sacrifices again<br><br>I wish you and your girl friend all the best.</div>
