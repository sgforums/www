            <div class='col-md body'>The fine line between a sentient human being and a 'lifeless' embryo is very much a complex issue intertwined in legality, morality and biology.<br><br>As such the only definition we have of life is through the Law. But is the Law infaillable? Are legal loopholes avenues for us to cover up defiency in our morals? It certainly isn't so.<br><br>Consciousness is an unexplained phenomena. Many pro-abortionist use the lack of self-awareness in a featus to justify their actions. I put to you the parody of a patient in coma, is it right to kill him. Or even someone in sleep. Basically when you sleep your mind is 'disconnected' from your body. Rendering you as good as unconscious. May I kill you then?<br><br>Pardon my little biology lecture. It is common knowledge that the fusing of the ova and sperm results in the embryo. Sperms and eggs are haploid, meaning they contain 23 chromosomes respectively, while the embryo has 46. From then on, the embryo is on its way to development to a homo sapien. I myself determine this fusion as the beginning of life.<br><br>This post is only a caucass of the main debate, do take note.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lv_gal:</div><div class="quote_body">neither i say abort the child. it's hard decision. like u said, Its not fair if you don't even give the child a chance to prove himself but what if the child reali had the thought of what i mention above? arent his/her life will be more miserable? so no one can predict what will happen in future. and whatever we said, it's no point. let the victim to decide whether to give birth or nt. cos it is their responsibities to all. n whatever guilt, they r the one to suffer. we r nt in their shoes, we wont feel the hard decision n consequences they might facing. maybe when it ur turn, u might think n act differently from what u said now.....<br></div></blockquote>You are right. I might not know what i will do if i were him. I think i will be very confused. I just want to share my life here:<br><br>My mother is adopted. I don't have any real maternal grandparents. She had a hard time trying to raise the 4 of us (me and my siblings) us. Now all my siblings are happily married. If my mum had given up hope on herself knowng that her real parents dumped her away, i would not be here now. Just want to testify that this is not an impossible problem to face for the unwanted child. I am the living testimony and the fruit of someone who has been able to overcome her problems in life.<br><br>Ultimately Hopelite is the one who makes the decision, whatever we say, its kinda useless against a defensive mind like his. So i'll just wish Hoplite the best and try not to think with his dick again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would say SingaporeTyrannosaur had touched the raw nerve of hoplite and had highlited hoplite probable feelings now.<br><br>i personally though do not condone abortion but i believe hoplite did what he needs to do. i would have do the same thing if i were to be in his shoes, but not for the sake of not being able to with the ger, but for the future of us both.<br><br>however its really sad that he do not respond to his mistakes and criticism and admit he is wrong and instead trying hard to save his pathetic ass by some flawed logic.<br><br>i do not wish for the best of him and hope that he realise his mistake one day.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
