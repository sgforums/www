            <div class='col-md body'>err ok firstly there is a problem with her.<br><br>she should had informed her bf that she wants to break up with him prior doing these sort of touching thing with you.<br><br>though her bf treats her badly. however what you have to realise is that she's still in a relationship with someone and this thing between you and her would be considered flirting.<br><br>though she should dump her bf. but the fact is that she hasn't. which makes her someone elses.<br><br>1 way or the other, you'll have to discuss this with her. I just hope she's not fooling around with you. as for the V'day, the way you describe it sounds like she can't get anyone to go out with her, thats why she used you as spare tyre to burn time.</div>
