I am that dude once.<br><br>Anyway, after your second chapter, all i can say is, ARE YOU NUTS !!??? It's your chance !! Well, can't confirm also but at least that's the moment to express all your feelings right away, on how much u care for her n wanna be with her n how u hef waited all this while and see what she said ? If she said she just wanna treat u as a friend, don't go and jump down from building or stuff like that, just take it easy dude, in love n relationship, it's all about Fate n Feelings if those two don't present, dun feel disappointed or lost your self esteem n confidence like what happen to me, just take it easy n go on in life. It took me 3 long years to regain my concious n confidence n i think that's stupid but thanks god, I am back. Oh ya, before i forgot, I can feel it that you are quite uneasy for you being ugly n fat, eh dude, no one is born ugly in this world, just different look all together, and you are the only dude with this kind of look in this world, and what that makes u ? SPECIAL !! Fat ? Fat is also another for cutey cool, you are fat, when u think u r fat !! Always feel good about yourself dude, cause that's the only way you can make yourself intoa confident dude. Ooooops ........... out of topic a little.<br><br>For now, I think, u should calm yourself down n make a plan on what to say, ask her out, face her, blurt out all your feelings n whatever happen how u have waited for the day to come to be with her and see what she say lor .......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  This is the best way i think, instead of hangin half way in the sky.<br><br>I wish you all the best dude !
