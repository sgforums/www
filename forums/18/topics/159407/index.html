            <div class='col-md body'>Why do we form relationships? To eventually breed with one's partner. It is human nature. Relationships are about caring, trust, and love, but if one starts a relationship, one has to accept that it will lead to sex. But if one wants a relationship that does not include having sex, then one's relationship would not last.<br><br>Why do you deny yourself pleasure and sex when it is human instinct to want to have sex with one's partner in a relationship? Because of the pain, of the diseases one might get from the other person, or because you are afraid of getting pregnant?<br><br>Why do people say sex is bad, when sex is what drives us on? It is what we need in order to reproduce, to grow, to develop and to evolve into a species with a much higher level of intelligence. Generations of young children have been corrupted with the idea that sex is bad, and sex is not encouraged before marriage. If that is the case, then why do we reach puberty at such a young age and why do we aquire the vital organs needed to reproduce and breed and produce the cells needed to create new life? The main purpose of life is to have sex, to breed. Animals understand this better than us all. That is why the animal society is able to thrive, to live in peace with one another and able to reproduce at such a rapid pace.<br><br>Humans have to understand that having sex is the most important thing that determines if we become extinct or continue to grow and become a truly sentient species that is capable of understanding the basic needs of humanity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>forming a relationship is more than jus to breed human species. it is not as simple as wat u think it is...comprising of care trust n love..so where does e commitment comes in? u are only emphasizing on passion n intimatcy. to have a successful r.s, studies have shown that these three aspects are impt (commitment, passion n intimatcy). it helps u to form ur identity and sense of belonging...<br><br>not all r.s leads to sex. how do u explain platonic r.s then? fair enough if u r talking bout romantically involved r.s. wat bout flings..they are only passion (or lust for a person) u consider tat a relationship?<br><br>so wat if u have sex w ur partner..if u do not have intimatcy or commitment or both of these aspect, the r.s will not last either...sex not = a lasting r.s<br><br>yes according to Abraham Maslow: Hierarchy of Needs<br>sex is the bottom of the triangle..which makes up e basics..however to read on into his theories, we have basic human needs n drive, not only to breed. there are other things that human would want to achieve. to greater heights, to be accepted by other pple, to have self-actualization, then self-transcendence..<br><br>u forgot to explore into social issues. if everyone goes crazy over sex, then who is reponsible for all those widespread of diseases? who dies in e end? (isnt it u?) is tat wat u wan? (now tat u feel tat sex is necessary to breed) u can practically have sex n die...<br><br>even if u wanna have sex, u shld do it e safe n correct way..no one says sex is bad. as long as u do it wisely n responsibly, its okie wat. we have issues tat the older generations says tat sex is bad cos: teenagers get themselves into trouble. they do not have a good understanding of e circumstances that follows..pregnancy, diseases etc. isnt tat more social issues?<br><br>y do we reach puberty at such a young age? it is part n parcel of preparing ur body for the next 40-60 yrs of adulthood! pple are getting into puberty stage at a younger age now is due to the better nutrition that they are getting.<br><br>if u say tat animals understand tis all, thrive n reproduce at such rapid pace, y did some species get extinct at all?<br><br>there are much more pointers to think bout...its not as simple as u think..<br><br>i think ur post is total crap</div>
