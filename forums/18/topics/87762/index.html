I may not be totally correct.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Red wine read meat... white wine white meat? True, but I don't care.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  How to know which year it is by tasting? No such thing lah!! Only possible if you are familiar with the produce from all region every year. Which means you have keep track of the wine industry and tasted all the produce each year. Not sure even if the pro is doing that.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Longer it's kept... better it is? Not true. Only that in some years where the harvest is very good quality, people keep it until there is a good event to want to drink it. So, the wines from the good years are consider as vintage wine and are collectibles.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Can't be kept after opening? Yeap, unless you want it to turn into vinegar. When expose to air, wine turns into vinegar slowly. Generally, it is advised to drink it within 24/48hrs of opening.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  The skin of the grapes affect the quality of wine? Not sure. But red wine is with skin and white wine is without skin. Same grape.</div>
