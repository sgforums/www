            <div class='col-md body'>I went there on Wed, and found that the place really changed a lot... and I mean the crowd... Usually... Weds and Sats are the most crowded days... and by 9, there would be queues forming outside... I went there on Wed at 9... and there was no queue!!! At all!!! And to make things worse, it's no more 8 -10 free for guys... Argh... never go there for 2 months, change so much...<br><br>The crowd there was like all 18 yr olds... I felt old sia... Really very different to the first time I went there at the start of the year... The crowd then was older... Most of them in the VIP area were older... those who came after work... This time... it was all kids... Everywhere I turn... I see guys who look like they haven't even entered NS... got some girls... look only 15!! WTH!! Got one girl.... got drunk at about 10 plus!! I'm like.. hah? so early drunk already ah? Worse thing is that I saw her getting carried to the toilet at least 3 times in 2 hours.... Cannot hold your liquor then don't drink so much mah... cannot control sia...<br><br>That day was also the day I saw the most number of people dancing like retards... They think humping the rear of a gal dancing is cool... I think it looks damn perverted... esp when the girl is ignoring you...<br><br>Hai~...
