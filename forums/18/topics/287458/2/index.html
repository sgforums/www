The husband covered her with a coat, pulled on his shorts, carried her to the car and made a dash to the hospital.<br><br>After examining her, the doctor explained that the wasp was too far in to be reached with forceps.

"if neither of you objects," the medic said, "I could give it a try."<br><br>Under the circumstances, both agreed. The doctor quickly undressed, slathered on some honey and mounted the woman. The husband watched with increasing alarm as the doctor's thrust continued for several long minutes. "Hey, What the hell is happening?"<br><br>"Change of plans," The physician panted. " I'm going to drown the little b@stard!."</div>

The husband replies, "I don't know, it was some bloke who wanted to know if the coast was clear."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A husband and his wife who have been married 20 years were doing some yard work.<br><br>The man was working hard cleaning the BBQ grill while his wife was bending over, weeding flowers from the flower bed. So the man says to his wife "Your rear end is almost as wide as this grill" She ignores the remark.<br><br>A little later, the husband takes his measuring tape and measures the grill, then he goes over to his wife while she is bending over, measures her rear end and gasps, "Geez, it really IS as wide as the grill!" She ignores this remark as well.<br><br>Later that night while in bed, her husband starts to feel frisky. The wife calmly responds, "If you think I'm gonna fire up the grill for one little wiener, you are sadly mistaken."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After the annual office Christmas party blow-out, John woke up with a pounding headache, cotton-mouthed, and utterly unable to recall the events of the preceding evening. After a trip to the bathroom he was able to make his way downstairs, where his wife put some coffee in front of him. "Louise," he moaned, "tell me what went on last night. Was it as bad as I think?"<br><br>"Even worse," she assured him in her most scornful one. "You made a complete ass of yourself, succeeded in antagonizing the entire board of directors, and insulted the chairman of the company to his face."<br><br>"He's an arrogant, self-important prick, piss on him!"<br><br>"You did. All over his suit, " Louise informed him. "And he fired you."<br><br>"Well, f<span style="font-style: italic;">u</span>ck him," said John.<br><br>"I did. You're back at work on Monday."</div>
