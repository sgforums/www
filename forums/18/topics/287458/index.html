Still, she doesn't want to linger so she calls a doctor to find out exactly where the heart is.<br><br>He tells her to put her first two fingers together, hold them horizontally and place the tip of the first finger just below her left nipple. The heart, he says, is immediately below the first knuckle on her second finger.<br><br>Later that day, the doctor is called to the emergency room to put fourteen stitches in the elderly woman's left thigh.</div>

We turned on a night light, turned the answering machine on, covered our pet parakeet and put the cat in the backyard. We phoned the local cab company and requested a taxi. The taxi arrived and we opened the front door to leave the house. The cat we put out in the yard, scoots back into the house. We didn't want the cat shut in the house because she always tries to eat the bird.<br><br>My wife goes out to the taxi, while I went inside to get the cat. The cat runs upstairs, with me in hot pursuit. Waiting in the cab, my wife doesn't want the driver to know that the house will be empty for the night. So, she explains to the taxi driver that I will be out soon, "He's just going upstairs to say goodbye to my mother."<br><br>A few minutes later, I get into the cab. "Sorry I took so long," I said, as we drove away. "That stupid b!tch was hiding under the bed. Had to poke her with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off, so I grabbed her by the neck. Then, I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching me. But it worked! I hauled her fat ass downstairs and threw her out into the back yard!"<br><br>The cab driver hit a parked car.</div>

He saw a little girl coming towards him, so he covered himself with the newspaper he was reading. The girl came up to him and asked "What do you have under the newspaper, mister?"<br><br>"A bird," the guy replied. The little girl walked away and the guy fell asleep.<br><br>When he woke up, he was in a hospital in tremendous pain. When the Police asked him what happened, the guy replied, "I don't know. I was lying on the beach, this girl asked me about my privates, and the next thing I know is I'm here."<br><br>Police went back to the beach, found the girl, and asked her "What did you do to that naked fellow?"<br><br>After a little pause, the girl replied, "To him? Nothing. I was playing with the bird and it spit on me, so I broke its neck, cracked its eggs, and set its nest on fire."<br><br>===============================================<br><br>A man is very horny and goes into a wh0re house. he goes up to a wh0re and tell her he wants to do something new and exciting. so she tells him "ok, baby, how about a little 69?". he says "69? what's that?" so she tells him "come upstairs and i'll show you". so they go upstairs, get naked, climb on the bed and start doing 69.<br><br>After about 5 minutes, she farts. he's a little shocked, but doesn't say anything because he's enjoying it so much. she continues, he continues and after about 15 minutes, she farts again. this time much bigger than the first. the guy gets really upset, but still doesn't say anything because he's still very turned on and enjoying his 69. after about 10 minutes, she farts again, this time a huge ripper, really smelly. by now he's really disgusted and throws her off the bed, and starts getting dressed. she looks up at him and says "what's the matter honey, didn't you enjoy 69?" and he shouts back "Hell no! i can't take 66 more of those!!!!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A little boy and his grandfather are raking leaves in the yard. The little boy sees an earthworm trying to get back into its hole. He says, "Grandpa, I bet I can put that worm back in that hole." The grandfather replies, "I'll bet you five dollars you can't. It's too wiggly and limp to put back in that little hole."<br><br>The little boy runs into the house and comes back out with a can of hair spray. He sprays the worm until it is straight and stiff as a board. The boy then proceeds to put the worm back into the hole. The grandfather hands the little boy five dollars, grabs the hair spray and runs into the house.<br><br>Thirty minutes later the grandfather comes back out and hands the boy another five dollars. The little boy says, "Grandpa, you already gave me five dollars." The grandfather replies, "I know. That's from your Grandma."</div>
