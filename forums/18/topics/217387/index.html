Kneeling before him, she let her tongue flicker over his thighs just below his groin, holding onto his hips for leverage. It was obvious that he intended to drag out her torment by blatantly ignoring his aching cock. After what seemed to be an eternity, she finally to wrapped her fingers firmly around the stiff rod.<br><br>The feeling of KimÂ’s soft fingers around his responsive organ sent chills down RonÂ’s spine. He watched intently as she tediously continued to caress his belly and thighs before finally brushing against his sensitive head. Teasing him further, she lightly fluttered her tongue over his cock in short, jerky movements before taking him into her mouth at last. As her tongue began to swirl leisurely around the tip, he felt the urge to scream from the sensation. Instead, he allowed a soft moan to escape his lips causing Kim to look up at him wickedly. Â“YouÂ’d better not come, or youÂ’ll be sorry.Â” She warned flatly before continuing with her ministrations.<br><br>She tortured him sweetly by pumping her mouth up and down his shaft, slowly dragging her tongue along the back as she went. After several minutes like this, she changed her approach and started to suck aggressively on just the tip, bringing her hand up to massage his balls. This elicited another series of deep moans from her long-time friend. She could have reprimanded him for expressing his pleasure without permission, but instead she smiled inwardly at the thought of him struggling to keep himself under control. She had him wrapped around her finger.<br><br>Knowing that he wouldnÂ’t be able to hold out much longer, she took his entire length into her mouth, causing it to brush against the back of her throat. She then released him with a loud slurping sound.</strong><br><br>This is part of an adult fanfiction under cartoons category, Kim Possible title "by the moon light" author: WildKat.....<br><br>I can't write this well... -_-"</div>
