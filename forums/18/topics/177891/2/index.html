            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by albinoworm:</div><div class="quote_body">True story, I was happy. My girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me." I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, "We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.<br><br>"The moral of this story is:"<br><br>"Always keep your condoms in your car."</div></blockquote>Heyyy... someone post that before  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

This sight scares her so she runs inside her house.<br>Trying to figure out what to do she grabs the yellow pages and looks it up. Sure enough right in the yellow pages is a big ad for gorilla extractors. She calls the number and the man on the other end of the line says he'll be right over.<br>When he shows up he explains to the lady that it is a pretty common problem and it should only take a few minutes. First he must get his equipment. So from his truck he grabs a stepladder, a shotgun, an eight foot pole, handcuffs and a dog.<br>The lady exclaims, "What the hell is all that stuff for?"<br>The gorilla extractor explains, "First I climb up on the stepladder and ram this here pole up the gorilla ass. This will cause the gorilla to fall from the tree at which point that mean ass dog will bite the gorilla in the balls. This temporarily paralyzes the gorilla. At which point I put the handcuffs on the gorilla and take him away."<br>The lady asks, "What's the shotgun for?"<br>The man answers, "If I fall off the ladder, you shoot the dog!"</div>

Realizing she had forgotten to title the assignment; she reaches to the very top of the chalkboard. Suddenly there is an even louder giggle from another male student.<br>She quickly turns and asks, "What's so funny, Billy?"<br>"Well teacher, I just saw both of your garters."<br>Again she yells, "Get out of my classroom!" This time the punishment is more severe, "I don't want to see you for three weeks."<br>Embarrassed, she drops the eraser when she turns around, so she bends over to pick it up. This time there is an all out belly laugh from another male student. She quickly turns to see Little Johnny leaving the classroom.<br>"Where do you think you are going?" she asks.<br>"Well teacher, from what I just saw, my school days are over."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since the wife is eight months into her pregnancy, the husband has to sleep on the floor to avoid any regrettable mistake, which might happen pretty easily, for he has been desperate for sex for quite a while now...<br><br>Just before lying down on the bed, she glances at him and sees the poor guy curled up on the floor, eyes stare widely into the empty air, filled with hopeless desire...<br><br>Feeling sorry for her husband, she opens the top drawer of the cabinet, takes out a fifty dollar bill, and gives it to him. She says...<br><br>'Awww, honey you're so depressed... Here, take this and go to the woman next door, and she will let you sleep with her tonight. But remember that this happens only once... Ok?...Don't think about it or ask me to do this again.<br><br>The husband rolls his eyes in disbelief, but afraid that she may change her mind, he grabs the money and leaves quickly.<br><br>A few minutes later, he returns, hands the bill back to the wife and says with much disappointment, "She said this is not enough, she wants sixty dollars..."<br><br>The wife's face slowly turns red with anger, "Damn that bitch... When she was pregnant and her husband came over here... I only charged him fifty..."</div>
