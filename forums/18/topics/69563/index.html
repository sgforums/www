            <div class='col-md body'>Sgforums News Headline<br>14th February 2004<br><br>By laurence82<br><br><strong>Kotex Man admits he is determinedly irritating </strong>.<br><br>Last night, while he logged onto sgforums, Mr Cortez,age unknown, the most notorious and irritating bugger in the whole universe, explicitly admited he is a 'sand in our eyes', the 'ulcer in our mouth that refuses to go away'. After a proposal by an honourable forumnite Temujin, to dismiss Mr Cortez from sgforums permanently on various charges of indecent behaviours and frauds, such as verbal assaults on the fairer sex of the Republic, proclaiming to various indecent sexual acts, while displaying outlandish feminine behaviour.<br><br>While sgforums fellow forumnites were holding a discussion on this matter, after Temujin has made his speech, Mr Cortez barged into the conference, while waving his smelly fist around, loudly told the present committee "No use putting me away! I will be back!" followed by a string of vulgarities. Security guards were called in to surpress Mr Cortez and uphold order. After he was 'surpressed', the Singapore Police Force were called in. The members of sgforums 'Hottest News Team' were alerted and with this reporter, hurried to the scene of the incident. When we arrived, Mr Cortez was seen handcuffed by the police, and being led to a waiting police car. It was noticed he was bruised in one eye, with several gashes across his cheek.<br><br>We interviewed several forumnites who were present, as to ascertain the causes and course of the incident.....<br><br>See Evening Edition<br><br>Coming up on Evening Edition......<br><br><strong>Interviews </strong><br>We interviewd many forumnites and passer bys who were in the thick of the action on Friday night, including people offerring solutions to get rid of scums in Singapore<br><br><strong>Precautions against certain Spaniards</strong> -<br>Looks how our ladies moaned the dangers surrounding girls in sg today, and our in-house specialist forumnite <strong>shan cai </strong>giving tips on how to ward off these dangers.<br><br>More to come...<br><br><strong>Mr Cortez and his gayish fantasies.<br>Mr Cortez and his sexual incapability and his height! - Including Special Interviews With Frustmum and Richgirl </strong><br><br></div>

Yeah... oh did i mention it was a lady who knocked him down? yup. she gave him some light blows and he was down for the count. She tried kicking him in the balls but it didn't seem to hurt. I guess when u ain't got balls it wun hurt when people try kicking your nuts.<br>Anyway i almost died laughing when he said he was me in disguise. I wonder how i could disguise myself in such a way that I take out almost 20cm from my height, or how could that be me when i was standing in front of him while he said that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Interviews </strong><br><br>sgforums Hottest News Team had interviewed people on the streets and honourable members of sgforums as to what they think of the incident on Friday night and what solutions is needed to rid Singapore of scums.<br><br><strong>Temujin</strong> - Watsup Kotex.<br><br><strong>germanium85</strong> - Fuck u!! Fuck ur mother!! This is sgforum not ur bloody %!&amp;$ing spainish forum!!! Respect singapore juz as how we respect Spain.<br>Anyway juz %!&amp;$ ur mother!!!<br><br><strong>Mooku</strong> - i think that harsher penalties should be given to rapists.. and not just castrating them or putting them on death sentence or in jail....<br><br>what the victims received was psychological hurt as well as physical.. the rapists should get the same back.. maybe they should have a professional rapist who looks like crap to do the job. =P<br><br><strong>Neontetra</strong> - huh? wat u mean??? rape the rapist?? how can....we cannot punish a sin with another sin....<br><br>use G clamp and clamp his tool at the workshop's counter and hit repeatedly using mallet.<br><br>oh..i miss my technical class days....last me 2 yrs only<br><br><strong>Heng@</strong> - buddy chemical castration simply means to inject chemicals to block production of male hormones in the guy lah.... not dipping e dick in acid.... dip dick in acid also not called castration. Its penectomy, which originally meant surgical removal of the dick usually for reasons like penile cancer, but now can mean removal of the dick by any means for any reason. Anyway for Mr Cortez, may i propose we bbq his schlong while its still attached to him? that would inflict the most physical pain n mental pain.<br>MUAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br><strong>m' back</strong> - look ppl, i told u guys many a times not to gangbang kortex's mother in the double decker bus in his face! look at what a freak he has become? the next time if we r to gangbang his mother, do it when he is typing here in this forum.<br><br>....by the way, who is the 1 screeeeeeeeeeewinnnnnnnnng his mother now? when's my turn?<br><br><strong>Heng@</strong> - oooo....<br>well i feel his arrest was wayyyyyy overdue. scuffle? what scuffle? he was just lying there gettin' beaten up. but the police took him in anyway because they couldn't find the other party involved. Yeah... oh did i mention it was a lady who knocked him down? yup. she gave him some light blows and he was down for the count. She tried kicking him in the balls but it didn't seem to hurt. I guess when u ain't got balls it wun hurt when people try kicking your nuts.<br>Anyway i almost died laughing when he said he was me in disguise. I wonder how i could disguise myself in such a way that I take out almost 20cm from my height, or how could that be me when i was standing in front of him while he said that.<br><br><strong>shan cai</strong> - GERS OUT THERE PLS BEWARE!!! REGARDLESS OF WHETHER U R 8 YRS OLD OR 80 YRS OLD. JUZ B CAREFUL. KOTEX MAY PREY ON ANYBODY WOR!!!!!!!!!<br><br><strong>Ah Ma</strong> - ur ang mo v chim, Mr Cortez? he is v stress ah he taking PSLE this year. mus try to understand him also<br><br>More interviews to come..........<br><br></div>
