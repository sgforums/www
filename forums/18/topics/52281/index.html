Adult television there remains as popular as ever and Japan seems poised to go the same way," broadcast commentator Mitsuo Sanuka tells Shukan Post.<br><br>Paradise TV started airing in 1998, providing 24 hour broadcasts of its own exclusive adult material. It has steadily gained support throughout its existence and now boasts of over 100,000 subscribers.<br><br>"It makes programs that show youth and sex exactly as they are without coming across as preaching in any way," raunchy manga artist Mimei Sakamoto, who has appeared on Paradise TV shows, tells Shukan Post. "It places great emphasis on servicing customers by providing unique programs. It's far more interesting than what the normal networks produce, so it's no wonder that it's as popular as it is."<br><br>At first glance, Paradise TV's scheduling appears more hard-boiled and heavy than lowbrow and lighthearted, packed as it is with news and English conversation programs. <strong>It's only when the viewers learn that newscasters and language teachers are all nubile young women who perform naked that Paradise TV's attractiveness is evident.</strong><br><br>Also leading to the station's appeal are its incredibly raunchy programs, with titles unprintable even here. Some of the softer shows include "Shojo Atetara, Soshitsu Night! (<strong>Pick the Virgin, Watch the Night She Loses Her Virginity</strong>)"<br><br>Currently the most watched show on Paradise, it pits three women against each other as they undergo a series of tests to determine who has yet to be initiated into the world of sex. Viewers are encouraged to determine which of the three remains chaste. If the viewer poll correctly picks out the virgin, she is obliged to sacrifice her charity on screen.<br><br>Also expected to work hard on the job are the performers in "Nagara Sekkusu (Sex and Something Else), where naked housewives are expected to perform their daily tasks while an aroused young man distracts her by caressing her from the rear.<br><br>Another favorite is "Ero tekku jiji (Sex Technique Grandpa)," where a 65-year-old retired salarymen is sent to brothels with the order to use his wealth of knowledge to bring workers to a climax. He has already performed at about 30 cathouses across the country.<br><br>"If the only guys romping around with naked young women are good-looking, our male viewers will get sick of us," a Paradise spin doctor tells Shukan Post. "That's how this show was born."<br><br></div>

That's what's made my bust get so much bigger. It's always full and ready to produce," Risa tells Shukan Taishu. "If I get him to give me a squeeze while I'm down on all fours, it's just like I'm a dairy cow."<br><br>Hitomi, Risa and another two young mothers will seek a winner in a titillating, breast-of-two contest that will allow no room for making boobies if they want to take off the top prize.<br><br>The women will first compete in a milk production championship, which has the simple objective of finding out who can wring out the greatest quantity of breast milk in the shortest possible time.<br><br>But the decisive battle could well be the cooking contest, where there will first be a taste test as the women will go espresso into a cup of espresso before they produce their favorite milk-based dish, such as breast milk cream stew.<br><br>Taking the milking even further, the ultimate climax to the show will come with the lactating lasses expected to show the milk of human kindness to four young men, with the winner the first person able to induce the lad to produce some cream of his own.<br><br></div>
