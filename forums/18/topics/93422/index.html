I tolerate whole journey cos i tout its too packed.<br><br>The next few days i saw him then got up bus again, many empty seats so i sat on an empty seat but he just came sit next to me.  the whole journey with his hands on his thighs, then arms bend out like can touch my side body, sometimes rubbing on my arms n thighs  i moved n shifted uncomfortably but he just act blur.  After that, many times, though d bus got many empty seats he just chose to sit bside me.  Sometimes made me stick to the window.  got 1 time i stood up and sit elsewhere.<br><br>The last straw came  day when he is about to sit then i told him don't sit beside me anymore, but he ignore me and just sit down. then i shouted" don't sit beside me anymore, do you hear, this is not the 1st time u tried to touch me" then he just act blur and point to me and asked ppl" she gila?"  Then again i shouted" do u want me to call the police?" then he just act innocent and stood up and even saying" siao lah, this gal siao one".

            <div class='col-md body'>i would suggest that next time u don't sit alone, sit with some other passenger.  Or what u can do u can ask ur friend to accompany u, and when this happen again, give him a hard warning <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> or a better one is carry a pepper spray on ur hand and make sure he see it. If he disturb u again, just aim ur shoot <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br><br>Anyway don't get frustrated over this kind of idiot right <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> all the best</div>
