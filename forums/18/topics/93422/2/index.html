Should see this thread <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=93306" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=93306</a>. But back to topic, if I were there I would help you. It's quite obvious you're the one being victimised here, but he thinks he can get away with it. So you should give him hell so he will think it's not worth the trouble.<br><br>I won't help you beat up the guy or physically restrain him. Although I'd probably want to, but I'd help add a word or two to make him look bad. I'd say stuff like,"Want to take advantage of people still want to say people crazy. You think people stupid one ah?" Then I'd ask, "He got touch you? Got touch then can call police already. Bus driver will immediately go police station. Got molest case it's his job to drive there directly."</div>

I tolerate whole journey cos i tout its too packed.<br><br>The next few days i saw him then got up bus again, many empty seats so i sat on an empty seat but he just came sit next to me.  the whole journey with his hands on his thighs, then arms bend out like can touch my side body, sometimes rubbing on my arms n thighs  i moved n shifted uncomfortably but he just act blur.  After that, many times, though d bus got many empty seats he just chose to sit bside me.  Sometimes made me stick to the window.  got 1 time i stood up and sit elsewhere.<br><br>The last straw came  day when he is about to sit then i told him don't sit beside me anymore, but he ignore me and just sit down. then i shouted" don't sit beside me anymore, do you hear, this is not the 1st time u tried to touch me" then he just act blur and point to me and asked ppl" she gila?"  Then again i shouted" do u want me to call the police?" then he just act innocent and stood up and even saying" siao lah, this gal siao one".  Throughout this nobody from the bus ask me what happen, everyone just stand 1 side.  not even d bus driver ask me, not even any ladies show me concern.<br><br>i am very upset by their no reaction at all.   Aren't we supposed to help each other?  If you are there will you help me?<br><br></div></blockquote>I will help you if you are chio  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> are you?<br><br>if that happens. you can tell the bus driver. in singapore I thought molestation is a serious offense? I dunno how it works but if u call police or something that guy will be Fucked.</div>

I would also recommend to have someone to accompany you home or meet you at your designate bus stop to feel safer from him.<br><br>If that man ever touches you again, pick up your phone and called the police immediately  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>*or simply just punch him when he touches you and say "oops, sorrie, reflex reaction"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
