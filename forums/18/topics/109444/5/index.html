I know of many examples to refute your observation.<br><br>My sister-in-law who is Malay, has a Chinese husband and he speaks Mandarin to my nephew &amp; niece exclusively. She speaks Chinese with no problems, even communicating in dialect with her parents-in-law and the couple communicate with each other in English. Her many Malay relatives have not objected at all. She still speaks Malay with her relatives and "practises" Malay culture. Her children speak in English with her and with her relatives.<br><br>Another sis-in-law has a Caucasian husband and he hasn't shown any signs of becoming "Malayanised". My niece speaks with a distinct British accent.<br><br>My cousins who are Chinese and married Malays, still speak dialect and their houses don't show any signs of "Malayanisation". In fact some of my nieces from that side of the family, are not totally fluent in Malay.<br><br>When I converted to Islam, I didn't do it for the sake of marriage.

In appearance the 'baby' is totally dissimilar from its adult shape. </blockquote>Nope. That is called life-cycle. Butterflies don't evolve from caterpillars; butterflies <strong>develop</strong> from caterpillars. How it happens is a problem in developmental biology, not evolutionary biology. It is akin to the problem of how adult humans develop from embryos. However, there is still a difference in that butterflies, frogs undergo what is called Metamorphosis.<br><br>Definition of Metamorphosis from dictionary.com:<br>A change in the form and often habits of an animal during normal development <span style="font-style: italic;">after the embryonic stage.</span><br><br>Are u are suggesting that <span style="font-style: italic;">looks</span> is the <span style="font-style: italic;">only way</span> we differentiate one species from another?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>God does not force you to marry into Islam. He gives you the power of reasoning and freewill. If it is fated for the guy to marry the Muslim girl, the guy will one day 'realize' and he will use his gift of freewill to do right. I speak from experience . </blockquote>Just a question, if an other religion (die die do not believe in muslim) guy and a gal loves each other a lot and die die need to marry, wat r the option available to them ? From the viewpoints I came out with the following possible option<br><br>1, Don't marry<br>2, Guy convert (even though he die die do not believe in muslim)<br>3, Girl convert but will result in a serious backlash<br><br>the fourth option, guys stay as his religion and girl stay as her is not really avaliable if u r under strict muslim laws.<br><br>I heard from some rumours tat if a muslim decide to renounce her faith, her family had to disown her as a daughter... is tat true ?<br><br><blockquote>The medical science finds that there is a risk for various diseaseas<br>the pig is found to be a host for many parasites and potential diseases. </blockquote>I have talked about tis in speakers corner before. If muslim wanna ban pork because the scripture says so, then i have nothing to say. But if u ban pork because u deemed it to be a health hazard, then I can tell u it is wrong and pork is as safe as other meat sources. Tis is particularly true since pigs r being reared in conditions similar to the rearing of cows and sheeps. Look at the chinese and japanese, who had ate pork all their lives. They r the ones tat had lived the longest isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>How do you know whether it's an evolved species or a different species? It could always have been a whole different species that's extinct! </blockquote>How about tis then.<br><br><a href="http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm</a><br><br>It spoke of the discovery of a bug tat digest nylon ? It is well known tat nylon is invented by men only after 1930's. How come there r bugs tat can and only digest nylon now ?<br><br><blockquote>Dinosaurs evolved? They could also have been something totally different. A different creature. Why is it that they have to evolve to become their so-called ancestors today? Why deny the possibility that they are a different group of creatures that have been extinct? </blockquote>It is because we can see gradual changes from time to time of these creatures becoming closer and closer to the species we look at now. There had been many many sites found and they all suggest a gradual but ertain change to the animals we see today.<br><br>Another interesting fact about evolution is if a bone, such as a modern crocodile was found in the age of dinosaurs, then tis would be enough to prove the theory of evolution wrong. However tis sort of evidence was never found.<br><br>Do u really believe there a species of crocodile all <span style="font-style: italic;">directly and suddenly </span>extinct, then <span style="font-style: italic;">out of the blue suddenly popped</span> up a new species of crocodile with enough number for continuing the line tat resembles much to the previous crocodile. (tis must be true. Otherwise a more modern crocodile bones would have been discovered in the past) Tis sudden extinction and sudden appearing of crocodiles have to occured for a few hundred species in order to give us the evidences we see today. If u ask me, it is much highly likely these crocodiles experience a change over the years<br><br>It is like seeing pictures of a girl growing up. U can either believe tat it is the same girl tat change and grow up, or believe tat all the pictures r different girls, and they die suddenly and another girl tat resembles to her suddenly popped up. (which is why a picture of an older girl never appears at the age when she was young and vice versa. Much like the bones found) Which is more believable ? Tis analogy is on accepting evidences of changes over time, which include growing up and evolution.<br><br>If u believe tat these r a group of animals tat have been extinct, u still have to acknowledge tat modern crocodiles only popped up in recent years which meant tat all animals was not created in a single day.<br><br><blockquote>And how's this for evidence-Noah's ark was found somewhere in Iraq. They tested to see how old the wood was (using DNA ageing or something like that to trace it). The wood really was as old as estimated to be. </blockquote>Why don't u post us a website on tis discovery ? Someone had mentioned about a dustbowl tat was supposed to be noah's ark before but upon further study from sceintist, it is pronounced to be just a natural dust bowl. Even the website of christian answers acknowledge tis fact<br><br><blockquote>"Poopie-Head", does a tadpole evolve into a frog? Does a caterpillar evolve into a butterfly? In appearance the 'baby' is totally dissimilar from its adult shape. </blockquote>I think u r probably thinking the scientists tat studied these bones to be morons or something... Does a frog grow to be a few hundred metres high (link it with dinosaurs) ? Does a giraffe have a short neck ? no matter how old a frong is, they will never grow to be tat big. No matter how small a giraffe is, they will never have a short neck comapred with proportion to their body. However these bones r found. How do u explain tat ?</div>

Perhaps we need a clarification on the meaning of the word 'open' as used in this context.<br><br>It seems that the Malay people, as a whole, do not socialise much with people from other social circles. They stick very tightly to their own group. This is the reason why our govt suggests the Malay community to 'open up' to others.<br><br>However, I do agree that they generally have <strong>no problems accepting</strong> people from other circles.<br><br>As for the discriminating part, I'm not sure for Malays. But I can see that many Singaporean Chinese are quite bias, be it race, religion, or nationality (most dont like Chinese nationals).

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if the Chinese guy &amp; the Muslim girl are seriously in love with each other then they ought to have consider all the problems that they would've to face if neither wants to convert to the others religion, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>If their love is strong then the issue on religion should not be a problem, since Islam should be accepted freely, as now claimed, so if the guy doesn't want to accept Islam then I don't see the likely hood of the girl being stone to death by other muslim, at least I'ven't seen it happened yet in this part of the world.<br><br>Yes, there would be difficulties in terms of the couples every day live especially when it comes to such as food, et cetra.  Well, if the couple have been together long enough before deciding on marriage then they should both know how to respect each other in every way including religion, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
