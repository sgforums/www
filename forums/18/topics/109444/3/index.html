Also, i'm not saying 'ALL guys will get infection' too. Rather I'm saying <strong>most</strong> who did not circumcise did not get any infection at all. So the term 'more prone' is highly arguable, since most people didnt get infection anyway. If this is the case, then why prevent something that is so rare? It's just as good as shaving every single person's head bald just so to prevent spreading of head lice. The end result is very similar - you do something that affects alot of people to prevent the rare occurence of some infection, and finally, you <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span> reduce the occurence but then on the other hand, introduce other problems.<br><br>As for the convenant part, me being the ever curious guy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , can we talk in PM, or better yet exchange email addr so we can discuss/share info? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span><br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The story about Charles Darwin is one of the most CRAP and underhand strategies used by Creationists and religious people to MISLEAD people, solely becoz his Theory of Evolution was running against what was in their religious scriptures - that Mankind evolved from animals.

Like I said, big events like Big Bang, etc should be broken down and looked at separately and in detail before we are able to start to understand its nature. Dont jump to conclusions just by looking at the surface. For example, to solve a very complex mathematics question, we need to look at each part separately and break it down to smaller parts. We can never solve a complex problem just by looking at the problem at the surface level. We can discuss this privately if u want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And what do u mean 'the kids ended up screwed up'?

Pls elaborate?<br></div></blockquote>hmmm..care to read this. my own experience...<br><br>my dad is a Muslim n my mum was a Christian.<br>dun say i din have much troubles during my youth in searching for God. i was born as a Muslim. but my mum was still a Christian back then. it was a hard times, bcos my mum's family are most Christian, my mum's friends are Christian, even my friends at school were Christian. yes, they did told me to convert to Christian. as i was abt to convert, my dad said NO ! although my mum had said yes. i was abt. 12 year-old that time. so..there was i..12 - 15 y.o.kid..trying to search for God..who's God ? what's God ? still..until almost my last year at junior high school, still hasn't decided yet what religion that i belong. until...there was one time, i HAVE TO join 'pesantren kilat' (Islam term for retreat). i was..huh ??? i din even know how to pray 5 times a day !!! OMG !!! i din wanna go, but i HAVE TO, cos the school required all Muslim to go. i was learning how to pray in a short time... i did go for the retreat. must say that all of my Muslim friends n teachers are very nice n so helpful. and i felt so blessed that i did go for that retreat. i finally found what i was searching for for a long time. i finally accept Islam as my religion. not because of my dad told me to. but because i want to and i do believe it. and i am so content now that i am a Muslim. i dun care how people or my mum's family say that Islam is bad or Muslim are poor (yes, my relatives did say that). i know what's good for me n i know that i'm in the right way.<br><br>and oh...after junior high school ended, i studied in a Christian Private School (cos that school was n still is known as a very good school). so i also did learn abt. Christian. but at that moment i'm already a Muslim. n i din hv even a slight thought to convert to any other religion. it's ok to know abt. other religions, n they also teach good things.<br><br>at last...after i finished high school, my mum decided to convert to Islam. not because of my dad told her to. but because she wanted herself.. here we are now..become a Muslim family  n i can say that i'm more than just content now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
