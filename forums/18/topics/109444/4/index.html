            <div class='col-md body'>There's no forcing involved. To convert, one must convert willingly.<br><br>These are Muslim rules. The groom has to convert if the bride is a Muslim.<br><br>Actually... these both line summarised the same thing. The groom r forced to convert if he want to marry a muslim girl. So wat happen if they get married and the guy refuse to convert according to muslim laws ? Wat will happen to the lady scriptually ?[/quote]<br><br>Hey! 6White_Pawn9...Asmlkm.. keep up the good work.<br><br>As '6White' had stated before, Islam forbids its followers to force the religion to peoples of other faiths/ or of no faith - no matter what the circumstance, be it for love or whatever. If there had been cases of this happening, the doer had actually deviated from Islamic teachings.<br><br>Actually, lemme refine "These are Muslim rules". It has been ordained by God (and there is only one God).<br><br>Again,  to clarify to "stupidissmart" issues/questions:<br>1.  God does not force you to marry into Islam. He gives you the power of reasoning and freewill. If it is fated for the guy to marry the Muslim girl, the guy will one day 'realize' and he will use his gift of freewill to do right. I speak from experience .<br><br>2.  Actually, this is putting the cart before the horse. If the gal's faith is strong, it will not happen that they get married first, therefore the question of "what will happen to the guy" is moot.<br>If the gal marries out of Islam, then she is adjudged to be a Muslim no more. It is up to God as to whether the gal gets pardoned/ forgiven for it is in His attribute to be oft-forgiving. But it is up to the transgressed gal if she wants to atone for her major sin and in this case, the only way would be for her to re-enter the Faith. However, God would be the only One who knows if she were to be forgiven.<br><br>I'm sorry if this sounds heavy but I just thought that this thread is becoming circuitious and a slightly more-to-the-point highlite is needed. Apologies if I had offended anyone of other faiths.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and as "Networker" had said earlier,<br><br><blockquote>Learn more about being a Muslim first. It might not be as bad as you think.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </blockquote>I've re-read this thread and I can clarify some doubts about Islam from some points of view.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Circumcision</span><br><br>As said by someone earlier, girls are Not circumcised.<br><br>For boys and guys, you'll be surprised!<br>In Islam, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">makruh</span> for the guys to be intact. That means that it is preferable and well favored by God that circumcision be carried out but it is <span style="font-style: italic;">NOT Haram</span><br><br>That means guys, you can concentrate on other matters first if you are really attracted to the universal Religion. It is possible to convert to Islam without being circumcised. You can then mull over this issue when you are Muslim and decide when you are ready for it otherwise.<br><br>Of course, there are issues like cleanliness and if you are able to keep that area spick and span always. It could be that this is one of the reasons that God had wanted to make it easier for the guys.<br><br>There is a quote from one companion of the final Prophet (peace be upon him) which goes that <blockquote>One day the Prophet (pbuh) came upon 2 graves &amp; God had told him that one occupant was undergoing a suffering in the grave because he had been backbiting and inciting enmity amonst friends falsely. The second was suffering in the grave simply because he was careless and always had traces of urine on himself!</blockquote>If you wanna know more and if there are rebuttals from other Muslims, you're welcome to write to me.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Muslim Name</span><br><br>Again, a lot of people will be surprised to know that many 'traditional' Christian names have respective 'Muslim' (Arabic) equivalents.<br><br>Who said that you can't keep your Chinese/Indian/any-other-race/nationality name? If you like, your equivalent Muslim name or new one, can be inserted as an Alias in your IC or other ID, keeping your original name intact.<br><br>eg John=Yahya, Jonah=Yunus, Joseph=Yusuf, Abraham=Ibrahim<br>Michael=Mikhail, Moses=Musa, Gabriel=Jibrail<br>Daniel=Danial, David=Daud, Adam=Adam;<br>Mary=Mariam/Miriam, Alicia=Aisyah<br>and many of the guys names also have gal equivalents in Arabic<br><br>So you can also assure your parents that their lineage will be intact as it is allowed for your children to assume/retain your surname. There are millions of China-Muslims, some of them my friends; they and myself can confirm this 'non-issue'.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pork</span><br><br>greengoblin mentions <blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Healthier life style... no pork... pork very dirty</span></blockquote>i will just post a dialog from an informed source here - sorry if it's a bit long..<br><br><blockquote>Good scientific explanation<br><br>Bob: Tell me why is it that a Muslim is very particular about the words<br>Halal and Haraam; what do they mean?<br><br>Yunus: That which is permissible is termed Halal and that which is not<br>permissible is termed Haraam and it is the Quran which draws the<br>distinction between the two.<br><br>Bob: Can you give me an example?<br><br>Yunus: Yes, Islam has prohibited  blood of any type. You will agree that<br>chemical analysis of blood shows that it contains an abundance of uric<br>acid, a chemical substance which can be injurious to human health.<br><br>Bob: You're right about the toxic nature of uric acid, in the human being<br>it is excreted as a waste product and in fact we are told that 98% of the<br>body's uric acid is extracted from the blood by the kidneys and removed<br>through urination.<br><br>Yunus: Now I think that you'll appreciate the special prescribed method of<br>animal slaughter in Islam.<br><br>Bob: What do you mean?<br><br>Yunus: You see, the wielder of the knife, whilst taking the name of the<br>'Almighty', makes an incision through the jugular veins, leaving all other<br>veins and organs intact.<br><br>Bob: I see, this causes the death of the animal by a total loss of blood<br>from the! body, rather than an injury to any vital organ.<br><br>Yunus: Yes, were the organs, example the heart, the liver, or the brain<br>crippled or damaged, the animal could die immediately and its blood would<br>congeal in its veins and would eventually permeate the flesh. This implies<br>that the animal flesh would be permeated and contaminated with uric acid<br>and therefore very poisonous; only today did our dietitians realize such a<br>thing.<br><br>Bob: Again, while on the topic of food; Why do Muslims condemn the eating<br>of pork or ham or any foods related to pigs or swine.<br><br>Yunus: Actually, apart from the Quran prohibiting the consumption of pork,<br>bacon (pig flesh); in fact the Bible too in Leviticus chapter 11, verse 8,<br>regarding swine it says, "of their flesh (of the swine, another name for<br>pig) shall you not eat, and of their carcass you shall not touch;they are<br>unclean to you." Further, did you know that a pig cannot be slaughtered at<br>the neck for it does not have a neck; that is according to its natural<br>anatomy. A Muslim reasons that if the pig was to be slaughtered and fit for<br>human consumption the Creator would have provided it with a neck.<br>Nonetheless, all that aside, I am sure you are well informed about the<br>harmful effects of the consumption of pork, in any form, be it pork chops,<br>ham, bacon.<br><br>Bob: The medical science finds that there is a risk for various diseaseas<br>the pig is found to be a host for many parasites and potential diseases.<br><br>Yunus: Yes, even apart from that, as we talked about uric acid content in<br>the blood, it is important to note that the pig's biochemistry excretes<br>only 2% of its total uric acid content, the remaining 98% remains as an<br>integral part of the body.</blockquote>So, guys and gals, I hope this clears up some misconceptions of Islam and you're welcome to write to me if you have questions. See what I can do to quench your thirst.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

My question is - why isnt the issue being mentioned for girls? If female circumcision is not the solution, then is there any other solution mentioned anywhere?

Most people have the idea that :<br>- Muslims CANNOT leave their religion<br>- Non-muslims marrying with a muslim MUST convert<br>- Muslims who abandon their religion will suffer in many aspects from the others within the society. (dunno how true)<br><br>Of coz the points are NOT true, your answer has made it very clear regarding the doubts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></span><br><br>How do you know?

Well, I can tell u even if u see it u may not understand it. Examples:<br><br>- U mentioned evolved trees. Dont u know that there are many fossils of pre-historic trees? Trees that look totally different from what we have now. U can always see these weird looking prehistoric trees when u see shows featuring dinosaurs. U think people imagined them up?<br><br>- Dinosaurs! Yes! No living human has EVER witnessed a dinosaur. Does it mean they NEVER existed? No! They definitely existed and walked on the surface of this planet! How do we know? Evidence! From fossils.<br><br>- All the seven continents of our planet were originally one gigantic land mass. Did anyone actually witnessed it? No way!! This probably occured even before dinosaurs existed. Then how did we come to know about it? Evidence again! From the various similarities and evidence found from the once adjorning shores, for eg South America was split from Africa - look at the shape its already an obvious answer! There were many evidence showing many similarities of the two shores. Other evidence include the moving plates. The recent calamity is exactly the effect of such a plate - the southern plate moving northwards against the plate China is. Thats how the Himalayas is formed - plates pushing the crust together and upwards.<br><br>So u see that evidence plays the vital role, not guessing work.<br></span><br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Then u should believe in it now.

Some cultures allow boy or girl  to retain the original religion, like in the Middle East. I don't think the Malays in Singapore allows that.<br><br>2. Actually the Chinese boy, when he converts he becomes a Chinese muslim.<br>There are Chinese muslims in China, and they are Chinese. In Singapore, when Chinese boy marries Malay girl, he becomes Malay like, and follows Malay customs.<br><br>3. I have yet to meet a strong Chinese muslim boy who marries a Malay girl and makes her Chinese like. Other cultures, muslim or otherwise, the male dominates, and the girl is absorb into the culture of the male. In Singapore with the Malays it is different.<br><br>4. I can't understand why in Singapore when Chinese muslim boy marries Malay muslim girl they can't become Chinese muslim following the boy. They all become Malayanised.<br><br>I think your problem is with race rather than religion, because religion is a personal matter and is none of your business, but cultural customs concerns the society you belong to.</div>
