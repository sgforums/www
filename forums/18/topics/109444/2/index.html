It is in fact recommended NOT TO CIRCUMCISE.

If u would bother to do to a web search, u can definitely find relevant sites on the topic.<br><br>It definitely does not guarantee better sex. in fact it makes the male less sensitive, meaning worse sex. The foreskin is there for a reason - to protect the sensitive glands.<br><br>As for the claim of better look, i would say it depends on individual. But I'd have to vote for the natural look. I like things to be natural. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>BTW, do u think nature will make it such that males are naturally 'unhealthy'? I am not circumcised but I dont have any disease or infection or any illness coz of my foreskin. Do you think most of the guys in the world actually suffer from any such illness? I would say it is a matter of personal hygiene!<br><br>Have u also thought about girls? Should they remove all the extra skin so as to be healthier, cleaner, better sex and look nicer? Girls, having more discharge, have even more to think about for hygiene, but is there any talk about removing the skin? We seldom hear about female circumcision! (Actually, there are. Some girls in Africa do indeed get circumcised by removing their skin, but it is to be noted that many activitists consider that practise to be very cruel and are trying their best to stop it.)<br><br>If u believe in a God, then u believe in his 'Intelligent Design', but how come u dont believe that his design is intelligient enuff to be natually 'healthy'.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know where you got that info, but my friend recently had to circumcise (doctor's recommendation) because his foreskin was infected.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Some people's toes are infected and need to be severed, so does it mean anything? What I'm saying is that this is obviously an isolated case. Most males on the planet are not circumcised, and most of us are not suffering from anything resulting from it. On the other hand, I can give examples of circumcised guys having it bad becoz their glans are not protected. The simple fact that the foreskin is there in the first place is to protect the glans, why remove it? Sure, some people need help becoz once in a while people have insolated cases that need treatment. Isolated cases include no-opening, cant pull back, yada yada. To think that it is more hygenic is a very erroneous misconception that people had since way back in history. If u wanna talk about hygene, consider it is said that every single girl, even in modern times, will have an infection at least once in their lifetime. Doesnt this call for more attention for them to be 'cleansed'/circumcised? </span><br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>If u believe in a God, then u believe in his 'Intelligent Design', but how come u dont believe that his design is intelligient enuff to be natually 'healthy'.

But it is exactly also becoz of faith that u do not question His instructions - aka blindly follow without understanding (pardon me, i dont mean to sound disrespectful). IMO, I prefer to understand the answers to my questions, rather than to follow others without questioning. Just like when u do a maths question, do u just use a formula without understanding how to derive the formula in the first place? Of coz it is easier to just use the formula without understanding...

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Poopie-Head:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Some people's toes are infected and need to be severed, so does it mean anything? What I'm saying is that this is obviously an isolated case. Most males on the planet are not circumcised, and most of us are not suffering from anything resulting from it. On the other hand, I can give examples of circumcised guys having it bad becoz their glans are not protected. The simple fact that the foreskin is there in the first place is to protect the glans, why remove it? Sure, some people need help becoz once in a while people have insolated cases that need treatment. Isolated cases include no-opening, cant pull back, yada yada. To think that it is more hygenic is a very erroneous misconception that people had since way back in history. If u wanna talk about hygene, consider it is said that every single girl, even in modern times, will have an infection at least once in their lifetime. Doesnt this call for more attention for them to be 'cleansed'/circumcised? </span></blockquote>It's more hygienic without the foreskin.  The doctor said it himself (check back to the infection...I didn't mention this though)! I can't go deep in this since I don't know how it can get dirty.  IF it is healthier with the foreskin anyway, I'm sure the government would take steps to help this be known.<br><br>Girls get infected?  What do you mean?  I don't know about this.<br><br><blockquote><br><span style="color: blue;">Yes, i know that it is God's instruction. Why didnt He mention about the girls' problems or how to maintain hygene in their cases? Like I said, if humans were a result of His intelligent design, we need not have to do with all these 'imperfect' natural causes of unhygenic conditions in the first place. </span><br></blockquote>Like Neontetra said.  The main reason was the convenant.  I don't know what you mean when you talk about the girl's problems...<br><br>So the result of the Big Bang ended up so perfectly, until the Earth happened to be just right for human life, we evolved from "fish" to "apes"?  Until now we haven't seen anything that evolved.  How is it that the human body system is so mechanically good?  Even Charles Darwin denied the evolution theory before he died.<br><br>As long as (people who've seen the miracles in religion+ prophecies being fulfilled) exist, they would deny that evolution is the origin of mankind.<br><br><blockquote><br>ok back on topic, yes, i understand it is becoz of faith and obedience. But it is exactly also becoz of faith that u do not question His instructions - aka blindly follow without understanding (pardon me, i dont mean to sound disrespectful). IMO, I prefer to understand the answers to my questions, rather than to follow others without questioning. Just like when u do a maths question, do u just use a formula without understanding how to derive the formula in the first place? Of coz it is easier to just use the formula without understanding... If God made us with free-will, would He not want us to have wisdom and intelligence as well? [/color]<br></blockquote>Convenant <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> That's the main reason.  The hygiene thing is an additional advantage.<br><br><blockquote><br><span style="color: blue;"> Hmm ok, so what happens if a muslim and a non-muslim wanna get married to each other but the non-muslim dont wanna convert? So is it wiser for them to be together without being married?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Prolly not.

Big problems can be solved when we break them down into parts. There was a great discussion about Evolution vs Creation when I first joined this forum.
