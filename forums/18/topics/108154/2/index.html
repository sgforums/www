Life is about experiencing new things.<br>Whatever you do, do not regret.<br>Whatever you do, try not to hurt others.<br>can you live with this "Fact" about her?<br>Why would she trust you with this secret about her?<br>You have nothing to lose, but she has her pride as stake.<br>Virgin doesn't equal to angel.<br>she only has memories of boys hurting her, try building her trust in males again?<br>Make sure shes matured enough to accept the fact that one day you both may part.<br>What do you like about her? If its for sex, then i understand why you post this topic here. If its for her moral values and principles in life, don't worry. Females are pragmatic. They tend to do logically upright things. But males tend to bend that will of theirs. She may be strong, but weak towards affection. This type of girl you would have to pay extra attention to her, make her feel secured.<br>Do you love her? Love is not about physical stuffs, its about the willingness of supporting her mentally in your life.<br>How long have you both known each other?<br>Do you think you have known her enough?<br><br>Think.. Figure.. Analyse.. Its your future, not ours, we only can help you think deeper, but the ultimate decision is still with you. Good luck..<br><br>......................................
