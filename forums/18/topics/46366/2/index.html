            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br><br>1) His gf lost her virginity at a young age<br></strong>how young? under 21, I'll look at her and say something like what were you thinking, but then I would'nt really mind. just that I'll be quite disappointed. If 21 or above, I would say that it's ok... in either case I would have prefered if it was her ex-boyfriend(s). If not then I also cannot do anything but I will be quite disappointed too. Wont look at her differently.<strong><br><br>2) His gf had sexual relationships with all her past bfs<br></strong>if she were to have a sexual relationship with me then why not with her ex? if she were NOT to have a sexual relationship with me then I would ask her why... if she gives an honest good reason then I would be very happy. If she gives a disappointing reason then I would be disappointed lah... but at least she's being honest. I might look at her differently (depends on the situation I guess) but I dont think I would leave her for that. see how the realtionship progresses.<strong><br><br>3) His gf had ONS before</strong><br>If she says so then ok but again I would be quite disappointed, I'll need some time to think about it but I dont think I'll look at her differently after a while, maybe I'd be more possesive.... if she deny and then I know from another source... wah piang! I'll be very angry... could lead to a break up.<strong><br><br>4) His gf was molested or raped</strong><br>Sad... take care of her more and not bring this up ever again.... but if she told me that she liked it... whoa! I think I'll stay away from her for a while and think about it.<br><br><strong>Does he mind all these? </strong>I wouldnt really mind if she were to tell me in advance. <strong><br>Will he treat her the same as before he knows her past? </strong>I would treat her the same... if she didnt tell me/in denial and I happen to find out from another source then I would treat her a bit differently.<strong><br>Will he have a sexual relationship with her just because he thinks she is loose? </strong> I dont understand... I would have a sexual relationship with her if she wants to, not because she is loose.<br><br>In all cases I would want to know... cuz I think her history (sex, dating and all) can (I'm not saying that it would but there is a possibility, so it's better to clear things out) affect the present.... like the present can affect the future. But I'll want to know from her and not from any other source(s). So it'll be better if she told it to me in advance. i would be willing to accept even the most absurd cases.</div>

I think one should get into relationships with the hope that it will lead to marriage one day and not just for kicks. In that view that person with whom you are going out with would one day become your wife. There's no way I can tolerate the thought of her with other men for a lifetime.</div>

If a person were to lie about his/her past and the other party were to find out about it, wouldn't that make things worse?
