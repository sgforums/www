Its not like if things dun work out in the long run, It means that I didn't "truly" love them back when we were together or did I lie even if I said things like I wish I could be with them forever. I did feel so back then. Somehow life is not always so smooth sailing. She loved her ex so she did it with them, just like I did it with mine. So, what is there to mind?<br><br>Of coz Idealistically, each person can hv their 'tian chang di jiu' but how often is life so ideal? Like it or not, its not gonna change the fact tt 'it' happened. The only thing one can choose is to let the past pass or dwell on it and affect the r/s. Mind so much then better dun be together.<br><br>Cheerz...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact that she was willing to tell me about it shows that she is willing to trust me and that is something i would really respect. A relationship has to be based on trust.<br><br>If she was raped or molested in the past .. it was not by her choice and instead of putting her down i would try and be more sensitive towards her knowing that she has been thru alot.<br><br>It would be alot diff if i found out that she is sleeping with others when with me...but thats a whole new topic</div>
