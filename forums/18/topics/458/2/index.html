From time to time, I stopped pondering about the outcomes and what I should or should not be doing. It seems to me that what I'm asking for isn't something very important. I've got so many much more important stuffs to do and think about now. As 4 the sex part, I would take it as it comes, whatever that happens would happen eventually. And I no longer see the point in me planning or awaiting or fantasizing.<br>I reckon u guys out there reading this might think,"this is such a boring stupid story I've been following." But that's what the outcome is. And from what I've heard, what I'veread, I'd discover that I have yet to know myself evough to take charge and make decisions myself. "Huh?" I know this sounds weird. In layman terms, I've yet to know what I really want. Or perhaps somewhere in my mind, I've already decided on what I want, it's just that I need support from people out there. Sounds fair enough?<br><br>Thanx a million to those who wrote in to help, and so on and so forth.<br><br>------------------<br>Luv, _Belle_</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>belle,<br><br>Listen, you want guys to fuck you. Do what I did in college. Wear tight jeans or a mini tight skirt... Also make sure your pullover or T-shirt is short enough so your belly is fully exposed...<br><br>Then wear some aroma perfume... (Do some research in the sex magazines) those perfumes that when the opposite sex inhale the smell, it ignites a fire that can only be extinguished through a good hard intercourse session... I couldn't remember exactly what I used, but that's for sure that I managed to arouse my first guy with a good perfume.<br><br>Now, you're almost ready... You walk in the caffeteria and pick and choose the guy you want to seduce, and try to stand or sit as close as possible next to him... Be friendly with a nice big smile, and nature will work it's way....<br><br>One more thing... Make sure you have in your drawer some good lubricant... Real penis can be more rough than a dildo...<br><br>Also, try to put your hands on a man's delay cream (to prolong his erection). Man usually get extremely excited when they're able to do a girl as young as you... Especially with your virginity still in place, the tightness may have him ejaculate within 10 seconds of the first thrub inside you... So what may end up happening, once he cums, he may leave you there hungry with some unfinished business, while he's all done.<br><br>So whith the prolong cream, you don't have to reveal to him anything... Just put some on your hand during foreplay and rub it gently on his tip... if he asks what the cold cream was, you just tell him it's a lubricant to make him feel better... Now when he's ready to push your vaginal area, he will be forced to last for at least 20-25 minutes...<br><br>I'm sharing with you my personal experience, so hopefully you don't make immature decisions...<br><br>Also, double check he wears a condom... All the talk of -feeling the hot sperm inside- is nothing but a bunch of bull crap, I have had my first experience without a condom and let me tell you, it wasn't worth it 1 dime...<br><br>------------------<br>Lisa</div>
