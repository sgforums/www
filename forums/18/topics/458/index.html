            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Belle !<br><br>Awright!!!!! looks like u are all keen to have SEX. hey! as long as u are willing no way is that lucky dude gonna be charged with statutory rape or anything like that. heheheh<br><br>i remember the first time i 'banged' a student too. i got to know her and of course lah, had to shower her with goodies and all those love talk. aiyah, just tell her all the things she wants to hear lor. No need for her to do anything, just thinking about having her 'cherry' turns me on enough to do all the work. so save your effort - just let the guy do all the work on u.<br><br>i remembered the act itself, it was at a chalet. oh man, the setting was romantic, candles and all. did i mention it was valentine's day ?<br><br>she bled and stained the sheets man! yeah! but hey! look, it comes with it, it always hurt the first time mah. BUT not for me, heheheh. i don't think she enjoyed it though, but look, she wanted it right ?<br>Anyway who cares whether she enjoyed it or not afterall, we are not married mah.<br><br>did i mentioned that i had her 'raw ' ? yeah, no condoms, why ? i know she virgin mah. but she doesn't know that i am not ! hehehe. anyway she was so immature, bluff her she oso don't know. Even if she gets pregnant, she cannot force me to marry her right ? afterall, she is so young and i am sure her parents oso don't want to have a grandchild when she herself is barely out of school. hwah ! if her parents finds out what i made their daughter do to me (and vice versa) in that chalet that night - don't tell u oso u know rite ? afterall u sound so mature ......<br><br>I don't know whether u want your lucky guy to wear condom or not. At least u won't get pregnant or catch those sex diseases. i heard there was this chick that caught some STD and i heard she can never have children again. sway man ! afterall she only 17.<br><br>Got one more story lagi best. my friend's sister kena HIV after a one night stand with some executive. she swear that they use condom. but she don't know that condoms cannot tahan HIV virus. Send her to NUS for what? study so hard, sex knowledge kena F9. heheheh<br><br>Don't worry, i bet alot of brudders out there willing to have sex with u afterall, u virgin and young and willing somemore.<br><br>So what are u waiting for ?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Sn1perscope (edited 21 November 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Plan B<br>It is really hard to believe that in this time and age, a young girl as willing as you are, can still be a virgin. Since your case is so unique, it is understandable that you were unable to get the right advise earlier. What I am suggesting here is merely a possible scenario as none of my friends or myself has ever heard of such a strange situation.<br><br>First I assume that you already have a good boyfriend. Either he is too conservative or too shy that you are desperate. If this is the case I have a few things for you to try.<br>1.	Is your friendship stable and old enough? If yes, read the next point. If no, you have to wait just a little longer.<br>2.	Are you dating with him? If yes, read the next point. If no, start today. Just in case if he is not asking you out, be the Â“manÂ” of the situation and ask him to take you to some funny movie.<br>3.	Choose some semi-private place for the date such as movie theatre or beach, etc. Allow occasional physical contact (holding hands or a little innocent kiss). This will act as catalyst. Do not discourage him if he likes to feel and caress.<br>4.	If the above activities are going out of hand, ask him to find some totally private place. There you have to say at least once that you are not certain about going all the way and may be you need more time to consider this issue. But at the same time, you need to be courageous enough to play with his Â“center of gravityÂ” innocently (absentmindedly). Once the sleeping dragon awakens, it listens to no arguments. There is not turning back now and while you keep saying Â“NOÂ” all the time to show your modesty, you will still be rewarded with a good and thorough service. Those who can still shy away at such a moment are either angels or not man at all.<br>5.	Make sure you want to go all the way with the guy before the point of no return. If you just want to tease, you may put a full stop at light patting.<br><br>Wish you good luck soon.<br><br></div>

The only problem would be tht they won't satisfy me enuff *winks*. It seems like I expect a lot?<br></div></blockquote>Now you are telling what your actual issue is. Here are some points.<br>1.	You have yet to see the world. Believe me, your toy is just nothing what you may find one fine day between somebodyÂ’s leg. True, any humanÂ’s stamina cannot beat battery-powered toy but hopefully, you will soon learn that it is not the longest duration that counts but it is actually the feelings and satisfaction. My partner and myself get bored after a certain time (not hours), no matter how horny we felt at the beginning.<br>2.	The nerve ends that feels the sensation and stimulation in your body lies only up to a maximum of four inches deep. Any deeper and you will feel the same feeling of fullness regardless of six inch or ten inch penetration. The flexibility of the mature female body allows diameters of a couple of inches without discomfort but study shows no additional or less stimulation at girths from one inch onwards.<br>3.	The last word. It is a general consensus that the pleasure and satisfaction is only possible by a human pen*s. Anything else, the artificial toys, any other object, even a finger (or fist for some) is just no comparison. You just have to try the real thing.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah .......<br><br>Suddenly all the wolves started hunting for fresh-blooded young sweet little thing. Must be interesting to note what happens when a guy declares that he wanna 'lose' his virginity over the post, hehehe.<br><br>Anyway, my sincere advice to you, beautiful girl is, never play with fire. I just heard from the news while on my way to home that the number of people being infected with HIV virus are already in double figures in Singapore, and even children are not spared from it.<br><br>I guess this alone spells trouble not only to aspiring girls like you but also to the rest of us, we are living in a 'jungle'.<br><br>So do consider carefully for the sake of your health. Sex is wonderful, it can be bonding and you feel so connected to the other party but only if there's love. There'll never be any enjoyable one-night stand without the fear of contacting any forms of VDs; not at this century.<br><br>I always wanna be some superman,'banging and drowning' women along the way till I settled down, so what??!? Don't you just feel lousy the moment the person you love claims that he/she don't enjoy being with you? That alone is good enough to tell us that nothing is more important than love.<br><br>hahaha, anyway, Belle girl, I have no objections to whatever you plan to do with yourself, I believe we all just wanna share our thoughts over the post right?<br><br>Till then, really enjoy reading the replies.<br><br>Cheerz!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Belle,<br><br>On your question with the need to be laid, it should be a question of the need to satisfy lust.<br><br>Do it if you see the opportunity, but in order to practise safe sex, you can't rush things. Get to know your partner first, if not you can't guarantee.<br><br>Remember even if there is a relation between lovers or sex partners, I would stress on this point that most men (most, not all)view sex as a tool of lust, while most women view it as a way for men to express their care and love in the form of sex. Men often stray away from their path becoz of this reason and act upon their lust. I do admit women (minority) sometimes do the same.<br><br>Generally, that would be the rule of thumb. This is just my general opinon, you do not have to agree/disagree or dispute about it.<br><br>Sex is a taboo in Singapore (remember that), do what you will, but you can't change the opinon of your fellow Singaporean.<br><br>One note to add, if you want satisfaction in sex, you have the talk it out because we men, can't just read the minds of women and know exactly what they want.<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>------------------<br>T.L</div>
