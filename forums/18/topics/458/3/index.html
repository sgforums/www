            <div class='col-md body'>dear Belle,<br><br>after reading your quest for knowledge, i do think you are in need of..well i would put it..."proper &amp; healthy love". Not that engaging in sex is "unhealthy" but too much of something is just bad enough... i have to agree with someone who replied u saying that u might be doing it wrong (maybe u should look at masturbating correctly and hitting the right spot?). and seriously...i think u r no longer a virgin for sure...maybe u never had sex but penetrations must had happened...so...well...<br><br>i think you need a responsible man...u need security so that you would value urself more as he would value you as much...with or without sex. In fact to me, there is a difference in "having sex" and "making love"...its my own philosophy tho...one involve less emotional commitment while the other has alot more and believe me they will feel so different. And to DIY is very different from engaging in the actual activity with someone else...element of surprise, anticipation, ecstasy and pleasure of being dominated or served, etc...which DIY will not bring u, limited only by ur own imagination and a fake gigantic dick dat has no blood rushing thru it automated by batt or ur own hands...<br><br>cheap thrills may be ecstatic, but they are short lived and soon over a period of time u will regret it...and it will become a haunting memory in ur life that u will have to live with for the rest of ur life...held unfairly against people who love u n u love...think about it...is cheap thrill worth it? go for the "real" thing...such cannot be rushed, but let nature takes its course...then it would have meaning, then there will be no regrets...<br><br>well gerl, do take a moment to ponder about ur life as a female...as a responsible entity...towards the people u love and who loves you and urself...nothing here was meant to be offensive but just as an advice as i began to be concern...<br><br>cheers,<br>sLeEpWaLkEr<br></div>

The local student only paid one-third of what the Singapore student paid. Furthermore, their Local Education Authority (LEA) will lend them all the tuition fees and let them have some living expenses too. On the other hand, it cost the Singapore parents an arm and a leg to send their kids away. However, there is no evidence of a relationship between the amount of money thrown into university education and genuine educational accomplishment. For university course, British University cost more than double than a same degree course that held in one of the universities in Singapore. Beside the difference in the price tag, there are employment restrictions as well. Nowadays, British University charges the whole year tuition in advance even the students might have scholarship and loans coming in. The situation is even more ridiculous for Secondary School Education. The average cost is more than 26,000-00 US dollars per year. It is enough to cover the construction cost of a front yard swimming pool in many countries. Why it worth so much money? It is never justifiable. They created unfair hardship for all Chinese students.<br><br>I have studied in UK before, what IÂ¡Â¦ve got is: continuous bullying [pushing around] and mis-treatment from the UK university. IÂ¡Â¦ve got very good A-Level and my parents were very generous to spend all their money in my further education. Most Singapore students get the worst rooms in the British School accommodation. Always in a weird corner, size is tiny and an inhumane place to live in. I was put in a storage room that was under the staircase; the ceiling is so low that I could touch the bottom of the staircase if I raise my hands. It is tinier than the maid bedroom or the closet of a master bedroom. I could not move at all if I would like to put my bicycle inside. The furniture is old and extremely tiny. This is in contrast to other single studentÂ¡Â¦s bedroom on the same floor, the room is big enough for them to park their car inside. We were all paying the same single room fees. Once and once again, these things happen to every Singapore student. It is just because British are arrogant and the Singapore students are too polite to make a complaint. It is not about the fairness, but Singapore student always get an inhumane room to live in, British look at us as tiny slave in one of their many colonies. Other British parents use their car to help their children to move in, does the Chinese parent take an extra suitcase, fly there and see the room that their devoted child will be living ? They could get a shock.<br><br>Very few Singapore parents really know what Britain is like. There are a lot of confusing Indians there, as many Indians could immigrate to Britain when India became independent. They keep on reproducing exponentially, most are either belong to Muslim or Islamic religion. Their accent is the worst in the world and their minds are just simply crazy. In cities like London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, Indian made up a big portion<br>of the student population. Many black people behave much better and much more educated than the always smiling-for-nothing Indian people. The Indian medical doctors are well known for their clumsiness in Britain. Those Islam and Muslim students never play fair during exam, they got a variety of cheap tricks during examination. For example, some of them will keep on shaking their legs during the whole examination. At the end of the exam, I complained to the teacher for such incident. She simply said, she did not saw it to avoid any further investigation.<br><br>Other well known problems in UK : soft drug and nicking. Marijuana and ecstasy are very popular among the British public especially teenagers. Unlike Singapore, they do not see that as a big problem, they even have a public opinion to legalise such drug. What about student altitude towards Nicking Â¡V a slang term refers to Stealing. For the British students, if they do not have any kitchen cutlery, they simply steal it from the cafeteria. That is why there are so many second hand stores selling every household item near the school district. Most of the goods sold must be stolen items. In one summer, I left the textbooks for safekeeping in an university accommodation storage facility. The whole box of textbooks got stolen before I came back to collect them. I simply could do nothing about it. Long distance phone call and small amount of pocket money is not guardianship. I just wonder when will the Singapore parents get notified if something happen ? The schools will not blow their own horn and blow the money earners away !!<br><br>Independent would be difficult when Singapore students face constant bullying by their own kind and other white students. Though looking happy, independent, excited and eager to explore a new environment; deep down in the students hearts, all students are suffering from the loneliness of leaving all their closest family and friends, and the Chinese environment that is so familiar to them. Facing new friends, new school, new hallmates, it had to be tough so as to survive. The students face many problems and some unforeseen situations, being abandoned, they had to solve those problems all by themselves. What the parents are actually doing, putting their children in an expensive private orphanage overseas. Ironically, it would be FREE if they abandon their children in those countries. The local government would pick up the entire bill for their education. British treat Singapore students just like orphan refugee. That is exactly how I felt while I never able to tell my parent about the mistreatment. In my heart, I realised how much money they paid for an overseas opportunity, I donÂ¡Â¦t want to disappoint them even when I was put in a modified storage room under a staircase that other students walk up to their decent size rooms. In reality, the parents just put their students in mentally handicap British schools because the Singapore schools of their choice got no place for their own children. The level of mathematics and science in Britain is well below the average standard of schools in Singapore. In the last few years, the GCSE O-level examination standard has dropped dramatically. What is the rationale to send their children to a handicap-alike school overseas ? What is the point of spending life saving for an unworthy BritiSHIT education? Will it be better to save up those money and buy a Real house with a real lawn after a few years. An annual 26,000-00 dollar for a secondary school education simply canÂ¡Â¦t add up.<br><br>There is a Chinese proverb that is well known among china town:<br>Â­^Â°ÃªÂ¤H   Â¦nÂ½a   Â¦nÂ½Ã¢    Â¦nÂ¶Ã‚Â¤HÂ¼Â¨		 It is so true.<br>[British People are very poor, very nasty, just nuisance group]<br><br>For students considering Britain for their further education. Australian and American students pay the same fees as the overseas students for their University Education, they are much friendlier than the arrogant British. In those countries, Chinese are generally consider to be brighter in science subjects, however, they are all right about that. Unlike UK, jealousy is not an issue when fair competition is the fundamental drive of their economies for centuries. The biggest fear of mankind is Uncertainty, why the Singapore parents would pay a fortune to a mysterious old school in Britain for an uncertain academic attainment that they knew little about while sure that the British would be biased against a young tiny Chinese kid ?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></span></div>

No need for her to do anything, just thinking about having her 'cherry' turns me on enough to do all the work. so save your effort - just let the guy do all the work on u.<br><br>i remembered the act itself, it was at a chalet. oh man, the setting was romantic, candles and all. did i mention it was valentine's day ?<br><br>she bled and stained the sheets man! yeah! but hey! look, it comes with it, it always hurt the first time mah. BUT not for me, heheheh. i don't think she enjoyed it though, but look, she wanted it right ?<br>Anyway who cares whether she enjoyed it or not afterall, we are not married mah.<br><br>did i mentioned that i had her 'raw ' ? yeah, no condoms, why ? i know she virgin mah. but she doesn't know that i am not ! hehehe. anyway she was so immature, bluff her she oso don't know. Even if she gets pregnant, she cannot force me to marry her right ? afterall, she is so young and i am sure her parents oso don't want to have a grandchild when she herself is barely out of school. hwah ! if her parents finds out what i made their daughter do to me (and vice versa) in that chalet that night - don't tell u oso u know rite ? afterall u sound so mature ......<br><br>I don't know whether u want your lucky guy to wear condom or not. At least u won't get pregnant or catch those sex diseases. i heard there was this chick that caught some STD and i heard she can never have children again. sway man ! afterall she only 17.<br><br>Got one more story lagi best. my friend's sister kena HIV after a one night stand with some executive. she swear that they use condom. but she don't know that condoms cannot tahan HIV virus. Send her to NUS for what? study so hard, sex knowledge kena F9. heheheh<br><br>Don't worry, i bet alot of brudders out there willing to have sex with u afterall, u virgin and young and willing somemore.<br><br>So what are u waiting for ?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Sn1perscope (edited 21 November 2001).]</div></blockquote>Hey u r such a jerk man!!! so irresponsible and no morals at all! asshole!!</div>
