            <div class='col-md body'>StQwerty:<br><br>people posting on forums on the internet are going to post topics like the kind you find in this section, whether there is a specific section for it or not (like there is here).<br><br>if this section of the forums is closed down, then "adult" topics might get posted in other sections where underage people might unintentionally read it. setting aside a section for adult topics is in my opinion a better approach than completely banning the posting of adult topics, since enforcing such a ban would be difficult and time-consuming on the part of the admins and moderators. open discussion is usually more likely to happen if censorship isn't practiced.<br><br>anyway, i don't think the morality of anyone else here is any of your business so if you don't wish to read adult-oriented topics, feel free to leave. what you are doing is akin to walking into a cinema screening an R(A) show, and then suggesting such shows be banned due to their "loose" morals.<br><br>learn some humility; you can keep yourself perched on your own moral high ground for all you like and for all we care, but kindly leave others the choice not to do so.</div>
