Ur bf may get too busy and tired in army  and so doesnt haf time for other things.. but this is no excuse....<br><br>Hes in some way wrong... but ppl do change.. whether it is to the better or for the worse... I mean u shld accept him for who he is and not try to change him in a way... and also like wise he shld acceot who u are... and try to make up to u in ways possible...<br><br>In a relationship, when quarrels take place its 2 ppl at fault.. not one... Cos it takes 2 hands to clap not one....  I suggest u think carefully over the relationship and mayb tok to him abt it.... If there is a communication prob, solve it...<br><br>ALl the best and jia you!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haaa . . . .To be honest . . guys are really miserable when in army. Can you imagine . . how are you going to survive with just $240 allowance previously for 9 months. currently $320 start off. Come'on dont compare with those Sergents and Officers they are getting definately at least 3 folds of allowance.<br><br>I'm the unlucky one that have to toggle money between self-paid meals(army dont provide free meals), transport and gal fren. What's more would you take hard earned money from parents? Nope i wont!! (Some lucky guys, parents would give them $1K allowance for them to spend.) Its isn't easy, almost wipe out my savings earn during school days part time to cover the LIMITED allowance given.<br><br>Today, which guys dont want to get their latest electronic gadgets like phones, etcs  . . Me want that too . . but i still have to get something special for my gal once awhile like anniversary and Birthday to make her happy. I've given up the ideas of buying new gadgets like other friends do during Army days. Poor me!!<br><br>I'm luncky to have a gal fren who isn't a demanding person. phew!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Inconclusion:<br><br>Gals : Army is the difficult times for we guys to manage our financial. Please spare some thoughs. A little understanding on the guys side will make him spare some thoughs for you too.<br><br>Guys : Women are creatures who loves surprises . . . perhaps a little dose of surprises each time will make her world spins. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Can you imagine . . how are you going to survive with just $240 allowance previously for 9 months. currently $320 start off. Come'on dont compare with those Sergents and Officers they are getting definately at least 3 folds of allowance.<br><br>I'm the unlucky one that have to toggle money between self-paid meals(army dont provide free meals), transport and gal fren. What's more would you take hard earned money from parents? Nope i wont!! (Some lucky guys, parents would give them $1K allowance for them to spend.) Its isn't easy, almost wipe out my savings earn during school days part time to cover the LIMITED allowance given.<br><br>Today, which guys dont want to get their latest electronic gadgets like phones, etcs  . . Me want that too . . but i still have to get something special for my gal once awhile like anniversary and Birthday to make her happy. I've given up the ideas of buying new gadgets like other friends do during Army days. Poor me!!<br><br>I'm luncky to have a gal fren who isn't a demanding person. phew!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Inconclusion:<br><br>Gals : Army is the difficult times for we guys to manage our financial. Please spare some thoughs. A little understanding on the guys side will make him spare some thoughs for you too.<br><br>Guys : Women are creatures who loves surprises . . . perhaps a little dose of surprises each time will make her world spins. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote>wat do u mean dat u hav a gal fren who isnt a demandin person??tell mi lei..realli wanna noe..<br>p/s: his pay is more than tat. ard 500.</div>
