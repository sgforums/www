From what I can tell about your posts, it's not about the gifts, but more about his thoughts right? After so many years of being together, perhaps the both of you are getting to be so comfortable with each other that you *think* you know what the other is thinking, but actually, you don't. Talk with him, communicate. If he doesn't want to, make him. Ultimately, it'll do both of you good, whether getting there is a pleasure cruise or a roller coaster ride to hell.</div>

Can you imagine . . how are you going to survive with just $240 allowance previously for 9 months. currently $320 start off. Come'on dont compare with those Sergents and Officers they are getting definately at least 3 folds of allowance.<br><br>I'm the unlucky one that have to toggle money between self-paid meals(army dont provide free meals), transport and gal fren. What's more would you take hard earned money from parents? Nope i wont!! (Some lucky guys, parents would give them $1K allowance for them to spend.) Its isn't easy, almost wipe out my savings earn during school days part time to cover the LIMITED allowance given.<br><br>Today, which guys dont want to get their latest electronic gadgets like phones, etcs  . . Me want that too . . but i still have to get something special for my gal once awhile like anniversary and Birthday to make her happy. I've given up the ideas of buying new gadgets like other friends do during Army days. Poor me!!<br><br>I'm luncky to have a gal fren who isn't a demanding person. phew!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Inconclusion:<br><br>Gals : Army is the difficult times for we guys to manage our financial.
