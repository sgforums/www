Think about it; spicy foods increase your heart rate and cause us to perspire. So cook up some curry chicken and then give her a "spicy meatball" of your own.<br><br>Oysters -- Wow, I know you're as surprised to see this one on the list as I am (yeah right). We all know that oysters have been esteemed as sex aids for ages. Why? Well, it's possible that it's because of diets that were nutritionally deficient in zinc in the days of horse carriages and lasting marriages. People would eat oysters and since their overall health would improve, it would lead to an increased sex drive. So start shucking and don't stop till you feel it move.<br><br>Wasabi (Horseradish) -- While some people believe that Sushi has aphrodisiacal effects all on its own, my Japanese friends let me in on a little secret. Apparently, that green stuff that comes with it (Wasabi or horseradish) is what'll really get your twig and berries ripe and ready. So the next time you go out for sushi, ask for some extra Wasabi; it's a kick and will make your eyes tear, but you can make your gal's eyes tear when you take her home and show her Wasaaaaaaabi.<br><br>Caviar -- That's right, fish eggs contain a large amount of beneficial vitamins. They are rich in phosphorus and are very nourishing to nerve cells. Their apparent aphrodisiac powers are reinforced by vodka. So get yourself into Absolut shape for the night.<br><br>from <a href="http://www.askmen.com/love/love_tip/55_love_tip.html" rel="nofollow">www.askmen.com/love/love_tip/55_love_tip.html</a></div>

How much time r u willing to leave aside for sex... I believe 4 most of us, the 1st thing when we reach home, is relaxing on the crouch n fall asleep. Having sex seems  a form of exercise. U need to have the energy n mood in order to enjoy from it.  If u dun enjoy from its process, most probably u did it the wrong way.<br><br>Go for a short trip, somewhere peaceful n relaxing wif ur other half. U may just found that when u feel relaxed n free from all  the "elements" u face daily, u might just feel the power of ur sex drive.<br><br>Alternative if still doesn't help, please consult a doctor for advice.<br><br>Best wishes.......<br>MAy the Force B wif U v <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> v<br><br></div>
