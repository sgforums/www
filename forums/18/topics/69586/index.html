He looks more like an Iraqi, but very kah teh  (means short).  He is shorter than an average Singapore man.<br><br>You all should feel sorry for him.  He is deprived.  He keeps saying that Singapore girls are cheap and asking whether any sg girls wants to sleep with him.  To tell you all the truth, he is not only short, he is tiny, if you know what I mean.  Yes, I tried to be screwed by him, but in the end, nothing happens.  Even if he tried to have something happen, I won't be able to feel it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> It is just soooo pathetic.<br><br>Too bad I did not think of taking a picture of him when I met up with him.  Otherwise, I could posted his picture here so that you all can whack this short a$$ upside down if you see him on the street, for being such a pain.<br><br>Mr Cortez, if you still want to fool people in saying that sg girls are desperate for your dick, you can wake up your idea now.<br><br>Frustmom looks down on tiny man.</div></blockquote>you actually tried to get screwed by him??? you went to bed with him to try??? you have seen his dick??? what bullshit story tellin! next time, try to make your story more believeable  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

I tell you - you will sure laugh at his appearance first.  What spanish guy with huge dick that all sg girls want???  *laugh until vomit my supper*<br>Short and dark.  Looks like one of the Iraqi terrorist.  If you want to know how he looks, try to imagine a very much shorter version of Saddam Hussein, slightly slimmer.  On the whole, he looks like a undernourished Iraqi terrorist.<br><br>Whole night tried to act sexy.  I buay tahan.  Tried so hard to hold my laughter.  When he took off his pants, that was the time I said to him, "I think I want to go home.  Nice knowing you."<br><br>What a night.  What a waste of time.<br><br>I'm so angry that I got conned by him and his "huge" dick as he claimed.  Shameless ba$tard.  Sill go around telling people that I wants to screw school girls.  I tell you - he can't do anything with his baby dick.  Can screw puppies, maybe.</div>
