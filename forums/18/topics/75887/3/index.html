Just before I have to make my way to an outing, I had to rush down somewhere to settle something. Busy hour. The MRT train was very crowded. I had to really squeeze in as I'm kinda in a hurry.<br><br>Right beside me was this student. Don't really know if she's from JC, secondary or private school... Look kinda like a JC student? Can't really see properly as it was too crowded... Anyway... The train was so packed that I really can't move much a bit... And left hand holding my bag was directly in front of her body and kinda low... If you can get the picture?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  But I was pretty careful not to have any body contact with her...<br><br>Then it happened... She moved her body forward and contacted my hand... I looked right behind her and nobody moved nor was trying to make his / her way out of the train... I looked at her... She was looking at me too... So I guess she was aware of our contact... I tried to move my hand out of the way (quite a straining move as it was really packed.. I could just turn my fist away...)... She moved in again...<br><br>So thoughts flew into my mind again... This wasn't the 1st time I've encountered this kinda thing in a packed train... I wondered what's with people today..? Students..? Women..? Don't misunderstand me, I'm no gentleman of class type... But it's just kinda strange? I wondered what's wrong with me? Probably many horny guys out there (in bar especially?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) would wish to be in my position? Weird...<br><br>She was looking at me... It was full awareness of the whole thing... The look was... I don't know how to describe...? Not cheeky but normal..? Yet not so normal....? I was looking around in all other directions and avoiding eye contact with her...<br><br>Just one station... The train door opened, I made my way out... Strangely enough I did turned back and take a glance at her.... Her look... A kinda unappreciative unhappiness....<br><br>Guess it's really too bad that I wasn't playing her 'game'?
