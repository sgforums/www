            <div class='col-md body'>i kinda agree with dumbdumb, if u engage in premarital sex, then u gotta support all men who do it, even if the female partner is close to u. May i add on, these people might as well teach their children to go ahead and have premarital sex because it is "RIGHT" isnt it? hahaha the things people do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cuz u can't defend one form of premarital sex and not defend the other forms. its still premarital sex. thats hypocrisy. saying "its ok, if you're in love" shows how little u understand love. can u honestly love someone without causing them to enter into marraige, which may not be with you, without a guilty conscience?</div>
