            <div class='col-md body'>This is an interesting topic and a serious issue. Because as the turn of the century... countries are starting to evolve. For isntance.. singapore is veyr effected by the US of A 's mentality. Look around you ...they seem to perform the role of the males..its not such a bad thing in a way..but then..it sure as hell confuses the males in OUR role. For the the new generation after us...i dun think we will make very good or effective parenting =P Girls nowadays seems to slowly loose thier sense of womanhood..asking me if they will make very good wives ? depends..i mean..seriously..i know girls who cant cook , cant wash....cant do jack shiet. But they sure as hell can study or club to the max..and look damn fine =D. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
