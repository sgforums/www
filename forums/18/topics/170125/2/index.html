Viluco, Chile<br>Date: January 5 2004 Time: 0515A<br>40-year old driver Juan Berrios was on his on an errand on Santa<br>Filomena Street on his way to Las Vertientes terminal when at<br>about 70 meters in front of his car he noticed a strange figure<br>standing on the middle of the road. He rubbed his eyes and then<br>saw nothing and kept on driving, at about 5 meters away the<br>bizarre figure again appeared. Stunned at what he was seeing<br>Berrios almost lost control of his vehicle as he swerved around<br>the figure almost upending the vehicle. The strange creature had<br>what appeared to be the carcass of a bloodied dog clutched in<br>his jaws. The creature suddenly jumped and disappeared into the<br>brush. Berrios described the creature as about 1.50m in height,<br>with large hind legs like a kangaroo, small curved front arms<br>that ended in claw like protrusions, a spiky dorsal fin on its<br>back, and a tail resembling that of a rattler on a snake. The<br>facial features were also bizarre; it had a wolf-like snout,<br>several sharp rows of teeth, and fierce-looking red eyes. It<br>jumped a height of about 5 meters and disappeared from sight.</strong><br><br>Location. Wise County, Texas<br>Date: January 12 2004 Time: night<br>A young girl reported encountering a large black bird-like<br>creature outside a schoolyard in Wise County.

Suddenly he woke up with a strange feeling that<br>something odd was happening in the street. He opened his eyes<br>and noticed a ball, which was hanging in the sky. It shone with<br>a white-blue silvery light---like the moon---but it was 2-3<br>times bigger than the moon. He immediately looked at the clock<br>and noticed the time. He looked around the bedroom and saw his<br>wife and dog sleeping calmly. The witness then felt very dizzy<br>and went to sleep again. That same night he had another strange<br>experience. While in a half-awake state in his bed he heard a<br>strange female voice, which repeated a passage read in an<br>unknown language (the witness is an interpreter and speaks five<br>foreign languages fluently). Feeling afraid he covered his head<br>with a pillow. He immediately checked all the electrical devices<br>in the room but they were all turned off, except for the icebox.<br>His wife and dog again slept calmly. The witness also heard the<br>strange voice the next night.<br><br>Location. Capilla del Monte, Cordoba, Argentina<br>Date: January 14 2004 Time: 2230<br>A 14-year old boy, Juan Pablo, was standing in his garden when<br>suddenly he spotted a short humanoid, wearing a red jumpsuit,<br>red cap and carrying a staff, walking along the Avenida Las<br>Gemelas towards a place called "Aguas de los Palos". The lighted<br>road allowed Juan Pablo to observe as the short figure briskly<br>walked away and disappeared from sight.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The weird events connected to the Mothman began on November 12, 1966 near Clendenin, West Virginia. Five men were in the local cemetery that day, preparing a grave for a burial, when something that looked like a Â“brown human beingÂ” lifted off from some nearby trees and flew over their heads. The men were baffled. It did not appear to be a bird, but more like a man with wings. A few days later, more sightings would take place, electrifying the entire region.<br><br>Late in the evening of November 15, two young married couples had a very strange encounter as they drove past an abandoned TNT plant near Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The couples spotted two large eyes that were attached to something that was "shaped like a man, but bigger, maybe six or seven feet tall. And it had big wings folded against its back". When the creature moved toward the plant door, the couples panicked and sped away. Moments later, they saw the same creature on a hillside near the road. It spread its wings and rose into the air, following with their car, which by now was traveling at over 100 miles per hour. "That bird kept right up with us," said one of the group. They told Deputy Sheriff Millard Halstead that it followed them down Highway 62 and right to the Point Pleasant city limits. And they would not be the only ones to report the creature that night. Another group of four witnesses claimed to see the Â“birdÂ” three different times!<br><br>Another sighting had more bizarre results. At about 10:30 on that same evening, Newell Partridge, a local building contractor who lived in Salem (about 90 miles from Point Pleasant), was watching television when the screen suddenly went dark. He stated that a weird pattern filled the screen and then he heard a loud, whining sounds from outside that raised in pitch and then ceased. Â“It sounded like a generator winding upÂ” he later stated. PartridgeÂ’s dog, Bandit, began to howl out on the front porch and Newell went out to see what was going on.<br><br>When he walked outside, he saw Bandit facing the hay barn, about 150 yards from the house. Puzzled, Partridge turned a flashlight in that direction and spotted two red circles that looked like eyes or Â“bicycle reflectorsÂ”. They moving red orbs were certainly not animalÂ’s eyes, he believed, and the sight of them frightened him. Bandit, an experienced hunting dog and protective of his territory, shot off across the yard in pursuit of the glowing eyes. Partridge called for him to stop, but the animal paid no attention. His owner turned and went back into the house for his gun, but then was too scared to go back outside again. He slept that night with his gun propped up next to the bed. The next morning, he realized that Bandit had disappeared. The dog had still not shown up two days later when Partridge read in the newspaper about the sightings in Point Pleasant that night.<br><br>One statement that he read in the newspaper chilled him to the bone. Roger Scarberry, one member of the group who spotted the strange Â“birdÂ” at the TNT plant, said that as they entered the city limits of Point Pleasant, they saw the body of a large dog lying on the side of the road. A few minutes later, on the way back out of town, the dog was gone. They even stopped to look for the body, knowing they had passed it just a few minutes before. Newell Partridge immediately thought of Bandit, who was never seen again.<br><br>On November 16, a press conference was held in the county courthouse and the couples from the TNT plant sighting repeated their story. Deputy Halstead, who had known the couples all of their lives, took them very seriously. Â“TheyÂ’ve never been in any trouble,Â” he told investigators and had no reason to doubt their stories. Many of the reporters who were present for the weird recounting felt the same way. The news of the strange sightings spread around the world. The press dubbed the odd flying creature Â“MothmanÂ”, after a character from the popular Batman television series of the day.<br><br>The remote and abandoned TNT plant became the lair of the Mothman in the months ahead and it could not have picked a better place to hide in. The area was made up of several hundred acres of woods and large concrete domes where high explosives were stored during World War II. A network of tunnels honeycombed the area and made it possible for the creature to move about without being seen. In addition to the manmade labyrinth, the area was also comprised of the McClintic Wildlife Station, a heavily forested animal preserve filled with woods, artificial ponds and steep ridges and hills. Much of the property was almost inaccessible and without a doubt, Mothman could have hid for weeks or months and remained totally unseen. The only people who ever wandered there were hunters and fishermen and the local teenagers, who used the rutted dirt roads of the preserve as Â“loverÂ’s lanesÂ”.<br><br>Very few homes could be found in the region, but one dwelling belonged to the Ralph Thomas family. One November 16, they spotted a Â“funny red lightÂ” in the sky that moved and hovered above the TNT plant. Â“It wasnÂ’t an airplaneÂ”, Mrs. Marcella Bennett (a friend of the Thomas family) said, Â“but we couldnÂ’t figure out what it was.Â” Mrs. Bennett drove to the Thomas house a few minutes later and got out of the car with her baby. Suddenly, a figure stirred near the automobile. Â“It seemed as though it had been lying down,Â” she later recalled. Â“It rose up slowly from the ground. A big gray thing. Bigger than a man with terrible glowing eyes.Â”<br><br>Mrs. Bennett was so horrified that she dropped her little girl! She quickly recovered, picked up her child and ran to the house. The family locked everyone inside but hysteria gripped them as the creature shuffled onto the porch and peered into the windows. The police were summoned, but the Mothman had vanished by the time the authorities had arrived.<br><br>Mrs. Bennett would not recover from the incident for months and was in fact so distraught that she sought medical attention to deal with her anxieties. She was tormented by frightening dreams and later told investigators that she believed the creature had visited her own home too. She said that she could often hear a keening sounds (like a woman screaming) near her isolated home on the edge of Point Pleasant.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Spring Heeled Jack - was he a creature, an alien, or a man wearing some strange costume and a hidden jumping apparatus?  During the 1830's, this 'man' terrorized England.  Described as tall, thin, powerful, wearing a black cloak, the man could jump 20 to 30 feet vertical.  It was reported that he had large pointy ears and nose, with red glowing eyes, and capable of spitting an odd white and blue flame from his mouth.<br><br>The Early Sightings<br><br>The first sighting may have occurred in September of 1837 in London, England.  A businessman was returning home from work late at night when a mysterious figure vaulted over the railings of a nearby cemetery.  The railings were at least 10 feet high but the creature effortlessly leaped over the wall and landed directly in the path of the strolling man.  The creature was described as having pointed ears, large glowing eyes, and a large pointed nose.<br><br>A short time later, Spring Heeled Jack was said to have attacked a group of people - 3 women and 1 man.  All ran but Polly Adams, who was left behind.  Spring Heeled Jack tore off the top of her blouse, grabbed her breasts, and began clawing at her stomach.  The attack knocked Polly unconscious where she lay until being discovered by a policeman patrolling his beat.<br><br>The Mary Stevens Incident<br><br>In October of 1837, Mary Stevens, a servant, was returning to her employer's home on Lavender Hill.  While passing through Cut Throat Lane in Clapham Common, Spring Heeled Jack sprang from an alley, tightly wrapped his arms around her, kissed her on the face, and began running his hands down her blouse.  When Mary screamed, Spring Heeled Jack ran from the scene.  Local men were alerted by the screams and quickly arrived on the scene.  They searched for the assailant to no avail.<br><br>The next day, Spring Heeled Jack struck again at a location very near Mary Stevens home.  He sprang in front of a passing carriage causing the carriage to careen out of control and crash.  Witnesses at the scene claimed that Spring Heeled Jack escaped by springing effortlessly over a 9 foot wall.<br><br>Very shortly after the carriage incident.  Spring Heeled Jack accosted a women near Clapham Church.  In this particular incident he left physical evidence.  Investigators discovered 2 footprints 3 inches deep.  The depth of the prints seemed to suggest some type of 'spring' mechanism in the shoes.  Note:  A spring apparatus was tested by the Germans during the war and resulted in a 85% failure rate (the men broke their ankles).<br><br>A few months later, January 1838, London's Lordy Mayor Sir John Cowan declared Spring Heeled Jack a 'public menace'.  A posse of men were formed to search for the individual responsible for the attacks.  It was during this time that the great Duke of Wellington, who was now 70 years old, joined in the search.  Some sources indicate that the Duke may have had several close encounters with Spring Heeled Jack.  Unfortunately, Spring Heeled Jack was never found and in fact, intensified his attacks during the following months.<br><br>The Lucy Scales Incident<br><br>On February 20, 1838, Lucy Scales (1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and her sister Margaret Scales were returning home at around 8:30 PM, from their brother's house in the Limehouse area.  Reports indicate that Spring Heeled Jack jumped out in front of Lucy Scales and spat blue fire in her face.  Written evidence indicate that Lucy was 'blinded' - whether this blindness was temporary, permanent, or simply a figure of speech is not known.  After the attack, witnesses claim that Spring Heeled Jack jumped from the ground to the roof of a house and made his escape.<br><br>The Alsop Incident<br><br>Two days later, on February 22, 1838, Jane Alsop (1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> was in her home on Bearhind Lane in the district of Bow, when she heard a wrapping on the door.  Answering the door, a black cloaked man exclaimed "I'm a policeman. For Gods sake, bring me a light, for we have caught Spring-heeled Jack in the lane" (a black cloak was traditional uniform attire for policemen of this era).  Jane, who lived with her father and two sisters, went to fetch a light for the man.  She returned with a candle and as she was handing the light to the man, it shone on his face and she noticed that it was Spring Heeled Jack hiimself.  He immediately spat a blue and white 'gas' into her face.  She attempted to run back into the house but he held on tightly to the back of her hair.  One of her sisters managed to pull her out of his grasps and drug her back into the house.  Spring Heeled Jack continued banging on the door some time before hastily leaving.  Witnesses claim that Spring Heeled Jack left quickly, dropping his coat in a field by Jane's home.  Another person was seen scooping up the coat and leaving the area leading police to believe that Spring Heeled Jack may have an accomplice.  The Lambeth police took Jane's statement:<br><br>He wore a large helmet and a sort of tight-fitting costume that felt like oilskin. But the cape was just like the ones worn by the policemen. His hands were as cold as ice and like powerful claws. But the most frightening thing about him was his eyes. They shone like balls of fire.<br><br>The following day, yet another incident occurred on Turner Street near Commercial Road.  Once again, Spring Heeled Jack knocked on the resident's door and when a servant boy answered the door, Spring Heeled Jack asked to speak to the master of the house, Mr. Ashworth.  The boy turned to call Mr. Ashworth when he noticed, out of the corner of his eye, that the visitor was none other than Spring Heeled Jack.  With glowing orange eyes and clawed hands, Spring Heeled Jack waved his fist at the boy and leapt completely over the houses on Commercial Road.  The lad was able to supply an additional piece of evidence - under his cloak, the lad noticed that Spring Heeled Jack had an embroidered letter 'W' on his shirt.  Similar to a coat of arms, the Gold 'W' seemed to indicate someone of royalty.<br><br>It was the Ashworth attack and the servant boy's subsequent description of the attackers monogram that led police to suspect Henry, the Marquis of Waterford.  The Marquis was an Irish nobleman known for his sometimes cruel and unusual sense of humor.  Police surmised that the Marquis accomplished his leaping feats via springs hidden in his shoes.  This theory was later abandoned when the Marquis died tragically in 1859 (he was thrown from his horse) while the attacks continued for some time afterwards.<br><br>After the Ashworth incident, attacks continued during the next year (1839). They stopped for a short while and then continued again in 1843.  In 1845, the only known incident involving a fatality, occurred on a bridge in New York, far across the ocean from the London attacks.  In broad daylight, Spring Heeled Jack jumped towards a young prostitute, grabbed her by the shoulders, and spat fire into her face.  The stunned girl was then thrown into a sewer below where she tragically drowned.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Things grew quiet for several years before flaring up again during 1877 back in London.  In Caistor, Newfolk, there were several reports of Spring Heeled Jack traveling across the town by jumping from rooftop to rooftop.<br><br>In August of 1877, Spring Heeled Jack appeared before a group of soldiers in Aldershot's North army camp.  A Private John Regan was standing sentry at the camp when he heard the noise of someone dragging something metallic down the road.  He went to investigate and finding nothing unusual turned to return to his post.  When he did, Spring Heeled Jack leapt at him and spat blue flames from his mouth into the boy's face.  Other sentries heard the commotion and hurriedly ran to his aid.  Witnesses claim that Spring Heeled Jack jumped over the men, clearing them by 10 feet or more.  The sentry fired at the intruder and claimed that bullets did not affect him (note that some reports indicate that these sentry men were not allowed live ammunition - 'blanks' only were used to warn off evil-doers).  The sentry described the attacker as tall and thin wearing a helmet and oilskin suit.<br><br>One month later, in Lincolnshire, Spring Heeled Jack was seen hurdling over several houses.  As in the Aldershot episode, residents fired at him with shotguns to no avail.  These witnesses claimed that the shots did hit Spring Heeled Jack and sounded like they were hitting some sort of metallic object.<br><br>Another occurrence was reported in January of 1879 where Spring Heeled Jack once again startled a carriage and horse team.  The driver was crossing a bridge in Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Court, when Spring Heeled Jack, clothed in black and flashing menacing orange eyes, jumped onto one of the horses backs.<br><br>In September 1904, South of Liverpool in England, Spring Heeled Jack appeared on the roof of a church.  He was spotted hanging on the steeple of St. Francis Xaviers on Salisbury Street.  Onlookers claimed he suddenly dropped from the steeple and fell to the ground.  Thinking that he had committed suicide, they rushed to the point where he had landed (behind some houses) only to find a helmeted man, clothed in white, standing there waiting.  He scuttled towards the crowd, raised his arms, and took to the air over William Henry Street.<br><br>The final recorded event occurred in 1920 at the Central Railway Station in London.  A man in a white cloak was seen jumping back and forth from rooftop to the street below.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All of her life, Frances T. has "seen things," heard things and felt them. Born into a family of sensitives, this was rather normal. "In my family, you were considered odd if you didn't experience 'abnormal' things," Frances says. "We never talked much about our experiences or our feelings about them. We just accepted them as normal - which, in fact, to us they are."<br><br>But nothing could have prepared her family for what they encountered on a dark, desolate road in Arizona 20 years ago. It's a mysterious and traumatizing event that haunts them to this day.<br><br>Frances's family had moved from Wyoming to Flagstaff, Arizona in 1978 shortly after her high school graduation. Sometime between 1982 and 1983, 20-year-old Frances, her father, mother and her younger brother took a road trip back to Wyoming in the family pickup truck. The trip was a vacation to visit with friends in and around their old hometown. The only member of the family not present was her older brother, who was in the Army and stationed at Ft. Bragg, N.C.<br><br>The course along Route 163 took them through the Navajo Indian Reservation and through the town of Kayenta, just south of the Utah border and the magnificent Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park. Anyone who has lived in Arizona for any length of time knows that the Indian Reservation can be a beautiful if harsh place for non-natives. "Many strange things happen out there," Frances says. "Even my friend, a Navajo, warned us of traveling through the reservation, especially at night."<br><br>Along with the warning, however, Frances's Native American friend blessed the family, and they were on our way.<br><br>"We have company."<br>The trip to Wyoming was uneventful. But the trip back to Arizona along the same route more than justified the warning from Frances's friend. "It still gives me goose bumps," she says. "To this day, I have major anxiety attacks when I have to travel through the north country at night. I avoid it at all costs."<br><br>It was a warm summer night, about 10:00 p.m., when the family's pickup was heading south on 163, about 20 to 30 miles from the town of Kayenta. It was a moonless night on this lonely stretch of road - so pitch black that they could only see just a few feet beyond the headlights. So dark that closing their eyes actually brought relief from the fathomless black.<br><br>They had been driving for hours with Frances's father at the wheel, and the vehicle's passengers had long ago settled into quiet. Frances and her father sandwiched her mother in the truck's cab, while her brother enjoyed the night air in the back of the pickup. Suddenly, Frances's father broke the silence. "We have company," he said.<br><br>Frances and her mother turned around and looked out the back slider window. Sure enough, a pair of headlights appeared over the crest of a hill, then disappeared as the car went down, then reappeared. Frances commented to her father that it was nice to have company on this stretch of road. If something went wrong, neither vehicle and its passengers would be alone.<br><br>Thunder began to rumble from the vast, clouded sky. The parents decided that their son should come into the cab before he got soaking wet from any rain that might fall. Frances opened the slider window and her little brother crawled in, squeezing between her and her mother. Frances turned to close the window and again noticed the headlights from the following car. "They're still behind us," her father said. "They must be going to either Flagstaff or Phoenix. We'll probably meet them in Kayenta when we stop to fuel up."<br><br>Frances watched as the car's headlights crested another hill and began its descent until it disappeared. She watched for them to reappear... and watched. They didn't reappear. She told her father that the car should have crested the other hill again, but hadn't. Maybe they slowed down, he suggested, or pulled over. That was possible, but it just didn't make sense to Frances. "Why in the hell would a driver slow down or, worse yet, stop at the bottom of a hill in the middle of night, with nothing around for miles and miles?" Frances asked her father. "You'd think they'd want to keep sight of the car in front of them in case anything happened!"<br><br>People do weird stuff when they are driving, her father replied. So Frances kept watching, turning around every few minutes to check for those headlights, but they never did reappear. When she turned to look one last time, she noticed that the pickup was slowing down. Turning back to look out the windshield, she saw that they were rounding a sharp bend in the road, and her father had slowed the truck to about 55 mph. And from that moment, time itself seemed to slow down for Frances. The atmosphere changed somehow, taking on an otherworldly quality.<br><br>Frances turned her head to look out the passenger window, when her mother screamed and her father cried out, "Jesus Christ! What the hell is that!?"<br><br>Frances didn't know what was happening, but one hand instinctively reached over and held down the button for the door lock, and the other tightly grabbed the the door handle. She braced her back against her small brother and held firmly onto the door, still not knowing quite why.<br><br>Her brother was now yelling, "What is it? What is it?" Her father immediately flipped on the interior cab light, and Frances could see that he was petrified. "I have never, ever seen my father that scared in my whole life," Frances says. "Not when he came home from his tours in Vietnam, not when he came home from 'special assignments,' not even when someone tried to firebomb our house."<br><br>Frances's father was as white as a ghost. She could see the hair on the back of his neck standing straight out, like a cat's, and so was the hair on his arms. She could even see the goose bumps on his skin. Panic was filling the small cab. Frances's mother was so frightened that she began shouting in her native Japanese in a high, squeaky voice as she frantically wrung her hands. The little boy just kept saying, "Oh my God!" Skinwalker Legend<br>Is the Navajo Skinwalker the same as the white man's werewolf? Yes, if the Navajo witch wears the skin of a wolf. But the Navajo witches can mimic any animal they choose, not just the wolf. They can be a cat, a coyote, a dog, a bear, whatever the Navajo witch wants to be. The Navajo witches pick their skins for the type of job they plan to do. The coyote skin is for high speed, accurate sense of smell, and the acute agility. The bear skin is for brute strength, however the bear is not as fast as the coyote. Along with their new abilities, the Navajo Skinwalkers still retain their full mental capacities. If the Navajo witch is a fairly or highly intelligent person, when he or she changes into a Skinwalker they carry that intelligence with them and you have a very dangerous opponent. Unlike the wolf man, the Skinwalker will use their whole bag of tricks - mind control, disease, and immobilization powder.<br><br>- from Navajo Skinwalkers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From out of the ditch<br>As the pickup sped around the bend in the road, Frances could see that the shoulder dropped off deeply into a ditch. Her father slammed on the brakes to prevent the truck from swerving into the ditch. As the pickup was slowing to a stop, something leapt out of the ditch at the side of the truck. And now Frances could clearly see what had started the panic.<br><br>It was black and hairy and was eye level with the passengers in the cab. If this was a man, it was like no man Frances had ever seen. Yet despite its monstrous appearance, whatever this thing was, it wore a man's clothes. "It had on a white and blue checked shirt and long pants - I think jeans," Frances testifies. "Its arms were raised over its head, almost touching the top of the cab."<br><br>This creature remained there for a few seconds, looking into the pickup... and then the pickup was past it. Frances could not believe what she had seen. "It looked like a hairy man, or a hairy animal in man's clothing," she says. "But it didn't look like an ape or anything like that. Its eyes were yellow and its mouth was open."<br><br>Although time seemed frozen and distorted in this moment of fantastic horror, it was all over within a few minutes - the headlights, her little brother coming into the cab and the "thing."<br><br>By the time the family reached Kayenta for gas, they had finally calmed down. Frances and her father climbed out of the pickup and checked the side of the truck to see if the creature had done any damage. They were surprised to see that the dust on the side of the truck was undisturbed, and so was the dust on the hood and roof of the truck. In fact, they found nothing out of the ordinary. No blood, no hair... nothing. The family stretched their legs and rested at Kayenta for about 20 minutes. The car that had been following them never did show up. It's as if the car simply vanished. They drove home to Flagstaff with the cab light on and the doors securely locked.<br><br>"I wish I could say this was the end of the story," Frances says, "but it's not."<br><br>The "men" at the fence<br>A few nights later, around 11:00 p.m., Frances and her brother were awakened by the sounds of drumming. They looked out his bedroom window into the backyard, which was surrounded by a fence. At first, they saw nothing but the forest beyond the fence. Then the drumming grew louder, and three or four "men" appeared behind the wooden fence. "It looked like they were trying to climb the fence, but couldn't quite manage to bring their legs up high enough and swing over," Frances says.<br><br>Unable to get into the yard, the "men" began to chant. Frances was so scared, she slept with her little brother that night.<br><br>Sometime later, Frances sought out her Navajo friend, hoping she could offer some explanation for these strange incidents. She told Frances that it was a Skinwalker that had tried to attack her family. Skinwalkers are creatures of Navajo legend - witches that can shape-shift into animals.<br><br>That a Skinwalker attacked them was quite unusual, Frances's friend told her, as it had been a long time since she has heard of any activity about Skinwalkers, and that they normally don't bother non-natives. Frances took her friend back by the fence where she had seen the strange men trying to climb in. The Navajo woman considered the scene for a moment, then revealed that three or four Skinwalkers had visited the house. She said that they wanted the family, but could not gain access because something was protecting the family.<br><br>Frances was astonished. Why, she asked. Why would the Skinwalkers want her family? "Your family has a lot of power," the Navajo woman said, "and that they wanted it." Again she said that Skinwalkers usually don't bother non-natives, but she believed that they wanted the family enough to expose themselves. Later that day, she blessed the perimeter of the property, the house, the vehicles and the family.<br><br>"We haven't been bothered by Skinwalkers since then," Frances says. "Then again, I haven't been back to Kayenta. I have gone through other towns on the reservation - yes, at night. But I'm not alone; I carry a weapon. And I carry protective amulets."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Location. London, England<br>Date: January 16 2004 Time: late night<br>In the middle of the night the witness, Jim, (involved in<br>previous encounters) suddenly found himself wide-awake. A loud<br>buzzing sound filled his ears. He was curled up on his bed in a<br>fetal position facing the closest wall. He felt a force push on<br>the back of his head. It did not hurt but felt extremely<br>uncomfortable. Again he heard the now familiar "clicking" sound<br>in his head. This time it panned from his right ear to the left.<br>He looked at his arm and it was covered in a bluish purplish<br>pulsating energy. He could not move his legs and arms; he could<br>just move his head. Somehow he managed to break free and used<br>all his effort to turn around. Standing before him in the center<br>of the bedroom was some kind of short humanoid creature, with a<br>large mantis/fly looking head. A beam of energy seemed to be<br>shooting from the alien to the witness. Thousands of thoughts<br>entered his head at the same time. Strangely he felt no fear and<br>felt as he had known the strange being all his life, but also<br>felt that he had been somehow manipulated into feeling this. He<br>then heard a slow deep voice, almost overwriting all his other<br>thoughts. It seemed to be communicating telepathically. It said<br>in an abrupt manner, "Now do you understand?" "Yes" the witness<br>found himself answering, but he had no idea why he said that.<br>"Good" It replied. The witness then turned his head back to the<br>wall and shut his eyes. The buzzing sound stopped and he felt<br>extremely tired. He then collapsed and lost consciousness. He<br>described the creature as humanoid, 5 ft 5 inches in height. Its<br>head was huge in relation to its body. Its eyes were extremely<br>large, shiny, and insect-like and were supported by big sockets.<br>His first impression was that it looked like a cross between a<br>praying mantis and a fly. The being appeared to be surrounded by<br>a bluish purplish field of energy. In the center of its cloak<br>was a golden badge, there was definitely a design or symbol on<br>it, but the witness could not make it out. He looked closer at<br>the head and it had two protrusions between the eyes and a mass<br>of protrusions was in the area where a mouth would normally be.<br>The witness woke up the next day feeling very tired.<br></div>
