            <div class='col-md body'>Location. Manchester, Dearborn County, Indiana<br>Date: January 24 2004 Time: 1930<br>A 17-year old motorist traveling almost 10 miles north of Aurora<br>Indiana on Saturday night claims to have encountered an unusual<br>figure on the road. While driving his black Chevrolet Cavalier<br>southbound along North Hogan Road a "figure" was spotted in the<br>headlights of the automobile as it was crouched down near a<br>puddle of water. From the driver's perspective the figure was<br>spotted out the windshield on the right of the car. After<br>passing the frail-looking figure, the driver looked into his<br>rear view mirror and again observed---illuminated by the<br>taillights of his car---what he described as a tall, abnormal<br>figure that moved strangely with pointed joints that "buckled<br>out". He estimated the figure stood around 6 feet, seven inches.<br>"It had protruding joints and moved very strangely." The driver<br>said he was able to ascertain the figure, alleged to be dark<br>gray or black and "pencil thin" stand up and take several steps<br>toward the woods along the roadside. The figure definitely<br>walked on two legs and was thought somehow, to be a male,<br>although no clothing was noted. No face or eyes could be seen,<br>but the witness had the impression that the figure was looking<br>straight at him. The figure was immediately thought to be<br>something out of the ordinary, not a human being. The duration<br>of the sighting was "hurried" and possibly within the 3 to 4<br>second range. The driver continued on for a small distance after<br>passing the figure and finally put on his brakes, coming to a<br>stop at an estimated 2 minute walking distance on the road from<br>the location of the sighting. He looked back to further observe<br>the entity. At that point, a second car came into view and<br>approached from the opposite direction, passed and then reached<br>the spot on the road where the figure was thought to be. The 17-<br>year old motorist reportedly watched closely and observed the<br>second car undertake what he thought to be an evasive maneuver<br>near the vicinity of where he thought the figure would be<br>situated, then the car turned around at that spot and shortly<br>pulled up behind him, somewhat in the grass. There was an<br>elderly couple in the car, both in their late 60s or early 70s<br>and both with gray hair. The driver, who wore glasses said,<br>"Boy, did you see something back there? I'll tell you right now,<br>that was no person." The passenger, an elderly female said, "It<br>was no human being. It was no man." The elderly couple were<br>reportedly "spooked" but offered to follow the first witness the<br>remainder of the trip down North Hogan Road, clearly in the<br>opposite direction of their intended destination route. It was<br>thought that the elderly couple observed this same figure on the<br>opposite side of the road, and possibly had observed it more<br>closely. Later, the 17-year old witness was said to have become<br>hysterical, and within an hour was describing the figure as an<br>"alien".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Location. Salisbury East, South Australia<br>Date: January 27 2004 Time: 0230A<br>The witness (involved in other encounters) had gone into his<br>bedroom to get ready for bed and had the immediate feeling that<br>he was not alone in his bedroom. It was a warm night so he slept<br>on top of the bedding. At 0230A he woke up for no apparent<br>reason and all of the sudden a strange feeling overcame him as<br>if time had stopped. (He had felt the same in the previous<br>encounters). There was no sound anywhere and not a bit of<br>movement in the room. As he laid on his bed feeling very relaxed<br>he was grabbed by the left and right arms between the elbows and<br>shoulders and pulled down into his bed. It was as if something<br>was under his bed and its arms were coming through the bed. At<br>this stage he was not worried but his legs started to rise<br>together and he could not stop them. He attempted to break the<br>grip but was grasped even tighter. He began to struggle and to<br>yell obscenities. The witness then yelled "go to the light" "go<br>beneath the earth" until he was set free. He now felt calm. Then<br>all of the sudden he was grabbed in the same way and he felt an<br>electric current travel through his body, his legs began to rise<br>up again. He then saw lots of movement in his room and saw a<br>hand similar to a "frogs foot" or a gecko lizard foot,<br>apparently reptilian in nature. His legs went right over and he<br>seemed to have passed out. He woke up at 0700A feeling ill and<br>with terrible back pain. He felt drained and could not eat<br>breakfast. His eyes were red and later he found bruises on his<br>stomach and chest. On all the encounters the witness feels like<br>his bedroom has somehow been "detached" from the house and taken<br>somewhere else.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Location. Leona Vicario, Yucatan, Mexico<br>Date: January 28 2004 Time: midnight<br>Maria Luisa Fernandez Morales a residents living in the<br>outskirts of the city reported that an unknown creature killed<br>at least 50 of her hens, which she kept in her backyard. The<br>witness, who sold chickens for a living heard a loud ruckus<br>coming from the pen and ran out only to confront a very strange<br>creature similar to a "tiger" but bipedal in nature and emitting<br>loud grunting sounds. According to the witness the mysterious<br>creature jumped over a wire fence and ran from the area leaving<br>a trail of blood behind. It only took several minutes for the<br>creature to kill the chickens. Also residents from the town of<br>Texan Palomeque have reported seeing what they describe as a<br>"wolf-woman", which has also killed and decapitated hundreds of<br>chickens in area.<br><br>Location. Texan Palomeque, Yucatan, Mexico<br>Date: January 29 2004 Time: night<br>Numerous locals have seen a bizarre creature dubbed the<br>"wolfwoman" and it is said to be responsible for the slaying of<br>hundreds of farm birds. Some who has seen it describe it as<br>about 5 ft tall, walking on two legs, hairy and with glowing red<br>eyes. About 100 people armed with rifles and flashlights<br>searched the area for the alleged humanoid. Benito Canul a 45-<br>year old worker living outside the city of Uman said he managed<br>to fire at the strange being outside his house on the way to the<br>cemetery, he is unsure if he hit it. "The creature was dog<br>shaped but with glowing red eyes" Benito said.<br><br>Location. Chicxulub, Yucatan, Mexico<br>Date: January 29 2004 Time: late night<br>Local residents have reported seeing a creature described as<br>resembling a huge creature with horse-like legs, and covered in<br>gray colored hair. It is said that from the waist up the<br>creature resembles a woman and emits a loud chirping sound like<br>that of a bat. Numerous mutilated dog carcasses have been found<br>in the area, also that of chickens and cats. 16-year old<br>Patricia Figueroa Ponce was watching television one night when<br>she heard loud "chirping" noises coming from the backyard, she<br>ran to the kitchen after hearing her farm animals shriek in an<br>agitated manner, and her dogs acted afraid and nervous. She<br>looked out the window and saw a bizarre creature resembling a<br>huge dog, but with half of its body human in appearance.<br>Terrified she yelled for her mother but when both ran outside<br>the strange creature had disappeared. Some of the local<br>residents claim that the creature is actually a witch from the<br>nearby city of Conkal who had been practicing black magic and<br>had somehow transformed itself.<br></div>

Mexico City, Mexico<br>Date: January 31 2004 Time: 1850<br>On the eastern section of the city Mexican photographer Salvador<br>Guerrero videotaped a strange dark flying humanoid shaped that<br>flew at an estimated 3,000 meters altitude over the area, moving<br>from west to east. It flew at a speed considerable lower than an<br>airplane. He could clearly see that the humanoid was moving its<br>arms and was wearing a very dark outfit. He was in the company<br>of Enrique Yonka when he took the video. Compare with the<br>encounter of the Mexican police officer that was attacked by a<br>flying humanoid earlier on the month.<br><br>Location.

He caught a quick glimpse of a figure, he<br>described as "graphite" in color with long thin but strong legs.<br>It quickly scurried behind some trees and disappeared from<br>sight. Later that night sometime after midnight as he slept in<br>the farmhouse he suddenly woke up feeling a strong hand pushing<br>on his chest. He was paralyzed and could not move or speak. He<br>then noticed a dark figure, human in shape standing over him. It<br>seemed to emit a strong influence over the witness, which<br>totally controlled him. The whole time his girlfriend and cousin<br>slept in the next room and was not in any way disturbed. Soon<br>the dark human-shaped figure vanished and he was able to move<br>again.<br><br>Note by Ashiene: This guy may have been suffering sleep paralysis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ashiene:</div><div class="quote_body">This story certainly has been causing a great stir here in the city of Monterrey, N.L.<br><br>It was very early in the morning 3:15 AM on Friday January 16, 2004 when police officer Leonardo Samaniego from Guadalupe, N.L. Mexico was doing his daily vigilance routine in his patrol car around Colonia Valles de la Silla not knowing the shocking experience that he was about to live, a true drama that he will never forget.<br><br>The night was cold and dark and the streets were empty when Samaniego made a turn onto Alamo street and immediately noticed something very unusual.<br><br>A huge, black object fell from a tree beside the street but it stopped just before touching the ground...and then slowly landed and turned itself to face the patrol car. At that moment, officer Samaniego knew that something was wrong. So he turned on the high beams of his car to try to see what was this black object that fell from the tree was.<br><br>That's when Samaniego's nightmare began.<br><br>"It was a woman...all dressed in black that fell from the tree but she didn't touch the ground, just remained floating several feet from the ground, declared officer Leonardo Samaniego. I saw her very well and then she landed softly on the ground and stood there looking at me. She was trying to cover her face from the lights of the car, I think they were bothering her. I could see two big black eyes on her, completely black without eyelids, and her skin was dark brown. She was all dressed in black with cloak and cape like a witch and she seemed very upset by the lights."<br><br>In a matter of seconds, the scene turned into a terrific sequence of events almost like a horror movie...but all too real. The being jumped very fast over to - and onto - Samaniego's patrol car trying to get at him while the shocked police officer tried to runaway in reverse while shouting desperately for back-up assistance on his radio.<br><br>"As soon as I realized it was a kind of woman being, or a witch, very strange standing there trying to cover her face, she threw herself against my car very fast, falling on the car and hitting the windshield. She was flying very fast and it took only a second to hit the windshield glass. I was so shocked by this action that I put the car in reverse and pushed the accelerator trying to get away while requesting backup assistance by radio."<br><br>According to officer Samaniego's statement, the female being was trying to grab him with her hands right through the car's windshield. She was separated from the officer by only the few centimeters of the car's windshield. It was at this moment that officer Samaniego got his best visual look at the being he described as a "witch".<br><br>"It was a woman with big black eyes, everything was black, no eyelids. Her skin was dark brown and her expression was horrible. She was furiously trying to get me with her claws while I was running away in reverse calling desperately for backup assistance to any units around. When I finally hit the end of the street, I was so shocked that I covered my eyes and then I fainted."<br><br>Officer Leonardo Samaniego lost consciousness after he covered his eyes trying not to see the frightening being still glued to the windshield trying to get to him. The severe amount of high stress experienced by him caused him to pass out.<br><br>Some minutes later, two police units arrived as well as an ambulance that was nearby. When they got to the patrol car they found officer Samaniego unconscious. Fortunately, he was not injured, perhaps due to the fact that he never abandoned the car during the incident. That decision may have prevented a tragedy.<br><br>After several minutes, he regained consciousness and was attended by the paramedics on the ambulance. A tv camera crew that arrived with a police unit recorded officer Samaniego's first interview just minutes after he felt calmed enough - during the interrogation by his police colleagues. All this occurred at the same place of the bizarre incident. Officer Samaniego stood firmly on his account, insisting that the being was a witch that could fly and attacked him and his patrol car.<br><br>An extensive search was done around the area by the police units trying to find any tracks or evidence of the mysterious female being but nothing was found. The ambulance took officer Samaniego to the Hospital Universitario for a medical evaluation and he remained there all day.<br><br>The Secretary of Public Security of Guadalupe, Mr. Hamlet Castilla Garcia, informed that several drug tests as well as other examinations were conducted on officer Leonardo Samaniego to check for any toxic substances in his body like alcohol or any kind of drug. All tests were negative.<br><br>Also, Dr. Edelmiro Perez Rodriguez who is coordinator of medical services in Hospital Universitario informed that after several psychiatric and psychological examinations they found officer Leonardo Samaniego mentally and physically healthy.<br>A police officer from Santa Catarina, N.L., Mr. Jorge Contreras, declared that he and two more policemen from the Regia Police saw EXACTLY the same flying being that officer Samaniego saw, but three days before. They saw it flying and decided not to say anything - until they heard about this case.<br><br>Norma Alicia Herrera who lives in Colonia La Playa declared in a tv interview that she and her brother saw also the being flying at daytime and that it looked weird. She said that her brother was so stunned by the sighting that he was sick for almost a week afterwards.<br><br>A neighbor in that sector also videotaped, several days before, a strange flying humanoid being and gave the video to the tv station. The footage was released the same day during the newscast of channel 34 and later on channel 2 causing even more commotion among the people.<br><br>The story was also released by major newspapers like El Norte and Milenio. The same Friday, January 16, special surveillance units were stationed where the incident took place and streets surrounding as an operative to protect the neighbors in case an eventual new attack. At the same time, an investigation was initiated by the Public Security Corporation in Guadalupe. Police officer Leonardo Samaniego remained in seclusion receiving his treatment for the next two days when he was interviewed again on tv, maintaining his story in every detail.<br><br>Full article can be found here (with pics):<br><a href="http://www.rense.com/general48/entity.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rense.com/general48/entity.htm</a></div></blockquote>a case for the FBI's mulder n scully</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Location. Petersfield, England<br>Date: March 2005<br>Time: evening<br>The witness, Cameron Lawther was walking home after school when he heard a strange screeching sound that he first thought that it was some kids playing around from the opposite junior high school. However he looked around and the sound did not seem to be coming from the school. He then saw opposite to him on a mud bank a really weird monkey-like creature except that his skin was completely showing and it had bizarre large teeth, it looked like a fur-less monkey with really large fangs which were at least 2-2.5 inches long. Frightened, the witness slowly backed away along the path while the monkey-like creature kept staring at him with beady eyes. He ran home and told his parents.<br><br>Location. Los Angeles area, California<br>Date: March 2005<br>Time: 2130 and 330A<br>The witness was standing out on the steps of his house smoking a cigarette when he suddenly had the impulse to look up in the sky. Recently he had read about reports of people who had seen a UFO and decided to attempt telepathic contact. He looked up and saw what he thought was a UFO and was able to make telepathic contact. He asked if they were there and they said, "Yes". Recently he had been having horrible nightmares and decided to ask them if they were the cause and they said yes. He asked them why they had been giving him the nightmares. The reason they gave him was that he meant something special to them. He then asked them to please stop scaring him that he was deathly afraid of them. They said that they couldn't stop because he was not born here, on earth they meant (!). The witness asked what did they mean and they answered that they had created him and that he was one of their experiments. He then asked them if they were going to take them again and they said yes. The witness then told them to try "not to scare him to much". To which they replied "we will try". That same night they came for him and the witness was able to remember everything. He remembered the aliens coming through his bedroom door which was closed. He looked at his watch and it said 0330A. He screamed and started to cry. He described the beings as about 3 or 4 ft tall, with slit for mouths, egg-shaped large heads, with large almond shaped eyes with pupils that resembled those of a cat. They were very thin and had very long fingers, which he counted five on each hand. There were a total of four humanoids. They told him not to be afraid. But the witness was becoming hysterical and was telling the humanoids to go away, while he screamed uncontrollably. They then stared at him and he began to calm down a bit but was still crying. Still sobbing, they led him into what appeared to be a small scout vessel shaped like a croissant, which had a large ramp about 10 ft long and 20 ft wide. He estimated the "scout ship" to have been about 20 to 27 ft long and about 13 to 18 ft high. They led him by the hand and as soon as he was inside he was strapped to a slab that looked like an uppercase "T" after that they disrobed him. All the while this was happening one of them told him that his name was Morrin. The aliens were speaking and all the witness heard was English, he thought they might have been using telepathy, but he still heard sounds coming out of their "mouths". The sounds were a mixture of grunts, shrieks, groans and one to scary to make out. Then when the ship docked with the mother ship he was rolled or felt like he was being rolled to their medical center, all the while he was still crying. Morrin told him that he was an experiment meant to advance their breeding program and that they had tried to adapt their hybrids to feel emotions but so far they had failed and that they just needed some insight into what they called human interaction and emotions. The witness then asked why he and they replied that they were still trying to find out. He then decided to tell them that if he was their "creation" how could they not know and they said that they were just "working for them and they were not told anything". The witness then asked who were "they", the humanoids then pointed to their left and when he looked, he saw what looked like a "Nordic" type being but it was much too thin and it had blood red colored hair. They then proceeded to take blood and sperm samples. After about four hours of mental interrogation as the witness felt being treated like a test subject he was returned home. He asked them to please never come back for him and they said "no".<br></div>
