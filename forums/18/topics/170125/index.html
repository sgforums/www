            <div class='col-md body'>This story certainly has been causing a great stir here in the city of Monterrey, N.L.<br><br>It was very early in the morning 3:15 AM on Friday January 16, 2004 when police officer Leonardo Samaniego from Guadalupe, N.L. Mexico was doing his daily vigilance routine in his patrol car around Colonia Valles de la Silla not knowing the shocking experience that he was about to live, a true drama that he will never forget.<br><br>The night was cold and dark and the streets were empty when Samaniego made a turn onto Alamo street and immediately noticed something very unusual.<br><br>A huge, black object fell from a tree beside the street but it stopped just before touching the ground...and then slowly landed and turned itself to face the patrol car. At that moment, officer Samaniego knew that something was wrong. So he turned on the high beams of his car to try to see what was this black object that fell from the tree was.<br><br>That's when Samaniego's nightmare began.<br><br>"It was a woman...all dressed in black that fell from the tree but she didn't touch the ground, just remained floating several feet from the ground, declared officer Leonardo Samaniego. I saw her very well and then she landed softly on the ground and stood there looking at me. She was trying to cover her face from the lights of the car, I think they were bothering her. I could see two big black eyes on her, completely black without eyelids, and her skin was dark brown. She was all dressed in black with cloak and cape like a witch and she seemed very upset by the lights."<br><br>In a matter of seconds, the scene turned into a terrific sequence of events almost like a horror movie...but all too real. The being jumped very fast over to - and onto - Samaniego's patrol car trying to get at him while the shocked police officer tried to runaway in reverse while shouting desperately for back-up assistance on his radio.<br><br>"As soon as I realized it was a kind of woman being, or a witch, very strange standing there trying to cover her face, she threw herself against my car very fast, falling on the car and hitting the windshield. She was flying very fast and it took only a second to hit the windshield glass. I was so shocked by this action that I put the car in reverse and pushed the accelerator trying to get away while requesting backup assistance by radio."<br><br>According to officer Samaniego's statement, the female being was trying to grab him with her hands right through the car's windshield. She was separated from the officer by only the few centimeters of the car's windshield. It was at this moment that officer Samaniego got his best visual look at the being he described as a "witch".<br><br>"It was a woman with big black eyes, everything was black, no eyelids. Her skin was dark brown and her expression was horrible. She was furiously trying to get me with her claws while I was running away in reverse calling desperately for backup assistance to any units around. When I finally hit the end of the street, I was so shocked that I covered my eyes and then I fainted."<br><br>Officer Leonardo Samaniego lost consciousness after he covered his eyes trying not to see the frightening being still glued to the windshield trying to get to him. The severe amount of high stress experienced by him caused him to pass out.<br><br>Some minutes later, two police units arrived as well as an ambulance that was nearby. When they got to the patrol car they found officer Samaniego unconscious. Fortunately, he was not injured, perhaps due to the fact that he never abandoned the car during the incident. That decision may have prevented a tragedy.<br><br>After several minutes, he regained consciousness and was attended by the paramedics on the ambulance. A tv camera crew that arrived with a police unit recorded officer Samaniego's first interview just minutes after he felt calmed enough - during the interrogation by his police colleagues. All this occurred at the same place of the bizarre incident. Officer Samaniego stood firmly on his account, insisting that the being was a witch that could fly and attacked him and his patrol car.<br><br>An extensive search was done around the area by the police units trying to find any tracks or evidence of the mysterious female being but nothing was found. The ambulance took officer Samaniego to the Hospital Universitario for a medical evaluation and he remained there all day.<br><br>The Secretary of Public Security of Guadalupe, Mr. Hamlet Castilla Garcia, informed that several drug tests as well as other examinations were conducted on officer Leonardo Samaniego to check for any toxic substances in his body like alcohol or any kind of drug. All tests were negative.<br><br>Also, Dr. Edelmiro Perez Rodriguez who is coordinator of medical services in Hospital Universitario informed that after several psychiatric and psychological examinations they found officer Leonardo Samaniego mentally and physically healthy.<br>A police officer from Santa Catarina, N.L., Mr. Jorge Contreras, declared that he and two more policemen from the Regia Police saw EXACTLY the same flying being that officer Samaniego saw, but three days before. They saw it flying and decided not to say anything - until they heard about this case.<br><br>Norma Alicia Herrera who lives in Colonia La Playa declared in a tv interview that she and her brother saw also the being flying at daytime and that it looked weird. She said that her brother was so stunned by the sighting that he was sick for almost a week afterwards.<br><br>A neighbor in that sector also videotaped, several days before, a strange flying humanoid being and gave the video to the tv station. The footage was released the same day during the newscast of channel 34 and later on channel 2 causing even more commotion among the people.<br><br>The story was also released by major newspapers like El Norte and Milenio. The same Friday, January 16, special surveillance units were stationed where the incident took place and streets surrounding as an operative to protect the neighbors in case an eventual new attack. At the same time, an investigation was initiated by the Public Security Corporation in Guadalupe. Police officer Leonardo Samaniego remained in seclusion receiving his treatment for the next two days when he was interviewed again on tv, maintaining his story in every detail.<br><br>Full article can be found here (with pics):<br><a href="http://www.rense.com/general48/entity.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rense.com/general48/entity.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On February 14, 2004, Ana Luisa Cid and two more witnesses videotaped one of the most disconcerting and controversial sightings that we have seen in years of research. This incident took place in Mexico City.<br><br>What seemed to be just another routine skywatch for Ana Luisa turned out to be a extremely rare experience never witnessed before by her. Up in the sky, a huge dark object was visible and Ana Luisa started videotaping...talking to the camera narrating the entire sighting. The dark object's shape became clearer and Ana Luisa said: "What is that?" on the video.<br><br>The dark object looked like a big black body below and a kind of vibrating structure above, joined together and almost stationary...balancing itself in the same spot. At that moment, Ana Luisa wondered if this was an helicopter coming toward her or an unknown aircraft. A big surprise was coming...<br><br>In a few minutes, a smaller, dark object appeared in the scenario from below and was absorbed by the big one. Then the whole object split apart. The lower body looked like a big dark creature with a kind of cloak waving to the air. The upper body looked like a winged creature that seemed to be vibrating and balancing like a pendulum.<br><br>A minute later, the smaller dark body was released again from the 'cloaked' creature and went flying to the right dissapearing behind a mountain. The two remaining bodies joined together again after some time, and then disappeared into the horizon.<br><br>This bizarre incident is known as 'The Entity Reunion in the Sky' and remains a complete mystery.<br><br>Full article with pics here<br><a href="http://www.rense.com/general66/humsan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rense.com/general66/humsan.htm</a></div>

The following week driving on the same hill the<br>witness saw another strange creature, thin in color and glowing<br>green, the head was like a lizard and on its back it carried<br>something resembling a backpack, which had a transparent<br>canister filled with the glowing green liquid, the creature<br>briefly walked towards the witness up an embankment but stopped<br>and disappeared into the woods, as it did the strange creature<br>appeared to turn transparent. Soon after that the witness was<br>driving up the same hill when his windshield went dark,<br>something was on the hood obstructing his sight, whatever it was<br>it was a creature with many white square teeth, he also saw the<br>creature's feet, which appeared sinewy and gray in color. The<br>creature then jumped from the hood and started walking alongside<br>the road, it had extremely long arms, and seemed to drag them on<br>the ground, the creature stopped and began gesticulating with<br>its long arms, at this point the witness noticed a similar<br>creature sitting on the ground staring at the witness, the eyes<br>of the creatures were black the size of a grapefruit, and both<br>had large pointy ears. The witness thought that another creature<br>was coming up behind him and looked back when suddenly the area<br>was illuminated by a strong white light, he drove on for about<br>50 ft and then looked back, and again saw the bizarre bird-like<br>creature standing on the road looking at him, it was six ft<br>tall, with square patches of red and yellow on it. The witness<br>eventually drove away without looking back.<br><br>Location. Rome Italy<br>Date: January 1 2004 Time: 1600<br>A public servant on his way back home sighted a strange object<br>resembling a wedge without wings emitting different tones of<br>orange light. The object remained suspended overhead briefly<br>before moving away at high speed. Later that same day as the<br>witness was lying in bed he suddenly felt himself totally<br>immobile, although totally aware of his surroundings. He was<br>able to open his eyes and saw standing before him a humanoid<br>face, green in color with large black eyes staring at him.<br>During the incident he heard a strong "metallic" buzzing sound.<br>When he was suddenly able to move he attempted to strike the<br>figure in front of him but it suddenly vanished in plain sight.<br><br>Location. Ivanovo, Russia<br>Date: January 1 2004 Time: 0100A<br>The main witness and two friends were celebrating the advent of<br>a new year, but had only drank a little bit of champagne and<br>were out walking the streets. The men suddenly noticed a large<br>orange sphere that seemed to descend and approach their<br>position. The sphere then hovered above some nearby fir trees.<br>As the men stared at it, the main witness looked around and<br>spotted a strange "person" some meters away, which immediately<br>he realized that it was not normal or human. It had what<br>appeared to be a "snout" and was staring at the witness in a<br>mocking grin. It then turned sideways and the witness was<br>stunned to see that completely flat in appearance, like it had<br>been run over by an asphalt roller. At this time the witness<br>felt a strong invisible wave that struck him and knocked him<br>down against the icy ground. As he got up the sphere and the<br>strange humanoid had disappeared he turned to his friends, who<br>apparently had not seen the humanoid but saw the orange sphere.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Location. Viluco, Chile<br>Date: January 5 2004 Time: 0515A<br>40-year old driver Juan Berrios was on his on an errand on Santa<br>Filomena Street on his way to Las Vertientes terminal when at<br>about 70 meters in front of his car he noticed a strange figure<br>standing on the middle of the road. He rubbed his eyes and then<br>saw nothing and kept on driving, at about 5 meters away the<br>bizarre figure again appeared. Stunned at what he was seeing<br>Berrios almost lost control of his vehicle as he swerved around<br>the figure almost upending the vehicle. The strange creature had<br>what appeared to be the carcass of a bloodied dog clutched in<br>his jaws. The creature suddenly jumped and disappeared into the<br>brush. Berrios described the creature as about 1.50m in height,<br>with large hind legs like a kangaroo, small curved front arms<br>that ended in claw like protrusions, a spiky dorsal fin on its<br>back, and a tail resembling that of a rattler on a snake. The<br>facial features were also bizarre; it had a wolf-like snout,<br>several sharp rows of teeth, and fierce-looking red eyes. It<br>jumped a height of about 5 meters and disappeared from sight.<br><br>Location. Wise County, Texas<br>Date: January 12 2004 Time: night<br>A young girl reported encountering a large black bird-like<br>creature outside a schoolyard in Wise County. No other<br>information.<br><br>Location. Jordanow, Poland<br>Date: January 13 2004 Time: 0258A<br>48-year old, L K was lying in bed with his face turned towards<br>the window. Suddenly he woke up with a strange feeling that<br>something odd was happening in the street. He opened his eyes<br>and noticed a ball, which was hanging in the sky. It shone with<br>a white-blue silvery light---like the moon---but it was 2-3<br>times bigger than the moon. He immediately looked at the clock<br>and noticed the time. He looked around the bedroom and saw his<br>wife and dog sleeping calmly. The witness then felt very dizzy<br>and went to sleep again. That same night he had another strange<br>experience. While in a half-awake state in his bed he heard a<br>strange female voice, which repeated a passage read in an<br>unknown language (the witness is an interpreter and speaks five<br>foreign languages fluently). Feeling afraid he covered his head<br>with a pillow. He immediately checked all the electrical devices<br>in the room but they were all turned off, except for the icebox.<br>His wife and dog again slept calmly. The witness also heard the<br>strange voice the next night.<br><br>Location. Capilla del Monte, Cordoba, Argentina<br>Date: January 14 2004 Time: 2230<br>A 14-year old boy, Juan Pablo, was standing in his garden when<br>suddenly he spotted a short humanoid, wearing a red jumpsuit,<br>red cap and carrying a staff, walking along the Avenida Las<br>Gemelas towards a place called "Aguas de los Palos". The lighted<br>road allowed Juan Pablo to observe as the short figure briskly<br>walked away and disappeared from sight. The witness became<br>afraid and ran into his home.</div>
