            <div class='col-md body'><br>Opps, what I recommended was rape in your country, sorry. I'm not Singaporean so I didn't know but I found it here:<br><br>"Section 375 of the Penal Code states<br><br>'A man is said to commit 'rape' who, except in the case hereinafter, has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the five following descriptions:<br><br>a) against her will;<br><br>b) without her consent;<br><br>c) with her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her in fear of death or hurt;<br><br>d) with her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband, and her consent is given because she believes herself to be lawfully married or to whom she would consent;<br><br>e) with or without consent, when she is under fourteen (14) years of age.'"<br><br>http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaSingapore.asp<br><br>* I guess that would be section D. Well anyhow it is just advice and you still haven't done anything yet, I think.<br><br></div>
