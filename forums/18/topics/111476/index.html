            <div class='col-md body'>WINNER # 1<br><br>Dear MJ,<br>My name is Ashley Edwards, I'm 18 years old fixing to be 19 November 22nd, I'm a sexy b|tch, but I need bre@sts! What I've got now just ain't cuttin' it. My friends tease me by saying things like "Excuse me little girl, the middle school is that way" or "Hey, nice going A cup." It's humiliating. When I go jogging, the guys don't stare because my bre@sts aren't big enough to flop all over the place. I want the boys to drool. I want boobs so big that when I run they hit me in the face. I've become so sensitive over the size of bo0bs that over the 6-8 months I've been stuffing my bra with abything I can find, Kleenex, rags, notebook paper, coffee filters, styrofoam peanuts, hay, sacks of marbles, and even fiberglass insulation. Nothing works and some of the other girls are starting to find out. They've been asking me a lot lately if they can borrow a tissue and they start to snicker. One time my boyfriend and I were getting frisky on the couch and he reached into my bra and pulled out a handful of Sweet &amp; Low, I was so embarrassed.  The next day at school he broke up with me because he said, "I can't be with a girl who has smaller bre@sts than I do, if I want sugar, I can go to the store." Ebert and Roper gave them 2 thumbs down. Dr. Seuss wrote, "Bigger bo0bs I wish she had. Bigger bo0bs would make me glad. Bigger bo0bs for me to hold and squeeze. Bigger b0obs to look at while she's on her knees." These are just a few of the instances I've had over the years. If I had new, bigger, firmer, bouncier bre@sts, I would show them off and shake my new milkers for everyone, including my friends who made fun of me. I would run right up to them and shake my new skin pillows all in their faces. As I said before, I'm a hot piece of ass, new bre@sts would only double my "nail-ability." It would also make up for all the embarrassing moments I've endured over the years.</div>
