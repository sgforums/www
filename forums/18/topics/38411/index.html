            <div class='col-md body'>The Saturday night was a boring one for Kim. He had lived a life of misery, and the life that he lead, had make him independence. In fact, too independent. His family bounded his freedom when he was 13, the age when all his other friends are having the happiest moment of their life. He was forbid to go out at night, he was forbid to chat on the phone for more than 5 minutes, regardless itÂ’s a boy or girl, he was forbid to had a thinking of his own. For he only do what his parent wanted him to.<br><br>Finally, on his 15th birthday, he made a promise to himself. He would fight for freedom, and break free from the chain that entangles him. He wanted a free live, no one to bother him, no one to let him bother. Therefore, he went about doing it his ways. He stayed out late, with friends, chatting. He skips classes, just to go window-shopping, alone. He ignore all warning from his parents, he do not care a damn about them. The resentment slowly builds up as his parents tried to tied him down again. However, it was not long after that, his parent realized that there is no point in grounding him anymore, as he is already 16.<br><br>This was the time when he got to know a girl, named Yvonne, through his friends. They held on fast, and chat on the phone every night, before they went to bed. And it was the first time that someone ever said that he was not that bad looking. For Kim, this is more than a compliment.<br><br>Yvonne was the girl-next-door type who will make heads turn. She is not pretty, but she had in her a kind of feminine touch that would make any guy want to protect her. And Kim could not escape this enchantment too. Two weeks after they knew each other, Kim gather the courage to pop out this question that is for Yvonne.<br><br>Â“ I guessÂ…ermÂ…I kinda like yaÂ…Â”<br><br>The phone at the other side was dead quiet.<br><br>Â“ I was wondering if Â…wellÂ…u would accept me more than just a friend.Â” Kim continues.<br><br>Yvonne pauses for a moment, and replied Â“ But IÂ’m really busy, I guess I donÂ’t really have the time to commit in a relationshipÂ…reallyÂ…Â”<br><br>The truth is that she is afraid, due to her pass romance, which her previous boyfriend went steady with her just to win a bet with his friends.<br><br>Kim, on hearing such reply, do not know what to say anymoreÂ…. it is his first time after all. Â“ Oh well, I understand. I guess IÂ’m tiredÂ…good night.Â”<br><br>And that particular Â‘good nightÂ’ lasted for 6 whole months. He kept himself busy working, day and night, just to put the thought of Yvonne off his mind. But the more he told himself to forget her, the more he think of the time they had together, although is was a short 2 weeks. Than one afternoon, while he was working, he felt very lonely, for the first time in his 6 months.<br></div>
