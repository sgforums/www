Locals are now being asked not to marry foreign spouses due to the difficulties they have in getting residency visas.<br>........<br>........<br>........<br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Many Bengali nationals who came to Malaysia on three-year contracts in the past found a rich niche of local Malay and Indian girls who were ready to marry them. One reason was looks. "Oh my God! Some of the Bengali's are so handsome, they look like Shah Rukh Khan or Amir Khan [Indian movie stars]," said a young Malay woman working in the Ministry of Education.</span></span><br><br>Mirana Manap insisted that she would have married her Bengali boyfriend if the authorities had not refused them the permission to be married. They contacted a local agency for their marriage registration, but the officials were adamant and refused to entertain them. They were told to leave the country if they married.<br><br>"I wonder where is the right of females in this country?" asked a disgusted Mirana. Basically, Malaysian authorities have failed to understand how their society works. They seem to have overlooked the major problems faced by "imported spouses," mostly women from Singapore, Indonesia or Thailand and India.<br>......<br>......<br>Malaysian females are treated differently. They are grossly discouraged from marrying foreigners. "This is because the policy makers fear the Malays will be overrun in numbers by foreign husbands," says Zurina. "Local women find it very difficult to have their spouse to stay in Malaysia. This shows that they are treated as second-class citizens," she added, saying that women's rights groups should join forces to fight off these challenges.<br>......<br>......<br><br></blockquote></div>
