You can call yrself C'tian and live immoral life, you can call yrself free thinker and appear very righteous. What is important is at the end of history God the judge will mete to each person according to their deeds, and assign them to their eternal destination based on their response to His disclosure of the rules He has set for the world He created. Everyone is willing to make sacrifices now for a better future. This future final judgement gives meaning to our existence- we are not amoral molecules but accountable beings who at that final day will see that there is a right and wrong, and see real justice being practiced, once and for all.<br><br></div>

But tell me frankly, haven you or any one of us here done somethings that we are not supposed to according to common sense? We  all have and sometimes, though its clear to other pple tat its wrong, we sometimes are too  clouded to see that we are wrong. For me, its like that, i gambled and lost, i know i could lose more if i gamble again but i not happy, i want to recoup so i gambled more. familiar isnt it? It wasnt until i became a christian that i found the courage and strength to face up to reality that i do have an  addiction to gambling.</div>

He and all the founders of the great and not great religions are all in line. All dead. Only Jesus rose from the dead never to die again. That is the proof of His divinity whereas all the rest were mere men. But He is the coming judge of all men. Even good, upright, religious men. Because if religion can save men then God won't have allowed His Son to be punished so man can have a chance to get right with God before its too late. Cannot say only one way? All religions teach we must do good in order to save ourselves. Only bible say our efforts are useless- only way for rebellious man to be saved is for God to do something on their behalf- Chrisitianity is simply acknowledging your inability to save yrselves and relying on Jesus. Its not really a religion cos you don;t do anything to earn favour with God. Can't believe? Can you believe Alexander the Great was a great warrior without seeing him him person? You do by the historical method of reading ancient manuscripts. If you care to check, there is more evidence for the authenticity of bible books about Jesus than any secular literature, even those of Plato, Julius Caesar etc. Then when you read the bible books you see no other way to explain the changed lives of the followers of Jesus after He rose, except that He rose. Even secular historians report the phenomenon. The great Roman empire of the day and other enemies of Jesus could not refute this phenomenon, and so Christianity spread. It is not a mystical blind belief. It is grounded in facts you can verify. There is sufficient ground to believe the deity of Jesus. You don't verify something 100% before you rely on it. If SIA has a safety record of 97%, you put 100% of yourself on the plane. Research can tell you the safety record of SIA. It is not 100%. But you trust the data enough to stake yr life on it. Same with Jesus- there is sufficient evidence to stake yr life on Him. Stakes are higher cos on Judgement day those not on His side will be kept outside of God's presence in punishment. But still people are not rushing to be saved, cos its very hard to admit you are helpless and need someone's help. So much more respectable to contribute by doing good to earn marks with God. If you are searching for Ultimate Reality- this is it. If I can help you further, message me.</div>
