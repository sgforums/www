The campaign has proved successful in Thailand and Cambodia. -- AFP<br>AFA depends mainly on volunteers for the activities it organises, from running an anonymous HIV testing centre and telephone helpline to a variety of support groups for people with HIV and Aids.<br><br>'We have been doing what we can in the past 15 years, but we are limited by resources,' Mr Wong said.<br><br>'We welcome more partners and the chance to sit and talk to the Health Ministry on expanding our role.'<br><br>He was responding to criticism levelled against AFA by Senior Minister of State for Health Dr Balaji Sadasivan, who told Tan Tock Seng Hospital doctors on Wednesday that Singapore was facing an 'alarming Aids epidemic'.<br><br>He said the 'explosion in HIV infection' affected mainly homosexuals and heterosexual men who had casual sex abroad.<br><br>He also criticised a statement on AFA's website that reads:<br><br>'Not everyone who has sex contact with an infected person will get infected.'<br><br>He said the statement was misleading and 'may actually make things worse by promoting unsafe sex'.<br><br>Pointing to a recent surge in HIV infections among gay men, he also said that AFA had failed to educate the gay community about the disease.<br><br>He urged the Commmunicable Disease Centre at Tan Tock Seng to stop relying on AFA alone, and spearhead future Aids education efforts with other community partners.<br><br>Yesterday, Mr Wong said Aids had afflicted the mainstream population in Singapore a decade ago, and was not confined to homosexuals.<br><br>'It's time the country woke up to the fact that Aids is becoming a major problem and affects everyone, not just the homosexual community.'<br><br>The majority of people with HIV and Aids are heterosexual men, but Mr Wong pointed out that cases of women with HIV more than doubled in the 1990s.<br><br>He said that everyone had a role to play and noted that the Health Ministry itself had 'shied away' from a public campaign promoting sexual abstinence and condom use, which had proven successful in countries like Thailand and Cambodia.<br><br>'We need a massive campaign to let people know that it is all right to use condoms. We need to de-link condom use from promiscuity,' he said.<br><br>Mr Wong also recommended government subsidies for HIV medication that can delay the onset of Aids. These can cost between $12,000 and $15,000 a year.<br><br>Subsidies were even more important for pregnant women, he said.<br><br>With early treatment, there is a less than 5 per cent chance of the virus being passed from mother to child, according to a KK Women's and Children's Hospital spokesman. Since 1997, 20 HIV infected babies have been born in Singapore.<br><br>Mr Wong said some people refused to get tested to find out their HIV status because they knew they could not afford the treatment.<br><br>'Subsidies can help in prevention. People will be more ready to step forward to get screened if they can get help,' he said.<br></div>

HIV is not transmitted magically only if you have sex with one girl or guy who have aids.My bf is very faithful to me and i am very faithful to him too.when we have sex,we do not need to use a condom because we trusted each other very much.If getting aids should be the one who like ONS with different girls or guys everytime.I only have one sex partner and we do not play ard outside he will scold me if i look at other guys on the streets so when i go out with him,my attention is all with him not with any other people.He helped me alot too when I am feeling down he is always there for me to lend me his shoulder.why iszit when people think of gay they started to think of aids c'mon what have you learn in school abt sex education?Did you buy your o level,diploma or degree through a mail order?I don't think i am abnormal anyway my and my bf intend to save up enough money then we both move overseas and buy a house by the beach and enjoy our life.We are both working very hard to realised our dreams.we did think of moving to canada because we can legally get married there and be ourselves.living in sg is too stress i mean for our relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">what to do I love him so it's worth it.</div>
