HIV is not transmitted magically only if you have sex with one girl or guy who have aids.My bf is very faithful to me and i am very faithful to him too.when we have sex,we do not need to use a condom because we trusted each other very much.If getting aids should be the one who like ONS with different girls or guys everytime.I only have one sex partner and we do not play ard outside he will scold me if i look at other guys on the streets so when i go out with him,my attention is all with him not with any other people.He helped me alot too when I am feeling down he is always there for me to lend me his shoulder.why iszit when people think of gay they started to think of aids c'mon what have you learn in school abt sex education?Did you buy your o level,diploma or degree through a mail order?I don't think i am abnormal anyway my and my bf intend to save up enough money then we both move overseas and buy a house by the beach and enjoy our life.We are both working very hard to realised our dreams.we did think of moving to canada because we can legally get married there and be ourselves.living in sg is too stress i mean for our relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">what to do I love him so it's worth it.</div></blockquote><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Something for you to read..</span></strong><br><br>The epidemic of HIV and AIDS has attracted much attention both within and outside the medical and scientific communities. Much of this attention comes from the many social issues related to this disease such as sexuality, drug use, and poverty. Although the scientific evidence is overwhelming and compelling that HIV is the cause of AIDS, the disease process is still not completely understood. This incomplete understanding has led some persons to make statements that AIDS is not caused by an infectious agent or is caused by a virus that is not HIV. This is not only misleading, but may have dangerous consequences. Before the discovery of HIV, evidence from epidemiologic studies involving tracing of patientsÂ’ sex partners and cases occurring in persons receiving transfusions of blood or blood clotting products had clearly indicated that the underlying cause of the condition was an infectious agent. Infection with HIV has been the sole common factor shared by AIDS cases throughout the world among men who have sex with men, transfusion recipients, persons with hemophilia, sex partners of infected persons, children born to infected women, and occupationally exposed health care workers.<br><br>The conclusion after more than 20 years of scientific research is that people, if exposed to HIV through sexual contact or injecting drug use for example, may become infected with HIV. If they become infected, most will eventually develop AIDS.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Where did HIV come from? </strong></span><br><br>The earliest known case of HIV-1 in a human was from a blood sample collected in 1959 from a man in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. (How he became infected is not known.) Genetic analysis of this blood sample suggested that HIV-1 may have stemmed from a single virus in the late 1940s or early 1950s.<br><br>We know that the virus has existed in the United States since at least the mid- to late 1970s. From 1979-1981 rare types of pneumonia, cancer, and other illnesses were being reported by doctors in Los Angeles and New York among a number of male patients who had sex with other men. These were conditions not usually found in people with healthy immune systems.<br><br>In 1982 public health officials began to use the term "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome," or AIDS, to describe the occurrences of opportunistic infections, Kaposi's sarcoma (a kind of cancer), and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in previously healthy people. Formal tracking (surveillance) of AIDS cases began that year in the United States.<br><br>In 1983, scientists discovered the virus that causes AIDS. The virus was at first named HTLV-III/LAV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus-type III/lymphadenopathy- associated virus) by an international scientific committee. This name was later changed to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).<br><br>For many years scientists theorized as to the origins of HIV and how it appeared in the human population, most believing that HIV originated in other primates. Then in 1999, an international team of researchers reported that they had discovered the origins of HIV-1, the predominant strain of HIV in the developed world. A subspecies of chimpanzees native to west equatorial Africa had been identified as the original source of the virus. The researchers believe that HIV-1 was introduced into the human population when hunters became exposed to infected blood.<br><br>For more information on this discovery, visit the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases press release at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/newsroom/releases/hivorigin.htm.<br><br></div>
