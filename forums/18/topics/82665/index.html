            <div class='col-md body'>I am writing this to complaint about one of the more popular IT training school in Singapore. I have paid for my MCSE 2003 course last November 2003 scheduled to complete by July this year.<br><br>Because of low attendance rate, the school cancelled my remaining 3 courses which I need to attend in order to sit for my MSCE exams. I need to complete my MCSE course by July due to a project I was scheduled by my boss. Now that I cannot complete my course by July due to the class cancellation, I am losing my job.<br><br>I am especially unhappy with the woman manager who was tasked to help me solve my problem. I have called her 5 times over one month and a half months about the problem. Everytime she answered my call, she told me to wait for another three/four days and she will call me back. She never did. And it was already 5 times she didn't call me back when she promised. I wanted to know if she can solve my problem, or else I want to refund the remaining 3 courses (about S$2K!) and take the classes at another school which has confirmed classes. She just refused to call me back and kept me waiting for over one month.<br><br>As the Sales executive who was handling my account has left the company, the manager took over my account from her exec. Therefore, she is expected to help me solve this problem. When I paid for the course, I was given a confirmed class schedule from the school in November, which I gave it to my boss so that he could schedule me for a very important project in August after completing my training.<br><br>Today, she was supposed to call back to let me know if the courses will resume or not. I have told her when I called her last Friday that it was the last time I will believe in her to wait for her call. She didn't call again! I have told her that if the courses cannot resume, I want to cancel the courses and refund back my money. She said that today she will call me to confirm my courses and said that the courses will start in July. Well, she refused to call me back again.<br><br>For your info, the woman manager is from New Horizons Computer Training school.</div>
