            <div class='col-md body'>I have been stationed in China for almost a year now. And I miss Singapore Girls! I think the girls here in china are very practical and materialistic even for the common girls. I think it is the culture and the tradition that brought them up to be money minded. It is a practice here in china that if you dont make money, dont go home. Its so cruel here in china. Thus, china girls has become cruel and money minded. Singapore girls are so gentle, kind, caring and most importantly loving! You guys in singapore are so lucky to have good girls in singapore. As for me, I guess i have to keep my love to myself until i come back to singapore and give it to a singapore girl who is willing to give the same love to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>where in china r u staying now?<br><br>anyway, can't really blame the china girls lah. they used to be in the communism era where everybody earns the same amt of small salary.<br><br>but capitalism starts pouring into their country and all of the sudden, almost everybody starts having materialistic dreams.<br><br>guys either go into illegal trade or resort to bribery/corruption if they're working in the govt sector.<br><br>gals wud go into prostitution. in china, they're this saying: "xiao qiong bu xiao chang". in english, it means ppl despise u for being poor, but will not despise u being in prostitution.<br><br>when i was in the rural countryside of china, there's this farmer who is working in the fields wif his hoe. then his neighbour shouted to him that his wife has gave birth. he asked out loud if it's a baby boy or a baby girl?<br><br>his neighbour replied him that it was a baby boy. the farmer juz say, "oh ok" and went back to his work.<br><br>i was puzzled... why did the farmer ask this question in the first place? he learned it was a baby boy and i expected him to rush back to his house and take a look at his newborn son.<br><br>but my friend gave me another scenario, if the baby was a girl, the farmer wud then rush back to his house and celebrate. and he will take good care of his daughter to see her reach her adulthood.<br><br>i think u shud know why.</div>

Its very cold in some parts of china and most of them wear very thick clothes. Thats why its not neccessary to shave hair, not just armpit <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
