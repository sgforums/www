            <div class='col-md body'>Now im sure many of u have read about the accident in Perth which has killed 2 female students?<br><br>It is really sad, and i just found out that they were both friends of a friend of mine. Now the thing is, the driver, one of the gal's bf, was drag racing other cars, and he lost control...<br><br>How often have we heard of such tradegies? of lives wasted due to such idioticy? Yet it never drives home any messages... never helps prevent yet another tragedy from happening.<br>The message which should be getting across, which so many are too pig headed, brainless and #^!&amp;ing stupid to get is:<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>ILLEGAL STREET RACING IS A NO NO!</strong></span><br><br>How many people have ever considered the consequences of street racing? Do they realise how immature, how #^!&amp;ing stupid it is? If u want to race, bring it to the track! If u can't afford to go to the track, then forget it! To race on the streets because "I can't afford track fees" is akin to saying I stole an ice cream because I can't afford one. Not eating an ice cream ain't gonna kill ya, not being able to race won't either.<br><br>Futhermore, how many of u street racers have the real skills anyway? If u were so good, people would have been clamouring to sponser u for pro racing. Stop kidding yourselves and accept that you're all just wannabes... The differences between a real racer, and a wannabe, is that the pro has a good idea and awareness of the inherent dangers of racing, and a good sense of racing resposibility. If u can't hack it, get away from the steering wheel... trying to prove you've got balls by not having the balls to resist doing something totally on the same intelligence scale as shooting yourself in the head is a total irony... learn to think with your brains not balls... god gave humans brains for a reason... learn to use it...<br><br>For all u car lovers here, but who are mostly law abiding citizens, im sure u all agree with me... im sure we all hate to see things like this happening as well... it is the minority of the idiots who think they are better than Michael Schumacher who are the dangers to us, to every innocent road user...<br><br>I'm sure everyone of us has been tempted at one time or another to just indulge in racing someone on the road, but common sense has prevailed most of the time... its human nature to want to best the other guy, but if we think about it, how do we lose out in any way if we refuse to race? Is it embaressing to be able to think properly with our heads? I urge everyone to help me spread this message, to urge speed freaks to bring their racing onto tracks... because one death due to their reckless actions, one death due to their irresposibility, their stupidity, IS <span style="color: red;"><strong>ONE DEATH TOO MUCH.</strong></span> The next time, the girl who <span style="color: red;"><strong>BURNS TO DEATH</strong></span> may be our friend, our cousin, our sister. Who can know, who can tell. She may not even be involved in the race, but just happen to be in another car which the reckless asshole hits. This kind of sob stories have got to be stopped.<br><br>And it has to stop now.<br></div>
