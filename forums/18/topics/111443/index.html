            <div class='col-md body'>hmm....get to really know her before you say you love her. I know love is a feeling, but how can you love a person if all you have seen is her good side in 5 days? And let me remind you: nobody is perfect. Right now she might seem cute and adorable and all that, but wait a little longer and the flaws will surface. I am not being pessimistic, but only when the not-so-perfect parts come out can you truly judge whether you can accept her as she is or not.<br><br>right now, dun worry too much abt what she says. Just be really careful, if she is trying to go overboard with your money and stuff like dat, just say no.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
