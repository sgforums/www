Dun girls like orgasm more? How come she dun wan a second time?<br><br>I agree that penetrative sex is much more tedious than oral to make her cum...<br><br>Cheers<br>FM<br><br></div>

Dun girls like orgasm more? How come she dun wan a second time?<br><br>I agree that penetrative sex is much more tedious than oral to make her cum...<br><br>Cheers<br>FM<br><br></div></blockquote>if ur sex partner is "dirty" no matter what kinda sex u do with her oso got chance to get transmitted la</div>
