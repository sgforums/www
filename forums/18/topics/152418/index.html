But like the clergy, they sometimes give in to their baser human instincts.<br><br>Such may have been the case for Mayumi Taniguchi, a 47-year-old Nagoya home tutor, who has been charged with violation of a local ordinance aimed at protecting minors from sexual abuse. Police allege that in February 2004, Taniguchi engaged in sex with a male pupil who was then in his third year of middle school.<br><br>Shukan Jitsuwa (9/15) reports her indiscretion came to light when the boy's mother consulted with the police. Under questioning, Taniguchi admitted that after their first tryst at a love hotel, the two had conducted a three-month affair. At the time, she was living with her second husband, a man five years her junior. Her first spouse was also reportedly several years younger.<br><br>Does this not show a pattern?<br><br>"She's not a brassy type, or what you could call especially beautiful, but she always carried an expensive designer brand handbag," says a resident of the complex where Taniguchi lives. "There were few restraints on her life; I wonder what got into her to do something like that."<br><br>If found guilty, Taniguchi faces up to two years imprisonment or a fine of up to 1 million yen.<br><br>"It was a first violation, and it's possible the victim might not press charges," says a local reporter. "In that case, she'll probably just be let off with a fine, maybe 200,000 yen."<br><br>According to official data, 148 teachers were punished for engaging in obscene acts. While most were male teachers who preyed on their female wards, Shukan Jitsuwa suggests the reverse phenomenon may be more widespread than many realize. One case involved a 32-year-old female teacher at a high school in Mie Prefecture, who was summarily dismissed for seducing a student.<br><br>Encouraged by a pledge of full confidentiality, several female teachers agreed to discuss their own situations at school.<br><br>"I'm not trying to justify such behavior or make excuses," says one, a teacher at a public middle school in Tokyo. "But it's easy to start feeling attracted to them. Today's boys grow up fast, and I can feel them undressing me with their eyes.<br><br>"Teachers these days are really overworked," she continues, "and the more serious and dedicated the person, the less time she will have for herself. In many cases we have to work on weekends, so have little time for dating or socializing. As the stress builds up, some women feel a strong sexual urge. And at schools full of young guys, they are surrounded by temptations."<br><br>"When fatigued, I feel beset by all sorts of urges, and to be honest, those young guys appeal to me more than the male teachers at the school," admits an attractive math teacher at a Kanagawa prefectural high school<br><br>Teachers who give one-on-one lessons in such disciplines as music, art or home economics seem to be in the best position to milk the situation to their advantage. One, a piano teacher in her 30s, admits to getting a perverse thrill out of teasing adolescent boys.<br><br>"Many are hoping to apply to music schools," she says. "During a private lesson, while they're sitting on the stool, I will 'accidentally' nudge their shoulder with my breast, and I see them stiffen --- in more places than one," she winks. "Watching how they react, and then thinking about it later, really turns me on." (By Masuo Kamiyama, contributing writer).<br><br>September 8, 2005<br><br></div>
