I want my own Singaporeans to comment about this.<br><br>Thank you very much <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>PS:Scottish Beef don't post again </div></blockquote>(I didn't see it was locked, but i wanted to get my views across, seeing as i didn't get a chance to reply.)<br><br>Grouchy? No.<br><br>Annoyed by useless threads that seem to come along every week or so that bashes one ethnicity vs another purely because of a small sample of what has been seen in a particular club/clubs? Yes.<br><br>Seriously. There are so many different permutations and selections of different variables around this country that lead to ill-informed judgments and statements.<br><br>White-woman's coochie? Please. If that's the only reason you're going after a girl, then you have some serious growing up to do. If someone verbally attacks my country of birth, or the country which i call home, you can be damned sure that i'll be the first in there to defend it, but i'm not going to stick up for caucasian women purely because their 'coochie' is surrounded by whiter skin.<br><br>"seeing a Singaporean Indian guy getting a Singaporean Chinese makes a Chinese guy like me a little insecure."<br><br>You should probably rephrase that as, "Makes a little chinese guy like me insecure". What kind of person feels threatened by seeing others having a good time?<br><br>Why not stock up on roofies or something, because i'm sure that with your attitude, it may be one of the only ways for you to handle some of the girls you lust after.<br><br>Everyone has a preference. I know I do, but it's not for a race, it's for leggy brunettes, who can hold a decent conversation.<br><br>I'm not going to avoid/be attracted to a certain race purely because they are a slightly more chocolate shade than the official Dulux Colour chart than I'd prefer, or have a skin tone that's somewhere between Morning Magnolia, and Beach-at-Sunset Taupe.<br><br>Get a grip.<br><br>As for not posting again, the day that you come to my house, and start paying for my internet access/subscription, THEN you have the right to say whether i can come back here or not. Until then, cry me a freaking river, build a bridge, and get over it.</div>
