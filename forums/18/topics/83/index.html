            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man I dont know who you are but if what you are telling is true...well i can only say I understand how you feel..Im not out here to insult you or what so don't worry. To be honest I plunged into the pit of love when I was in J1. Had the mentality in me that i was in JC so i shouldnt be like secondary days whereby getting a stead was juz a cheap trill n something tpo brag about. Well i kinda fell in love with this gal in J1. She was realy pretty n guess that was what attracted me. i decided to chase her n so i suceeded. to b honest i was a bastard cos my best friend was in love with her...bt anyway... gg out with her i was kinda proud cos she was really q attractive..bt looks aside her character n temper was atrocious! she was extremely possesive of me n mt the other way round. she would delete all my gal phone numbers in my hp when i was asleep, call my friends to stop calling me, did not allow me to go cheong, i was not to fetch anyone other than her...etc...but for the sake of 'love' i changed to meet her expectations..i said sorry each and everytime(serious) cos it takes two to argue and if i juz say sorry there would b noting to argue i guess...neway after two years plus we broke up..she suggested it and i agreed. i couldnt take it anymore, i felt liked a caged bird!i craved for the freedom and the friends and popularity i once had.. but she really struck me with one phrase b4 we broke up.she said i never change. God damn it i tried like hell to change n i realy did, n nw the pots calling the kettle black! go try restricting another guy from gg out 24/7 n see if he tries to sneak out anot. well i did not n i was bloody faithful for 2yrs plus. Hey im not some ugly unwanted guy k n i dont have to put up with this shit she gave. well guess when u find true love u should cherish, n when its time to go its time to go....sad as it may seem....<br>but guess god is fair, after my breakup with my ex i took a half year break n enjoyed bein single..got back my friends n etc.... till sometime back i met a gal that i fell in love with...yes love and not 'love'.. im am happy now as she is everything yr sayang is n even better...but thats my opinion only..<br>if the old dosent go the new dosent come...of course when you have found the rite one hang on to it.. if u realy like yr sayang then try as hard as u can to chase her back..dont juz channel all yr energy in to  crying... use it to stop yr tears frm flowing by bringin her bk...<br></div>
