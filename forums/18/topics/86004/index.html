            <div class='col-md body'>I may seem too young to give you advice... But i think you should just follow your heart cos it is what I think you should do... If you think that waiting for her is worth it and that you really like her that much... Just do it.<br><br>But let me tell you something about decisions made in relationships... Do not get your hopes too high... When things do not go right in relationships... It will eat up your heart if you are really put too much effort in it... Relationships are not like other things where you will most likely reap gains if you put in effort... do things with an open mind... And do not expect anything in return...

Yes you want a normal life, but she may not, but you don't care. If you love someone, you have to embrace what she loves. You got to be a bigger man here. Or else she will leave you no matter what. Because both of you want different things in life, and you alone have never thought about compromising. At least she still try to balance between you and her dreams, and you? You only care about yourself.</div></blockquote>Thanks,i know.<br>You're right in the 2nd paragraph<br>Wrong ,I do love her very much!<br>But in different ways,maybe a wrong way. Cos she kept complaining and stressed on her part time jobs because of politics...i also worry that she will have more politics in entainment life. I don't want her to suffer. Maybe i try to get her back,let her try then see.<br>If can't get her back i also no choice.at least i've to regain,no regrets...</div>

Love is not just about feelings, is about belief, is about strength, is about will, is about commitment, is about compromise, and....love is a choice.</div>
