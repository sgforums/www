Many Fashion magazines like Herworld*, GQ*, Cleo* editors had interviewed the couple and is writing articles on them, some well success companies contribute congrat messages through the newspaper. Almost everyone in IT / Advertising industries had come to know about this major event. They had invited almost all the well-established companies CEOs and Top executives to attend the dinner with nice cocktail party with red wines and declicious finger foods before the actual dinner.<br><br>When everybody had seated in their own seats, there is this nice Flash movie with photos and videos showing how this wonderful couple had started knowing each other to the courtship. The bride is extremely beautiful; the groom is very good looking. Everyone thinks that this couple is the most perfect match from heaven.Light suddenly grew dim, background music is playing nice jazz song by Laura Fygi, Â“I love you for sentimental reasonsÂ” just when the movie is about to come to an end showing the couple was waving at everyone on the bike, everyone can hear the sound of loud exhaust of Harley Davidson from a distance and witness the beautiful couple riding the same bike in the movie into the hall with nice Vera wang* wedding gown and suit. Everyone were stunned by the opening of this wedding dinner.They rode the bike up to the stage besides the wedding cake with class 95 FM DJ as their MC for the night. When both were cutting the wedding cake, all the servers in the Hall serve the guests with a slice of Mango cake from popular four seasons Hotel and also an exculsive hard cover book consist of a cd of the flash and photographs of the newly wed couple.<br><br>The dinner went smoothly, everyone is busy eating.<br><br>While everyone is eating their third dish from the 12 dishes menu, the groom suddenly walks up the stage and greets everybody.<br><br>Â“HelloÂ” he speak same time he loosen up his tie,<br><br>Â“Right, good evening everybody and welcome to my wedding dinnerÂ” he smile to all the guests.<br><br>Â“Today yup today is my big day, and so, I got a very big surprise for you to let you show my sincerety and appreciation of everyone presence. And also to let you guys know how great you are for making my wedding a wonderful wedding.Â”<br><br>He continued, Â“Now everyone of you, I urge for your kind attention, please look underneath your chair you will see an envelope inside consist of somethingÂ”<br><br>Â“You might be the $1000 winner or the one that will go home with a car DVD system. Come on all of you look stop eating for a while and look for the envelope it is just underneath your chair, every one of you definitely have this white envelope if not raise up your handÂ” he laughed.<br><br>Imagine the whole hall, all the guests are busy fodgeting looking for the envelope underneath their chairs and found one. That includes the parents of the bride and groom, bridemaid and the bestman. You can hear some of them even jokingly shouted Â“Is me Is me I think I got the $1000!Â”<br><br>The groom took out a cigeratte and lighted infront of all his guests, while puffing out he continue to speak through the mic when some of them had opened envelopes and went speechless.<br><br>He took off his glasses, and speaks softly to the crowd.<br><br>Â“Im sure by now, you guys are r-e-action-less Â“<br><br>Â“Yup every one of you has the same photo inside the envelopeÂ”<br><br>Â“I guess the winner is still my BEST MAN, and of course, my wife to be.Â”<br><br>There are loud noises, some of the crowds trying to stand up to look at the bride, and the best man while there are whispering and gossiping across the dining table.<br><br>It was a photo of the bride and the best man making love inside a house.<br><br>Â“Shall I invite the bride and the best man up to the stage?Â” He looked at them when he was saying it out.<br><br>Â“Bro, I know you for twenty years, I was there for you all times when you needed help. I trusted you with all my heart and soul and you actually betrayed me.Â”<br><br>Â“Dear, since the day I know you, I was madly in love with you. Never did I stop caring for you, never did I stop loving you yet, of all people when I gave you my world, this is how you repay me.Â”<br><br>He was tearing all this while when he was saying this out.<br><br>Â“The photo was taken at our new home. The webcam supposed to spy on the maid but while testing out the camera, this is what that came out. For the past 10 months IÂ’ve been suffering from this betrayal act.Â”<br><br>Â“Sorry dad, mum, I think I decided.Â”<br><br>Â“Ladies and Gentlemen, may I offically declare this marriage is offÂ”<br><br>He walked down the stage slowly and was walking near to the hall exit, He look back and bow at everyone and walk out the hall. Never was he found again.<br><br>- The End -<br><br></div>
