As for the radio system, I have changed it to a blaupunkt woodstock series as I like to play MP3 in my car. The lift to right , rpm, and speed. On top is the Temperature and fuel tank. This is a typical rally car style display which you can also see it in VW cars.<br><br>lighting of the speedo meter is white in color and there is a swtch on the right side, next to the head light switch were you can dim the light. under the front passenger sit, there are compartment where you can put your firstaid kit pr tissue box.<br><br>I think audi is a bloody good car, with excellent interior quality. only thing I dislike it servicing at premium auto ubi service centre.
