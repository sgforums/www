I hate picasso, I like impressionism, but the question is, can you? I can even talk my industry on technical level or simple general levels, but are you interested. I can even psychoanalyse people and even my family, but do you want to hear that. And I like anime and such things, but do guys find it kiddish. Mostly, I talk about safe topics and make things easy for the guys so that they don't break down and cry for the lack of topics and awkward silences they have to endure.<br></div>
