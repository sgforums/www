            <div class='col-md body'>Armed robbers steal 'The Scream'<br>Monday, August 23, 2004 Posted: 1:42 AM EDT (0542 GMT)<br>OSLO, Norway (CNN) -- Armed robbers have stolen two classic paintings by Edvard Munch, including "The Scream," in a brazen daytime heist in Oslo.<br><br>The picture frames were later found in another part of the city with the pictures cut out. Authorities have found the getaway car and are using video footage of Sunday's robbery in an effort to track down the thieves, police said.<br><br>"They knew exactly where the paintings were and took them down from the wall," said Jorunn Christophersen, head of information for the Munch Museum.<br><br>The masked thieves also stole Munch's "Madonna," which shows a mysterious bare-breasted woman with flowing black hair.<br><br>The paintings -- which Munch painted as part of a series about love, fear and death -- are said to be worth millions of dollars.<br><br>"They are our most valuable paintings," Christophersen said.<br><br>"The Scream" is one of the most famous paintings in the world. Munch painted four versions, the first in 1893.<br><br>The best-known version was stolen from Oslo's National Art Museum 10 years ago. It was recovered three months later after thieves failed to extract a ransom for its return.<br><br>Sunday's theft from took guards and patrons by surprise.<br><br>An eyewitness said one man dressed in black rushed towards the "Madonna" painting, "grabbed that off the wall and then started banging it against the wall and against the ground because the gray strings weren't breaking off for him."<br><br>"He then saw 'The Scream', ran towards that and grabbed that off the wall and then he started rushing out the front and we started rushing out the back."<br><br>"The Scream" was attached to the wall by wires, witnesses said, noting that no alarm bell could be heard when the painting was taken. They also said guards did not prevent the robbers from fleeing with the paintings.<br><br>At a news conference, government officials expressed outrage that the paintings were not more carefully protected.<br><br>But Christophersen said an alarm did go off after the paintings were pulled off the wall. She also said the paintings were "stuck to the wall with solid screws." The robbers "used force in taking the Munch (paintings) away," she said.<br><br>Christophersen also said the robbers threatened the guards with guns as they headed to their getaway car.<br><br>Munch lived from 1863 to 1944 and was a pioneer of modern expressionism.<br><br>Journalist Erlend Fernandez Stedding and CNN's Glenn van Zutphen contributed to this report.<br><img src="http://pic16.picturetrail.com/VOL701/2898363/5850058/79870189.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>At least it proves that people do not just talk about 5Cs and shallow stuff.<br>There are people of quality.<br><br>I am impartial to most art forms although I cannot understand or appreciate abstract especially picasso during his later phases.  If anyone wants to explain abstract art, please tell me why people like it. I like certain pieces from certain artists although I don't really go study deeply. Few nights ago, there was this couple of documentaries on Leonardo da Vinci and Manet. I like Flaming June and  William Bouguereau's. But it all a visual pleasure and every artist brings something different to the pieces. I initially got interested beacuse of amusic teacher who got us to sing starry starry night and told us the story of Vincent. Then I got interested. I think I have my own understanding of what looks good and what does not.. so same goes for fashion. So it depends. To me even anime is an art form.<br></div>

Be careful to take out the bladder and try not to spill urine. . Deer urine is very strong.<br><br>When you have cut to the breastbone, reach inside the lower body cavity, pull out the rectum and remove it. Then and cut the tissue that holds the organs and intestines in place.<br><br>Roll the buck onto the other side and do the same thing. Roll the deer over so the cut faces downhill<br><br>Reach inside the body cavity and around the paunch and make sure all the tissue is cut away from the backbone. Then turn the deer so the cut faces downhill and pull out all the innards. Do not try to take the innards out piecemeal as there is too much of a chance of spilling bile and intestinal juices which will reall foul up the taste.<br><br>Save the liver; it is delicious.<br><br>http://huntingsociety.org/FieldDressing.html<br><br></div>
