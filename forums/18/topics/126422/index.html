Totally agreed with you and I would like to add one more thing why don't our government donate $2 to every $1 being donated ? Wouldn't that be better ?<br>We all see when the host ask for the LIVE AUDIENCE to donate , we can always see alot of people SMS when the camera are focussing at them especially the MPs . Do you think they are really making a donation SMS or perharps sms by pressing the phone just for a show ? well no comments on this it's up to them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) If the prize is $500 worth but they can get 1000 ppl to donate and  they get 50,000. more over the $500 is sponser by company.<br><br>2) those vouchers with discount coupon given to all whome made at least 1 donation of $5, they actually done a calulation of <span style="color: red;">how many will actually use the vochers</span>. Don't forget its only a discount of 15% - 20% after a purchase of maybe say above $50 dollars.<br><br>3) those company that participate in the discount coupon actually take this advantage to advertise their company.<br><br>4) Condo is sponser by other company, condo actually attract how much donation, I believe they get back alot more money then the condo worth.<br><br>No choice lah, if not for this above coupons, condo and just base on our heart to donate , how much can they collect?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gloria Estefan:</div><div class="quote_body">There are alot of charity shows going on every year asking for donations .<br>Do the people who donates really donates from the heart or for the sake of prize ?<br>The show even got some prizes that worth up to abt $500 if you make a certain number of calls and it's definately worth the callers because they could be calling only $50 - $100 but they can get vouchers of 10 or 5 times the calls they made .<br>Even Condos were given out and many attractive prizes to be won like cars etc....Let's say if there are no prizes given out AT ALL , do you people think the singaporeans will donate ?<br>For me , I never donate or make any calls because of prizes . I just think that's simply pathetic . But I do make regular donations to SPCA every month through internet transfer though I don't get any prizes at all but I do feel very happy just being able to help the poor puppies and animals  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Hmm.. and I tot I'm e only who feels happy donating to SPCA more than to human ones..kezkez...nice to hear that ur also one of them.. cox I also feel that charity shows asking for doughs to help humans that have so many humans to help them out in crisis.. but do those poor animals have humans to help out? Very little...what is most important is that one feels happy bout donating freely and not asking for anything in return..tats e real spririt of donation</div>
