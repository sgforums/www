            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Azman was elated! After three years at his workplace with the large corporation, for which he worked, he had just been chosen to spend the next three years with their American branch in Houston, Texas. His boss and co-workers showered him with congratulations. "It's an indication that you're doing well in our company," his boss told him. "You're only the second employee that has ever been given this opportunity, and we know you'll do well," he had been told.<br><br>It was with mixed emotions that Azman told his wife that evening that he would be leaving at the end of the week for three years in the US. What concerned him most was his wife, Azizah. She was pregnant and expecting a child next month. He felt very sorry that he wouldn't be there to welcome it into the world, he told her that night, but it was the chance of a lifetime for he and his family. "I asked if going couldn't be delayed until after our child is born, but they said I must go now or they would have to choose someone else. It means a big promotion for me," he told her "if I can impress the senior executives in the American branch, then come home and show them how much I learned while there. They also said that you could join me when the baby is old enough to travel. Perhaps we will even be able to afford a better home for our parents when we come back."<br><br>Reluctantly Azizah agreed. It was indeed the opportunity of a lifetime. She wanted very much to be with Azman, but her doctor had told her she could not travel this late in her pregnancy. He had also told her that she would have twins, although she hadn't told Azman that bit of news yet. She held it back, biting her lip. This was not the time to cause more commotion in their lives.<br><br>So, on Friday of that same week, Azizah fought back tears as she saw Azman wave to her from the security checkpoint at the airport. They had not been separated since their wedding, and she knew she would miss him greatly. Despite his misgivings about leaving Azizah behind at least temporarily, he looked forward to this great adventure. He said a silent prayer for her health as he felt the enormous Singapore Airlines 747 jet lurch forward, engines roaring.<br><br>Fourteen hours later, he had only time enough to get from the international terminal in Los Angeles, through customs, to the terminal where domestic flights departed for points all over the USA. He was hot, tired, and very sleepy despite the short naps on board the airliner, longing for a hot shower. He was also thankful that his parents had insisted that he study English in school. Without that knowledge, and his own determination to improve his language skills, he thought it would be almost impossible to make his way around the enormous airport. He smiled when he thought of how he had seen western tourists wander aimlessly through the terminal at Kuala Lumpur. Although there were signs in English, Chines, Japanese and other languages, it was still a mystifying maze for many people who did not travel internationally.<br><br>Six hours later he stepped into the lounge of the airport in Houston. Fatigue and the loss of an entire day had robbed him of any interest in anything other than a bed and a hot shower. From the lounge he walked what seemed like a great distance to the baggage area. He was still waiting for his baggage to arrive on the carousel when he saw his name on a signboard held aloft by a tall man dressed in a suit. He approached the man who, on seeing him asked if he was Azman. An affirmative reply was met with a handshake and an introduction to the stranger.<br><br>"I'm Earl," he was told. "My boss said I should meet you here and take you home. I'm your sponsor for the next three years. You'll be living with me and my wife, Ting. We're very happy to have you as our guest. I haven't been told much about you and your family, so we have a lot of talking to do after you've had a chance to rest and relax after such a long flight."<br><br>Earl helped him retrieve his baggage then led him outside to a limousine with the corporation's name embossed on the door. "Nothing like traveling in comfort for a while," Earl said as he pushed Azman's baggage into the trunk. "Just don't get too used to it, the rest of the time you'll be riding around in my old beat up Toyota unless the company gives you a car while you're here."<br><br>Azman was only too happy to slide into the air-conditioned interior of the limo. He sighed with weariness as he settled back into the deep cushioned seat.<br><br>"It's about an hour drive to our house," Earl told his companion. "So, just relax and look at the scenery, such as it is. A little different from Malaya I would guess."<br><br>"Very much so," Azman nodded with a smile. "I was expecting to see horses and cows since I was in Texas."<br><br>Earl laughed. "We don't get many of them in the city these days. Although you don't have to go far to see them. We're about twenty miles from the center of town, but there'll be time for you to see that on Monday when we go into the office." Azman saw the highway opening wide in front of them as they took what Earl described as the beltway around the city. He was surprised at the many hectares of open terrain covered with trees and brush as they passed through a mixed area of commercial and private properties. Despite his weariness he had many questions, all answered easily by his companion. Too soon, it seemed like they were back on city streets, then in an area that seemed to be entirely residential.<br><br>The limousine halted in front of a house that seemed very large to Azman who asked how many lived there.<br><br>"Just Ting and I," Earl laughed. "We don't have any children, so there's always room for one more. Ting will be glad to see you. She's Asian too, from China, but that's many years past."<br><br>As Earl and Azman got his luggage from the sedan, Azman was surprised to see a tall Asian lady in a sapphire blue cheong sam standing in the doorway of the house, a wide smile on her face.<br><br>"Hi, Ting," Earl called out to her. "Here he is, all the way from Malaya." Almost unnecessarily, he then said, "Azman, this is my wife, Ting." Azman took the hand the lovely lady offered and held it far longer than would have been polite in his own society. He couldn't get over how much this woman looked like his wife, Azizah. The same broad smile, beautiful black hair, shining brown eyes, and full breasts that tempted him just as those of Azizah. It took a moment for him to regain his composure to the amusement of both Earl and Ting. Although only hours away from his last bedding of his wife, Azman felt the lurch of his cock. Ting was beautiful!<br><br>Earl took Azman through the house and into the wing they had reserved for their guest. A complete suite of rooms had been made ready for him and despite his curiosity he felt the pull of that large bed immediately. Earl smiled. He knew how Azman felt after such a long journey. "I leave you alone so you can unpack and settle in," he told his guest. "When you feel more refreshed, we'll have a barbecue on the patio. Please, make yourself at home."<br><br>It was six hours before Azman walked onto the patio where the smell of grilled meat and vegetables brought a surprising hunger to his mind. "Just in time for something different from airline food," Earl laughed as he handed a plate almost covered by a steak to his guest. "Help yourself," he told Azman, "from now on you'll need to do that. If we're going to be together for the next three years, you'll find the service around here really is poor." That drew a laugh from Ting who, sitting in one of the recliners was sipping a drink. She wore a bikini style swim suit that would have scandalized his neighbors back home, but she looked so lovely that Azman found it hard to tear his eyes away from her very visible body. Again he felt that lurch of his cock as she responded to the comment from her husband. "I don't provide that kind of service at all," she chuckled. "It's help yourself or forget it."<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The months went by rapidly. Even the bad news that Azizah could not join him immediately didn't overcome the good, that he was a father of two young male children. Azman was no longer the "stranger" who had found a place in Earl and Ting's home and became a fixture at the parties which were frequently held in the neighborhood. Azman felt totally immersed in the culture of this American couple who seemed to have no modesty when in their home or in the yard where a high fence provided privacy. He remembered the night when he had received the news that he was a father, an event celebrated by his host and their friends. He knew he had had too much to drink that night, but he still remembered the events that followed.<br><br>When the rest of the party had left, Earl and Ting invited him to join them in the hot tub. It was something that Azman had avoided up until then. The temptation was just too much. Both Earl and Ting insisted on using the tub without suits. Before that night, even the sight of Ting's luscious Tits through the patio door had sent Azman's cock into a spasm of delight. His lust increased with each such event. His need for sex was overcoming him. Even so, he had resisted it until that night. He blamed the excess alcohol for what followed. The day had been cool. Summer was over, fading rapidly into a pleasant fall. That night he had watched the plumes of steam from the warm water curling about his host and his wife. It had proved too much and he found himself in that hot tub modestly wearing his bathing suit until Ting, with a laugh had insisted that he must remove it. Dutch courage overcame Azman's natural modesty and he found himself pulling his trunks down, then tossing them onto the wooden deck surrounding the tub.<br><br>"Oh, look, he's really becoming bold. Maybe in a few more months we can entice him into some of our parties in the party room," Ting had said with a chuckle.<br><br>Azman had wondered about those parties. At least once a week and sometimes more often, couples of Earl and Ting's friends had gone into that room adjacent to his own. Even through walls that had been soundproofed, he could hear things which made him blush. He had fought down his inclination to join them as Ting and Earl had so often insisted he do. He had heard of such parties, even in his home in Kuala Lumpur, but had never been invited to one. Here it seemed to go on and on well into the night and sometimes even overnight until smiling couples kissed and hugged their host and hostess and gave him an amused smile as they left.<br><br>So, on the first night that Azman had joined his new family in the warm, neck-deep water he was comforted by the fact that little could be seen through the rapidly bubbling water - that is until Earl had turned off the high speed jets. The now slowly moving water had left Ting's full Breasts on display. Earl had seen the direction of his rapt attention and laughed.<br><br>"Ting, I think Azman had found something he really enjoys watching. How about it Az (the couples shortened name for their guest), like the view, or do you want Ting to cover them?" Azman swallowed hard, then nodded, "yes, yes... I mean no, don't cover them, please. They are beautiful!" That comment earned him a brief kiss on the cheek from Ting. Earl laughed as he watched his friend's face flush without ever taking his eyes off Ting's marvelous attributes. "Ting has been telling me for weeks about her plan to put you in this position," Earl admitted, still smiling. "I've told her she didn't have a ghost of a chance, but it looks like I was wrong. Show him, honey."<br><br>With that, Ting had taken both of Azman's hands and placed them on her Breasts. "There, isn't that better? I know you've been watching me, and I've encouraged it shamelessly. You've held out for much longer than some of our other friends. It must be your love for Azizah, but she isn't here and I am, so enjoy! I won't tell." With that, Ting covered both of Azman's hands with her own, grinding them into her Tits, as she sighed in pleasure.<br><br>"It's been months since you came, Az," Ting said softly. "I don't know how you've managed to go so long without sex. Earl could never go that long without some Pussy, so why should you. Remember, we told you that you have to help yourself around here, and I fully intend to do just that." With that remark, Ting dropped one hand deep into the water and curled it around Azman's cock. It had already reached full arousal and Ting's touch seemed to bring it to an even more aroused state.<br><br>"Oh," she said as her fingers closed over Azman's throbbing erection. "He's got a good one, honey," she said with a smile to her husband. "Can I use it?"<br><br>"I certainly wouldn't have any objection," Earl nodded with a smile of his own. "After all you know how I feel about things like that." He watched his wife stand in the tub, still holding Azman with one hand. Turning away from the furiously blushing Azman, she slowly lowered herself onto his lap. Azman did nothing until he felt the head of his cock push through the tight ring of muscle guarding Ting's Vagina then, with a lurch of his hips, he drove the first couple of inches into her. Earl smiled.<br><br>Ting cooed with pleasure. Wriggling her hips, she forced the swollen member deeper into her. She knew that the water would inhibit the flow of juices which would make it easier for Azman to enter her, but she was determined to take his substantial length into her, before he spewed his cum, as the delight of a new Cunt sent him to paradise. "Ah,' she sighed as she felt her ass come into contact with Azman's pubic bone. "That feels so very, very nice. Please cum in me, Az. I want to feel your cum filling me up before we get out of here and really get to enjoy each other."<br><br>Azman couldn't have prevented that even if a gun had been pointed at his head. He felt the swelling sensation in his nut bag just before that first hot jet was fired into Ting's smoldering cunt followed by at least three more. The semen that had leaked from her cunt in thick threadlike streams when the water washed their juices away soon coated his hands, wrapped tightly around Ting's Tits.<br><br>"Mmm, we need to go inside and get this cleaned up," Ting suggested, looking down at the mess the water had brought to the surface. "But you'll have to carry me. I'm not about to let this hard cock out of my Pussy. It feels too good!" By some means Azman never understood, Ting turned in his lap until she could wrap her long legs around his waist. As he stood up, Ting sighed with pleasure. "Ah, that's even deeper. I love the feeling of your cock inside me. Earl, lead us into the playpen. I have the distinct feeling that Az isn't through with me by a long shot!" Azman realized the same thing as he felt his own still swollen cock eke out another string of cum into his friend's wife.<br><br>Earl opened the door to the patio and led them down the hall to the playpen. He watched Azman lay his wife in the middle of the four-inch thick foam rubber pad covered with a cotton sheeting, underlain with soft plastic that prevented any semen from seeping through the covering and into the foam. Azman never lost his connection with her, laying her gently down, then covering her with his body, a near match in height. To his surprise however, Ting used one foot as leverage to turn their two bodies over until she was atop him.<br><br>"Just relax a moment, honey," she purred. "You've been so fascinated by these that I want to give you a chance to really taste them." With that remark, Ting slid higher on Azman's chest to place one nipple in his mouth. "Ah," she sighed, feeling his lips tighten around that swollen flesh and the suction of his mouth pulling it deeper. His teeth scraped her nipple with each inward pull, sending a tremor of pleasure through Ting's body. "That's it," she said as she used her fingers to comb Azman's hair and pressed her Breast harder against his welcoming mouth. "I knew you were a tit man from the first day I saw you. Now we're really going to have some fun!" With that said, Ting slid lower on Azman's body, pressing her swollen clit against the underside of his cock. She shuddered with pleasure, then slid upward again until she could feel the head of his swollen organ pressed tightly to her equally swollen pu_ssy lips, then enter her.<br></div>
