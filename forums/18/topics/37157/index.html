            <div class='col-md body'>Do the porn queens get to control the kind of film they want to make? Or are they sometimes actually raped for real? Though they give consent to have sex in front of the camera, sometimes the director take things too far and push them beyond what they have agreed to do in the first place.<br>Granted, this takes place in any industry, even in respectable professions such as teaching, law, medicine, etc. There are times when you allow yourself to be taken advantage of so that you can do your job properly. For most people it means working extra hours, taking on extra jobs, entertaining clients. In the porn industry, this becomes no less than rape.<br><br>Isn't there a professional code of ethics for the entertainment industry?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you enjoy having sex with men you don't even the names of, if you look gorgeous and think you are skilled in bed,  if you have an open mind and want to be seen while doing it, perhaps you would not mind being a pornstar. At least it is your choice.<br><br>But if things turned out differently from what you expected? You cannot even walk out of the doors. After all, rape is about doing things to you that you do not want, and the director will want to capture how you were forced, against you will. The moment you signed, you signed away your freedom and dignity as a human. You are reduced to a toy.<br><br>Making love is one thing. Rape is quite another.</div>
