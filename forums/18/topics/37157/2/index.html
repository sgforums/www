Maybe she knew all these will happen, and has agreed to do it, but it's still terribly demeaning. I have seen some where the acting is so fake you will laugh at them. Others seem quite real, oscar-worthy. It could be real.<br>There are lots of types of porn, this is not the kind I like. I prefer the love-making type, where both parties take turns to pleasure the other. Sure it's all acting too, but it's easier on the mind.<br></div>
