THIS IS RAPE OK!!! do u think this is the way a guy will treat his beloved??? no respect for u coz u didnt protect yourself, never thought of your feelings. i really wanna scold him... ruin all the men's reputation... i suggest that u keep a distance from this 'bf' of yours. stop going to his home or else next time all u will be meeting him will be his home and nowhere else coz he can get what he only wanted from u there. go other places and never his home. be firm kick his dick and wake him up if he do this again. what do u think he treating u as??? a machine to satisfy himself??? i think u need to ask yourself is this the kind of relationship u want. sex and nothing else seems to be on his mind. dont take into consideration of the duration u all have been together. more impt is what u want, a bf that respects u for who u are or a bf that dont treat u like a human at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yes, basically you need not even think of having sex drugs if he can solve it for you. sex, love making IS about TWO person and not only him or you. it takes both organs to cum together.<br><br>remember, no drugs also can get your O one. maybe even multiple Os if done right. get it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>i seriously think your current bf is not worth the effort anymore. he's immature, selfish and inconsiderate. i pray he'll change in the near future and discover the real pleasures of love making.<br><br>tell him to jerk himself off the next time. basically, its lust that is in him. i don't see any love in your replies about your relationship with him.<br><br>be wise</div>
