            <div class='col-md body'>wa touching story, i also have one enjoy......<br><br>True story... very sad..<br>A police officer had a beautiful daughter, who fell in love with a boy who was an ordinary poor person. When the gals father came to know about their love, he did not like it at all, and so began to protest about it. Now it happened that the two lovers left their homes for a happy future. the gals father started searching for the two lovers but they could not find them. At last, he accepted their love and asked them in a newspaper to come back.  her father said that if u both come back i will marry u wit the guy u luv, I accept that u loved each other truly. So in this way their love won and the age old attitude of the tribe took a beating. The couple went to the city to shop for the wedding.  He was wearing a white traditional dress, and was crossing the road when a car came and hit him and he died on the spot. The girl lost her senses. After a long time she recovered and accepted that her love has died. One night she was sleeping in her home with her family. Her mother had a dream in which she saw a fairy. That fairy asked her mother to wash the  blood spots of the guy from her daughter's clothes as soon as possible. But her mother ignored the dream. Next night the father saw the same dream, he also ignored it.  Then when the girl had the same dream the next night,she woke up and told her mother about the dream. Her mother asked her to wash the clothes on which there were blood spots. She washed the spots but some remained. Next night she again had the same dream she again washed the spots but some still remained. Next night she again had the same dream and this time that fairy gave her last warning to wash the blood spots, else something terrible will happen. This time the girl tried her best to wash the spots, the clothes tore, but some spots still remained. In the evening on same day when she was alone, someone knocked the door, when she opened the door she saw the fairy at the door. She got very scared and fainted. The fairy woke her up..., and gave her an object, That awe- struck girl asked "what is this..? to which the fairy replied <span class="large">"Try Dynamo Liquid Soap</span>.. juz a dap &amp; it will remove all stubborn stain"<br><br>I know what u all are feeling now... But don't look for me...
