            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br>this is my first post nice to meet u all. here's my trouble<br>I went steady wif my gf for 2 years, from the start of the relationship, she told me she was a virgin. This was something i was very happy about.i love her so much that i have distanced myself from other females.She was the ger i want to marry. It was recently that i found out that she lied to me. She had sex when she was 17.(i knew her when she was 19).I was distraughted when i was told and i forced her to admit. I cant accept the fact that she lied to me for 2 years. B4 i knew the truth, i trusted her so much<br>I have forgiven her since and she really tried to make it up for me. She is treating me better since. But that hurt of ego really take times to heal. I am now feeling troubled and cant sleep well at nite since then as i would always think of that guy having sex with my gf and i will feel damm jeolous and angry. But i still love her. I dunnoe how to stop this thinking and i am seeking help. I dunnoe whether i am posting in the rite forum but i believe the people here are mature enough to give constructive advise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Y bother she is a virgin or not? Tat was in the past. It is better than havin sex wif another guy when she is wif u rite? Mayb she is so scared tat u will mind n luv u so much, tats y she doesn't wan to tell u at first. When she feels tat its the suitable time to tell u, tat means she is stable wif ur relationship already. At least she told u, she is true to u.<br></div>

And u noe wat i did? At that time,I defended her and make it clear to my fren that she wasnt a loose ger. We nearly fought.At that point I felt confused y my fren was so confident about wat he told me. That is y i asked my gf and make her admit. I was very hurt when i heard her say:"Dear, i am sorry"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>The way i got to noe the truth was really cruel.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, reallieRAW was rite.<br><br>Virgin or not, does it really matter ? It's 2002 ppl do sports for recreation, it may also break the virginity, what the hell. It's the girl ur girlfriend is that you love and cherish rite ? What's the hymen of the organ need to do with that ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Friend, sometimes in life, loving someone include loving everything about her, personality, mentally, the heart and physically. Most of all , loving her weakness and imcomplete development of personality where u two will live n love to complete it. Sometimes it would be a sweet and nice thing to look at your gf's weakness as a concept where in this world "Nobody is perfect"<br><br>Give yourself some time off, go to a calm place, a garden or beach, just sat there and think, what really matter ? My love for her or my complain on her non virginity ?  Love over complain or complain over love ? It's very difficult for two person to be in love in this world and to stay well together, once u r in it, dun let small things get u out, IT'S NOT WORTH IT MAN .......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I wish u good luck ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess most of the posts above have summed up the general concensus of the "mature" pple in this forum.<br><br>one thing that came to my mind was this:<br>it doesn't matter whether u are upset about her lying to u for 2 years, or that she isn't a virgin which u hope ur wife to be, or both. wat seems to bother me, or rather should bother u, is why she had to lie?<br><br>if one partner has to lie to another to get accepted then it's all wrong. maybe she was young and didn't understand that honesty and sincerity is very very important, and that a white lie could just solve everything. yes she truly likes/loves you, but she's afraid of rejection (or anything else bad, for that matter) that she'd rather lie to u than lose u. that, in essence, to me, is not desirable in a stable relationship.<br><br>now we have to look at urself. are u imposing too much pressure on her that any "wrong-doing" on her part will incur an irrecoverable wrath from u? i dun think u seem like the type that will only have ur coffee with two sugars and nothing else will go down your throat. in other words, i'm sure u are more flexible than "i dun care, my wife HAS to be a virgin". Bear in mind that i'm not talking about just her virginity here. what i'm saying is that u may have all these expectations on her that she feels if she can't fulfil she'd rather lie than to lose u. i hope this is not the case.<br><br>watever the case is, u both have to learn from this. i seriously dun think this should be the cause of a break-up, or a sour point in ur relationship. take this opportunity to get to know one another better. ask her nicely why she lied in the first place. assure her that u accept her for who she is, not for how well she can lie about herself. that is of course, in the first place, u can accept her for who she is.<br><br>talk it out nicely, u want her to live in happiness and security in ur arms, not in fear of offending u. likewise, you dun wanna be always thinking that she could lie to u about anything and that u always have to be on the lookout for clues to her darker side. living in a reln like this is just pure hell.<br><br>btw if i seem to be accusing u of anything above then i'd like to disclaim myself if u could just put "ifs" and "mays" where such statements exist.<br><br>overall, i think this can be a good thing that has happened. may u both grow closer and in greater understanding of each other thru this seemingly bad situation. you choose: u want to make this a good learning experience, or keep harbouring unhappee thoughts. it's one or the other, becos it won't be the same as the day b4 u found out she wasn't a virgin.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
