They are psychologically unhealthy in that sense, and their perspective of life is hence narrowed.<br><br>I do agree with you that all fat people are unhealthy, but to rephrase your sentence, they are in danger of being unhealthy, its the obese group that are really unhealthy. Obesity is not a psychiatric disorder, its more of a physical illness, but it will also affect their psychological component. So if you see it in another way, you can say that obese people are hurt twice as much in their physiological and psychological aspects of life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The perhaps important thing to consider is that all are unique individuals, be it of different sizes. It's really up to one individual whether he chooses to look externally or internally or both.<br><br>I understand your first point mistyblue, the question and statement that girls can be like guys in terms of choosing guys the way most guys choose girls. And girls of course are created from the beginning to have an emotional background, meaning that they express their emotions more towards other people around them. With this major component in them plus our advancement in IT knowledge in the turn of the century, girls have become more demanding, but although no matter how demanding they are, they will eventually settle down for second best. Most girls I see, and I have to really praise them, they don't go for external beauty. Most end up with guys who are not up to the standard that you mention in the muscles part but still they love their partner extensively, and that is a miracle. Although when gathered with their friends, they would talk about guys who have muscles, look macho and have a great personality and a warm heart.<br><br>Girls go for love and falling in love when choosing a partner...<br><br>Guys are more egoistic and we all know that from the beginning, since they are given the duty to be the leader of the house. And from this main and sole responsibility, they tend to cultivate that character in many parts and sectors of their lives. It's normal and natural for them to act like this, but if this can be brought under control, they would have been great  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
