            <div class='col-md body'>I simply can't bring myself to go out with fat girls ah..i guess some things are like preprogrammed within you due to genetics and the environment you grew up in..But i guess, fat people are humans after all , and just like how  people fancy thin girls, some guys out there must have something for the fat ones..<br><br>I also agree with fact that some thin people are not healthy, and may be fat though they look thin. Fat people, are definitely unhealthy though, unless they exercise regularly. Hence, the lesson here is fat or thin, exercise!Don't die of heart attack all this, yea!<br><br>To sidetrack a bit, the government should look into bloodtests to ascertain how "fat" one is , instead of the BMI, the BMI is an indicator only of course and could be misleading, by having bloodtests, it allows for "fat" thin people to realise where they stand with respect to their health.</div>
