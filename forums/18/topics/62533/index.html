            <div class='col-md body'>When I was in my first year secondary, I heard a story that every March 13th night, there was a ghost that haunt the school at night. This student killed himself after finding out that he failed his SPM papers. That night itself, he came back to the school and hang himself in the old section of the school where the toilet is. Near there was several classrooms as well as the girls toilet.<br><br>After he died, the Education Ministry actually investigate his paper again and found out that someone switch his results for someone else. That student who kill himself got 8A1 and the person who change it, never got exposed.<br><br>But on the annniversary night, it was said the student will come back and try to get someone to hang at the same place. Since that second incident, the school administration completely barricade the toilet and the stairway to that toilets. So every year that night, we can see someone going down that stairway and start to listen to eerie noises there.<br><br></div>

One Night she woke up wanting to go to the toilet, she saw her father( my grandfather ) tied a red string on a newly grown banana shoot and pull the red string to a storage room... My mum followed him and she saw a naked women having sex with her father. At tat time time my mum was too young and don't really know wat was happening.. Then next morning she saw her father chopped of the tree immediately.<br>Few days later, she saw her father doing the same thing, bringing the red string to the storage room. This time my mum saw the women again and the next morning her father chopped the tree away. My mum said ppl do that to have their wish granted...<br>For example: Getting 4D numbers...<br>All i mentioned above are true...<br>BETTER DUN TRY IT OUT. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>i dun understnad.. ur grandpa wish is to haf sex??</div>

Finally his skin would dry up and die.<br>The spirit would continue to look for its victim in the house as long as the red string is still tied to the banana tree.<br>The only way too get rid of it is to chop off the tree.</div>
