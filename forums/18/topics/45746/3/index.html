Why make such a big fuss when girls ask for more?<br><br>Girls gave in to guys in the past because they did not want their boyfriend to find other girls to have sex with. Now you face the same problem. How does it feel?<br><br>I think this due to the know fact that Singapore guys have one of the lowest sexual drive (due to work, stress, environment, etc).<br><br>Ask an 'Ang Mo' male teenager, the more sex, the better.<br><br>I think you are a failling your gf by not being able to provide what she wants. Do not blame her.<br><br><strong>Free Advise:</strong><br>Sex comes naturally, if she has to ask.. that kinda wrong. She should be able to turn you on and make you want it. Tell her about it.<br><br>Sex does not have to be tiring. Suggest her to get on top and 'do' you. Or try lying side ways.<br><br>Sex does not always require intercourse. Finger her, give her oral sex or even help her to masturbate with a sex-toy.<br><br>Sex like any other exercise requires gradual build up. For example, you run 1km today and then try to run 10km tomorrow, it will be difficult. But if you keep increasing the distance ran, you will finally be able to run 10km. Same for having sex.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ps: hope you do not take this personal and get angry at me, just trying to help a bit</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

How does it feel?</strong></blockquote><strong>Haiz...please I am not one of those guys who keep asking girls for more sex...I have never been one, even during my teenage life, cause I simply hate sex and prefer love making. Thus, it would be meaningless if she is doing it juz to please me....<br><br><blockquote>I think this due to the know fact that Singapore guys have one of the lowest sexual drive (due to work, stress, environment, etc).<br><br>Ask an 'Ang Mo' male teenager, the more sex, the better.</blockquote>Pardon me...I dun think I consider myself to have a low sex drive.<br>In fact, if my other half has a high sex drive, I am happy too...Juz that I always respect my other half if she does not wanna make love and would expect her to respect me too. Girls always have the mentality that guys are sex creatures, always thinking of sex, which is not necessary true. We do say NO and would appreciate if girls will respect that. It is as good as I am being RAPED coz I said NO and she still force herself on me. Ain't it the same definition as in a guy raping a girl?<br><br><blockquote>I think you are a failling your gf by not being able to provide what she wants. Do not blame her.</blockquote>Hei....Maybe I did...But I really cannot accept the fact that she wants it every night. Really every night....without fail. And for your info, I found out from her sister that her previous bf oso complaint that her sex drive is scary, every night oso want...it's like 24x7x365...kinda like mission-critical servers support.<br><br></strong><blockquote><strong>[b]Free Advise:</strong><br>Sex comes naturally, if she has to ask.. that kinda wrong.

In fact, it is good advice for those who are still in the learning stage. For me, well, I have not post the full story or everything about me nor that relationship. Thus, trust me, whatever your advice is, I have done and been thru all that. I ain't young nor a teenager anymore...<br><br>Oh...one more thing, I ain't an intercourse only person.
