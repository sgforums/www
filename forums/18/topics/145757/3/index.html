            <div class='col-md body'>She giggled with anticipation and kicked her fair slender legs as I lifted her up, married couple style, and headed up the creaky stairs to the room.<br><br>The night was still young, at least to me, as I thought of all the sexy possibilities of making out with this fantastic woman who was just moments ago, my sweet and demure housemaid.<br><br>Even though I had just ejaculated, I was ready for another, or maybe a few more, mind blowing orgasms.  Ever since I left Singapore a few weeks ago to work off site, the opportunities to get laid were few and far between.  Fine, I'm lying to myself.  There wasn't any opportunity at all being buried in projects after projects.  I heard from the grapevine in the office that a few of my colleagues even suspected that I was gay.  30 years old, leading a yuppie life with no hint of a girlfriend.  That would make the tongues wag.<br><br>Carrying her, I felt an immense sense of closeness and desire.  Her scent of flowers was not overpowering yet subtle enough to keep my heart beating in desperation.  Her b reasts bobbed lovingly with every step I took as she wrapped her arms around my neck.<br><br>I bent my head and we shared another kiss of longing and wanton lust.  The tongues darted around one another playfully, exploring as our oral fluids mixed.  Almost at the top of the stairs, I tripped and we both fell to the floor clumsily.  Fortunately, she held on tight and didn't get hurt, whilst I palmed the hard surface to break the fall.<br><br>"Oops.  Sir is not strong."  I confessed sheepishly.<br><br>Moving my hands to her head to check if she was hurt in any way, I found nothing.  She lay there quietly, smiling at me, with the eyes just staring deep into mine.  Caressing her beautiful mounds, I felt the soft warm flesh and the taut and hard n ipples.  Laying my head on her chest, I could hear her heart beating furiously too.<br><br>We were like two secondary school children, in love for the first time.  My thoughts drifted back to the other encounters in the past.  True, the other women were in a class of their own but what I had right here, right now was different.  It was not about having sex or satisfying a woman so that she would remember me for life.  I tried to convince myself that this was just pure lust on my part, but the harder I thought about it, the notion of being in love became more apparent.<br><br>Could this really be love?  Did Han strike a long hidden chord that I have so painstakingly hidden over these years deep within me?<br><br>One of my reasons of not being attached till now was a phobia of being tied down to just one person.  I have seen many good friends, drinking brothers and partying members of my group slowly reduced to being a regular family man after marriage, even more so after their first born.  It's true that there are exceptions, but you have to admit, marriage changes a man's lifestyle and habits.  I cannot thrive within this "comfort zone".  I am spurred in life with my successes in work and for my love in writing.<br><br>Han lifted my head up from her chest and pulled me in close for yet another warm kiss.  It was a lovers' kiss this time, slow and soft as if trying to steady the pace at which we were going.  I moved to remove the white pants she was wearing and she helped a little, bending at the knees so I could take them off while keeping our mouths locked together.<br><br>I ran my hand along the length of her smooth thighs, relishing the touch of the almost baby soft skin.  She did not wear any panties and that made her even more sexy and desirable.  The cheeks of her bottoms were tight and firm, probably from all the work she was doing.  All in all, she was the woman of the moment, the mistress of the house.  And I had to admit that I must have fallen in love with her.<br><br>I pinched her inner thighs gently and ever so slowly, inching upwards towards where it mattered.  She was totally wet and wanting.  I spread her legs open and rubbed her in controlled strokes with my fingers.  The only reward I had was a slight mew of pleasure from her as she held my head with both her hands and held me close, maintaining the kiss that never seemed to end.<br><br>My other arm that was half supporting my weight as well as to hold her head up was aching with a dull throb.  I shut that out.  Nothing will stop me tonight.  I'm not going to show weakness in front of this woman who had been giving so much for me, even though only for a week.  In fact, I wanted to impress her, albeit sexually but impression does count, even in bed.<br><br>She held my hand now and guided me along her crevice to a part that was only too familiar to me.  Continuing my assault on her clit, her responses were more noticable now.  She moaned softly and she broke the kiss, laying her head on the floor and closing her eyes, enjoying this particular moment.<br><br>I, too, was recovering from the last orgasm.  Hardening, I knew that was ready to take her.  The foreplay was definitely driving us well as I moved my body on top of hers, missionary style and prepared to enter her.<br><br>She laid her hands on my chest to hold me back and at the same time she said, "Sir, pain?"  I could feel her tensing up nervously as she knew what would be coming next.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"A bit Han.  It's ok.  No worry ok?"  I kissed her again and put both my arms under her and gave her a reassuring hug.  I slowly positioned myself for the entry and pushed gently, careful not to make it any worse for her, suspecting that this might be her first time.<br><br>She did not cry out in pain at all.  Her body jerked as I broke her hymen.  I stopped myself and left her to relax.  It seemed all my senses concentrated on my lower body as the tightening feeling of warmness surrounded me.  It was a feeling I had never experienced for months now.  A wetness that only a woman would be able to give.<br><br>Her eyes were closed in concentration and I saw tears of pain that she had endured running down the sides of her face.  I wiped them away and kissed her on her forehead.  I pushed and pulled slowly, hoping to send sensations of pleasure that will wash the pain away.  It is not the first time for me to take a virgin and I knew that the pain is only temporary.<br><br>She seemed more relaxed now.  Her arms were embraced around my neck, pulling me in occasionally for a small peck.  I bucked harder now as she started to moan again like a little girl.  I taught her how to place her feet on the ground for leverage so she could push her bottom up to meet me with every thrust.  She made love with me with wild abandon, pushing up hard, kissing and hugging me whenever she had a chance.  Her hands were even holding my waist and pulling me down, preventing me from taking a break even I was tired.<br><br>She was a quiet one, I must say.  There were nothing more than just soft moans from her as we made love.  I was kind of worried that I was not living up to her expectations and physically, her actions were showing me signs that she wanted more desperately.  Undeterred, I knew I was capable of more and this would not be the first time either.<br><br>There wasn't a change of position nor any time out for us to catch a breath.  She just continued pumping and I was too driven by lust to even consider stopping.  We were both breathing extremely heavily now.  I knew I was going to be on the verge of climax if this kept up.  I hoped from now onwards, this would be a common sensation for us.<br><br>Her moans were getting to be more regular.  Her speed increased and I could feel my journey almost coming to an end.  She pushed and hugged me harder.  Before I could even wonder if she was coming, she gave out a slight shriek and held me tight and hard.  I knew she had climaxed.  There was a sudden presence of wetness that can only be felt when a woman reaches orgasm.  I continued pumping her furiously as she remained tense for a while, lavishing in her first orgasm.<br><br>It wasn't long before I came too.  My thighs felt taut, trying to hold back like I always do, as the surge of pleasure washed upon me before I gave in and released myself into her.  I gave out a grunt of satisfaction as I pushed my head into her sweet smelling neck and came.  I could hear her breathing and I was sure she could hear mine too.  I uttered a soft, "I love you." as I closed my eyes and relaxed.  I could still feel myself throbbing slightly within her wetness and wished that time would stand still right now.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I coughed as water suddenly began to fill my nostrils.  I opened my eyes and what I saw was a blur.  Trying to compose myself, I realised I was under the water in the bathtub!<br><br>The dull sound of the trickling water reached my ears and I pushed myself up into a sitting position and wondered what the hell happened.<br><br>Looking around, I saw the stub of my cigarette swimming in the bathtub.  The water was slightly murky and exuded a tangy, musky smell that reminds me of my sperm.<br><br>Oh f uck!  It was all a damn wet dream!  I must have fallen asleep whilst bathing!  The bermudas and boxers that were supposedly wet was still laid out on the rack, dry.<br><br>Taking a few deep, disappointed breaths.  I got out and washed off the sperm-filled water from myself and towelled dry.  This was stupid.  A grown man like me, still having wet dreams at this age.<br><br>I dressed and left the toilet. Standing at the top of the stairs, I called out to her, "Han!"<br><br>She rushed out from the kitchen and stood at the foot of the stairs, still wearing her blue Ao Dai.<br><br>"Sir?"  She must have been shocked from my sudden outcry.<br><br>I looked at her, the last part of the dream kept replaying in my mind.  What a damn waste!<br><br>"Nothing."  I told her.  "You go work."<br><br>Damn, I'm not ever going to have sex in real life...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This story, like all others that were written, are semi-true.  There are parts that are true in the dream whereas some parts are made up.<br><br>It's up to you, as the reader, to determine which part is the truth.<br><br>I prefer non-fiction over fiction as there would be something that has occured for me to tap on for inspiration.<br><br>As for poor me not able to get laid everytime in my stories, those parts are made up.  Just a little trademark I like to have. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Thanks everyone for the kind comments and criticism.  It keeps me going.<br><br>Until the next encounter, I'll be seeing you guys!<br><br>PS.  Going to Jakarta tonight.
