            <div class='col-md body'>Time to write again.<br><br>I've been moving around the SEA region for the past few months due to an expansion in the company's operations in developing countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia.<br><br>I'm currently stationed in beautiful Vietnam in the city of Ha Noi (Hanoi).  Living here is really an eye opener.  There are beautiful buildings almost everywhere and the people are friendly as hell to say the least.  (At least to a foreigner like me).<br><br>I currently live alone in a rented beautiful villa with garage and a fantastic swimming pool.<br><br>Living here makes me feel like I own a bungalow house in Sixth Avenue back at home.  The feeling is great, not to mention the cheap rent!  Only USD$1100 per month just to live in luxury.<br><br>On top of this, I have my own personal housemaid which I got to handpick from the local marriage agency.  You know the guys from Singapore who come over to Vietnam to find wives?  My housemaid was "hired" from an agency like that.  Thanks to a good pal of mine in Ha Noi, instead of picking an old out-of-shape woman from the proper maid agency, I got myself a young woman waiting to find a suitor who was willing to work part time.<br><br>Oh and I should call her a housekeeper, because that's the actual term here.<br><br>Her name is Nguyen Thi Ngoc Han and she is 24 years old.  She's speaks a bit of english so we can communicate quite ok with my limited command of Viet.  She's very inquisitive, always asking me about life outside Vietnam and she's a very good listener.<br><br>With this, here's the story I call - A Domestic Affair.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Han, I home!"  Life was good.  It was 7pm and home I was.  In all my life, I have never felt being treated like royalty.  I lived in a very beautiful 2 storey home with a pool and the place was kept beautifully spick and span by my lovely housemaid, Han.<br><br>She was a young lady, on a waiting list at a local marriage agency for a potential suitor to arrange to meet her.  One of these days, I thought, she is going to leave me and get married.  I think I might be a little heartbroken then.  My thoughts flew back to about a week back, when I was at the agency, scrutinizing the photo album, looking out for someone who will not mind being my housemaid while I was stationed here, in Ha Noi.<br><br>"Sir, sit please."<br><br>We go through the same ritual everytime I come back home.  She would drop whatever she was occupied with and immediately attend to me.<br><br>First would be taking off my shoes and placing it neatly beside the other shoes I have at the shoe rack.<br><br>Second, she will lay food at the dining table for my meal.  And while I was having my meal, she would be preparing the bath as well as to get ready my after-bath clothings.<br><br>Lastly, due to a daily ritual, she would have turned on my computer and prepare a notepad with a sharpened pencil just in case I need to take notes.  Of course, a glass of warm tea would be there too.<br><br>Life is good, very good.<br><br>"Han, sir don't want you to wear Ao Dai anymore in house, ok?"<br><br>The Ao Dai is the traditional dress worn by women in Vietnam.  I was just told by my colleague today that it is worn on formal occasions only.  It's a long gown with slits on both sides and I have caught myself on many occasions trying to look beyond the slit just trying to see if I could.<br><br>"Sir, my parents say I work here.  So only wear Ao Dai is good for work."  She replied before she turned to the kitchen to bring out dinner.<br><br>I stared at her as she brought the dishes out one by one.  It's the same everyday.  4 or 5 main dishes with rice or noodles.  She's not a bad cook, I must say.  Some lucky chap is going to have a good life with her.<br><br>"Do you wear Ao Dai at your parent's home, Han?"  I asked her as she moved in and out of the kitchen.<br><br>As she placed the last dish on the table, she said, "At home I wear Tshirts and bermudas, very hot in home.  Sir house is cold of the air-con."<br><br>"Hmm, sir turn off air con, Han take off Ao Dai?"<br><br>She must have interpreted it in the wrong way.  She smiled in a very shy manner and quickly mumbled a "No" before she turned and went back to the kitchen to get a beverage for me.<br><br>I thought I have already kept my english simple and easy to understand.  But I realised that she must have thought I wanted to see her naked.<br><br>There was an uneasy quiet after that.  I ate dinner while she stood a ways behind me awaiting any instruction.  Normally, we would chat a bit and she would ask me about people and life in other countries and how is it different from Ha Noi.<br><br>"Han, sir is sorry.  Sir no more talk about Ao Dai ok?"  I turned apologized to her.  I would not want her going back to her parents and telling them I made a pass at her.  Although she is an adult but the culture here is one of purity and decency.<br><br>"No no sir.  Please no sorry.  Sir want Han take off Ao Dai, Han will follow."  She looked down meekly as she said these words.  Man, I felt like I was hurting her feelings.  She can be so sweet at times that my heart will melt.  Is this why Singaporean men love Viet women?<br><br>We left the conversation at that.  I felt really bad about what I said and went up to take a bath.  While I was soaking my tired body in the bathtub, my mind went back to what transpired earlier.  I never thought of having any other relationship with her and I thought about how I could rephase my words next time to prevent an encounter like that again.<br><br>I turned the tap and adjusted for more hot water.  I love being in a bathtub.  Alone and quiet, I can smoke and make use of the time to think.<br><br>This time, when I got out of the tub and towelled dry, I accidentally dropped my boxers and bermudas into the tub and wet them.  I called for her and asked her to get me new "sleeping clothes".  Wearing only a T-shirt, I started shaving at the mirror.  It was another mistake.  I left the door unlocked and in she came carrying a complete set of tshirt, boxers and pants and saw me half naked from the waist below.<br><br>We stood there looking at each other for what seemed like an eternity.  She was transfixed at my brother and looked extremely shocked.  Whilst I, usually used to the fact that someone would knock before coming in, never expected something like that to happen.<br><br>I composed myself and quickly took the clothes from her and turned her around and pushed her out of the bathroom.  My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears.  I dressed as fast as I could and went down to look for her.  Although she has only been with me for about a week, I don't want to make her think that she's living with a pervert.<br><br>She was in the kitchen.  When she saw me coming down the steps, she looked away and started to wash the dishes.  She had long, straight, jet black hair tied up in a very high ponytail.  Her traditional Ao Dai, blue today was worn tightly and you could see her small waist and lithe figure.  A figure many men would die to hug.  As she worked, the slits on her dress opened and closed and you could see the white pants that are worn inside as part of the traditional dress.<br><br>"Han, sit please.  Sir want to talk to you".  I wanted to iron out any misunderstandings that we have.  I would very much like to have the old Han back again.  Always smiling, always cheerful and always asking me questions that half the time, I don't have an answer.<br><br>She sat down quietly.  What happened earlier must have been had a crazy effect on her.<br><br>"Han, sir very sorry just now.  Will not happen again.  Please no sad ok?"<br><br>She nodded to show that she understood and I turned and started to leave her to her own work.<br><br>"Sir?"<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"Sir, please no sorry.  Han working here.  What sir wants, Han will give."  I guess she must be thinking that I want her to have sex with me.  And the problem is how do I convince her that it is not what I intended.<br><br>"Han, do you know what is f uck?"  I know now how difficult it is for a parent to sex educate their child.  It is the exact same feeling that is plaguing me right now.  As soon as the words, came out of my mouth and seeing the reaction on her face, I knew I screwed up big time once more.<br><br>- End of Part 1 -</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She looked at me with those innocent eyes.  For the life of me, the tension was excruciatingly terrible.  I sat down across the table from her.  "Han, it is not what I meant.  Please do not misunderstand my intentions.  I feel bad today so many weird things happen."<br><br>"Sir, no feel bad please.  Han want to learn be good wife."  She was definitely feeling uneasy, glancing everywhere and rubbing her hands together.<br><br>Looking at her now reminds me of those girls in the Japanese porn that I have watched before.  Quiet, decent, sweet and youthful girls who would do anything you told them to.<br><br>Right here, before my eyes, I had a fair and beautiful, not to mention sexy (at least that is how I imagined her figure would be) woman that was just ripe for the taking.  But deep within me, knowing that she is actively looking for a man to spend the rest of her days with, I struggled with the thought of wanting and not wanting her.<br><br>I spent the next few minutes trying to explain to her, to recollect the events that led up to this uneasiness between us.  Hoping she will understand what I actually wanted in the first place.  All I wanted was for her to be comfortable and treat this home like her own.  That was why I wanted her to just wear casually instead of putting on the Ao Dai.<br><br>We spoke about the differences in the cultures in Vietnam and Singapore.  She was shocked when I told her that maids in Singapore dress just like the rest of us.  In Vietnam, there is a unspoken and unseen class difference line drawn between the employer and employee.<br><br>Things began to lighten up and I could see her trying to hide her smiles when I joked about people and events that happened to me.  It was a relief to see her relaxing.  Frankly, I love to make her laugh.  Her dress was worn tightly and it accentuates her figure and especially her upper body.  Whenever she laughs, my eyes will inadvertently be drawn to look at the soft bounce of her b reasts.<br><br>Oh, I would like to add in something extra.  In the past week since she's been doing my place for me, I have only seen her wearing the Vietnamese traditional dress.  There were a few incidents where I've wondered what's beneath the dress.  Is she wearing any lingerie?  What would the lingerie be like?  But because of the way the dress is designed and worn, it was virtually impossible to spot.  I must say I am quite good at spotting Gstrings back in Singapore.  But over here, my skills as a self proclaimed pro voyeur is tested beyond the normal boundaries.<br><br>An idea suddenly came to me with regards to the issue with the Ao Dai.<br><br>"Han, you know, in Singapore, housemaids cannot dress better than Sir and Madams."  I knew how to convince her to dress casually now.  "Sir feel very bad when housemaid dress nicer than sir.  Sir is not housemaid right?"<br><br>"No no no Sir.  Sir not housemaid, Han is housemaid."  She stood up immediately.  Back to the employer and employee difference again.<br><br>Now that she gets the idea.  I told her that she was making me feel uncomfortable about dressing "lower" than her.  And that she should dress more casually so that visitors (not that we have a lot) will not think that she is the mistress of the house.<br><br>"Sir, Han is ok not wear Ao Dai?"  She confirmed.<br><br>"Yes.  Not wear Ao Dai ok?  Here we follow Singapore style."  It's like talking to a grown up child who will follow your every command and request.  I thought about the girls in Singapore I know.  Even the meekest one in Singapore can't hold a candle to the purity and naivety of Han.<br><br>We agreed from then on that the Ao Dai will not be standard fare as long as she is working here.  The subject was dropped and she started to ask me more questions about maids' life in Singapore.  She cringed when I mentioned a few horror stories of the maids being tortured and also of maids killing the children in their employees' home.<br><br>It was getting late at about 11pm but we're still chatting gaily.  I switched the subject and asked her if she ever fell in love with someone before.  Being more comfortable now, she told me a story of her first love back in her village with her father's sworn brother.  I probed more about what love means to Vietnamese women.<br><br>What I gathered was that women in Vietnam was taught from young that love is undying and love is giving anything.  No matter how good or bad they would be treated, for them to love a man is to give that man everything.  That belief governs the fact that women must give in everytime, to any request to the man that they love.<br><br>So different in Singapore.  Singaporean women always justify that love is NOT equal to sex and that love is pure.  But what love can be purer than what I am hearing right now?  Maybe the cause of the low birth rate can be attributed to how the women in Singapore thinks.<br><br>Han asked about marriage and we compared notes on how the men proposed to the women.  I even went down on my knees and held her hands to show her how the romantic guy proposes.  I think that must have made her very happy as she started to giggle innocently in glee.<br><br>Getting ahead of myself, I even wanted to show her how the married man carries his wife on the day on their marriage into the new home but she stepped away and laughed, saying that she will keep that for her husband.  Everything back to normal now, I told her I would go back to my room to do some work before going to bed.<br><br>Leaving her to her chores I went back to my room.  Being a late sleeper, I would normally surf the web or chat with the guys before retiring for the night.  It was nice to have Han around, I thought.  No worries about anything as she has performed very well as a housemaid.  Everything was clean and in it's place and she had the uncanny ability to know where everything is.<br><br>Right about midnight, I heard the creaking of the steps outside my room.  Han was coming up.  I leaned back in my chair and looked at the little slit under the door where I could see her shadow pacing to and fro outside my door.<br><br>Something must have happened but I decided against opening the door to shock her.  Maybe she was just doing some chores outside.<br><br>Her shadow stopped moving outside my door and I heard the soft rustle of a piece of paper being pushed under the door.  Then she walked away and the creaking of the stairs told me that she went back down.<br><br>I stood and went to pick up the piece of paper.  It was torn from the little notebook she kept beside the phone where she could take down messages and on it wrote :<br><br>"Sir, I want to learn f uck.  Teach me ok?"<br><br>-  End of Part 2  -</div>
