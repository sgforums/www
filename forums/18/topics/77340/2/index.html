            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion.<br><br>Guys are hunters by nature , constantly on the lookout for pretty girls but as usual , this does not apply to the majority. There are the faithful ones , loving ones , playboys and so on.<br><br>Some of us may not have the looks but they have the substance. Some may have the looks and the substance. Some may be lacking in both departments. Either way , it depends on what the girl expects.<br><br>Singapore is a materialistic world , money matters most , drive a flashy car and you can get a girl , no questions asked. This is the truth , i kid you not.<br><br>Girls are vain , that is a fact. Going downstairs to buy ciggarettes or just a packet of chips and they put on a little powder etc.<br><br>Girls too look out for guys , they THINK some guy is cute or hot. Difference here is girls THINK , guys SAY. Just cause girls dont openly say out a guy is hot doesn't mean they dont judge guys too.<br><br>As for the babies , don't blame the males. Blame the mindsets of Singaporeans , career always comes first. Until we change that , the baby shortage will never improve.<br><br>But let's face this fact , we all look at the appearance first. Honestly ask yourself , if a fat and ugly guy/girl tries to pick you up , would you smile and chat with him/her or just feel disgusted?<br><br>Some would chat , most would not. We are THAT shallow.<br><br>For me , i like pleasant looking girls with little or no make up. The natural look , i love it. It takes a girl with confidence to go to Orchard Rd without make up or just a quick powder. Sadly , i hardly see any girl now with little or no make up. I see barbie dolls everyday when i go to school , a big turn off to me at least , to most guys it would attract them. No idea why...<br><br>Because to me , after you get past the LOOKS department , it all boils down to character. No point going after a pretty girl who doesn't know how to cook , sew etc. Or can't even have a nice conversation with without her asking what you are talking about.<br><br>So far , i only know 2-3 girls in my entire life who are intelligent enough to talk about the world and current affairs , smart enough to catch a punchline or a joke while others would just stare into space or think i'm being serious.<br><br>As for the girls in the corporate world doing whatever it is to clinch deals. I think they are just career minded , using their bodies to their advantage. They go far but they fall fast too if someone exposes them.<br><br>Foreigners do not have something we locals don't. I'll be dam*ed if i have to listen to another Singaporean say the Americans/British/Australians are better , smarter , stronger etc. People like these have no confidence in themselves , no self-esteem. I pity them.<br><br>All i can say is , there is someone for everyone. Just be patient.<br><br>- Leo</div>

[color=brown]There are the faithful ones , loving ones , playboys and so on.</span>[/color]<br>Actually its the majority as far as i know<span style="color: blue;">Mistake on my first post , hehe , agree with you here.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Some of us may not have the looks but they have the substance. Some may have the looks and the substance. Some may be lacking in both departments. Either way , it depends on what the girl expects. </span><br>those lacking in both ended marrying foreign brides lor!<span style="color: blue;">Not really... they somehow end up with pretty girls simply because they are sincere and the girls somehow know they are not flirting around(because they can't... obviously) I know a few people and they are the envy of others.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Singapore is a materialistic world , money matters most , drive a flashy car and you can get a girl , no questions asked. This is the truth , i kid you not. </span><br>A typical mentality of local guys!<br><span style="color: blue;">Typical because it's true. However, the calibre of girls who are like this leave much to be desired... character wise</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Girls are vain , that is a fact. Going downstairs to buy ciggarettes or just a packet of chips and they put on a little powder etc. </span><br>i dont and my mum doesnt too!<br><span style="color: blue;">Extreme minority <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Girls too look out for guys , they THINK some guy is cute or hot. Difference here is girls THINK , guys SAY. Just cause girls dont openly say out a guy is hot doesn't mean they dont judge guys too.</span><br>We THINK and we SAY too!<br><span style="color: blue;">Hmm.. maybe you do , so far , i have only heard my girl friends say it out 4-5 times.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">As for the babies , don't blame the males. Blame the mindsets of Singaporeans , career always comes first. Until we change that , the baby shortage will never improve.</span><br>Blame government and society too...women are facing a lot of pressure at work place. For instance, our performance were being scrutinised during maternity leave / urgent leave etc.  Advancement opportunities are also affected for married women / with kids in many organisations.<span style="color: blue;">I might sound a little sexist here but the Government and we Men always think that women should remain at home to take care of the family. Take the medical profession for an example , ever wonder why there are so little female doctors? Because they know that the female doctors tend to quit to take care of the family. It requires a lot of money to train doctors. Men tend to see women as the inferior sex when it comes to business thus the drive to succeed in most women. The drive to succeed exceeds the need to settle down. Baby shortage <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You can be successful at work and at home too. But somehow i don't see many women doing that , they want to prove themselves , neglecting their family in the process. Sad but this is the way Singapore is...</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">But let's face this fact , we all look at the appearance first. Honestly ask yourself , if a fat and ugly guy/girl tries to pick you up , would you smile and chat with him/her or just feel disgusted?</span><br>I will rather chat with a not-so-good-looking and humble guy than to talk to handsome guys who think tat they are god's gift to women.<span style="color: blue;"> You are part of the minority then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Some would chat , most would not. We are THAT shallow.</span> yeah!<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">For me , i like pleasant looking girls with little or no make up. The natural look , i love it. It takes a girl with confidence to go to Orchard Rd without make up or just a quick powder. Sadly , i hardly see any girl now with little or no make up. I see barbie dolls everyday when i go to school , a big turn off to me at least , to most guys it would attract them. No idea why...</span><br>A very typical, irritating 'sentence' tat i always hear from local guys - 'The natural look'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  Please lah...out of 100 gals, maybe only 95 really look ok /out makeup.  We need to meet ppl everyday.  Makeup is a good etiquette to make ourselves presentable.  It doesnt necessarily equate to confidence.<span style="color: blue;"> The thing is , natural is the best way to go , if making yourself presentable means slapping on a thick layer of powder and what have you , then it is not being confident. I see working women looking good with hardly any make up , i don't see why the rest must put on such thick make up. If you are saying out of a 100 girls only 95 look good without make up , then why do girls constantly want guys to say they are beautiful WITH make up on? When i say i like the natural look , i meant it. Typical guy? I think not , most of my guy friends have the hots for barbie dolls.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Because to me , after you get past the LOOKS department , it all boils down to character. No point going after a pretty girl who doesn't know how to cook , sew etc. Or can't even have a nice conversation with without her asking what you are talking about.</span>[/color]<br>Which era r u from? A gal can still have character even if she doesnt cook, sew.  She doesnt understand could also be u cannot express well!<span style="color: blue;">When we are in a group , and everyone else understands except her , you know the problem ain't me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> A girl can have character even if she can't cook or sew , but i have yet to meet one , maybe you're right , i don't know.Benefit of the doubt.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">So far , i only know 2-3 girls in my entire life who are intelligent enough to talk about the world and current affairs , smart enough to catch a punchline or a joke while others would just stare into space or think i'm being serious.</span><br>Tat 2-3 girls could also be thinking tat u are not intelligent enough to talk to them abt world and current affairs.  I will usually give a blank look too when guys tried to joke w me, cos i find them lame.<span style="color: blue;"> The difference between your guy friends and my group of friends is that we are straightforward , if its lame , we let them know. If its funny , we laugh , if its about world affairs , those who know nuts will keep quiet , those who do , will speak up. If the girl thinks i am not of standard to talk to her about world affairs , then isn't it discrimination in a sense? Who are you to judge a person's intelligence even before he/she can prove it?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">As for the girls in the corporate world doing whatever it is to clinch deals. I think they are just career minded , using their bodies to their advantage. They go far but they fall fast too if someone exposes them.  </span><br>Men too suck up to their bosses, use unethical means to clinch deals.  So we are just using a different mode of weapons.<span style="color: blue;">Weapons... so far i am not sure what weapons guys use , mind telling me?
