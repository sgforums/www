            <div class='col-md body'>cases like this very common sometimes the girl is also at fault. I remember once my ex gf also was dead drunk in one of the clubs at MS. Then her friend call me up on my phone to fetch her. Lucky i was there to send her to her house, she can't even walk. But of cos i did nothing to her except to send her home. At that moment of time she was an easy prey to those preverts.<br><br>I dun understand girls, knowing that sure things might just happens then why y get yourself so drunk.<br>Even if u are going out with a group of friends with guys and girls its still the same. Can you be very certain that all the guys in the group are very well behave no one can be acertain of that.<br><br>There once at Centro I saw a lady very high on drinks and she went to different groups of guys and hug, french kisses.<br>Then suddenly a guy i assume she did not know who he is was went over to her and hug with her and french kis on the sofa sits, out of nowhere this guy just grab her on her breast and kiss her as if they are starting a love session. Everyone around that area was looking at them. After sometime this guy drag this girl away to the lobby. After that i have no idea what happens, but when i was about to go off, this girl was with the security guards at he entrance and she was vomitting. But that guy was nowhere to be found.<br><br>So girls if you dun want to be a victim then dun present yourself as an easy prey to the others.<br></div>
