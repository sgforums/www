When you drive by the bus stop scan for any ladies sitting and in skirts, then see whether their legs are parted. When you go to food court for lunch, scan for a lady in short skirt, (legs cross or not not important). Chose the seat opposit her. Even if her legs are cross, she will eventually uncross and open her legs slightly to get out and up. So the split second attention is very important, you miss the split second uncrossing of legs, you miss the whole show. Going up the stairs or escalator, always stand or walk a few steps behind her if only she is wearing a short flare skirt, tight skirts cannot see anything.  Sometimes, when you go to shopping centre, and there is a show on the stage, many people would be standing on the second or third floor looking down, Chose your target, surely got those in short skirt so engrosed in the show, that they forget and give you a show. Once saw a malay girl who was not wearing any panty and her CB was visible, hair and all. Wah !<br>So my advise is Open eye big big and thru' practise you will get to see more. I have seen so many until now don't need to go out of the way to peep. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

When you drive by the bus stop scan for any ladies sitting and in skirts, then see whether their legs are parted. When you go to food court for lunch, scan for a lady in short skirt, (legs cross or not not important). Chose the seat opposit her. Even if her legs are cross, she will eventually uncross and open her legs slightly to get out and up. So the split second attention is very important, you miss the split second uncrossing of legs, you miss the whole show. Going up the stairs or escalator, always stand or walk a few steps behind her if only she is wearing a short flare skirt, tight skirts cannot see anything.  Sometimes, when you go to shopping centre, and there is a show on the stage, many people would be standing on the second or third floor looking down, Chose your target, surely got those in short skirt so engrosed in the show, that they forget and give you a show. Once saw a malay girl who was not wearing any panty and her CB was visible, hair and all. Wah !<br>So my advise is Open eye big big and thru' practise you will get to see more. I have seen so many until now don't need to go out of the way to peep. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>wah... so nice from the EXPERT. drive by the bus stop scan for girl.<br>this advice is the best of the best.<br>hope u didn't crash ur car.<br><br>Zao geng....<br>sigh...<br>sometime.. luck is most impt.<br>U can waste the freaking whole day waiting for the girl in the food court to open her leg..<br><br>When there was dozen of girls BEHIND u already Zaogeng but u didn't notice.<br>so na pai pai na.<br><br>as for having show on stage..<br>in my older past.. quite a dark one....<br>i think it wasting time to wait for them Zao geng.<br>i rather be near the girl.<br>sometime if getting too crowdy..<br>i can have free touch..<br>by accidently and non accidently.<br>and the girls will be too engross in the show that they didn't notice...</div>
