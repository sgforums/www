In fact today, during lunch at a food centre in CBD, saw 2 zaogeng at the same time, they were sitted in 2 diferent tables facing mine. 1 was a lady in her mid-thirties who was wide open, wearing a silky pink panty that can see her mould with lots of Pubic hairs, and the other is a young lady in her early twenties, she was not so wide open but her skirt was ready short and had a slit on it, and she was wearing a white panty which I think is a Sloggy. Not so much to see, so had to keep switching the views. Even though the older lady do not have such a nice body as the younger lady, she had much more to offer, like just before she left the table, she swing her left leg even wider in order to get out and up. But after she swing wide open she was still sitting there wiping sweat from her forehead and taking out another tissue. Wah Lau ! So wide open, both side of her crotch of her panty can see her CB lips bursting out with a lot of hair on it (never shave), and still upward her patch of coarse black hair was all curly wirly. She eventually stood up and left. The young lady was more modest she swing both her legs out at the same time so not much can be seen. CONCULSION : Older ladies, say from Mid thirties up normally more "BoChap" Their attitude is you want to see, see lor. They also feel "shiok" to let people see, at least they know if still got people interested to see, that means, they are still "attractive" and they also have to fight to show more since young girls and young ladies are so daring now a days.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Your friendly neighbourhood Zaogeng "See Full" Hehehe.....<br><br>Next round: Peeping at neighbour's daughters bath in the kampong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> days.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

I was one of those watching the performance as my friends were involved. Midway, I went to get some food and on my way back, I saw this blonde sitting on the lawn.
