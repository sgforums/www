She should have got a lot of feedback by now. So why? I have told her before, that the best reason I can think for her behavior is she had a liason with a single guy and up to this day she still feel guilty about it, and one of the ways she has developed to reduce her guilt is to post continuously, hoping to hear people keep saying to her that it's OK, nothing wrong, everyone's doing it. i.e. not looking for info, but using people here to give her psychological relief- dats why I told her to settle it in her mind permanently and don't post anymore.</div>

This is when freedom of speech is being exercised- when people feel free to respond according to their judgement, and depending on the degree of unacceptability involved, often includes suggestions to stop posting. Which of course sometimes do not stop the person from another round of similar posts- presumably another expression of freedom of speech. Thus the mere asking of another to stop posting is not a repression of freedom of speech. Rather, it is the exercise of freedom of speech, which includes the freedom to rebut. You may feel free to post your objection to this opinion. You will then be exercising the freedom of speech that you espouse.</div>

She should have got a lot of feedback by now. So why? I have told her before, that the best reason I can think for her behavior is she had a liason with a single guy and up to this day she still feel guilty about it, and one of the ways she has developed to reduce her guilt is to post continuously, hoping to hear people keep saying to her that it's OK, nothing wrong, everyone's doing it. i.e. not looking for info, but using people here to give her psychological relief- dats why I told her to settle it in her mind permanently and don't post anymore.</div></blockquote>yeah brother....at the most u can just ignore the thread right? no need to get all hot and bothered abt such trivial things..<br><br>Stay cool bro!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
