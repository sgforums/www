It's really tough if you got not much in the account ...<br><br>And the way how your ex (I assume so since both of you are not in contact since then) reacted towards your money matters... is it cos of her background that led her to such a behaviour? And maybe her relatives were really driving her crazy by asking what does her bf (you) do for a living and etc etc etc..
