Why has it got to do with USA? Not as if they are a part of Asia or anything. US kaypoh lar, everything want to meddle.</div></blockquote>You obviously don't knw how the world works, do you?<br><br>On the surface, the US are the defenders of Democracy.  Taiwan is similar to the US in its quest to gain independence.  The US had to fight the Brits to gain theirs.  It would make them look like hypocrites to stand on the side of the Chinese.  Or to stand around and do nothing.<br><br>Militarially/Strategicaly, if Taiwan was part of China that would cut off a part of the waters between Japan and Singapore in the south china sea. They'd have to take a huge detour to get to Singapore.  No good for the travelling of its Pacific Fleet or cargo ships.  If it came down to war with China, they'll have another base to place their ships and equipment.  Remember Pearl Harbour retaliation bombing of Japan?  Imagine where they could reach if their base was situated in Asia?<br><br>The most important point of all, money.  There are obviously US investments in Taiwan that they'd have to protect which could be gone if China took over.  Taiwan is also one of the most developed 'countries' in Asia and with it's infrastructure is a good place to further invest.<br><br>So the US is pretty much looking out for itself, something that's a norm nowadays.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>FFI, judging by your post.
