It means that they are overenthusiastic on exercising their rights. Women are educated on their rights now, and most have no quells exercising it because they can now afford to.<br><br>We live in a materialistic society. Not only are the girls materialistic. Guys are materialistic as well. It's the environment.<br><br>(2) Well, just too bad if you want a submissive wife. There are submissive women here in Singapore, but they are rare. Most demand equal share in housework which I don't think is an unfair request as usually, both parties are working.<br><br>(3) I think 'foreigner' is much more polite than 'alien'. We do not like the Americans calling us 'aliens' because it sounds so rude, neither should we call a foreign bride 'aliens'. Well, there are good apples and bad apples. There are some who just want the PR and the your money as it is better than what they get in their own country and scoot when they get what they want, whereas others are looking for a better life but remain devoted.<br><br>There are sg girls who are devoted and stick through thick and thin with their guy as well. Sometimes, it depends on where you look for the girl and your expectations and how you court the girl.<br><br>It's really the same everywhere. Just that differences in cost of living makes expectations seem higher or lower.</div>

I have a good job, stable income and pleasant looking. My experience with singapore girls are they are materialistic, treat you like a driver. It does not help by the fact the car i drove is not a japanese car.<br><br>Even till today, i have an ex-colleague (quite pretty)  whom i have not met for 3 year plus still sms me once in a while and ask me what im doing and then move on to say shes outside at this so and so place and tries and filt with me and get me to pick her up and send her home. I always decline as im already attached. Such is the attitude of singapore girls and this is not an isolated incident. Many a times when im younger, many girls will want me to send them back after a night of clubbing etc etc.<br><br>Currently my GF is from Vietnam. Comparision between sg and foreign girls? Viet girls are MUCH more caring, most of them knows how to cook since young even when she is from a rich family, knows how to take care of the family. Sometimes when i wanted to buy her something, she will say oh no so expensive and ask me not to buy it. Singapore girls? Its almost the opposite.<br><br>What about those foreign girls that are flooding singapore? In my job i meet foreign girls everyday. I must clarify they are not what you read in the papers regarding PRC girls soliciting for sex in geylang and the likes. Majority of them are down to earth, pleasant, caring.<br><br>And the hooha few months back on vietnamese brides parading themselves in the computer fair. If you would try and understand their background your views might change. Girls from the countryside in vietnam earn less than $100 or $150 per month. They live in poverty. To many of them marrying foreigners is the only way out of their misery and it does not help that they have to support many siblings. Singaporean will not understand as they have NEVER been put in the same situation. Many of them are born living in a comfortable environment since young where we do not need to worry about education and 3 meals a day. Such is the opposite for those rural girls from vietnam. Why wouldn't they marry viet guys u may sak? Viet guys are well known as wife beaters, lazy, drunkards and not doing anything while the wife works. Would you wanna marry them?<br><br>So in a way, i do respect those girls that is trying to fight for their own lives and freedom by marrying overseas and taking the 1st step out of their hometown and seeking work in factories so that foreigners can come and choose them. They are just fighting for their survival. And remember, their family do not get much money even if they are married overseas from those agencies. Out of $15k clients pay in singapore to the agent, majority goes into the pocket of the agents, they family stand to gain only $800 or LESS.<br><br>Sorry for my lengthy post, given my personal experience, i still stick to my stand, foreign girls over sg girls anytime.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by saigonblack:</div><div class="quote_body">Allow me to share my views.<br><br>1st and foremost i must say i do have my fair share of singapore girlfriends. I have a good job, stable income and pleasant looking. My experience with singapore girls are they are materialistic, treat you like a driver. It does not help by the fact the car i drove is not a japanese car.<br><br>Even till today, i have an ex-colleague (quite pretty)  whom i have not met for 3 year plus still sms me once in a while and ask me what im doing and then move on to say shes outside at this so and so place and tries and filt with me and get me to pick her up and send her home. I always decline as im already attached. Such is the attitude of singapore girls and this is not an isolated incident. Many a times when im younger, many girls will want me to send them back after a night of clubbing etc etc.<br><br>Currently my GF is from Vietnam. Comparision between sg and foreign girls? Viet girls are MUCH more caring, most of them knows how to cook since young even when she is from a rich family, knows how to take care of the family. Sometimes when i wanted to buy her something, she will say oh no so expensive and ask me not to buy it. Singapore girls? Its almost the opposite.<br><br>What about those foreign girls that are flooding singapore? In my job i meet foreign girls everyday. I must clarify they are not what you read in the papers regarding PRC girls soliciting for sex in geylang and the likes. Majority of them are down to earth, pleasant, caring.<br><br>And the hooha few months back on vietnamese brides parading themselves in the computer fair. If you would try and understand their background your views might change. Girls from the countryside in vietnam earn less than $100 or $150 per month. They live in poverty. To many of them marrying foreigners is the only way out of their misery and it does not help that they have to support many siblings. Singaporean will not understand as they have NEVER been put in the same situation. Many of them are born living in a comfortable environment since young where we do not need to worry about education and 3 meals a day. Such is the opposite for those rural girls from vietnam. Why wouldn't they marry viet guys u may sak? Viet guys are well known as wife beaters, lazy, drunkards and not doing anything while the wife works. Would you wanna marry them?<br><br>So in a way, i do respect those girls that is trying to fight for their own lives and freedom by marrying overseas and taking the 1st step out of their hometown and seeking work in factories so that foreigners can come and choose them. They are just fighting for their survival. And remember, their family do not get much money even if they are married overseas from those agencies. Out of $15k clients pay in singapore to the agent, majority goes into the pocket of the agents, they family stand to gain only $800 or LESS.<br><br>Sorry for my lengthy post, given my personal experience, i still stick to my stand, foreign girls over sg girls anytime. Thanks for reading, no offence meant</div></blockquote>I don't think you should say that of all SG girls. It's not fair at all. Unless you've dated ALL SG girls, then by all means go ahead and say that.<br><br>Period.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guys out there, thanks for all the posts.<br><br>It is really an eye-opener, frankly speaking, I have never thought of this idea of finding an overseas bride,until now.<br><br>I now know that I have one more option out there.<br>2 views,<br><br>1)30 yrs from now, the statictics of single woman is going to get higher. of course, the same will go for man, but we, man can always venture out with only 15K. but how about local women?thail or viet guys? ha ha. think most of their dream guys will be ang mohs, but i don think they need wifes that help them spend.<br><br>2)although there are cases of such foreign bridges running away but so far, i had only heard one. so the gamble is there but the statitics of winning is high.<br><br>So go for it, singles guys out there !!!who are in mid 30s yet cant find a stable gf. Best wishes!!!<br><br></div>
