            <div class='col-md body'>I don't have experiences with PRC or vietnamese brides or friends who have married them, but i share something that is relevant.<br><br>I shoot weddings regularly, and last month, had the pleasure of going to KL to cover a wedding there. quite an elaborate affiar, the couple was affluent, and i suspect so were their friends.<br><br>The moment i started in the morning, i was greeted by a cheerful "jie mei" who was preparing the tekan stuff for the groom. soon, a few more joined in and started chatting with me asking me for suggestions and what i thought of their evil plans. spoke perfect english, confident, looks wise ok, nothing to complain about, fun-loving, uninhibited and DEFINITELY NOT dao. can u imagine the same of a singaporean girl, educated overseas, affluent, good-looking? wat's the chances they will come up and initiate friendly banter with you, esp if you're an ugly wedding photographer "intruding" into their fun?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I contrast that to singaporean weddings i shoot. sure singaporeans girls are not total OPPOSITE, but it does take them a while to warm up. some never do, mind you, and snuff you all the way. there's something about singaporean girls being dressed up and looking pretty (in their opinions entirely) that they have the right to snuff any stranger.<br><br>i'm sure i have treaded on many (female) toes here. just sharing an experience, and generalising. don't come and reply me saying, eh not all sg girls are like that, i know alot of malaysian girls so this that and the other.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>maybe that KL wedding i shot was a very RARE case. let's see if i get the chance to shoot in KL more often.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
