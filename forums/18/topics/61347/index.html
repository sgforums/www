            <div class='col-md body'>Cop jailed, career over because of oral sex<br>A POLICE sergeant has been jailed for two years and faces the sack after he was found guilty of having oral sex with a 16-year-old.<br><br>She was above the age of consent and agreed to perform the act, but Annis Abdullah, 27, of the Police Coast Guard, landed in court because oral sex is against the law.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>The girl made a police report after the incident.<br><br>The court heard that they got to know each other through an Internet chatroom in March last year, met and kept in touch.<br><br>On April 23 last year, she met him at the Jurong Entertainment Centre and he drove her to Chinese Garden Road where they engaged in heavy petting in the car.<br><br>When he asked if she wanted to have sex, she said no. She agreed to perform oral sex on him, but a week later she made a police report.<br><br>Lawyer Ismail Hamid pleaded for leniency, saying Annis did not force the teenager to perform oral sex.<br><br>He was a first-time offender, the sole breadwinner for his family and engaged to be married.<br><br>But Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Wee Soon told the court earlier that as a law enforcer, Annis should have known better than to 'engage in carnal intercourse against the order of nature' with the girl.<br><br>District judge Wong Keen Onn agreed, and jailed him for two years yesterday.<br><br>He told Annis that as a serving police officer, he should have known what was right and wrong and his behaviour ought to have been exemplary.<br><br>A police spokesman said last night: 'We have no place for ill-disciplined officers. We are taking disciplinary action with the view to terminating the services of the errant officer.'<br><br>Lawyers contacted yesterday said it was not common for cases of consensual oral sex to land up in court.<br><br>But veteran criminal lawyer Subhas Anandan explained: 'The act by itself is an offence. It is not a question of consent or no consent. Even between consenting people, it is an offence.'<br><br>Technically, he said, a woman who performs the act can also be charged with helping to commit a crime, but he was not aware of any such case.<br><br>Criminal lawyer Sarbrinder Singh said: 'Cases of oral sex being brought to court are not common, simply because the nature of the act is such that it is almost always consensual.'<br><br>The maximum punishment for the offence is life imprisonment.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let's distinguish the difference between him being jailed becos he committed the crime, rather than becos he deserved it. Especially the part where he was intimate with another woman yet was engaged to another. The law doesn't, or shouldn't take into account that he's to be married in it's judgement.<br><br>As for oral sex being a crime, well it's a law, what to do? i don't agree with it, and i sure as hell will continue doing it, with or without "proper" sex afterwards (apparently it's ok to have oral sex as part of foreplay play leading to "real" sex?)<br><br>I think this case is more a "save face" thing for the law enforcers. becos he was a law enforcer, and so that the law doesn't lose it's respect, they have to deal with him severely, which IMO shouldn't be the case. i really do hope that the policeman was dealt with the SAME as any other civilian who would commit such a crime. i dun think this is so though, as the judge already said that as a law enforcer he should know better. since when does the law give leeway for ignorance? i'm no lawyer lar, someone educate me.</div>
