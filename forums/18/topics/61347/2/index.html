            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>When he asked if she wanted to have sex, she said no. She agreed to perform oral sex on him, but a week later she made a police report.<br><br>voluntarily and agreed are 2 different issue. </blockquote>Huh ~~!?!?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I think there is something wrong with your interpretation. Why do u seperate volunteering and agreeing ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> R u sure tis is how the law interprete the above statement ?<br><br>Look at section 39, penal code.<br><br><blockquote>A person is said to cause an effect Â“voluntarilyÂ” when he causes it by means whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it.<br><br>Illustration<br>A sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating a robbery, and thus causes the death of a person. Here A may not have intended to cause death, and may even be sorry that death has been caused by this act; yet, if he knew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death voluntarily.</blockquote>She consent to have oral sex and she knew about the end effect (they having oral sex). She by law, is also volunteering too. Please do not use our own understanding of English to interprete law...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> There is not such term as "agreeing"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the girl got away from the law because she made the report to the police voluntarily hence her lawyers could argue that she was the victim.Therefore the Judge took it to the case and did not jail her.Anyway she is young too..many factors could have help her.<br><br>Yah,Singpapore laws comparing  of female and males got some loopholes...we guys are unlucky lo if we ever got in tis stupid situation..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, few years ago, the law stated that oral sex is only legal when it lead to sex.<br><br>As for the police officer, he's stupid as he's a police officer.
