            <div class='col-md body'>In 1993, the University of Kentucky did a study to see why the head of<br>a man's penis was<br>larger than the shaft. After one year and $ 80,000.00, they concluded<br>that the reason the<br>head was larger than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure<br>during sex.<br>After the study was published, the University of South Carolina<br>decided to do their own<br>study. After $250,000.00, and 3 years of research, they concluded that<br>the reason was to<br>give the woman more pleasure during sex.<br>The University of Georgia, unsatisfied with these findings, conducted<br>their own study.<br>After 2 weeks and a cost of around $75.46, they concluded that it was<br>to keep a man's<br>hand from flying off and hitting him in the forehead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate<br>father to start their family. On the day the surrogate father was to<br>arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife and said, "I'm off. The man should be<br>here soon" Half an hour later, just by chance a door-to-door baby<br>photographer rang the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.<br><br>"Good morning, madam. I've come to...."<br>"Oh, no need to explain. I've been expecting you," Mrs. Smith cut in.<br>"Really?" the photographer asked. "Well, good. I've made a speciality of<br>babies"<br>"That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat"<br><br>After a moment, she asked, blushing, "Well, where do we start?"<br>"Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the<br>couch and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is<br>fun too; you can really spread out!"<br>"Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me"<br>"Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But, if we<br>try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven different<br>angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results"<br>"My, that's a lot of....." gasped Mrs. Smith.<br>"Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I'd love to be in<br>and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure"<br>"Don't I know it," Mrs. Smith said quietly.<br><br>The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his<br>baby pictures.<br>"This was done on the top of a bus in downtown London"<br>"Oh my God!" Mrs. Smith exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief.<br>"And these twins turned out exceptionally well, when you consider their<br>mother was so difficult to work with"<br>"She was difficult?" asked Mrs. Smith.<br>"Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job<br>done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get<br>a good look"<br>"Four and five deep?" asked Mrs. Smith, eyes widened in amazement.<br>"Yes," the photographer said, "And for more than three hours too. The<br>mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate.<br>Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally, when the<br>squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in."<br>Mrs. Smith leaned forward. "You mean squirrels actually chewed on your,<br>um......equipment?"<br>"That's right. Well, madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so we<br>can get to work."<br>"Tripod?????"<br>"Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big for<br>me to hold for very long. Madam? Madam? ....... Good Lord, she's<br>fainted!!"<br><br></div>

The doctor told him the next time he wanted to have<br>sex, to stick his<br>finger in his wife's pussy, and then rub it under his nose, and the<br>smell would cause his<br>hormones to kick in, and he would obtain an erection. That night, he<br>decided to make his<br>move. He turned out all the lights and got into bed. He put his finger<br>in her pussy, and then<br>rubbed it under his nose. He felt a tingling in his cock, and it began<br>to stiffen. Amazed, he<br>decided to see what would happen if he used two fingers. He stuck them<br>in her pussy, then<br>rubbed them both under his nose, and his cock quickly jumped to 3/4<br>erect. He decided to<br>try 3 fingers, so he put them in her pussy, then rubbed them all<br>around under his nose.<br>Soon he was sporting the biggest hard on he could remember. He said,<br>"Honey, quick<br>turn on the lights, and check this out!" She turned on the lights, and<br>with his dick standing<br>tall, he proudly asked, "What do you think?" She looked at him and<br>said, "Looks like the<br>worst nose bleed I've ever seen!"<br></div>
