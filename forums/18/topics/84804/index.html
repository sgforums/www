            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there ppl,<br>I have something to share with you. I also have a question to ask.<br>But most importantly I have a plea to make. Yes as always, being<br>the good net citizen I am, have read all the rules and had spent<br>the last couple of days going through some previous forums so as<br>not to start something that may have already been discussed before. It has, a matter of fact,being discussed before in sgforum but unfortunately I have not found what I am looking for. (The closest would be Chantel_99. But I doubt. Webcams were not used...LOL and it happened only recently.)<br><br>It concerns cybering (usually referred to as cybers*x). I do surf the net often but I seldom go to chat rooms. That was probably why it took me rather by surprise when it happened. It was work related<br>(honest). I was looking for some tips on VBA (no not "Very Big Asses" but "Visual Basic for Applications" ) in a specific user group chats room. I was mainly chatting with this one female user and there were not many other logon users (only the two of us most of the time).<br><br>Have to admit that I got rather flirtatious in those early hours of the morning. It became something like me asking this user about her<br>whereabouts (Would you believe it - she says she is local.<br>My main reason for this post.), about work, about the weather, about her vital statistics and about what she was wearing.<br>Mistake-mistake! never discuss about what the other party is wearing in a chat - it can be a massive turn-on - even though you know she not really "wearing a micro short nightdress that barely hides her panty and no bra" like she says. Well I told her I was only clad in a super macho black Calvin Klein microfibre seamless brief that could hardly hide my hard-on bulge. The hard-on bulge part was true though.) We eventually started a private chat and it really went ballastic!<br><br>It was astonishing to say the least. You simply cannot under-estimate the powers of written words and the wonders of the human imagination. There was this sense of "naughtyness" (forgive<br>me for the lack of words to use to describe it) about the whole thing that made it tantalizing. I do not know whether she eventually had an orgasm. I did not at that moment - but I did wank myself sore immediately after login off the PC.<br>And subsequently for the next few day I could not think of anything else but that experience (and yes I would mast*****e each time. The truth is I suspect I am now smitten to pieces by her). Come to think of it, if I weren't trembling so much that night I would have wank away during that chat. Nothing new really - do it all the time while surfing girlie sites (and no - I am not a sex maniac).<br><br>My question then: - From the things she said and her description of the local scene, I have absolutely no doubt that she is local<br>(local as in born and bred here). And I am positively sure she is straight. Do you ppl think she is QENUINE? Is she telling the truth about the fact that she is from around here?<br><br>The time has come. This post is becoming too long. The major reason for my post. I am now going to make an embarrassing<br>(but I am not ashamed) plea. People, this is a long shot,<br>desperate even, but here goes:-<br>"Whoever you are I am seeking you out like crazy. Please contact me!"<br><br>You people will probably suggest that I go back to that site.<br>Of course I did but unfortunately it was only after a while that I got<br>back and no luck subsequently. Yes I did use the same login handle.<br><br>I am a local chinese guy (with a "u" not an "a" ) and an IT professional. Most importantly I am "alien_from_Tantooine".<br><br>Thanks and cheers and let it flow forever (I mean the beer).<br></div>
