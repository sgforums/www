            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, Let me tell U guys my story.... 4 years ago, when I just graduated and just step out to the industry to work for just few months, I realized my GF is pregnant. We're together for 10 years and just ROM then. We've not much savings for marriage. Coupled with fears of telling our parents about this almost made me abort the child. My GF says no and we finally decided to face it. We told our parents and siblings and surprising, they're all very supportive and most willing to lend us money to tide us through. With their encouragment, we decided even more to keep our child and of course we've now few big obstacles to cross - (1) prepare marriage which is a race against time cos her stomach is getting bigger each day. (2) saving for marriage and later for the child's delivery (3) saving for buying flat later on and renovations (4) saving for child's expenditure after he is born like diapers and nanny, etc. All these are pressure in front of us that we're goingto face.....<br><br>sorry guys... will continue tomorrow cos need to fetch my wife now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Stop lying to yourself. The reason you want to abort is not because you care for the baby, but because of your own selfish reasons.

The only difference between it and what you consider a "normal" baby is that it has not been born yet.<br><br>Ask yourself this... is your future, your studies, justify the taking of another's life? There are so many other options. Do not blind yourself to them. Stop stating reasons like shame and future and money, these are just excuses. But I tell you, if you really go through with it and see your child in a jar, all torn up, immediately you know that you have done a very, very wrong thing, and that's gonna be with you for the rest of your life.<br><br>Your child is a living individual, not a simple piece of tissue that you can just discard for four hundred dollars. Ask yourself, when it comes to the bottom line, is it even barely justified? Not a chance, never. There's no grounds you can justify the killing of your child, not what her parents might say, not what your parents might say.<br><br>And your studies... are you telling me you are <strong>willing to sacrifice your child for a piece of paper saying that you have studied</strong>? Is a piece of paper worth having blood on your hands.<br><br>Don't do it, just don't do it.

I mean people shouldn't be so quick to comment and scold when they themselves are not in the situation...</div></blockquote>yes.. you are right. then again.. i would never have walked into that situation. but i guess its too late now to regret rite? whats done is done.. reality check.<br><br>but i suggest u find some councillors.. and discuss yr options.. but somehow... dunno why ppl always walk into situations like this.. when warn them before hand not to do it, they say old fashion, and flame and scold us. when things go wrong, they say, shouldn't be quick to comment and stuff. i'd symphatize with them... but part of me feel that they deserve the trauma, when they ignored all warnings. pls lor, sex education is kinda common now.. ppl warning the youths to stay away from premarital sex, but they push it away like the passing wind. and they got into deep sh!t.. whose to blame?</div>
