Let them know abt it, even if they are angry or wad, they will still 4gif what both of u have done!! At least, they will come together to figure a solution!!!  After all, Blood is thicker than Water....pls do think abt it....Abortion is e easy way but never e best way !! Pls do inform your parents...Whatever u do, at least 20years down e road, u will not regret....once done is done!!!<br><br>Hope my little advise can help u....Good Luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rox,  this is not flaming or scolding you.. but if I am your father, I would  not hesitate to give you a tight slap. If I am your girlfriend father, don't even think of what i will do to you.  But regardless, both fathers would want the truth.  You ( and your gf) make a mistake, so be it, face the music and live on.  Two WRONG do not make one Right.  Discuss with both family before making a rash decision.</div>

But you have to face the facts. Everyone is diffrent. from what he sounds like, it's going to be more trouble then better to keep the baby, both for the couple, their parents and the baby.</div></blockquote>So in short, nobody wants to take care of the child, so let's just kill it. Let it take the fall for everyone's selfishness.<br><br>No! Love and cherish your child, irregardless of what situtation it was concieved in. There are women who love a child concieved of incest and rape, because they know that the child is innocent, and should not take the fall for OUR failings.<br><br><blockquote><strong>And you haven't been through what people call actual bith giving. You kept saying you will give the baby to a good and caring couple, spent months working out looking for someone who actually cares. In the end, you gave birth and it's a life~! Not just something in the body you can't see anymore. You'll feel diffrent and will take back everything you said about putting he/she up for adoption no mater what and you will swear to keep and protect your own baby no mater what it takes.</strong></blockquote><br><br>An oxymoron, and one that screams in the face of logic and reason itself.<br><br>Basically the reasoning goes "aiyah, if put him up for adoption I will feel bad, might as well take his fate into my own hands and kill him."<br><br>If I cannot have my baby... no one will have him...<br><br>Gee, that sure is a the "loving logic" of why people justify abortion over adoption.<br><br>Yes, you must protect your own child, and failing that, at the very least give him a fighting chance for safety and future in the hands of another. To kill an unborn child is utter nonsense, it's simply giving up on the child. But then again, since when were abortions for the good of the child? They were mostly to sastify our selfish desires for an easy way out.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You showed so many pictures of unborned babies being aborted aka killed. But you must also know that the fact more babies die after birth. and some even left at garbage bins, rivers, buried.</strong></blockquote><br><br>What is clear is that apparently you do not know the truth here. Every year, <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">13,000</span> babies are aborted in Singapore </strong>on average, that means one out of three, or four babies never made it out EACH YEAR.<br><br>Can you say that we have <span style="font-style: italic;">anywhere</span> near that number abandoned in garbage bins and rivers and buried in Singapore? Know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. The truth is, <span class="large">abortion is the worst possible massacare of innocent infants every put together since 1973, more then any know of infantcide, neglect and even malnutrition <span style="font-style: italic;">put together</span>.</span><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Number of abortions per year: Approximately 46 Million<br>Number of abortions per day: Approximately 126,000<br><br>78% of all abortions are obtained in developing countries and 22% occur in developed countries.<br></strong></span><br><br>Infant mortality rates from other causes don't even come a whisper close to matching this horrendus statistic.<br><br>And best, 70+ percent of abortions worldwide are done in developed counties, where the baby had a perfectly good chance of having a decent life, had their parents been bothered to just love their child like normal people do.<br><br>More babies die then from other causes then from abortion... UTTER RUBBISH! Please do your homework before you post thank you.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Advices are for the better of things. Not the pity of the baby.</strong></blockquote>And the better of things is to give this child a fighting chance, it's not pity of the baby (though shame on you if you had no compassion for this child who is so unwanted because of his parent's selfish reasons), it just pure logic, and one you should take note of.<br><br>The heart of the matter is, abortion is an utterly repungant and discusting assualt on the person, both parent and child to be even considered an option. And that's why I oppose it vermently... it's not an option, it can never be if you knew the real truth behind it.<br><br>To illustrate a point, slavery of the blacks was accepted back last time because it was legal and everyone was doing it. But was it the right thing? Like abortion, a slave trader can give a lot of funny reasons like he needs an income and future that's why he needs to put blacks under slavery, would we accept it? Would we even consider his 'reasons'? Even if it was legal now? Never, not anybody with half a conscience.</div>

Rox, don't look at bloody statistics. That's what we've been fed all our lives. Think what's most important to YOU and YOUR FUTURE. If an abortion is imminent, get it done. You won't live with guilt as you did what you think was best. Get on with your life and don't repeat the double-barrel-sawn-off-shotgun episode.

No one gets hurt, no tempers flare, and everything will be normal. Your wounds (if any) will heal and you have a 2nd chance to 'not screw up' your life.<br><br>So to those people who screamed foul play, I really hope that the same situation doesn't happen to you.

Do u ever think about it..what if it happens on u when u are merely 20 years old? Not all parents are e open-minded kind...not all can accept e wrong of his children and be gossiped by neighbours..relatives...maybe most of u come from a fortunate family...<br><br>Do reflect this situation upon yourself and see how u will handle it. No one will go for e abortion if everything is right, who would...esp e girl who bears e child...in her own stomach.<br><br>Dont just judge by e surface of e problem. Some giving him alot of pressure by claiming him as murderer etc. Its not helping him in any ways. Maybe e guy should really seek professional help instead of people here who aren't professional in handling it.
