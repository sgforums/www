            <div class='col-md body'>yeah its too late to regret that u 2 Opps! did it again! and even got fruit of love.<br>anyway... some people already suggested where the places are to get an abortion.<br>but please bear in mind. some people cannot give birth anymore after an abortion. especially if she's the weak body kind i think you better remind her that too.<br>but this consist of her future's stake. maybe you two can check with the doctor to see if he can determine whether she can give birth in the future anot.<br>you noe wat im saying? yes you 2 can't have the baby. i also agree. 20 years old nia. how to have baby. still haven't finish studies. she can't go school with big stomach also right.<br>hai. its such a fault.<br>the final decision is you and hers but i think u have to let your girl friend see the <strong>COMMENTS</strong> in this whole forum to let her have an idea wat might happen to her after the abortion.<br>if she wants the baby. i have to say. u gotta give her the decision. the ultimate decision should be hers.<br></div>
