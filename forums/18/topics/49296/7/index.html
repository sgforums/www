            <div class='col-md body'>well, i suppose all have chided you about your irresponsibility, and i will do likewise. it is indeed unethical for your girlfriend to abort the child, especially so when she doen't want to bring shame to her family. she should face the consequences of her actions. if say, she had health problems, then abortion is inevitable. if you can't support the child, there's always adoption agencies. who are we to play God and dispense life or death? do you think abortion simplifies things... if your girlfriend thinks so, i'd gathered that she is a pretty shallow person. there'll be grief, and also from there henceforth, you will look at each other in a different perspective.<br>in any ways, the decision is ultimately up to you guys, and i do sincerely hope you do what is right.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

I am focused. I can kill without regret in such a situation. My only regret would be the money wasted on the Abortion. Once i almost had to deal with it. But i think it was either a false alarm or she miscarried. So i took the money that would have been for the abortion, bought myself a new Digital Camera and took her out to dinner...and had change to spare.<br><br>Murder is defined as Illegal killing. Since it is Legal...heh! Kill away baby!<br><br>Both are unwanted cells growing inside of a body. Only difference, Pregnancy is much easier to cure.</div>
