If it is really not possible, dont force yourself and her...go for e abortion. If u think going thru an abortion is an easy way out, its not... the torment and guilt your gf is going to suffer is intense...esp e first few months after she just aborted...its e aftermath...its not going to be easy for e both of u. Weigh e difficulties and situations u have to go thru, come out with e best decision.<br><br>I know alot of people here are against your abortion. Yes, its cruel...but sometimes in this realistic world...without understanding and supportive parents...keeping it is not an option..esp at such a young age. I bet most of e people here didn't really went thru what u are going thru now. Its a tough decision. Both options, u will be blamed, look down by people and gossips behind. Be prepared for all these. Most importantly is e feelings of your GF, be there for her at all times..help her go thru e whole ordeal. Ultimately its u and your GF, no matter what others say, as long as u two have decided what to do, go ahead with it and dont regret it.<br><br>Be it good or bad, hope everything will be settled soon for u <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best advice is still to find a counseler to help you. They got plenty of numbers you can call.<br><br>If you plan to keep they baby, they knoe plenty of help in advice and groups which can help financially.<br><br>If you need to talk with the parents, they can help ease things and make you, your GF and your parents understand the situation better.<br><br>How your parents, your GF's parents will punish you and your GF for not having the diciplin to control your sex life is another thing and you must face the facts that you are guilty and won't ever be able to run away from that guilt.<br><br>So You either make 1 of the 2 choices now or risk a more higher error ratio when aborting or a higher punnishment panelty for not telling.<br><br>Whichever choice you choose.

I bet most of e people here didn't really went thru what u are going thru now. Its a tough decision. Both options, u will be blamed, look down by people and gossips behind. Be prepared for all these. Most importantly is e feelings of your GF, be there for her at all times..help her go thru e whole ordeal. Ultimately its u and your GF, no matter what others say, as long as u two have decided what to do, go ahead with it and dont regret it.<br><br>Be it good or bad, hope everything will be settled soon for u <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>There is no justifying murder.

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe you should know your child a little better... 8 weeks... right?<br><br>A growing baby with all organs and body systems in place, 8 weeks.  His/her unique fingerprints are visible under a microscope, never to change except in size. The creases on the child's hands are also visible and external genitals appear.  The eyes, nose and mouth are evident and all 20 milk teeth buds are present. The baby first moves (6th to 7th week) and if the lips are stroked the child bends the upper body to one side and makes a quick backward movement.  At 8 weeks, tickling the preborn's nose will cause him to flex his head backwards away from the stimulus.   Tapping the amniotic sac results in arm movements. The preborn swims in the amniotic fluid with a natural swimmer's stroke.  At the end of the 7th week the child's central nervous system has reached a highly developed state.  At 40 days the skeleton begins to develop into cartilage.  The movement of electrical impulses through the neural fibers and spinal column takes place between 6 and 7 weeks and at the end of the second month most parts of the adult skeleton can be identified, as well as most named nerves and muscles. At only 40 days after fertilization electrical waves as measured by the EEG can be recorded from the baby's brain, indicating brain functioning ... and yes, he/she is quite human.<br><br>Women are the ultimate victims of abortion with many long-term effects.  An abortionist stretches the womb opening in 30 to 60 seconds, instead of 12 or more hours of naturally labor Â– tearing the muscles. If the woman becomes pregnant again, the muscular door has been weakened -- tending to open way ahead of time.  Women who've had abortions who later seek children face these additional risks:<br><br><strong>During the 1st three months there is twice the chance of miscarriage.<br>During the second trimester there is ten times the chance of miscarriage.<br>There is three times the chance of premature delivery.<br>After birth: 2There is two times the chance of infant death. </strong><br><br>Need any more evidence to reconsider your desision?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please think for the future. Now you are in a crisis, that's why your ability to think clearly, and stay in touch with reality, not to mention your sense of conscience has been compromised, making you vulnerable to considering horrendus ideas like aborting a perfectly wonderful child.<br><br>Recently there was this story of a seventeen year old mother... if somebody even younger can me can make it why can't you... stop making excuses... yes it's gonna be a drain on your finances and time (that's part of being a parent). But it's not as if you are gonna end up on the roadside begging for food because of it.<br><br>I tell you the truth, this is more a matter of you not wanting to face up to your responsibility and doing what you have to do rather then the child being impossible to support. Search your heart, you just want the easy, 400 dollar way out rather then face a little hardship and difficult times now until things work out, and raising an individual which needs you, and loves you.<br><br>Stop listening to the lies that tell you that you cannot keep this child, it is all nonsense. The real truth is, if you want, you can. Don't be a victim of your own delusion.<br><br>Do the right thing.. don't abort.</div>
