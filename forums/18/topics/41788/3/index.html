Don't know if the guys will enjoy this anyway,<br><br>Never put insert the penis into the mouth straightaway. Licking the penis head with slow movement with your hand running down the groin area and caressing the a55hole. Slowly push the penis into the mouth and keeping the teeth away by controlling your jaw muscles. Make sure you ample saliva in your mouth by now and wetting your lips as frequently as possible with your tongue moving around the penis and your mouth. Continue working with your hand squeeze the balls lightly, and work your mouth and tip of your tongue on the penis head as much as possible for about a min or 2. Push the penis further into your mouth shrinking your jaw muscles as you do it always remember to keep those teeth away gal if not it will hurt greatly. Put only 3/4 of the penis in your mouth and suck away look at your guy as you do it, pop in and out of your mouth moving your hands onto his nipples twitching lightly. When you think he is hard enough to maximum, insert the whole thing into your mouth and if able squeeze your jaw muscle again and do a deep throat by opening your throat as the penis move down. This give the guys a feeling like a virgin hole really tight and erotic. When you feel him quiver... move slowly up the penis and continue doing what you can do... can also repeat the steps again but not in sequence pls.. it will get boring after a while. When hes really high and horny, he will push your head up and down automatically, do not be offended as he do not mean to take u as sex object but juz he cannot control the feeling, he just need more than the slow ones.. he need to pump harder.. either that he will want to have the penis in your vaginal now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Enough information why now the guys like to have blowjobs? Because if the girl is good, they really enjoy it but they do not know in the midst of asking every gal to do it, some girls are not as skilful and will tend to hurt the guy, the guy will find it boring and some ONS guys will blame the girl and not having a good night fun. Choose the right gals to do it.. not all gals can do it and not all gals enjoy it like not all men enjoy licking a pussy right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!</div>
