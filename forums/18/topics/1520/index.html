            <div class='col-md body'>I am a newcomer to this forum. I thought the topic posted are interesting, honest and certainly very human. I think I might like to talk about a matter and see the readers' point of view .....<br><br>I got to know this girl way back during my National Service days. She signed-on then as a Regular and we happened to be in the same basic courses. And like some old movies where the lead actor and actress found themselves close after a while. It happened likewise to us too. I have no regrets and I thought we have it made.<br><br>The blow came 4 months after we finished the basic courses and moved into the professional courses. I presisted, hanging on and tried means and ways to make her feel good only to discover that I am 3rd in line. I thought heaven was unfair; I felt cheated. She left the Forces soon after that. And that was it; I was shattered, devestated and I felt so unfair then.<br><br>I began to hate girls, and a whole lot of them. Not to the extent of killing them (Hahaha) but rather I was mean, very mean to them. Things went on like these for almost 2 years. It was only when I completed my National Service did I finally laid the ghost of my insecurities to rest.<br><br>Now I am a contented working guy. I had long since moved on to my current relationship where my lady and I are happily planning for our future. And so I thought it would be fine for me to re-contact the girl then, not because I want to have a go at her but just want to keep in contact. I told her close friend about it and I was rejected flat on my face.<br><br>Her sms reads like this:<br>"If he wanna keep in contact with me, he would have done so long time ago. Why wait till now, let things remain the way it is"<br><br>I respect her decision. I just wonder why can't someone she dumped back then cannot be her friend now? Am I so unpopular in her world? Did I ever hint that I want to win her heart back? All I can think of now is that she is being her own selfish ways again. She shut me off her life back then and she commented that I didn't have this intention to contact her till now. Is this fair to me again?<br><br>I can only say to myself that she's not worth it but it's too bad; I'll always be someone she'll avoid all her life and I hate that status. I thought I deserve something better than that.<br><br>Perhaps it's a good lesson for those who lost their usual contacts; better buck up on that area or risk being push away again.<br><br>Thanks for listening, I'm sure I'm not the only one who tasted such unpleasant thing.<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br></div>
