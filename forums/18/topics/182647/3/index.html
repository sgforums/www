            <div class='col-md body'>Stop skinning people alive. It's getting boring.<br><br>And gr2012, beg for mercy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>First I would strip you naked and tie you up. Taking a blade, I would slowly cut your stomach. Not enough to kill, just enough to bleed. Taking a fork, I would poke at the wounds, forcing it to bleed. After I've collected around 100 ML of blood, I would mix the blood with urine and force-open your mouth, pouring the mixture into your mouth.<br><br>Next I would cut off your toes. All of them. But before that, I would pluck out your nails, and force them into your wounds at the stomach. After I cut off your toes, I would cut them into much smaller pieces. Then I would mix it with raw eggs and force feed you.<br><br>After that, I'll cut off your right leg, while collecting the blood you would lose. I would cut your right leg into three parts. One for the dog, one for you(SOUP), one for Mother Nature. After I fed you your right leg (or a part of it), I would take all the blood i collected and force it down your throat, again. Then, I'll bloat you up with water, and then jump on to your stomach, causing your nails to pierce even deeper into your flesh, while causing you to vomit.<br><br>If you ain't dead yet, I would let you go. Simply because you cannot run anyway.</div>
