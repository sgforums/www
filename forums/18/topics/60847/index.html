Depending on how much risk you wanna take, you can invest in penny stocks(short-term) or blue chips(usually long-term). Also, do not only invest in one sector. You should diverge and invest in a basket of stocks from the different sectors to minimise risk.<br><br>However, if you are not so much of a risk-taker, you might think about investing in bonds or unit trusts, which may take a longer period before you see your gains but is much steadier, meaning even if you lost, it wouldn't be as heavy a penalty to pay as if you invest aggressively.<br><br>There are also various insurance policies that are useful to investors. You might want to check them out. Or you may want to seek a financial advisor for advice for saving, investing, and insurance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
