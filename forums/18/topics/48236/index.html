            <div class='col-md body'>Not all first attractions has to be attracted to lust or love. It can be simply a compliment of ur looks. When i'm attracted to some gal on the street that doesn't mean i like her or wanna hump her in my thoughts, sometimes i just think that the gal has a good sense of dressing lor.<br><br>i do agree that man is by nature manipulated by lust. He is only restrained through the chains of so-called morality. I think deep down in everyone's mind, if there's no such thing as law and ethics, all would be commiting mass orgies, adultery, incest and the likes</div>
