But you'd still appreciate the food you'll eat, whatever it might be.  I wouldn't know if this girl was right for me unless she was able to make me happy in every, if not most, aspects.

You assumed that people in the past hardly had pre-marital sex.  I might be assuming that a woman shouldn't be hurt 10 years dlater for what you both wanted to do.  But you made it sound like you're taking a blame for something that both parties consented to.  What's the point?<br><br>Anyway, you have your views, mate.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it depends on what kinda perspective u are looking at sex... to have sex to have babies? or to have sex for fun? to have sex to closer e bond between u and your partner. I feel that sex even though not a necessity is also a good way of consoling, soothing, comforting yourself or your partner in any ways. It definitely closer e bond between e 2 of u coz u 2 are 'connected in one way'. Understanding them, just purely oneself without makeup, clothings or anything that can hide their flaws... appreciate them e way they are naturally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
