            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>"Come on Lilly, I donÂ’t have all day." I looked at my beautiful toddler with frustration because she was intently trying to stuff a quarter in her pocket, and she would not move any farther until she had accomplished this goal. I wanted to get to the store and home before the ice storm, which had been forecast to hit within the next couple of hours. I had been unreasonably grouchy today for some reason; maybe because it was coming up on a full moon, maybe because the next door neighbor had just started on a career of drum playing or maybe because I had not had sex in 3 weeks. When Lilly finally achieved her mission she hopped into the car and I strapped her into the car seat.<br><br>I heaved a big sigh and walked around to the other side of the car, carefully getting in so as not to cause any further pain to the left side of my body, which had been badly bruised when I fell on the ice after the last ice storm, two weeks ago. I sighed again as I started the car. Why was I so unsatisfied? I had every kind of physical comfort and was not lacking for anything except my man. He was still gone and I had no idea when I would see him again because of stupid military bureaucracy. I had a brand new car, with a sun roof, a beautiful home and any time I wanted to I could go out to eat or fix a meal of my choosing without having to worry about how I was going to pay for it. We were financially better than we had ever been and little Lilly sure was a sweetheart; she made me laugh all the time now with her antics. She was really a good girl most of the time.<br><br>As I backed out of the driveway, I smiled and waved to the neighbor, wanting to ask her if she knew how long her son was going to keep it up on the drums. I started thinking of the relationships I had experienced in my life, my vehicle almost automatically taking me to my destination. I reached up to turn on the Queen cd and started listening to "Bohemian Rhapsody." My reflective reverie was interrupted by the sound of my little girl singing "Mamaaaaaa...oo..oooo..ooo" along with Queen. "What a girl," I laughingly thought to myself. "They singing mama," she informed me knowingly.<br><br>I pulled into the parking lot of the grocery store and noticed that there were a lot of people out and about. Everyone must have had the same idea, to get to the store and stock up. I pulled in next to the cart corral and Lilly immediately noticed the bus cart. Though I dreaded the thought of pushing that behemoth around the store I knew that I would never hear the end of it if I denied her heartÂ’s desire to ride in the beast. You have to choose your battles. I would prefer to wrestle a shopping cart the size of a small vehicle through the aisles of the store rather than listen to her incessant prattling whines as to why she could not ride in the bus. After all, she wouldnÂ’t understand if I tried to explain to her that mommy has depth perception problems and fears running into things and people. She would not care that mommy does not want to be the loudest shopper in the store because of the amplification of the mini-bus wheels. The things we do for our children.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I loaded the water jugs into the cart, got Lilly out of her car seat and in the shopping bus and headed for the store. Why did I have to notice so many good-looking men tonight? Everyone was looking at us and smiling; they must have all had children of their own, I assumed. I felt a little sense of camaraderie with the woman pushing the shopping police car, which carried three little boys. "At least I only have one," I thought to myself with relief. Then my breath caught in my throat as I saw him. It was Stone Adair. The last time I saw him was 1993. Oh my God, I had such a crush on him back then. The first time I met him was on the volleyball league we had joined in 1989. I was 23 and he was somewhere between 18 and 20. I thought I was so much older than him back then. Ironically, my first daughter was just about the same age as Lilly when we had met. He looked better than I had even remembered him. He is the type who ages well. "LetÂ’s see," I thought, "he must be in his late 30's." Tall and lean with sandy brown hair and mischievous eyes. He was by himself and he really had hardly changed at all in the last 14 years.<br><br>I spoke to him. "Stone, do you remember me?"<br>"Linda? God, you havenÂ’t changed a bit. No, wait...you look even better than you did last time I saw you! Who is this?" he asked.<br><br>"I Lilly," my little girl retorted. "ThatÂ’s my mommy." She looked at me and then back at him, missing nothing.<br><br>"How are you doing Stone?"<br>"I just got divorced," he said.<br>"I got divorced in 2002 and now I am re-married."<br>We talked like this for about 20 minutes until I realized that the sky was really starting to get ominous outside. I told him that I was very glad to see him and asked him where he lived. When he told me I could not believe my ears. Come to find out he lived on the same street as we did. For some reason that thought sent chills up my spine. I shook his hand and could feel longing in his touch as he smiled at me and said goodbye. He said, "Sometimes I get so lonely since the divorce."<br><br>Then I did something that I thought I would never do. I told him, "Remember when we met at the grocery store back when Katie was this age,Â” pointing to Lilly. "I so much wanted to invite you over to the house to help me with my volleyball skills."<br><br>"I almost followed you home that day," he responded.<br>The rest of the shopping trip was a blur for me. I wanted him so bad I could feel my desire in my stomach and between my thighs. I knew that he wanted me too. It had already started to ice when I got to the car and I noticed that there was someone sitting in the car next to mine. It was him! My legs were shaking with anticipation at the thought of what I knew was about to happen. He rolled down his window and said, "Would you like me to scrape the ice off your car while you warm it up?" I looked at him and told him that I would really appreciate that. I watched him; his lean frame and soft, boyish face were titillating my senses.<br><br>"There you go," he said when he was finished. "Let me follow you home<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so I know that you donÂ’t get in trouble on the road."<br><br>"O.K," I said, knowing that he was following me home for more than that.<br><br>The road was really slick and I was extremely glad when I pulled into my driveway and opened the garage door, relieved that I was finally in the shelter of my home. I got out of the car and waved at Stone as he drove past my house. I was in a state of anticipation, knowing that I had not seen the end of him.<br><br>I went about my usual tasks...getting Lilly out of the car and the groceries out of the trunk all the while thinking of Stone and how much I wanted to see him again. I put the groceries away and got ready for my favorite part of the day; LillyÂ’s nap time. I read her a couple of stories and as soon as I knew she was going to succumb to sleep I headed downstairs to make a fire. After lighting the fire, I lay on the couch and watched the ice softly beating down on the window and covering the trees with a beautiful silver winter blanket.<br><br>There was a knock on my door. Knowing intuitively that it was Stone, I went to the door with a pounding heart. He held my ice scraper in his hand.<br><br>"I forgot to return this," he smiled sheepishly.<br>"Oh, thank you...I wouldnÂ’t want to be without it next time I ventured out," I responded. "Would you like to come in for some coffee?"<br><br>"That does sound awfully tempting," said his words while his eyes said, "I want you more than words can express."<br><br>Leaving his shoes and coat at the door he followed me up the stairs. I got the coffee ready and we chatted some more. I asked him if he would like BaileyÂ’s in his coffee and he told me that would be wonderful. I told him about my fall on the ice and he said that he had become a physical therapist after leaving the army and would I like him to see if he could help get rid of some of my pain. Shyly I said, "Please do." We went downstairs and I showed him where it hurt. He told me that he knew some great techniques and asked me if I would like to lie down.<br><br>I was full of anticipation and my body was responding to just the thought of his touch. As I lay down in front of the fireplace he softly whispered, "You are so beautiful. You donÂ’t know how many times I have thought about you over the years." As his hands started softly caressing my side I looked at him and told him that I had wanted him since the first time I laid eyes on him.<br><br>Giving up all pretense he moved his hand to my neck and lifted my hair. He bent down and softly kissed my neck. I breathed in a deep sigh of longing and contentment. At this moment in time I needed him more than anything and I was in heaven. He started kissing my earlobe and sucking on it. As he did this he put his hand inside my shirt and softly but firmly caressed my back, my shoulders and my neck.<br><br>He brought his lips down to the small of my back where my pants met my shirt. Raising my shirt, he slid his tongue across my lower back and up my spine. My desire was mounting with every touch. He lifted off my shirt and unsnapped my bra. Gently lifting me into his lap<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he removed my bra and cupped his hands over my breasts. He played with my nipples with his fingers while his tongue and mouth played with my neck, shoulders and earlobes.<br><br>I turned myself around to face him. Smiling, I put my arms around him and kissed him deeply. Our eyes were closed and we were lost in that kiss for what seemed like an eternity. When we came up for air we were both breathing heavily and we could feel our hearts beating as one. He playfully asked me if my side felt better. I told him that I did not feel any pain in my side but that I was aching somewhere else. He asked me where I was aching and instead of telling him I lifted his hand and placed it between my legs. He whispered, "I have some therapy for that too." Then he grabbed my hand and pressed it between his legs. I could feel his swollen member through his jeans.<br><br>I wanted to set it free. I unbuttoned and unzipped his pants and reached in to feel the warmth of his thick, hard shaft. I was a hungry animal; I roughly pulled down his pants and started rubbing up and down on his penis with vigor. I got on my knees and with my hand wrapped around the base of his shaft I bent down and licked the head of his penis. I could taste pre-cum as I teased the head with my mouth. I wrapped my right hand softly around his balls, rubbed my left hand up and down in a rhythmic motion and licked the head circularly with my tongue.<br><br>I did this for a while and then when I thought he was getting used to my technique I changed it and swallowed him whole, sucking greedily. He winced with pleasure as I continued to latch on to his cock with my mouth while I alternately squeezed lightly on his balls and then firmly grabbed his ass.<br><br>"Oh my God," he gesticulated and moaned. I unbuttoned and unzipped my pants and tore them off with my underwear. Flinging them aside, I got on top of him and guided his throbbing member into my tight wetness. I pressed my breasts into his chest and kissed him passionately as I rode up and down on him with force.<br><br>"Mmmmm...mmmmm...mmmmmm. Yes, God yes," I cried. I put my hand to my swollen clit and started rubbing it greedily as I continued to ride him, though not as forcefully as before, but methodically. I made myself cum this way and as he felt my juices being released and my pussy starting to spasm he could not contain himself any longer. He grimaced and grunted with pleasure and I felt his hot cum squirting into my body.<br><br>We laid there in ecstasy for quite some time, not able to move. Finally I said we should get up so Lilly would not find us like this. He reluctantly agreed. We got dressed. As I pulled on my jeans I felt some of his cum sliding out of my body. We smelled like sex and we were both more than satisfied. "I have a confession to make," he told me as he was getting ready to leave. "I'm really not a physical therapist."<br><br>I laughed and said, "Well you sure gave me some good therapy!"<br>As he opened the door to the storm outside he looked at me with amazement and said, "We will do this again."<br><br>"I know that," I replied as I gave him a hug and a kiss and told him to be careful in the ice. Closing the door I sighed with contentment and smiled to myself.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_<br>Can anyone tell me why my previous story was closed? Was it nasty?<br></div>
