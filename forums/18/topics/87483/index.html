            <div class='col-md body'>Don't Lie to Mom<br><br>John invited his mother over for dinner. During the meal, his mother couldn't help noticing how beautiful John's roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between John and his roommate, and this only made her more curious.<br><br>Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, John volunteered, "I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just roommates."<br><br>About a week later, Julie came to John and said, "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?" John said, "Well, I doubt it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure."<br><br>So he sat down and wrote "Dear Mother, I'm not saying you did take a gravy ladle from my house, and I'm not saying you did not take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner."<br><br>Several days later, John received a letter from his mother which read: "Dear Son, I'm not saying that you do sleep with Julie, and I'm not saying that you do not sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now. Love, Mom."<br><br>Lesson of the day...Don't Lie To Your Mother.</div>

"Forgive me father, for I have sinned."<br><br>"What is your sin, my child?" the priest asks back.<br><br>"Well," the man starts, "I used some horrible language this week and I feel absolutely terrible."<br><br>"When did you do use this awful language?" said the priest.<br><br>"I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was going to go over 250 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only about 100 yards."<br><br>"Is that when you swore?"<br><br>"No, Father." Said the man. "After that, a squirrel ran out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in his mouth and began to run away."<br><br>"Is THAT when you swore?" asked the priest again.<br><br>"Well, no," said the man, "You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!"<br><br>"Is THAT when you swore?" asked the amazed priest.<br><br>"No, not yet." The man replied. "As the eagle carried the squirrel away in his claws, it flew towards the green. And as it passed over a bit of forest near the green, the squirrel dropped my ball."<br><br>"Did you swear THEN?" asked the now impatient priest.<br><br>"No, because as the ball fell it struck a tree, bounced through some bushes, careened off a big rock, and rolled through a sand trap onto the green and stopped within six inches of the hole."<br><br>"You missed the %#$*&amp; putt, didn't you?" sighed the priest.<br></div>

No honey for you for one month!"<br><br>Later that afternoon, Johnny pondered upon some butterflies, and soon started catching them and crushing them under his feet.

            <div class='col-md body'>Why Did The Chicken Cross The Road?(Note replies are punchlines. If you don't get it it's ok <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)<br><br>JERRY FALWELL:<br>Because the chicken was gay! Isn't it obvious? Can't you people see the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the "other side." That's what "they" call it: the "other side." Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And, if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like "the other side." That chicken should not be free to cross the road. It's as plain and simple as that.<br><br>KEN STARR:<br>I intend to prove that the chicken crossed the road at the behest of the President of the United States of America in an effort to distract law enforcement officials and the American public from the criminal wrongdoing our highest elected official has been trying to cover up. As a result, the chicken is just another pawn in the president's ongoing and elaborate scheme to obstruct justice and undermine the rule of law. For that reason, my staff intends to offer the chicken unconditional immunity provided he co-operates fully with our investigation. Furthermore, the chicken will not be permitted to reach the other side of the road until our investigation and any Congressional follow-up investigations have been completed. (We also are investigating whether Sid Blumenthal has leaked information to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, alleging the chicken to be homosexual in an effort to discredit any useful testimony the bird may have to offer, or at least to ruffle his feathers.)<br><br>PAT BUCHANAN:<br>To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.<br><br>DR. SEUSS:<br>Did the chicken cross the road?<br>Did he cross it with a toad?<br>Yes!<br>The chicken crossed the road,<br>But why it crossed,<br>I've not been told!<br><br>ERNEST HEMINGWAY:<br>To die. In the rain.<br><br>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.:<br>I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.<br><br>GRANDPA:<br>In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.<br><br>ARISTOTLE:<br>It is in the nature of chickens to cross the road.<br><br>KARL MARX:<br>It was a historical inevitability.<br><br>SADDAM HUSSEIN:<br>This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.<br><br>RONALD REAGAN:<br>What chicken?<br><br>CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK:<br>To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.<br><br>FOX MULDER:<br>You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it?<br><br>FREUD:<br>The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.<br><br>BILL GATES:<br>I have just released eChicken 98, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.<br><br>EINSTEIN:<br>Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken?<br><br>BILL CLINTON:<br>I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by chicken? Could you define chicken please?<br><br>LOUIS FARRAKHAN:<br>The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed the "black man" in order to trample him and keep him down.<br><br>THE BIBLE:<br>And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken, "Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.<br><br>COLONEL SANDERS:<br>I missed one?</div>
