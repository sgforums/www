            <div class='col-md body'>I was like.... At BQ the other day waiting for a cab.... Then 2 ladies were wearing lowcut upfront and bending over.... One of the girls noticed that I'm looking in her direction, she looked down at her breast and bent back forward again so that I can 'see her'...

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, I think girls with tubes and minis are the most sexy thing to happen in this world.  And further, it would be so easy to get into their panties and bras.  When the car is parked, just hop over to the passenger side of the seat and have her spread her legs facing you, sitting on your lap.  Then her short skirt will have to be hitched up...and you will have a clear view of her panties, whatever color it might be.  With her facing you, you will also have her boobs in your face.  There you can off down her tube and start carressing her.  take of the bra and you will have the nipples in your face, ready for your mouth.  ain't that neat.</div>
