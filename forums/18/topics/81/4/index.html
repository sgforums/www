And further, it would be so easy to get into their panties and bras.  When the car is parked, just hop over to the passenger side of the seat and have her spread her legs facing you, sitting on your lap.  Then her short skirt will have to be hitched up...and you will have a clear view of her panties, whatever color it might be.  With her facing you, you will also have her boobs in your face.  There you can off down her tube and start carressing her.  take of the bra and you will have the nipples in your face, ready for your mouth.  ain't that neat.</div></blockquote>hehe... i dun think tubes and minis are for that purpose  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>but i am glad....

I hate guys who keep asking if they can ask you out or if I have a boyfriend. Does it matter?<br>I think it's wonderful that a guy is attracted by my dressing... even if it's sexy. That's why I would dress sexy! To look sexy..hehe...But after that, he must also want to be a friend. I think it's disgusting that guys keep looking at my cleavage while chatting with me. So talk about a movie or telling me a good joke might be a cheeky way of putting me off guard, I guess.<br>Am I answering your question???<br><br></div>
