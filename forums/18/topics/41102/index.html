In fact I find it great that you have had such a gal. Really! Character wise I dunno but i do like her daringness. I like to play in the rain a lot(esp during primary school when raining, sure go out and play in it one. I dunno why. Maybe I like to play with water).. I will sure enjoy it if I had such a gal!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Now no more liao lah.. No longer like last time so 'siao'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span></div>
