            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone.<br>Has anyone tried Libidus (Tongkat ali plus chinese herbs)? I went to Fortune Centre at Middle Road and saw a shop selling it. The person in charge told me that Libidus is different from other tongkat ali products in the market as you can feel its effect within an hour (others are gradual). And can last up to 4 days?!<br>But the price to me is a little steep. I think it is $70 for a pack of 10capsules.<br><br>Thanks in advance for any feedback.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since nobody tried it before and after considering a while I decided to buy Libidus. Last evening!<br><br>And guess what? it really works! Took the recommended dosage of 2 capsules with warm water. About 30minutes later I felt a little heaty.(maybe caused by better blood circulation). I also felt tingling sensation down there. A little while later i got an erection without thinking about sex! That means if you want to take 2capsules you better be prepared. Otherwise its no use if are loaded but cannot fire as there is no target(lol).<br><br>And I performed better, much better than expected. My wife kept asking me where i got all that energy from. I just smile as i know the question doesnt need an answer as both of us had a great time.<br><br>Next time i will try just 1 capsule. And see how it goes.<br><br>I will definitely buy another pack or two as the shop is selling 2packs at $65 each.<br></div>
