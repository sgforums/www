            <div class='col-md body'>I read Allan Pease's book "Body Language" and he described a sign of women's arousal/ attraction is her subconsious fondling of cylindrical object she could get in the presence  of the guy(s). The object could be anything cylindrical like a cocktail glass, a drinking straw etc.<br><br>At first I thought nothing of it. Until I saw my friend doing it and I was stunned.<br><br>Anyway, I witnessed this for myself during a group outing and I was wondering what that gal was thinking at that time. I don't think the rest of the other guys noticed it (since they've not read the book?) but that gal was twisting and turning the bottleneck of the drink bottle she was holding while engrossed in her conversation.<br><br>So I wonder how true or reliable this "fondling cylindrical object" theory is and if any of you guys/gals notice this phenomenon, perhaps with friends or your bf/gf. Luckily she was not looking at me as she played with her bottle or else I would have to make an excuse not to sit next to her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>More information on Allan Pease's theory can be found at http://www.bodylanguagetraining.com/nathealtharticle.htm</div>
