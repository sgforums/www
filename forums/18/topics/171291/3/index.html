If your mind in the holo does not put in enough effort to effect changes to your collective reality, then changes would not occur. There are many ways to increase your constructive strength to help you build better realities. And I can teach you how. There are methods, one of them meditation, which requires you to clear your mind of all things and imagine you are floating in a vast emptiness and imagining your physical self is not there.<br><br>Then theres the other more effective method, where you take an object (small one preferably), place it in your main hand and imagine that object is a part of you. Imagine that every atom in the object is connected to every atom in your hand. Then, using your mind, will it to happen. Will the object to move, to bend, to twist, to rotate...In the holo, ALL things are connected, and if you can imagine that everything in the collective is connected too, then you'll be able to do things that only those in the holo can do, like change their own realities. Now the object in your hand will respond if you use enough mindpower, because in the holo, anything you think of is reality.</div>

Like you know someone is watching you but you see nothing? That, is the power of the holo. Everytime you do not look in a particular direction, things happen behind your back. Realities are constantly being changed and the collective evolves to adapt to humanity's needs. Minds are thinking of ways to improve their lives by constructing better realities in the collective. This raw energy that emantes from the holo causes most people to sense that they're being watched.<br><br>Of course, there is another explanation. because we're animals, we're trained to hunt and survive in the wild. Thus we have something called a survival instinct. everytime we do not see something, we feel that something or someone is watching us. this helps us survive in an hostile environment. but although we've evolved beyond this basic need, we still keep with us this instinct, some people call it a sixth sense.<br><br>Though I prefer the former explanation, the latter holds some truth too...</div>

Compare these 3 species of animals and you would realise what they and what WE see is VERY different. That is because what we perceive is NOT what is actually real.<br><br>1) Humans<br>2) Bees<br>3) Ants<br><br>Bees see only colors, and they are unable to see details. That is because they're not built to do so. Their job is to pollinate and so they need color vision only to identify which flowers to go to and get their honey.<br><br>Ants do not see, or they have extremely poor vision. But their feelers have the ability to sense the air and objects around them. Therefore, what an ant perceives is real is NOT what we humans see is REAL.<br><br>Humans may put a metal pen in front of an ant, allowing the ant to touch the object with its antennaes. But the ant will never know it is a pen. It will perceive of the object as a twig. This proves our saying: 'What we perceive is not what is real'.</div>

I believe what we call 'realms' or 'dimensions' are in fact the many very different realities the minds in the holo create. Our reality, the collective, is one of them. Someone created this reality some time ago and many other minds came to populate it. Of course, there are some minds who decide not to join the others, and form their own realities.</div>
