            <div class='col-md body'>Very true. What we perceive is what our senses try to tell us how the collective reality is like. But if we were to be stripped of all our senses and physical self, leaving our mind as a direct like to the holographic reality, then all we'd know exist would be frequencies. It is our senses' ability to pick up these frequencies and decode them which forms our 'reality'.<br><br>This may mean that Asexual Division in the collective(physical) reality may just be beams of light bouncing off 'mirrors' in the holo-reality. So now we have 2 or more beams instead of the 1 beam we have before it reflects off the mirror. Now, we all know that as light beams travel further, they become weaker. That is why light from stars far away do not hit the earth unless the star is as close to the earth as our sun is. Now imagine a ball in the collective reality bouncing up and down. With each bounce, the ball will gain less kinetic energy and more gravitational potential energy. This is what happens in the collective reality. But in the holo-reality, beams of lights reflect off each other or other 'mirrors' and with each reflection, the beams decrease in speed. This may explain the term 'ageing' in our collective reality.</div>

But contentment is just contentment, and however it seems, not dependant on how much money you have or whatsoever. Since wealthiness is illusory and self-defined, <strong>contentment is the greatest wealth</strong>. It is the limitless seeking that is dissatisfactory.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>now most of you are not getting this right so imma give ya all an example of what the collective and holographic realities are.<br><br>You're playing a game on the computer. for example, counterstrike. now you might think your moving about and shooting people with guns in the game, but you're not. you're just tapping keys on the keyboard and pixels on the computer screen are just changing colors...<br><br>now, THAT is what is happening. our 'reality' is just like a computer game. we might think we're living our lives, but the fact is we're not. we're just like pixels on a computer screen in the holographic reality..<br><br>since everyone, everything in the holographic universe is internconnected in a seamless web, then everything that dies in the collective returns to the holographic reality to be 'reborn'.<br><br>have you heard that dying people or people on the verge of death having seen a bright light at the end of a long long tunnel they're in?<br>when our physical bodies in the collective die, our minds are free to return to the holographic reality. and this long tunnel is what i call the neutrox, the link between the collective and the holographic realities. and the bright light at the end of this tunnel is the 'entrance' to the holographic universe. now do you understand?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>every wondered why some people are luckier than others? or born smarter than some people, who are handicapped and deformed from birth? that is because some people are better at creating realities in the holo. anything you think of in the holo will become a reality. this world, this collective reality, is a paradise to those people who are able to construct better realities than others. this reality is a living hell for some people, because they're not able to form realities that suit them. every mind in the holo is equal, but, like in the collective, some people will put in more effort to create their realities. imagine this: 2 minds are trying to create a reality, but one mind puts in more effort than the other in forming the reality, so when the reality is constructed, the person who has put in more effort will have a better chance in the collective and be a more successful person than other.</div>
