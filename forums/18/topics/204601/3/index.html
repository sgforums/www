The producer of the film Mr 'Orgy' Peterson-Heng said that he couldn't have done it without the support from his family members and the good people at Underground Games led by our all-too-familiar game developer spokesman SHB (Sg Hentai Beng), a former drop-out Multimedia student.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">troublemaker2005: So what is this film about and why does it relate with the underground gaming networks here in Sg?<br>Orgy: Well we have always wanted to make a movie based on Hentai ~ Pervasion, u know. With the successful on-going creation of SHB's work that referenced to BIKO, we decided to script a movie based on the game. Basically the movie is about how Hentai came about ini Sg and there's a 15 mins run of the movie that introduces in brief on its rise centuries ago and its rebirth in the present day. The main part of the storyline covers the struggle between a satisfying sexual life and hentai...something like Good versus Evil.<br><br>troublemaker2005: So who are the casts in this movie?<br>Orgy: The cast are multi-national infact. Local hot babes like Fiona Xie, Felicia Chin, Rui-en and many more will play as victims to sexual harrassment from hentai. There is also a scene where Fiona xie got her upskirt photos taken. i am sure guys out there will love it. Foreign players include Minori-Aoi, Yua Aida and Yui Hasumi ~ popular Jap AV stars. We have also had Jolin Tsai and Ayumi Hamazaki in the movie too. There was a scene when a pervert hot-wired a lift and sabotage it, trapping Felicia chin withhin. Later after the pervert took Felicia, techicians and Maintenance engineers were called in to fix the damaged lift and Bill Gates appeared courtesy of M$ playing the  role of the chief Maintenance Engineer.<br><br>troublemaker 2005: what are the break through in this movie that you can brag about here?<br>Orgy: okay the movie isn't just about se x, pervasion and stuff like that. We made it an action movie and included a few large scale battle scenes and a couple of duel-fighting scenes in it. One battle scene unfolds the struggle between the age old armies of healthy s ex genes (the Good guys) and the Hentai Genes (the Bad guys). It took place long before time herself and we have hundreds of stuntmen for that scene alone. it took us a month's long period for completion. the armors and weaponry, costumes and fighting stances were true to the date and well-executed respectively. With the help from SHB, we included animation effects over the fighting battle scenes to make it bloody and down to details. Every stuntmen's engagement in battle are well co-oridinated and we pair up a good guy and a bad guy prior to deployment and scene capturing. Its just like the NDP and once the 2 armies meet, blades clashing, the stuntmen will know who to seek out and 'fight'. fughting sequences ranged from step 1~5. Step 1 ~ good guy thrusts, bad guy parry, step 2 ~ bad guy slashes and good guy dodges and so on. Every pair of stuntmen (good and bad) start off at a different step so pair A stuntmen start of with step 2 while pair B stuntmen start off withh step 1. When you throw a bunch of fighters into the fray in this planning, the realistic effects of intense battle and flexibility of the human brain versus action are true down to the byte!<br><br>troublemaker2005: so what are your expectations from this movie?

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like Hentai and Biko-ism are grabbing the attention of Underground Goers. Hips-and-Hype-Records recently released a heavy-metal music album with the title "Hentai-metal is the Law" from our very own local Beng Metal band. Rumors has it that the band was grief-stricken after failing to gain support and win the recent "Superband" contest because their image failed to melt the hearts of the many Sgrean music and band lovers. They were branded "Super-Beng" before getting the kick from judges and h/p uses' sms. However, this did not stop or hinder the all-metal band from showing their love for Metal and seeing a good chance to use their talents in producing music for Biko-ism and Hentai, "Super-Bengz" now released the album HMITL a.k.a HTMIL (not HTML har). Below are the album details.<br><br><img src="http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k240/bipolar06/1.jpg"><br><br><strong>Album Name: H.T.M.L.
