Next time, I'll hurt you, ha ha'<br><br>SHE was just doing a good deed by helping a man carry some clothes to his car. In return, the 21-year-old sales assistant from Kuala Lumpur was allegedly drugged by the man outside a mall, raped and then dumped by the roadside. But that was not the end of her ordeal.<br><br>Two weeks after the incident, the woman is reliving her nightmare after her alleged rapist hand-delivered to her home two taunting letters in which he threatened to rape her again and kill her.<br><br>On 13 Aug, the woman was having dinner at a mall in Bukit Bintang when she was approached by a stocky man in his 30s. She told The Malay Mail that even though she didn't recognise him, the man knew her name as well as where she worked in the mall. The man spoke to her in Cantonese and was neatly dressed in office attire.<br><br>He then asked her to to help him carry two bags of clothes that he left in his car parked at a hotel opposite the mall. 'When we got to his car, he asked me to take a bag in the front seat,' the woman told the Malay Mail.<br><br>She claimed: 'As I lifted the bag, it bottomed out and clothes spilled out. I smelled a strong odour which made me dizzy and I passed out.' She was driven to Kajang, where she was allegedly sexually assaulted while unconscious. She claimed she woke up to find herself with her shirt unbuttoned, and was pushed out of the black Honda Civic onto the roadside soon after.<br><br>After she was found by a passer-by, the woman called her 26-year-old husband for help. The couple made a police report the same night.<br>On 2 Sep, the woman claimed she found a letter at her front gate from the alleged attacker. In the letter, he allegedly threatened to publish nude<br>pictures of her he took during the attack.<br><br>The Star reported that the letter was written in Mandarin with a smattering of English and was printed on a laser printer. The first few lines read: 'Do you remember me? How is my sexual ability? Do you know how much I miss your body scent?' The letter-writer also wrote in English: 'I am a doctor as well. I am expert at disguising one's looks.'<br><br>He added that he had been observing her for over two months and hinted at an earlier victim whom he had killed. The letter signed off with, 'She was dead. I killed her. You did not die because I released you. I also did not hurt you. But not next time around! *Game number two is coming! Ha ha ha!'<br><br>Three days later, there was another letter, with the man allegedly threatening to come after the woman again. The man claimed that it was his third letter, but the woman said she has received only two. The Malay Mail reported that the police have classified the case as molestation as there was no evidence of rape.<br><br>Kajang district police chief Mohd Nor Hakim told Malaysia's Sun newspaper that he advised the woman to lodge another report with the original copies<br>of the letters she received.<br><br>He explained that when the woman lodged her initial report on Tuesday, she had handed over only photocopies of the letters to the district police<br>headquarters. The investigating officer was also not in at the time.
