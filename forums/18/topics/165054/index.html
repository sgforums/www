FRIDAY 25 NOV 2005 !<br><br>Club Review courtesy of ClubbersLounge.com<br><br>Phunk Bar is one of the newest bar to open its doors to the clubbing world in the ever bustling Mhd. Sultan. The bar is HOT, funky and is definitely one of the bars to check out in Mhd Sultan. The place focuses very strongly on attracting the right mix of clubbers and are strict in the kind of people they allow to come in, but thatÂ’s the best things about these place.  Phunk bar looks at creating an image as an awesome place to club without having to worry about fights or rowdy crowd.<br><br>The bar emphasis on creating an environment for all who come in to have good clean fun, soak in the atmosphere and have a great time partying the night away. The bar has also invested in very good air-con and sound systems. The air in the place is always cool and of course, the sound system is awesome. The management of the bar takes to the music and sound system quality very seriously, and the RnB music u hear being belted out are a delight to any ears in the place.<br><br>Punk Bar sees its Fri &amp; Sat nights as one of their most packed hours with a good mix of crowd lining up to get a chance to enter the new boys in town. The place attracts a good mix of both sexes and youÂ’ll find amongst these crowds, locals and Caucasians, from young working executives to yuppies.<br><br>The Bar also allows for pole dancing whereby some spicy grooves can be seen on display each time, and of course, never forgetting the Pool table for all those looking at pitting your skills with others in the bar. Make your way toward the back of the bar where the pool table is located and see how you fare with some of the good player there. Trust us, some of them are really good in the game.<br><br>One of the main attractions of the bar is the patron themselves. The people here are truly a friendly and enjoyable bunch who knows how to have a good time as the night passes on. Building new friendships in here is ever so easy with these happening people. Together with the hard-hitting music, lights, smoke machine, you know partying at Phunk Bar is truly an experience. This place is definitely a must checkout for any clubber. Get on down to Phunk Bar and weÂ’ll see you guys on the dance floor.<br><br><img src="http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9706/phunkbarkeepingitrealposter5fz.gif"><br><br>http://nikitadc5.multiply.com/journal</div>
