            <div class='col-md body'>Well, just like yesterday, me saw four ladies (got three not bad looking lah) zao geng:<br><br>1st lady was rather tall (taller than me and not bad looking but just too thin), wearing mini denim skirt, nice long pair of legs, took bus to town. You know SBS double-deck has two rows of seats facing each other, me sat on one side, then she came and sat opposite me, saw her pink lacy undies (plus some hair sticking out), me pai seh don't know like what cos me couldn't sit straight in front of her.<br><br>2nd lady was also not bad looking and average height but very well endowned, me was looking for some reference books in Times, we were both looking at the same shelf and she squatted down to look at the lower rack, me didn't know she squatted down and from my standing height, me could see her black bra and the cleavage was "WOAH!!!".<br><br>3rd lady was the ugly one but nice proportional figure that me saw in the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn boutique to help my wife get some porducts. Me believed that she didn't wear bra as me could visibly see the nipples sticking out of her white 3/4 sleeved blouse, black tight skirt (didn't see the panty line and maybe didn't wear undies also). Her boobies were bouncing up and down when she moved around the boutique.<br><br>4th lady was a young lady, casually dressed in a single piece sundress, wide neckline. Believed she wasn't a local cos me don't understand her conversation with her mum. She was also very well developed. Me was in the home entertainment and theatre section of Carrefour when me saw her. Me was looking at the Pinnacle 42" LCD TV that was on offer at $1499 and it was playing King Kong on it. She stood next to me and folded her arms across her chest (below her boobies). Me saw that her bra was loose fitting type and the way her arms were crossed, the bra fell forward, exposing her nipples and boobies to be seen from the wide neckline of her dress.<br><br>Best part, all my Toto numbers me betted on, not a single number came out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
