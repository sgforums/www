            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, just wanted to gather feedback from the floor. Have been noticing far too many singaporean ladies going for caucasians, and the lame excuse is they are more romantic and caring.<br><br>But from what i know, there are alot of expatriates that only want to get them to bed, have company until their term is up and that's it. Although, no doubt there are also sincere ones. But seems this trend is going alarmingly high... Singapore Guys.... do something about it!!! We don't need foriegn expertise in this area... hehe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think DareDevil is so hot up is because of common ppl like us thinking what so big deal for women going to caucasian men. In actual fact, there is nothing wrong. I think we're a very tolerant society already as compared to the caucasians. Those who have stayed in the caucasian countries before will know the racism there is so much more vivid and vocal.<br><br>But here we're not talking about racism. We're talking about Bimboism. There are alot of women out there, some very highly educated, keeps thinking that caucasian men are more romantic, gentle, high sex drive and so on then locals. Pleasesssss, but there are alot of locals whom are as good. Those women never read newspaper on how violent caucasian men can be too... band and whack at the same time. It is the same everywhere, come on, black, white or brown, there are black sheeps.<br><br>Come to think of it, i can be extremely gentle in a foriegn land, maybe thinking of a good time with one/many babes there, then after i leave there is no strings attached.<br><br>So my underlying meaning is, to the SPGs out there, give the locals a chance, and you will know their virtues 2.<br><br>Local guys out there....

Perhaps like you said some locals can be as good IF NOT better than the caucasians... But just like buying mobile phones and going for the latest trends I think we should let the girls have a time to react to all these 'caucasian' things.... Despite the skin color, I think all of us have an EQUAL chance of 'being good'.... The main difference I would guess and have to admit would be our background...... But whatever's the case we should just let things be.... If what you've said about how good the locals can be are true... I believe that the TRUTH would surface one day.....<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think ultimately boils down to the choice of lifestyle that a woman prefers these days<br><br>for asian society.. women have a more conservative role as in women are home makers...no matter wat they say abt more women coming out into the workforce..<br><br>whereas the caucasian woman seems more independant (maybe not the right word ...more liberal perhaps?)<br><br>so for the younger set of women who do not wan to become the stereotyped homemaker or look for a more so-called "exciting" r/ship which they think they can find with a caucasian man (simply bcos hes from a diff culture means its a fresh experience) ...  looking beyond our local choices seem to be the only way to do it... how else??<br><br>personally, i still prefer local guys   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to FHM's Interview with the ladies. We Singapore Guys aren't romatic as the american featured films like Serendipity, Romeo &amp; Juliet, The Wedding Planner, such and such. Despite that I question their thrist for caucasians whom they might have a mental image of knowing such men would give them a romatic and enjoyable life than singapore guys would provide.<br><br>Caucasians are apparently "more cute" than singaporean guys as claimed. My facts are not based on assumptions but rather what the magazine has to offer.<br><br>Personally experience ? I've spent 3 yrs overseas studying in australia therefore ultimately gaining the aussie acent. Apparently alot of girls love that, in which many had been rejected by me.<br><br>Like flies who buzz around you where there layed nicely across the table contains a feast.<br><br>apologies ladies. this comment applies to those minority. not all women are like that I believe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say, "Battle Me", I haven't mentioned the fact that there is anything wrong with being love with a caucasian. Its a matter of "Preference". When you mentioned Singaporean Men have to be more "humourous, sensitive, outgoing, open minded". I gave that a thought and realize that had Singapore Women gave such a criteria, "we men should set several criterias out as well". The very fact that "some" Singaporean women just go for men with money, decides that their "need to be concern" is much more special and unique then men ? I feel Singaporean women should change on that. I've met women who just want to be care for, concern, loved and the interesting thing is, "They Don't Show Any Appreciation".<br><br>The term give and take doesn't seem to "apply for singaporean women." All they do is take. But do they give any ? Some maybe.  Thats my criteria for Singaporean Women since you mentioned certain criterias about men.<br><br>In my opinion the fact you mentioned<br><br>"no guys<br>u do lose out to them....thats the point..u guys think ur so good..<br>while caucasians dont....they're just so easy going...they dont think as much as singaporeans do....u gotta be more socialize!..like they are... "<br><br>If that isn't racist, its certainly Sexist towards Singaporean Men. Some Singaporean men prefer to be more dominating, which I have no control over it however, I have to stress that not all are like that, because if so, I can nail down many 50 year old caucasians in Suntec City flirting with 16 year old girls on any given day on a weekend. And they think its pretty cool. Personally I think its a god damn tragedy for such women to be so hopeless in love with the caucasian races.<br><br>To those who are genuinely in love and its by no preference to whether they prefer caucasians, asians, indians whatsoever, they have my fair share my thoughts.<br></div>
