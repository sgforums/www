            <div class='col-md body'>When I was much younger, I wanted to know what is all the craze about soccer. So I actually tried watching a few seasons of soccer.<br><br>What i saw shocked me. Whenever a player gets vaguely hurt, he rolls on the ground clutching his leg, as though he is dying of pain. Personally I have spent a few years practising tae kwon do and I understand the pain he goes thru. Once the ref mets out the penalty to the opposing player, the crippled player jumps right up and starts running as though nothing has happened!<br><br>What happened to the immense pain that caused you to roll on the ground clutching your leg?<br><br>And the fans frighten me. There was terrible soccer gangsterism in the news that year (can't remember which year). Brits fighting and stampeding onto the soccer fields...<br><br>Even when I played soccer, soccer fans would call foul on every little thing. When one of them kicked the ball and it hit my shoulder, he screamed "Hand ball!!! Free kick!!!"<br><br>No matter how many times I tried to explain the difference between a hand and a shoulder to him, he remained impervious to my logic. Perhaps that's another rule I missed out.<br><br>Although I do not hate soccer, I have no special affinity towards it either. And I have no sympathy for people injured during soccer because, as my soccer kakis used to tell me, "If you can't go for the ball, then go for his leg". And in all naivity at that time, I asked "For what?".<br><br>Now I've taken up different sports that actually appeal to me, such as tennis and golf. And if i want someone to kick my legs, i go back for tkd classes.</div>
