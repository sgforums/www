To educate them on porn, a good way is to let them know the reality of it being illegal.  That is totally different from sex education.  We cannot assume that everyone who brings porn to school is in need of sex education.  We can educate them about sex but will that stop them or even scare them from at least bringing porn to the public?  Alot of people are educated in sex, but do we see people buy or watch lesser porn just because of sex education? Yes, sex education is important but that is altogether a different matter from making them realise that porn is illegal in Singapore.  As for the future of the children, they were not even given a criminal record..so why should their future be affected?</div>

To educate them on porn, a good way is to let them know the reality of it being illegal.  That is totally different from sex education.  We cannot assume that everyone who brings porn to school is in need of sex education.  We can educate them about sex but will that stop them or even scare them from at least bringing porn to the public?  Alot of people are educated in sex, but do we see people buy or watch lesser porn just because of sex education? Yes, sex education is important but that is altogether a different matter from making them realise that porn is illegal in Singapore.  As for the future of the children, they were not even given a criminal record..so why should their future be affected?  </div></blockquote>so in ur opinion... as long as anything against the law happens in sch it shd be reported to the police? so if a student copies during exam he shd be reported to the police for cheating? if a student photocopies an entire textbook to save money he shd be reported to the police due to copyrights? if 2 friends are having fun n one of them accidentally gt hit by the other the friend shd be arrested by the police for assult? if guys playing basketball n took off their shirt they shd be arrested for indecent exposure?<br><br>it is a sch for goodness sake. unless the students committed something really bad such as raping a gal in sch, knifing a student and arson den i think yea this student deserves to be handed over to the police... if nt i feel there is no need to alarm the police at all regarding small matters...</div>

One could be turned into a rapist if too much is involved and became addicted. It could turn a normal person into someone that he himself no longer knew before. In my point of view, police will only handle legal issue of porn but in the area of the sexual health of the students, u need professional doctors to take care of them. It is a medical and mental health issue of growing people, if un-taken care of, they will still go back to it after sometime. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's look at this incident at another point of view. The school kept the 17 boys back 7 hours without food or drink. This caused one of the boys that had a rare illness to fall sick. The principal had to inform the police to protect her reputation as people will wonder why the boys are being kept for 7 hours, pretty smart move don't you think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

IMO adults shd be able to think for themselves.... sec sch children r going through puberty... they r curious bout everything under the sun. juz cos they r curious bout porn u call in the cops? wat is this?<br><br>the thing here is tat i feel tat it is NT necessary to call in the police at all on 14 year olds. Instead of scaring them into nt doing it... i prefer the softer way of approaching; teaching them into nt doing it.<br><br>the news stated tat ONLI one disc is found between the 17 kids and u r here saying that porn is being sold in sch. even if they r nt sold in sch they can be bought anywhere in singapore as long as u chanced upon it. instead of calling the police unto them... teach them instead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the principal was so noble and wanted to call the police, to punish the students, to set a good example, to trace down the source of the VCD etc. She would have do so earlier instead of keeping back the students for 7 hours. She is only using the student's mistake to cover her mistake of not allowing the students to eat or drink for 7 hours. She knew she wouldn't be able to answer to the media if she didn't called the police. What kind of principal is this? She ruined the future of 17 boys for her own.</div>
