            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm just my 2cents - to illustrate my point let me relate a personal experience:<br><br>I was 14 yo and was a habitual shoplifter at a bookshop. one day i got caught and was brought to the manager's office. She contemplated calling the police and there were signs arnd the bookshop saying that shop lifters will be dealt with by the police. Anyway i pleaded with her and she agreed to give me a chance. If i pay return everything she will not involve the police and let me go. Well i returned everything and was let off.<br><br>Point is, If she took the path taken by that principle, i might have ended up with a criminal record and might not be in university now. After that incident, i took a risk management approach as far as possible. IE. look at the consequences. If cannot deal with it, don't commit the offence. While this is not PERFECT (I'd probably risk jail time for a reasonable chance of getting away with say 10 million) at least it brought me within the boundries of the law. I think that is sufficient - respect the rules of society.<br>Therefdre, she was IMO irresponsible in taking such drastic actions. I do not think that she KNEW that involving the police will not result in the boy's getting a criminal record. No doubt the behausior SHOULD be condemned- there are somethings that you just don't openly allow...coz its a slippery slope. If you allow this todae, your just expanding the boundries of acceptable behaviour.<br><br>BUT IMO A public caning(maybe) + public reprimand + informing the parents should and will suffice. This will condemn the behaviour and yet serve to scare them and others.  Further she suposedly kept them behind for seven hours - for WHAT?! no good reason as far as i can tell. Just confiscate the tapes, if you need time to discuss let them go home and deal with them tomorrow. Now she has created so much publicity .Such lack of foresight on her part is distressing.</div>

She knew she wouldn't be able to answer to the media if she didn't called the police. What kind of principal is this? She ruined the future of 17 boys for her own.</div></blockquote>Yupee. Completely ruined.<br>I wonder the principal herself or himself ever watched or own a porn VCD b4....<br>Even the teacher too.<br><br>And if one day they find their kids having the same thing.  Do you think they will also call the police to catch their own kids?<br>Since they are so noble to call the police to catch other ppl's kids, by right they should call police to catch theirs too if they find out.<br><br>But my first thoughts are nopee.  They wont.<br>I think their kids may be trying to burn or throw away watever porn they hav right now, in case get caught by their own parents...and get drag to the police...haha.<br><br></div>
