One or 2 threads are enough, but they (or he) insists on posting one story after another. In the beginning, I found it amusing. But soon, it became rather irritating.<br><br>The fault doesn't just lie with the clones. Normal users hae become VERY sceptical when people post their experiences or queries. Perhaps we should always give the benefit of doubt to fellow users. They may not be as intelligent or as streetwise as you. However, sometimes I do feel sceptical about some experiences and queries, but hey, just answer if you want to answer. Don't answer if you have nothing good to say. It's an open forum, yes, so you are free to air your views. But know the limits. Some responses I've seen are really uncalled for. (FYI, I'm not really a person who post a lot, but I do read what has been posted here.)<br><br>Now, I'm just trying to be frank here. I believe there will be people who will not be happy about what I have said here. But why don't we try to make this forum a better place? A forum's quality depends very much on the users. To be frank, this forum's quality is going really low.<br><br>My point is, just live and let live. Reply to queries if you want. But if you feel like posting something spiteful, please refrain from it. It will definitely improve the quality of posts. (I'm not naming anyone. I dun remember the names also.)<br><br>And one more word to clones. Please grow up, and stop the childishness. Initially it was entertaining. But these things get boring after a while. If you have nothing better to post, please refrain from posting as well. There are sites where you can post your erotic stories. If you want to make known your talent in writing adult stories, please write to those sites instead of here.<br><br>Sorry for the long post. I just hope that Bar can become a forum of quality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>two thumbs up... you're the Saint... you've touched on the best part...<br><br>lets take the response I get much earlier for example...<br><br>here we are just asking nicely for the fellow users to put up something more interesting, stimulatin, and something nice... there I get some silly fella posting his reply as "something nice....." wish they'll just stop trying to be funny and ending up being corny....sigh.</div>

From your post can tell that you expect to see sex-related topics in BAR and no where else.<br><br>Well, again it brings me back to the same point. If BAR is allocated for sex-related topics, then why does the MOD discriminate against those who start such threads? My point is if this MOD is so unhappy having sex-related topics in her forum, why not just let the sex-related topics be in another forum under a different moderator? Or can the moderator in BAR be at a more neutral person?<br><br>Whether or not that other forum becomes another BAR seriously depends on the moderator and the standards he/she sets.<br><br>I myself find it a joke that BAR is the place for sex-related topics yet in the past people always get dissed for starting sex-related threads. I notice that the MOD no longer does this though.<br><br>Carry on laughing dude, but you've only helped prove my point.</div>
