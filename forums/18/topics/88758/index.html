            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, if BAR was meant to discuss about clubbing and sex-related topics, then the moderators should let it be so. However, FireIce has time and time again shown that she dislikes sex-related topics. If she's so unhappy with sex-related topics, I feel she should either shift the sex-related topics elsewhere or she should just not be MOD of BAR at all since she dislikes it so much.<br><br>As the moderator, I feel she should be neutral in her own forum rather than go around dissing everyone who starts a sex-related thread. Because, once she starts going around dissing people, it acts as a disincentive for sex-related topics to be put in BAR. Which defeats the point of why sex-related topics are allocated to BAR in the first place.<br><br>I understand the idea of moderators to close a thread if it is overly explicit or extreme, but FireIce has been very quick to diss almost anyone who has started a sex-related topic.<br><br>And just because she disses people who start sex-related threads, there will be those forumites who join in and flame the original guy just to suck up to the moderator and join in to diss the person.<br><br>There are also those forumites in the BAR that act righteous and pretend to be morally upright. Because there are girls here, they pretend to be against all sexual acts yet they themselves crave for the same things that others have posted about. Just to look good in front of the girls here.<br><br>I'm not saying all who speak up against certain sexual topics are hypocrites, but there are such people here.<br><br>Then there are also those who join in the dissing just for the fun of it. I must admit, some ppl like Cortez deserved the kind of hate he did last time, but there are those who are just looking for a chance to slam others. Doesn't matter if the guy getting slammed deserves it or not, some just want to go with the flow.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>One thing also is that it's become so predictable that the people in BAR will twist the meaning of a thread and change the topic of the post. As a result the thread develops into a thread for crapping and that is why there is so much crapping in BAR.<br><br>Initially it was funny that people twist a sex-related topic into something else, but it happens so often now that it's expected. The joke has gotten seriously stale by now yet some people still do it. Why? To curry favour the moderator and the girls and to join the 'I spoiled the thread' club.<br><br>Don't you all find that there are so many lame topics in BAR? Too many people try to show off what little wit they have and wannabies who want to make the same jokes that others make.<br><br>Some jokes have been really overused which makes this forum really boring. Like The Hobbit and all his clones of other ppl's thread. Initially it was funny but now that joke is very stale as well.<br><br>Just highlighting some of the things that happen. I'm fine if some of you disgree with me, but no point flaming me back. Just tell me why you disagree, no need to get personal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SumOne:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually, if BAR was meant to discuss about clubbing and sex-related topics, then the moderators should let it be so. However, FireIce has time and time again shown that she dislikes sex-related topics. If she's so unhappy with sex-related topics, I feel she should either shift the sex-related topics elsewhere or she should just not be MOD of BAR at all since she dislikes it so much.<br><br>As the moderator, I feel she should be neutral in her own forum rather than go around dissing everyone who starts a sex-related thread. Because, once she starts going around dissing people, it acts as a disincentive for sex-related topics to be put in BAR. Which defeats the point of why sex-related topics are allocated to BAR in the first place.<br><br>I understand the idea of moderators to close a thread if it is overly explicit or extreme, but FireIce has been very quick to diss almost anyone who has started a sex-related topic.<br><br>And just because she disses people who start sex-related threads, there will be those forumites who join in and flame the original guy just to suck up to the moderator and join in to diss the person.<br><br>There are also those forumites in the BAR that act righteous and pretend to be morally upright. Because there are girls here, they pretend to be against all sexual acts yet they themselves crave for the same things that others have posted about. Just to look good in front of the girls here.<br><br>I'm not saying all who speak up against certain sexual topics are hypocrites, but there are such people here.<br><br>Then there are also those who join in the dissing just for the fun of it. I must admit, some ppl like Cortez deserved the kind of hate he did last time, but there are those who are just looking for a chance to slam others. Doesn't matter if the guy getting slammed deserves it or not, some just want to go with the flow.</div></blockquote>well said.... mi put up four limbs to agree in unison <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="http://img46.exs.cx/img46/4271/alligator_walking2.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I can't understand why FireIce just doesn't want to shift the sex-related topics to a new forum? Is she afraid that BAR will lose its popularity and that the acivity in BAR will drop?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also believe this particular forum is becoming a rather silly place to come to.<br><br>There are so many clones here posting rubbish! One or 2 threads are enough, but they (or he) insists on posting one story after another. In the beginning, I found it amusing. But soon, it became rather irritating.<br><br>The fault doesn't just lie with the clones. Normal users hae become VERY sceptical when people post their experiences or queries. Perhaps we should always give the benefit of doubt to fellow users. They may not be as intelligent or as streetwise as you. However, sometimes I do feel sceptical about some experiences and queries, but hey, just answer if you want to answer. Don't answer if you have nothing good to say. It's an open forum, yes, so you are free to air your views. But know the limits. Some responses I've seen are really uncalled for. (FYI, I'm not really a person who post a lot, but I do read what has been posted here.)<br><br>Now, I'm just trying to be frank here. I believe there will be people who will not be happy about what I have said here. But why don't we try to make this forum a better place? A forum's quality depends very much on the users. To be frank, this forum's quality is going really low.<br><br>My point is, just live and let live. Reply to queries if you want. But if you feel like posting something spiteful, please refrain from it. It will definitely improve the quality of posts. (I'm not naming anyone. I dun remember the names also.)<br><br>And one more word to clones. Please grow up, and stop the childishness. Initially it was entertaining. But these things get boring after a while. If you have nothing better to post, please refrain from posting as well. There are sites where you can post your erotic stories. If you want to make known your talent in writing adult stories, please write to those sites instead of here.<br><br>Sorry for the long post. I just hope that Bar can become a forum of quality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
