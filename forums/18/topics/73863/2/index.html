            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i saw a documentary on her in UK a couple of yrs back by ITV channel, they actually came here to film her home, ex school and places she went to eat (like tim sum at geylang). her former teachers at hw jc wasn't too keen to give interviews though.<br><br>and the guys dat did the bang, they had to take medical tests, and she herself did went for a HIV test which turn out alrite. And she did get gang raped, not in the US though but in london where she was studying. actually she was chatted up by a guy on the tube (not sure if it was a white guy or black?), which later she consented to sex with. dey went to an abandoned public housing and dey did it in some quiet room. Den it turned out the guy called along his frens and subsequently they took turns to rape her, which she did not consent to. After dat she basically decided to pursue her life in porn i think.<br><br>quite sad life actually, she broke down and cried thru out the documentary many times and she even showed the producer her self inflicted scars on her hands which she cuts every now and den, so called a "stay sane" treatment. come n think about it, i didn't know the show was on tv at dat time, till a fren of my from the bahamas told me to turn on my tv, and she still tot s'pore was a conservative country! haha</div>
