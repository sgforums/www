I think if you're mature enough to know what you want in life and what's the price you would have to pay or risk for it, no problem going for it. It's actually a fact that people are very much used to getting their ways around things to achieve what they want. Please don't view this type of relationship as SHIT and learn to respect others' decisions. Many other things done by the others are actually much WORSE.<br>I think the very most important thing in this type of relationship is that both parties are willing. And they should know what they would get and how far they could go from there. It's a mutual understanding. Come on, it's already Y2K.... Actually many of this type of things are happening, perhaps you're just not one of the 'party-goers'....?<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
