Our class was far too noisy when moving around and the Discipline Teacher made us walk in " Caterpillar " style. We would stand in one straight line hands on each others shoulder and walk around the Parade Square quietly without any noises like talking and dragging of foots. Any noises and we would start all over again. We did that after school for about 2 weeks and we were in the Afternoon Session that time, imgaine how late we got home everyday. Anyway, our class is still as noisy as ever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>wah wich sec sch u frm?</div>
