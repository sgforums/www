That shld immediately stop most of the youngsters from smoking..y muz the garment progressively increase the prices???<br><br>Raising of ciggy prices certainly does not decrease/prevent youngsters from smoking....but it did reduce the number of smokers..but..how much??? 1~5%???<br><br>Taxes from ciggy are so high that you can imagine how much revenues they're getting from smokers...<br><br>1 ciggy cost from mass production aprrox: max. 5cents&gt;&gt;&gt; 20 ciggy will be $1.00;   These are production cost...given max. cost.<br><br>Ciggy companies export to other countries...let's say sell to Spore, $3.00 (max)/pack...n that's it...so..additional $7.00 we have to pay for ciggy...can imagine that?? (All these are calculated at the very MAX. cost).<br><br>So..let's say 500k Sporean smoke one packet every two days... 500k*$7 = $3.5millions/2days.<br><br>In juz 2 days...they had a profit of $3.5millions..$1.75millions/day<br>So...in one week....$1.75millions * 7 = $12.25millions..(PROFITS)<br><br>See how much profits they can gain from raising of ciggy prices...<br><br>Dun complain abt smokers who complain abt raising of ciggy prices...you go and imagine if one day, there're no smokers in spore...how much loss has the garment lost??? And by then, maybe GST will be raised to 10%~20%...Transport Fee will be raised...so much more you can imagine yourself..<br><br>Sales of ciggy actually improve spore economy to a certain percentage...(I do not know how much)...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>$11 for a pack of 20 ciggies.<br><br>Therefore, 01 Ciggie will cost 11/20 = $0.55.<br><br>FACT: Smokers, like all human beings, cannot do without water and Food.  Smokers also cannot do without Ciggies.<br><br>Therefore, we can see a constant here. SMOKERS cannot do without FOOD/WATER and CIGGIES.<br><br>Thus, we can conclude if SMOKERS can spend $3.00 on a plate of WANTAN MEE, WHAT IS $0.55 for a stick of CIGGIE.  Since SMOKERS treat CIGGIES like they treat FOOD, we should raise the price to $3.00 per CIGGIE which means $60.00 per pack of 20 ciggies.<br><br>THIS $60.00 pricing is suggested to reflect the importance of CIGGIES to Smokers just as Food is important to them.

            <div class='col-md body'>there is always people who are willing to pay because of addiction so this is the most constant revenue source.<br><br>The question comes back to choice. I would accept it if its really for a good reason that the price is raised but really, the lame reason of "protecting" the people fell flat long ago... I find it hard to swallow this reasoning.<br>If its the people the system was to protect, then why did the system start discussing about casino, or legalised prostitution or did not demand for electric cars and such.. Its become a hypocritical issue but I cannot expect perfect system. However, as like all companies who are are finding the easy way out of their problems but retrenchment and outsourcing which is now the trigger happy solution all exec do... then its the same trigger reaction when it comes to increasing the $ in the treasury.. but no thought it put into proper use and conservancy or better treatment of the people who propelled the country to this day...
