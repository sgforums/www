The guy stumbles around and says, "Um.. no.. um.. what happened?"

            <div class='col-md body'>BLONDE DECTECTIVE TRAINING<br><br>A policeman was interviewing three blondes who wanted to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he showed the first blonde a picture for five seconds and then hid it. "This is your suspect. How would you recognize him?"<br><br>The first blonde answered, "That's easy! We'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"<br><br>The policeman said, "Well, that's because the picture shows his profile."<br><br>Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashed the picture at the second blonde and said, "This is your suspect. How would you recognize him?"<br><br>The second blonde giggled, flipped her hair and said, "Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"<br><br>The policeman angrily replied, "What's the matter with you two? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing, because this is a picture of his profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?"<br><br>Extremely frustrated at this point, he showed the picture to the third blonde and said, in a very testy voice, "This is your suspect. How would you recognize him?" He quickly added, "And think hard before answering, so you don't say something completely idiotic."<br><br>The blonde looked at the picture intently for a moment and said, "Hmm... The suspect wears contact lenses."<br><br>The policeman was stunned speechless, because he honestly didn't know whether the suspect wore contacts or not. "Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file, and I'll get back to you on that." He left the room and went to his office, checked the suspect's file in his computer, and came back beaming. "Wow!" he said, "I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! But how were you able to make such an astute observation?"<br><br>"That's easy," the blonde replied. "He can't wear regular glasses, because he only has one eye and one ear."<br></div>

The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the course to steer to SEATAC airport, and landed safely.<br><br>After they were on the ground, the copilot asked the pilot how he had done it.<br><br>"I knew it had to be the Microsoft Building, because they gave me a technically correct but completely useless answer."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CINDERELLA AND ALAN<br><br>Cinderella was now 75 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now dead Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a cat called Alan for companionship.<br><br>One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother. Cinderella said: "Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years?" The Fairy Godmother replied: "Well Cinderella, since you have lived a good, wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"<br><br>Cinderella is taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful consideration and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish. "I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension." Instantly her rocking chair was turned into solid gold. Cinderella was stunned.<br><br>Cinderella said, "Oh thank you, Fairy Godmother!" The Fairy Godmother replied, "It is the least I can do. What is your second wish?" Cinderella looked down at her frail body and said: "I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again."<br><br>At once, her wish having been desired, became reality, and her beautiful youthful visage had returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years and long forgotten vigour and vitality began to course through her very soul. Then the Fairy Godmother spoke again: "You have one more wish, what shall you have?"<br><br>Cinderella looked over to Alan, who was now quivering in the corner with fear. "I wish you to transform my old cat, Alan, into a beautiful and handsome young man." Magically, Alan suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biologicial make up, that when he stoof before her, he was a boy, so beautiful the like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds begun to fall from the sky at his feet.<br><br>The Fairy Godmother said: "Congratulations Cinderella! Enjoy your new life." With a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone.<br><br>For a few moments, Alan and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes. Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly perfect boy she had ever seen. Then Alan walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his muscular arms.<br><br>He leant close to her ear, and into her ear breathed as much as whispered, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath, "I bet you regret having my balls chopped off now, don't you?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HITMAN<br><br>Jack and his friends were playing golf one Saturday. As they are getting ready to tee off, a guy walks up and asks if he can join them. The friends look at each other, look at the guy and say, "Sure."<br><br>About two holes into the game, the friends get curious about what the guy does for a living. So they ask him. The stranger tells them he's a hitman. They all laugh. The guy says, "No really, I am a hitman. My gun is in my golf bag. I carry it everywhere. You can take a look at it if you like."<br><br>So Jack decides to check it out. He opens the bag and, sure enough, there is a rifle with a huge scope attached. Jack gets all excited and says, "WOW! I bet I can see my house through here! May I look?" The hit man replies, "Sure."<br><br>So Jack looks and says, "YEAH! You can see my house! I can even see through the windows into my bedroom. There's my wife. Wait, there's my next door neighbor! And he's naked too!" This really upsets Jack so he asks how much it would be for a hit. The hitman replies, "I get $1000 every time I pull the trigger."<br><br>Jack responds, "$1000? Well, OK, I want two hits. I want you to shoot my wife right in the mouth. She's always nagging at me and I can't stand it. Second, I want you to shoot my neighbor in the penis, just for screwing around with my wife."<br><br>The hit man agrees, gears up and looks through the scope. He's looking for about five minutes until finally Jack starts to get really impatient and asks, "What are you waiting for?" The hitman replies, "Relax. I'm about to save you a thousand bucks!"<br></div>

When the preacher asked, "Who created the earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th?" The wife stuck her husband with the needle and he jumped up and exclaimed, "Oh my God!" The preacher said, "That's correct." And the husband sat down mumbling to himself.<br><br>He soon fell asleep again and when the preacher got to the question, "And who died on the cross to save us from eternal damnation?" The wife stuck her husband again and he jumped up and exclaimed, "Jesus Christ!" And the preacher said, "Right again." With this the husband fell suspicious of his wife and decided to catch her in the act.<br><br>The husband pretended to fall asleep while keeping an eye on his wife when the preacher said, "What did Mary say to Joseph after Jesus was born?" The wife started to poke her husband again, but before she could the husband jumped up and exclaimed, "If you stick that damn thing in me again, I'm going to break it in half!"<br></div>
