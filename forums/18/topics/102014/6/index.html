            <div class='col-md body'>TELL ME<br><br>A very elderly couple is having an elegant dinner to celebrate their 75th wedding anniversary.<br><br>The old man leans forward and says softly to his wife, "Dear, there is something that I must ask you. It has always bothered me that our 10th child never quite looked like the rest of our children. Now I want to assure you that these 75 years have been the most wonderful experience I could have ever hoped for, and your answer cannot take that all away. But, I must know, did he have a different father?"<br><br>The wife drops her head, unable to look her husband in the eye. She paused for moment and then confessed. "Yes. Yes he did."<br><br>The old man is very shaken, the reality of what his wife was admitting hit him harder than he had expected. With a tear in his eye he asks, "Who? Who was he? Who was the father?"<br><br>Again the old woman drops her head, saying nothing at first as she tried to muster the courage to tell the truth to her husband. Then, finally, she says. "You."<br></div>

The wives of these men were so lonely that they will always go to the next village to look for men. But these women upon having an affair felt guilty everytime, hence they will go n confess to the pastor in the village's church.<br><br>Hearing so many women talk about their affairs made the pastor very embarrassed, hence he decided to tell the women "From now on, just say that you "had a fall" and I will understand what you are talking about.<br><br>Years passed, these women continually to the pastor to confess about their "falls". Then there was this year, the pastor got a transfer to another village.

But before I go, I would like you to remind the new pastor that whenever the women came to say something about them having a fall, they actually mean that they have an affair." said the pastor. Upon hearing this, the mayor giggled, promised the pastor and bid him goodbye.<br><br>When the new pastor came, the women continued to confess to him whenever they have an affair. He was totally puzzled about the village women "falling down" all the time and hence, decided to consult the mayor about this.<br><br>"Mayor, I think that the village needs some maintenance." said the new pastor.<br><br>"Why do you think so?" answered the mayor.<br><br>"Well, I have so many confessions from the women "falling down" every day. Pls see to this." said the worried pastor.<br><br>Hearing this, the mayor broke into a laughter and said, "Really? Is that so?"<br><br>The pastor answered, "Yes, this is true. Mrs Mayor "fell down" three times last week."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I WANT A DIVORCE<br><br>A married couple is driving down the interstate doing 55 mph. The husband is behind the wheel. His wife looks over at him and says, "Honey, I know we've been married for 15 years, but, I want a divorce."<br><br>The husband says nothing but slowly increases speed to 60 mph.<br><br>She then says, "I don't want you to try to talk me out of it, because I've been having an affair with your best friend, and he's a better lover than you."<br><br>Again the husband stays quiet and just speeds up as he clenches his hands on the steering wheels.<br><br>She says, "I want the house." Again the husband speeds up, and now is doing 70 mph.<br><br>She says, "I want the kids too." The husband just keeps driving faster, and faster, until he's up to 80 mph.<br><br>She says, "I want the car, the checking account, and all the credit cards too." The husband slowly starts to veer toward a bridge overpass piling, as she says, "Is there anything you want?" The husband says, "No, I've got everything I need right here."<br><br>She asks, "What's that?"<br><br>The husband replies just before they hit the wall at 90 mph. "I've got the airbag!"<br></div>
