"Do you know what I'm doing now?"<br><br>"Yes," the woman said, "You're checking for any lumps or breast cancer."<br><br>"Correct," replied the shady doctor.<br><br>Finally, he mounted his patient and started having sexual intercourse with her.<br><br>He asked, "Do you know what I'm doing now?"<br><br>"Yes," she said.

"Or just a bed, I don't care where."<br><br>"Well, I do have a double room with one occupant, a Navy guy," admitted the manager, "and he might be glad to split the cost. But to tell you the truth, he snores so loudly that people in adjoining rooms have complained in the past. I'm not sure it'd be worth it to you."<br><br>"No problem," the tired Marine assured him. "I'll take it."<br><br>The next morning the Marine came down to breakfast bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. "How'd you sleep?" Asked the manager.<br><br>"Never better."<br><br>The manager was impressed. "No problem with the other guy snoring, then?"<br><br>"Nope, I shut him up in no time." Said the Marine.<br><br>"How'd you manage that?" asked the manager.<br><br>"He was already in bed, snoring away, when I came in the room," the Marine explained. "I went over, gave him a kiss on the cheek, said, 'Goodnight, beautiful,' and he sat up all night watching me."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AN UNREASONABLE WISH REQUEST<br><br>A man was walking along a California beach and stumbled across an old lamp. He picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a genie!<br><br>The genie said, "OK. You released me from the lamp, blah, blah, blah. This is the fourth time this month and I'm getting a little sick of these wishes. So you can forget about getting three wishes. You only get one wish."<br><br>The man sat down on the beach and thought about it for awhile. Then he said, "I've always wanted to go to Hawaii, but I'm scared to fly and I get very seasick. Could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so that I can drive over there to visit?"<br><br>The genie laughed and said, "That's impossible! Think of the logistics of that! How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific? Think of how much concrete, how much steel. No. Think of another wish."<br><br>The man tried to think of another wish. Finally, he said, "I've been married and divorced several times. My wives always said that I don't care and that I'm insensitive. So I wish that I could understand women, know how they feel inside and what they're thinking when they give me the silent treatment, know why they're crying, know what they really want when they say, 'Nothing', know how to make them truly happy."<br><br>The genie said, "You want that bridge two lanes or four?"<br></div>

After studying these pieces for a long time, Germany announced that ancient Germans 25,000 years ago had a nationwide telephone network.<br><br>Naturally, the British government was not that easily impressed, they ordered their own scientists to dig even deeper. 100 meters down, they found small pieces of glass and they soon announced that ancient Brits 35,000 years ago already had a nationwide fiber net.<br><br>Irish scientists were outraged, they dug 200 meters underground, but found absolutely nothing.

His arm is not himself, and I fail to see how you can punish the whole individual for an offense committed by his limb."<br><br>"Well put," the judge replied. "Using your logic, I sentence the defendant's arm to one year's imprisonment. He can accompany it or not, as he chooses."<br><br>The defendant smiled.<br><br>With his lawyer's assistance he detached his artificial limb, laid it on the bench, and walked out.<br></div>

The genie got so tired of the racket that he finally came out and told the pair that he would grant them 3 wishes a piece if they would just leave him alone.<br><br>The pair agreed.<br><br>The bear said he would go first. "I wish that all the bears in this forest were female." The genie granted the wish.<br><br>The bunny just grinned and asked for a helmet. The bear thought that strange but continued. "I wish that all the bears in this country to be female!" The genie granted the wish.<br><br>The bunny just grinned again and wished for a motorcycle. He jumped on the bike, put on his helmet and started gunning it.<br><br>The bear looked at the bunny and said, "You must be the stupidest bunny I ever met!" Then he asked for his last wish. "I wish that all the bears in this world to be female!" The genie granted the wish. The bunny just grinned and said, "I wish the bear was gay."<br></div>

The nurse arrived and proudly announced to the first man, "Congratulations, sir. You're the father of twins!"<br><br>"What a coincidence! I work for the Minnesota Twins Baseball team!"<br><br>Later the nurse returned and congratulated the second father on the birth of his triplets.<br><br>"Wow! That's incredible! I work for the 3M Corporation."<br><br>An hour later, the nurse returned to congratulate the third man on the birth of his quadruplets. Stunned, he barely could reply, "I don't believe it! I work for the Four Seasons Hotel!"<br><br>After this, everyone turned to the fourth guy who had just fainted. The nurse rushed to his side. As he slowly gained consciousness, they could hear him mutter over and over, "I should never have taken that job at 7-Eleven. I should never have taken that job at 7-Eleven. I should never have taken that job."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A THEORY ON HELL<br><br>The following is an actual question given on a University of<br>Washington chemistry mid-term:<br><br>"Is Hell exothermic [gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?<br>Support your answer with a proof."<br><br>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law<br>(gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or<br>some variant. One student, however, wrote the  following:<br><br>First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we<br>need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they<br>are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a  soul gets<br>to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how<br>many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions<br>that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you<br>are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are<br>more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more<br>than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to<br>Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number<br>of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of<br>change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order<br>for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of<br>Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibi!<br>lities.<br><br>1) If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls<br>enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase<br>until all Hell breaks loose.<br><br>2) Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase<br>of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell<br>freezes over.<br><br>So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese<br>Banyan during my Freshman year "That it will be a cold night in Hell<br>before I sleep with you," and take into account the fact that I still have<br>not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be<br>true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic.<br><br>The student got the only A.<br><br></div>

When he finished, he found his horse had been stolen.<br><br>He comes back into the bar, handily flips his gun into the air, catches it above his head without even looking and fires a shot into the ceiling. "Who stole my horse?" he yelled with surprising forcefulness.<br><br>No one answered.<br><br>"I'm going to have another beer and if my horse isn't back outside by the time I'm finished, I'm going to do what I do back in Texas and I don't want to have to do what I do back in Texas!"<br><br>Some of the locals shifted restlessly. He had another beer, walked outside, and his horse was back! He saddled up and started to ride out of town.<br><br>The bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, "Say partner, what happened in Texas?" The cowboy turned back and said, "I had to walk home!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TO NEW YORK<br><br>A beautiful, well-dressed blonde seats herself in the first class cabin on a cross-country flight, and settles herself in for the trip, smiling prettily at admiring passengers seated around her.<br><br>Underway, a flight attendant soon approaches the blonde and says, "Miss, I'm sorry, but I see that your ticket is for coach, and you're seated in first class. I'm afraid you'll have to move."<br><br>The blonde replies, "I'm blonde, and I'm beautiful, and I'm going to New York to be a model." Slightly incredulous, the attendant alerts the senior flight attendant.<br><br>The senior attendant approaches the blonde and says, politely, "I'm sorry, Miss, but since your ticket is for coach, you'll have to move back." The blonde replies, sweetly, "I'm blonde, and I'm beautiful, and I'm going to New York to be a model" - and shows no signs of moving.<br><br>Frustrated, the senior attendant informs the captain, and he says he'll deal with the problem. He turns over flight control, walks to the rear, and observes the blonde seated comfortably in first class.<br><br>Approaching her with a smile, the captain leans over and speaks quietly into the blonde's ear. Almost immediately, the blonde gathers her things, gets up, and moves quickly to the coach compartment.<br><br>Amazed, the senior flight attendant asks the captain, "Captain, I'm impressed. What did you say to her?"<br><br>The captain grinned slyly and said, "I just told her that the first class cabin doesn't go to New York."<br></div>

Just as she was about to storm out of the house, her husband stopped her with these words:<br><br>"Before you leave, I want you to hear how this all came about. While I was driving along the highway, I saw this young girl here, looking tired and bedraggled, so I brought her home and made her a meal from the roast beef you had forgotten in the refrigerator. She had only some worn-out sandals on her feet, so I gave her a pair of good shoes you had discarded because they had gone out of style. She was cold, so I gave her the sweater I bought you for your birthday that you never wore because the colors didn't suit you. Her slacks were worn out, so I gave her a pair of yours that were perfectly good but too small for you now."<br><br>Then, as the young girl was about to leave the house, she paused and asked, "Is there anything else your wife doesn't use anymore?"<br></div>

Why so expensive?" the guy asked in amazement.<br><br>The lady pulled the guy to the window and asked him: "Do you see that shiny red Porsche down there? That's what I earned by my hand!" The guy was convinced and decided to try her service. It was great! So he asked, "What else can you do?"<br><br>The lady said: "For $200 I'll give you a blowjob." "What? That's way too expensive for a blow job!" he replied.<br><br>The lady brought him to the window again, and said: "Do you see the restaurant down there? That's what I've earned with my mouth!"<br><br>So the guy decided to go for it and gave her $200. It was unbelievable! So he decided he wanted to try the "real" thing. So he asked: "How much for real intercourse?"<br><br>The lady pulled him over to the window again, and said: "Do you see that skyscraper there?

When you chug the beer, it makes you all warm inside and since warm air rises, if you just hold your breath you become lighter than air and float down to the sidewalk."

"Well, the answer is four," said the teacher. "But I like the way you are thinking."<br><br>Little Johnny said, "I have a question for you now. If there were three women eating ice cream cones, one licking her cone, the second biting her cone, and the third one sucking her cone, which one is married?" "Well," said the teacher nervously, "I guess the one sucking the cone?" "No," said Little Johnny, "The one with the wedding ring on her finger. But I like the way you are thinking.<br><br>Another day in class the teacher brought a bag full of fruit. "Now class, I'm going to reach into the bag and describe a piece of fruit, and you tell what fruit I'm talking about."<br><br>"Okay, first: it's rounded, plump and red." Of course, Johnny raised his hand high, but the teacher wisely ignored him and picked Deborah, who promptly answered "An apple." "No Deborah, it's a beet, but I like your thinking."<br><br>"Now, for the second: It's soft, fuzzy, and colored red and brownish." Well, Johnny is hopping up and down in his seat trying to get the teacher to call on him. But she skips him again and calls on Billy. "Is it a peach?" "No, Billy, I'm afraid it's a potato. But I like your thinking."<br><br>"Here's another: it's long, yellow, and fairly hard." By now Johnny is about to explode as he waves his hand frantically. The teacher skips him again and calls on Sally. "A banana," she says. "No," the teacher replies, "It's a squash, but I like your thinking."<br><br>Johnny is kind of irritated now, so he speaks up loudly. "Hey, I've got one for you teacher; let me put my hand in my pocket. Okay, I've got it: "It is round, hard, and it got a head on it." "Johnny!" she cries. "That's disgusting!" "Nope," answers Johnny, "It's a quarter, but I like your thinking."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BAD PARROT<br><br>There's this fellow with a parrot. And the parrot swears like a sailor. He can swear for five minutes straight without repeating himself. Trouble is, the guy who owns him is a quiet, polite, conservative type, and this bird's foul mouth is driving him crazy.<br><br>One day, it gets to be too much, so the guy grabs the parrot by the throat, shakes him really hard, and yells, "QUIT IT!" This just makes the bird mad and he swears more than ever. Then the guy gets mad, says "OK, for you" and locks the bird in a kitchen cabinet. This really aggravates the bird and he claws and scratches.<br><br>When the guy finally lets him out, the bird cuts loose with a stream of vulgarities that would make a veteran sailor blush. At that point, the guy is so mad that he throws the bird into the freezer. For the first few seconds there is a terrible din. The bird kicks and claws and thrashes and uses words Lenny Bruce and George Carlin NEVER thought about trying to use in their acts. Then suddenly, it gets VERY quiet. At first the guy just waits, but then he starts to think that the bird may be hurt or deeply chilled.<br><br>After a couple of minutes of silence, he's so worried that he opens the freezer door. The bird calmly climbs onto the man's outstretched arm and says, "I'm awfully sorry about the trouble I gave you. I'll do my best to improve my vocabulary from now on." The man is astonished. He can't understand the transformation that has taken place. Then the parrot says, "By the way, what did the chicken do?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>STRICT NURSING HOME<br><br>After deciding that their frail, elderly mother can no longer live alone, a family brings her to a nursing home, hoping she'll be well cared for.<br><br>The next morning, the nurses bathe the old woman, feed her a tasty breakfast, and sit her in a chair at a window overlooking a lovely flower garden. She seems fine, but after a while she slowly starts to lean over sideways in her chair.<br><br>Two attentive nurses immediately rush up to catch her and straighten her up. Again she seems fine, but after a while she starts to tilt to the other side. The nurses rush back and once more bring her back upright. This goes on all morning. Later the family arrives to see how the old woman is adjusting to her new home.<br><br>"So Mum, how is it here? Are they treating you all right?" they ask.<br><br>"It's pretty nice," she replies. "Except they won't let you fart."<br></div>

In over 20 years of being a doctor I've never laughed at a patient." "OK then," says the man, and he drops his trousers.<br><br>The doctor is greeted by the sight of the tiniest penis he has ever seen in his life. Unable to control himself, he falls about laughing on the floor. Ten minutes later he is able to struggle up to his feet and wipe the tears from his eyes. "I'm so sorry," he says to the patient, "I don't know what came over me. I won't let it happen again. Now what seems to be the problem?" The man looks up at the doctor sadly and says, "It's swollen."<br></div>

Everyone looked at him and was just so amazed by this.<br><br>One guy walks over to the other guy and asks him where he got that little man and the piano. He replies, "Well, out there, is a genie and he grants you but one wish."<br><br>So, immediately after the guy heard that, he ran out to the genie. He walks back into the bar with all these ducks everywhere.<br><br>The guy with the man and piano asks, "Where'd all those ducks come from?"<br><br>The other says, "Well, I asked the genie for a million bucks, but he gave me a million ducks."<br><br>The first guy says, "Oh, I guess I should have warned you that the genie is hard of hearing. You don't actually think I asked for a 8 inch pianist, do you?"<br></div>

The pharmacist says the condoms come in packs of 3, 9 or 12 and asks which the young man wants.<br><br>"Well," he said, "I've been seeing this girl for a while and she's really hot. I want the condom because I think tonight is the night. We're having dinner with her parents, and then we're going out. And I've got a feeling I'm going to get lucky after that. Once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, so you'd better give me the 12 pack."<br><br>The young man makes his purchase and leaves. Later that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her parents. He asks if he might give the blessing, and they agree.<br><br>He begins the prayer, but continues praying for several minutes. The girl leans over and says, "You never told me that you were such a religious person." He leans over to her and says, "You never told me that your father is a pharmacist."<br></div>

When he began crying, God appeared and asked him, "Why are you crying?"<br><br>The woodcutter told him that he had dropped his axe into water. God went down into the water and reappeared with a golden axe.<br><br>"Is this your axe?" God asked.<br><br>The woodcutter said "No".<br><br>God again went down and came up with a silver axe. "Is this your axe?" God asked.<br><br>The woodcutter said "No".<br><br>God went down again and came up with an iron axe. "Is this your axe?" God asked.<br><br>The woodcutter said, "Yes".<br><br>God was pleased with the man's honesty and gave him all the three axes.<br><br>The woodcutter went home happily. One day while he was walking with his wife along the river, his wife fell into the river. When he began crying, God appeared and asked him, "Why are you crying?"<br><br>"My wife has fallen into water."<br><br>God went down into the water and came up with Jennifer Lopez. "Is this your wife?" God asked.<br><br>"Yes", he said.<br><br>God was furious, "YOU CHEAT! Now I am going to curse you."<br><br>The woodcutter quickly said, "Forgive me My Lord." It is a misunderstanding. If I say "No" to Jennifer Lopez, you will come up with Catherine Zeta Jones. If I also say "No" to her, you will finally come up with my wife and I will say, "Yes". Then you will give all the three to me. I am a poor man. I will not be able to look after all the three. So that's why I've to say "Yes".<br></div>
