The barman took his order and the panda went to sit down at a table. Soon, a waiter took over the meal, the panda gobbled it up, thanked, tipped the waiter and paid his bill.<br><br>All seemed normal until the panda pulled out a gun from the depths of his fur, pulled the trigger and BANG! Shot the waiter dead.<br><br>The barman rushed over and said: "Argh! You just shot my friend!"<br><br>The Panda calmly replied: "Do you know what I am?" "Of course I do," the barman answered, "You're a panda!" "Good," the Panda replied, "Now go home and look me up in the dictionary." And with that, the panda walked out of the bar.<br><br>The barman was a little unsure, but he was very eager to be enlightened on the subject of his friend's murder, so he went home to find his dictionary and after a while he found 'panda' and quickly read the definition.<br><br>PANDA: 1.

The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game?<br><br>The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.<br><br>The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and lot of fun. He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5 and vice versa."<br><br>Again, she declines and tried to get some sleep.

"OK," says the lawyer, "You turn."<br><br>She asks the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and come down with four legs?" The lawyer puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his reference, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to all his friends and co-workers, to no avail.<br><br>After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hand her $500. The blonde says, "Thank you!" And turns back to get some more sleep.<br><br>The lawyer, who is more than little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well. what was the answer?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hand the lawyer $5, and go to sleep.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>UPGRADING TO HUSBAND 1.0<br><br>Dear Tech Support:<br><br>Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed that the new program began making unexpected changes to the accounting modules, limiting access to flower and jewellery applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.<br><br>In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9 but installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and HouseCleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system.<br><br>I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail.<br><br>-- Desperate<br><br>***<br><br>Dear Desperate,<br><br>Keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system.<br><br>Try to enter the command: C:/ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and install Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications: Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to GrumpySilence 2.5, HappyHour 7.0 or Beer 6.1.<br><br>Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create "Snoring Loudly" wave files. DO NOT install MotherInLaw 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.<br><br>In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. Consider buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend HotFood 3.0 and Lingerie 5.3.<br><br>Good Luck!<br>Tech Support<br></div>

After a year, only three applied for the job. A Japanese, a Chinese and a Jewish Samurai.<br><br>"Demonstrate your skills!" commanded the Emperor.

"Number Two Samurai, show me what you can do."<br><br>The Chinese samurai smiled confidently, stepped forward and opened a tiny box, releasing a fly. He drew his samurai sword and * Swish! * Swish! * The fly fell to the floor neatly quartered!<br><br>"That is skill!" nodded the Emperor. "How are you going to top that, Number three Samurai?"<br><br>Number Three Samurai stepped forward, opened a tiny box releasing one fly, drew his samurai sword and *Swoooooosh! * flourished his sword so mightily that a gust of wind blew through the room. But the fly was still buzzing around! In disappointment, the Emperor said, "What kind of skill is that? The fly isn't even dead."<br><br>"Dead is easy." replied the Jewish Samurai. "Circumcision.

Since they were without their boyfriends or parents, they decide to go in.<br><br>The desk clerk, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. "We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. It's easy to decide, since each floor has signs telling you what's inside."<br><br>So they start going up, and on the first floor the sign reads, 'All the men here have it short and thin.'<br><br>The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor.<br><br>The sign on the second floor reads, 'All the men here have it long and thin.'<br><br>Still, this wasn't good enough, so the friends move up to the third floor, where the sign reads, 'All the men here have it short and thick.'<br><br>This was still another disappointment, but knowing there are still 2 floors left, they move on to the next floor.<br><br>On the fourth floor, the sign was perfect. 'All the men here have it long and thick.'<br><br>The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they were missing, they go to the fifth floor, where the sign reads, 'There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that it is impossible to please a woman.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LATE FOR THE EXAM<br><br>It was the final examination for an introductory English course at the local university. Like many such freshman courses, it was designed to weed out new students, having over 700 students in the class!<br><br>The examination was two hours long, and exam booklets were provided. The professor was very strict and told the class that any exam that was not on his desk in exactly two hours would not be accepted and the student would fail. 1/2 hour into the exam, a student came rushing in and asked the professor for an exam booklet.<br><br>"You're not going to have time to finish this," the professor stated sarcastically as he handed the student a booklet.<br><br>"Yes I will," replied the student. He then took a seat and began writing. After two hours, the professor called for the exams, and the students filed up and handed them in.<br><br>All except the late student, who continued writing. 1/2 hour later, the last student came up to the professor who was sitting at his desk preparing for his next class. He attempted to put his exam on the stack of exam booklets already there.<br><br>"No you don't, I'm not going to accept that. It's late."<br><br>The student looked incredulous and angry. "Do you know WHO I am?"<br><br>"No, as a matter of fact I don't," replied the professor with an air of sarcasm in his voice.<br><br>"DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?" the student asked again.<br><br>"No, and I don't care." replied the professor with an air of superiority.<br><br>"Good," replied the student, who quickly lifted the stack of completed exams, stuffed his in the middle, and walked out of the room.<br><br></div>

I'll tell jokes for 25 flights, Jim can sing songs for the next 25 flights and Scott can tell us sad stories for the rest of the way.<br><br>At the 26th floor, Bill stopped telling jokes and Jim began to sing. At the 51st floor Jim stopped singing and Scott began to tell sad stories.<br><br>"I will tell my saddest story first," he said. "I left the room key in the car."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A TIFF WITH YOUR SPOUSE<br><br>It's 3am, and the man is driving his brand new BMW M3 CSL down the N1 at 240km/h. He's two minutes away from home when he sees a car on the side of the road, on its roof, and flames all around.<br><br>There's no one else in the area, his cell phone reception is dead, and so he stops his car. Sure enough, there's a beautiful woman in the car, but she's bleeding to death. The guy reckons "screw it" and rushes home to fetch a blanket. He gets back, puts the blanket on the back seat of his M3, and puts the woman on the blanket. He then rushes her to the hospital.<br><br>Six months she lies in the hospital, and he is with her every day and very night. He donates blood to keep her alive. Eventually, she recovers fully, and they get married.<br><br>Life is cool for a few years, until one day she gets fed up and decides to leave him. His love of money is obvious, and she feels like a trophy wife.<br><br>As she comes down the stairs, struggling with her two suitcases, she reaches into her pocket for the keys to the Jaguar. Sure enough, he stops her before she reaches the door, and asks, "What are you doing?" "I'm leaving you," she says. "Oh really, and how are you going to leave? The keys in your hand are for the Jaguar I paid for. It's my car. You're not taking it anywhere."<br><br>"Fine," she says, and throws the keys at him. "And those bulging suitcases? The clothes you're wearing? Everything, I've paid for. They are my suitcases and my clothes. You're not taking them any where."<br><br>"Fine," she says, and throws the suitcases at him. She strips down completely and throws her clothes at him too. "And the blood in your body? I sat with you for six months in the hospital. You know half of the blood is mine. You're not going anywhere."<br><br>She whips out her tampon and says "I'll pay you back in monthly installments."<br></div>

At bedtime, the two boys knelt beside their beds to say their prayers when the youngest one began praying at the top of his lungs, "I PRAY FOR A NEW BICYCLE. I PRAY FOR A NEW NINTENDO. I PRAY FOR A NEW VCR."<br><br>His older brother leaned over and nudged the younger brother and said, "Why are you shouting your prayers? God isn't deaf." To which the little brother replied, "No, but Grandma is!"<br></div>

Just cooperate with anything he wants. If he wants to have sex with you, just go along with it and pretend you like it. Our lives depend on it!"<br><br>"Dear," the wife hissed, spitting out her gag, "I'm so relieved you feel that way, because he just told me he thinks you have a really nice butt!"</div>

Promise!<br><br>Well, the hours passed and the beer was going down way too easy. At around 2:30 a.m., drunk as a skunk, I headed for home. Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hall started up and cuckooed 3 times. Quickly, I realized she'd probably wake up, so I cuckooed another 9 times. I was really proud of myself, having a quick-witted solution, even when smashed, to escape a possible conflict.<br><br>The next morning my wife asked me what time I got in, and I told her twelve o'clock. She didn't seem disturbed at all. Whew! Got away with that one!<br><br>She then told me that we needed a new cuckoo clock.<br><br>When I asked her why, she said, "Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said 'Oh Shit,' cuckooed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckooed another 3 times, giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then farted."<br></div>
