"Oh no, my dear," replied granny. "Many years ago, realizing our advanced age, we figured out the best time to do it was when the church bells would start to ring. It was just the right rhythm. Nice and slow and even. Nothing too strenuous, simply in on the Ding and out on the Dong."<br><br>She paused, wiped away a tear and then continued, "and if that damned ice cream truck hadn't come along, he'd still be alive today."<br></div>

So I went out onto the balcony, we live on the 25th floor, and found this man hanging over the edge by his fingertips. I went inside, got a hammer, and started hitting his hands. He fell, but landed in some bushes. So, I got the refrigerator and pushed it over the balcony and it crushed him. The strain of the act gave me a heart attack, and I died."<br><br>St. Peter couldn't deny that this was a pretty bad day, and since it was a crime of passion, he let the man in.<br><br>He then asked the next man in line about the day he died. "Well, sir, it was awful," said the second man. "I was doing aerobics on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment when I twisted my ankle and slipped over the edge. I managed to grab the balcony of the apartment below, but some maniac came out and started pounding on my fingers with a hammer. Luckily I landed in some bushes. But, then the guy dropped a refrigerator on me!"<br><br>St. Peter chuckled, let him into heaven and decided he could really start to enjoy this job. "Tell me about the day you died?", he said to the third man in line. "OK, picture this; I'm naked, hiding inside a refrigerator..."<br></div>

"But where did the 10 thousand dollars come from?" she asked. "Every time I got a dozen, I sold it."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MARITAL SEX<br><br>A mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt.<br><br>The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding. The card said nothing but "Nescafe". Mom was puzzled at first, but then went the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: "Good till the last drop."<br><br>Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter.<br><br>The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, and the card read: "Benson &amp; Hedges". Mom now knew to go straight to her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson &amp; Hedges pack: "Extra long. King Size".<br><br>She was again slightly embarrassed but still happy for her daughter.<br><br>The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean. Mom waited for a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing. Then after a whole month, a card finally arrived. Written on it with shaky handwriting were the words "British Airways". Mom took out her latest Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, and finally found the ad for British Airways.<br><br>The ad said: "Three times a day, seven days a week, both ways."<br><br>Mom fainted.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PARROT<br><br>A man goes into a pet shop to buy a parrot. The shop owner points to three identical looking parrots on a perch and says:<br><br>"The parrot to the left costs 500 dollars". "Why does the parrot cost so much?" the customer asks. The owner says, "Well, it knows how to use a computer."<br><br>The customer asks about the next parrot and is told "That one cost 1,000 dollars because it can do everything the other parrot can do plus it knows how to use the UNIX operating system."<br><br>Naturally, the increasingly startled man asks about the third parrot and is told "That one costs 2,000 dollars." Needless to say this begs the question "What can IT do?" To which the owner replies "To be honest I have never seen it do a thing but the other two call him boss!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DISSUASION<br><br>The beautiful secretary of the president of the Chase Manhattan Bank goes to a sight-seeing tour with a very rich Taiwanese client. The client out of the blue asks her to marry him.<br><br>Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback. However, she remembers what her boss told her, "Don't reject the guy outright." So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting to marry her.<br><br>So, after a few minutes, the woman says to the man, "I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75 carat diamond ring, with a matching 200 carat diamond tiara."<br><br>The Taiwanese man pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, "No problem! I buy."<br><br>Realizing that her first condition was too easy, the woman says to the man, "I want you to build me a 100 room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine county in France."<br><br>The man pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone, calls some brokers in New York, then he calls some brokers in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, "Okay, okay. I build."<br><br>Realizing that she has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally, she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, "Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 12-inch penis."<br><br>The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table. All the while, he's muttering something in Chinese. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the man shakes his head, looking real sad, says to the woman, "Okay, okay. I cut."<br></div>

As the bus rolled up and it become her turn to get on, she become aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her legs to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.<br><br>Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.<br><br>Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover she still couldn't. So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more for a second time. Attempted the step and once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.<br><br>So, with a coy little smile to the driver, she unzipped the offending skirt a little more slack and again was unable to make a step.<br><br>About this time, the Texan that was behind her in the line, picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus.<br><br>Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, "How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!"<br><br>At this, the Texan drawled, "Well, ma'am, normally I would agree with you but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kind of figured that we are friends!"<br></div>
