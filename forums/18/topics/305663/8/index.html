              <p>I am not a prude, what I meant was you condoned what those
              edison and females artistes are doing by taking photos of their
              lovemaking.   So as for you if you do the same you have
              to guarantee that the photos will not leak to be exposed on the
              internet.  If once it is exposed on internet, me together with
              others will get to see it.</p>

              <p>i don't think it is in anyone's position to say whether its right or wrong. definitely its not wrong, because its their own private lives, and their sex lives. i think its more about whether its wise to do so or not.</p>
              <p>if they want to take photos. its within their rights to do so. of course if things go badly, then its also their own fault.</p>

              <p>btw. the difference between being pure and being a prude is this:</p>
              <p><strong>being pure</strong>: making sure you don't fall in sexual sins. and if others fall, you caringly guide them back on the right track, never condemning them and covering them in love against the shame they endured, so that they will grow from the experience. so that in turn, they can be a shelter for others who are going through the same issues.</p>
              <p><strong>being prudish</strong>: making sure others don't fall in sexual sins. and if they do, critisize and condemn them like crazy. making sure they pay for it with the rest of their lives and never be able to live their lives ever again, and forever reminding them of their wrongdoing with a <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> everytime you see them.</p>

              <p>lol, so there's no conclusive evidence from you on these 2 issues then?</p>
              <ul>
              <li>is it morally and ethically right for a legally married couple to take pictures of themselves in the act of lovemaking, as a way of enhancing their sex lives.</li>
              <li>and where in the bible did it say that erotic photography was a sin?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>ok, now this is funny. touched a raw nerve? how can the nonsense you sprew around touch any "raw nerves" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p><em>"oh, you reminded me of the horrifying moment in my life when i was brutally raped and abused by an idiot who misquoted the bible and had a myopical viewpoint about how others should handle their sex lives"</em></p>
              <p>or maybe it was</p>
              <p><em>"you remind me of so many other idiots who mentally abused me with their broken moral compass and accompanying mental retardation..."</em></p>
              <p>let me tell you what would be possibly touching a raw nerve. is that i suspect that you're so angry about edison taking photographs of his lovers, that you're more angry about him doing that, rather than him engaging in premarital sex,</p>
              <p>is because you, probably once made the mistake of doing having sex and your lover took pictures as a memento, and now your pictures are circulating in the world wide web and every guy, from the pimply school nerd to the hardcore rock star wannabe is jerking off to your pictures every night.</p>
              <p>now i'm most probably wrong, but i'm just saying, that this, is called "touching a raw nerve". not your pathetic attempt to reason out why i think you are an idiot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lol. don't be mistaken. just because i think you're an idiot, doesn't make you my enemy. in fact, i just see this as differential pov, and your reasonings just happen to make me conclude that you're an idiot with a broken moral compass and that you're focusing on the wrong issues in this edison episode.</p>
              <p>that doesn't mean i don't "love" you, "Moi Nemico"... *cough, finally got a verse right, cough* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway, it's not people like me who chase away others from church. but actually it's judgemental people like you, who're more conceren with pointing out the shame of other people and their wrong doings instead of focusing on the good things they do.</p>
              <p>people like you judge, according to your standards, by clamping others down with your own interpretation of morality, and misquoting the bible to back you up, hoping that others don't read enough of the bible to know you're misquoting it. that's how cults and terrorist groups start up, by the way.</p>
              <p>since you're talking about bible verses, let me tell you one, you should be familiar with, judge not, lest you be judged.</p>
              <p>you'll never know one day you might fall to temptation, and all these condemning stares and fiery speeches about how others deserve it, come crashing back down on you, how can you stand then? and when that happens. it will be "people like me" who will stand for you, and helping you move on and shooting down "people like you" for their judgemental and condemning attitudes.</p>
              <p>and don't give me that crap about "how you'll never make that mistake la.. etc" everyone makes mistakes, everyone sins, and anyone can make the mistake that edison made. including you.</p>

              Latest News!
              Kira received 7 million HK dollars, disappears forever.
              Beijing, Feb 12, 2008
              
              The curtain has dropped: According to friends in HK, all the photos we have seen thus far were screen captures from videos. Gillâ€™s photos were the first 10 minutes of the video, why? Because it was a used as a bargaining chip for extortion. Secondly, the audio of the video involves the reputation of many other big-name celebrities.
              Gaoqing (who?) has over 1000 photos alone, and they were partially released last year. The first time Edisonâ€™s photo got released was the result of a hacker. This hacker has the most complete data. In order to protect himself from hackers and trojans, he transferred part of his data to his Apple computer. Apple does not run Windows, and most trojan are designed towards windows. The photos that were stolen during his computer repair is only a small part, and that is to the person we come to know as Kira. Photos of Vincy Yeung released on the 9th was unexpected from EEG Music. As we know, Edisonâ€™s photo all came in a set, and every women has a complete collection including the sexual parts. Usually they are released in few numbers first, then released in completion. So Vincy has a complete collection too.
              
              Kiraâ€™s upload on the 9th, 4:45 is the last upload from Kira. He had an agreement with EEG in the amount of 700 hk dollars. Why did Gillâ€™s manager said Gill would appear on the 11th? Because they have came to an agreement with Kira. After the money is received he needs 24 hours to confirm payment, also time for him to flee. As a matter of fact, the photos he has have already been uploaded to various free servers in the United States and Europe. If the discussion does not fall into place or if anything were to happen to him, he has set automatic emails that would email the links to his trustworthy friends, so they can spread the files. The reason Gill appears in front of the media on the 11th, and the fact that she had a big smile on her face, was because she knew the ordeal has came to a rest.
              
              Whatâ€™s Kiraâ€™s gain for showing us the photos? What does he get by destroying the life of these celebrities? He is not a warrior of morals, heâ€™s just a regular Hong Kong citizen. Money is his ultimate choice. So everyone, please stop calling for him, he has disappears forever. From tomorrow, thereâ€™s a lot more entertainers going to entertain us, and the danger is over. It is disappointed for us, but we all know the reason behind Kiraâ€™s action.
              
              Gossip
              The photos actually were stolen a long time ago. At first Kira talked to Edison, asking for 5 million HK dollars, but was not agreed upon. Edison was afraid he wonâ€™t be able to get back all the photos. He looked for Yeung Shou Cheng (EEGâ€™s president) to help him on the matter. Eventually, Kira released some information to the media, the magazines last year briefly mentioned this matter. However because of EEGâ€™s influential power, magazines were afraid to show the photos nor pay Kira. Through the help of magazineâ€™s editor, one of the three members from Kiraâ€™s group was found. He knew whether he surrender the photos or not, he was doomed. He did not say anything while being question, and was eventually killed. The other two then fled to Southeast Asia, and again try to distort EEG and Edison. Befor the matter gains public attention Edison already knew, because both parties could not agree on a price, this time Kira was asking more than 10 millions. Edison took a private car to Shenzhen, then to Macau, took a private plane from his dadâ€™s friend to the United States, and look for Vincy Yeung to help his cause. Yeung Shou Cheng thought he could handle the matter, but eventually it was still not solved. Kira has decided to raise the price, and released the photos the night when Edison fled HK. Since that day Kira has been raising his price every day. It is believed Kira is in Thailand and Indonesia, and Kira is a group of two, and the data has been uploaded to the United States.
              Do not think you have seen the best of all, why hasnâ€™t C10â€™s and Maggie Qâ€™s photo being released? Because Kira hasnâ€™t gotten the right price, or because of safety reason, there isnâ€™t a safe way for him to get paid.
              Right now, both parties are fighting. The involvement of HK police has propelled this tension to its maximum. If Kira is sure he couldnâ€™t get his money, thereâ€™s gonna be a monster upload, but not all. The reason is because thereâ€™s heavy involvement from other celebrities, including HK, China and Taiwan. If Kira wants to live longer than Edison, he would have to have something to protect himself from.
              
              It is obvious what is going to happen to Edison, heâ€™s going to die unnaturally.
              
              Vincyâ€™s 3 photos was a declaration of power to EEG, showing Kira has even better materials. This action forced EEG to come to the table, leaving the police behind. Boboâ€™s photos that were uploaded today were no longer of importance, since she was only a sacrifice in this whole matter. However, Vincy, C10 and Maggie Q, definitely will not be released today. Because this is Kiraâ€™s ultimate chip. And the most controversial material in Kiraâ€™s collection? I dare not say, because I donâ€™t want to die before Edison does.
