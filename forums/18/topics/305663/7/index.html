              <p>If they want to have sex, go ahead but if they take the photos of the lovemaking then they have to take the risk it will be very possible to be exposed one day, which it did.   Both edison and those female artistes are consenting to the phototaking so no pain, I don't pity them for they ask for it.</p>

              HONG KONG - THE Hong Kong starlet at the centre of a sex photos scandal said on Monday she had been 'naive and silly' as the media storm over the explicit images reached a frenzy in the celebrity-obsessed city.
              <p> </p>
              Gillian Chung, one of several leading Canto-pop and film stars whose photos in compromising positions have been plastered across the Internet, made a brief statement to a horde of journalists after meeting with her fans.
              <p> </p>
              The singer of popular Canto-pop group, Twins, voiced for the first time her anguish over the leaked pictures.
              <p> </p>
              'This incident has tormented and hurt me and the people around me. I admit that I used to be very naive and very silly, but I've already grown up now,' she told 150 reporters, photographers and cameramen.
              <p> </p>
              'I thank my company, family and friends for their care and support. I deeply regret the impact the incident has caused to society and people. I will work hard in the future and will positively face my life ahead ... I am thankful for the fans who haven't given up on me,' said Chung who is popular with teenage girls.
              <p> </p>
              She is one of at least seven stars to be sucked into the twists and turns of the scandal over the photos which has dominated headlines in the southern Chinese territory for several weeks.
              <p> </p>
              They feature singer-actor Edison Chen with a string of Hong Kong starlets including Chung, actress Cecilia Cheung, and former actress Bobo Chan.
              <p> </p>
              Chen, star of 'Grudge 2', has been romantically linked to all three in the past. The pictures with Chung are reported to have been taken as far back as 2001.
              <p> </p>
              Media reports say the photos were copied from Chen's computer when he sent it in for repairs. The photos first started appearing several weeks ago on the Internet, and were initially dismissed as hoaxes.
              <p> </p>
              Local media also reported that CDs filled with hundreds of the racy pictures have appeared in the shops of the neighbouring Chinese city of Shenzhen and quickly sold out.
              <p> </p>
              Vincy Yeung, Chen's current girlfriend and niece of the boss of Chen's management company, Emperor Entertainment Group, has told the media that she will stand by her man, despite pictures resembling her being published on the Internet over the weekend.
              <p> </p>
              Last week, Chen issued a statement on video website YouTube, in which he apologised to 'anyone who has been affected by this strange, strange ordeal'.
              <p> </p>
              'The lives of many innocent people have been affected by this malicious and criminal conduct,' he added.
              <p> </p>
              The police have made several arrests linked to the case, but have faced criticism that they have been over-zealous. Hundreds of Internet users marched on Sunday to protest over the force's handling of the case.
              <p> </p>
              John Tong, the city's newly-appointed Catholic bishop has even weighed in, saying people should stop passing on the pictures, according to the South China Morning Post.
              <p> </p>
              'It is also biblical teaching that we should speak no evil, see no evil and hear no evil. It is important that we should keep our mind decent and, perhaps needless to say, we should not post or circulate pictures,' he said, when asked about the scandal.
              <p>Hong Kong's media competes tirelessly to break scoops about the city's film and pop stars, whose popularity often extends across Asia. -- AFP</p>

              <p>My sis said the same as you.  In Cantonese, we say she is kar cheng keng!   She does not look a bit sad or affected when she appeared to talk about the issue.   She seems happier than the phototaking in the changing room.   She is just being superficial and lacked sincerity in talking about the issue, she did it because she wants to continue to be in showbusiness and wants things to go on smoothly for her.</p>
              <p>She is a seductress in sheep's clothing.</p>

              <p>I am not a prude, what I meant was you condoned what those edison and females artistes are doing by taking photos of their lovemaking.   So as for you if you do the same you have to guarantee that the photos will not leak to be exposed on the internet.  If once it is exposed on internet, me together with others will get to see it.</p>
