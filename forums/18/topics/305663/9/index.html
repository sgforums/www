              <h1 class="clr">Star apologises over Hong Kong sex photos scandal</h1>
              <p>HONG KONG (AFP) - - The actor at the centre of an Internet sex photos
              scandal involving a string of Hong Kong stars admitted Thursday that he
              took them and announced his retirement from the local entertainment
              scene.</p>
              <p>The explicit photographs of Edison Chen with actresses and pop stars
              have been plastered across the Internet over the past few weeks,
              causing a storm in this celebrity-obsessed city.</p>
              <p>Speaking
              publicly for the first time since the scandal broke, Canadian-born
              Chen, 27, said he had returned to Hong Kong to account for himself.</p>
              <p>"I
              would like now to apologise to all the people for all the suffering
              that has been caused and the problems that have arisen from this," he
              said, reading a statement in English to a packed press conference.</p>
              <p>"I
              would like to apologise to all the ladies and to all their families for
              any harm or hurt that they have been feeling. I am sorry," he said.</p>
              <p>Media
              reports say the photos -- which purportedly show him in compromising
              positions with various celebrities, including Canto-pop star Gillian
              Chung, actress Cecilia Cheung and former actress Bobo Chan -- were
              copied from Chen's computer when he sent it in for repairs.</p>
              <p>Chen admitted taking the photos but said they had been stolen from him.</p>
              <p>"I
              admit that most of the photos being circulated on the Internet were
              taken by me but these photos were very private and have not been shown
              to people and were never intended to be shown to anyone," said the star
              of "Grudge II."</p>
              <p>"These photos were stolen from me illegally and
              distributed without my consent. There's no doubt whoever obtained these
              photos had been uploading them on the Internet with malicious and
              deliberate intent," he said.</p>
              <p>Chen said he was helping the police investigation.</p>
              <p>"I
              have been assisting the police since the first day the photos were
              published and I will continue to assist them," he said, thanking the
              police "for their hard work on this case."</p>
              <p>Hong Kong police have
              made several arrests linked to the case, but have faced criticism that
              they have been over-zealous because the scandal involved celebrities. A
              charge against one Hong Kong man detained over the photos was dropped
              last week.</p>
              <p>In the wake of the scandal, Vancouver-born Chen said
              he had now decided to retire from the Hong Kong entertainment scene,
              whose stars are popular across Asia.</p>
              <p>"During my time away I have
              made an important decision. I will wholeheartedly fulfil all
              commitments I have to date but after that I have decided to step away
              from the Hong Kong entertainment industry," he said.</p>
              <p>"I have
              decided to do this to give myself an opportunity to heal myself and to
              search my soul. I will dedicate my time to charity and community work
              within the next few months.</p>
              <p>"I will be away from Hong Kong entertainment indefinitely."</p>
              <p>Chen,
              who had a supporting role in cop thriller "Infernal Affairs," which
              Martin Scorsese remade as "The Departed," said he had failed as a role
              model and apologised to the people of Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>"I give my
              apologies sincerely to you all, unreservedly and with my heart. I know
              young people in Hong Kong look up to many figures in our society, and
              in this regard I have failed as a role model," he said.</p>
              <p>Chen
              added that he had instructed his "lawyers to do everything possible
              within the law to protect all the innocent victims in this case."</p>
              <p>"I hope you all will accept my apology and give me a chance."</p>
              <p>The
              scandal has spread across the region, with police in Taiwan and China
              arresting around a dozen people this week for allegedly possessing and
              distributing the photographs.</p>
