Pls explain yourself.</div></blockquote>I think if she's drunk beforehand, then it is entirely possible since she is high. Could be a friendly outing at a pub that turned out bad, ie she got high and they took her to the house where the rape was conducted. Please remember that a person under the heavy influence of alcohol is incapable of rational thinking, so I think this poor girl just 'went with the flow'...and after all, we are all human, and we respond to lust accordingly, so how can you fault her for 'enjoying it' even if it's disgustingly so? Think we should try to help her erase the scars instead of heaping accusations, after all what's done cannot be undone....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Some people drunk liao, will talk even more wan!  And if you had talked to your partner, how come can "change people" and u didn't know about it?  impossible leh.  unless the session very fast, mebbe not much was said.  but u said the session went on and on.... so that possibility is out.<br><br>another thing u should know is that usually it's more diffcult and takes longer to achieve orgasm when a person has got higher blood-alchohol.  So it's not actually surprising if the session too much longer than usual (ie like u said "went on and on").  And i'm sure this is not your first time having sex since u said you've played this "game" before.... so i'm sure you should at least be able to know when your partner has climaxed.  I'm sure u should be able to tell the difference between a long session and many (repeated) sessions.<br><br>i know it's not very nice to accuse a rape victim of lying, so i'm not acusing you.  But there are so many details that i mentioned above which i do not quite understand.

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously... if i were u.. i wouldn't hv gotten into that kind of situation where i could be taken advantage of. so i have absolutely no idea what i will do if i were u.<br><br>yea. it does sound abit dramatic. but. i choose to believe you, cause it's not something totally outrageous. but i don't have much "oh, i'm so sorry you went thru all that" kind of talk. cause its not like u were raped like women in world war 2 jap occupation. u walked into a situation where u chose to get drunk. which could have been all avoided if u chose not to drink so heavily.</div>
