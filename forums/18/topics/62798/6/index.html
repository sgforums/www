            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the postings, I would recommand highly call the counselling hotline,have a chat with the counsellor and seek their advice and perhaps from there maybe you can make a decision whether to report to the police to nab those bastards.Anyway juz call the counsellor.There is no harm about calling them since all contents disclosed to them would be confidential and as well as a more suitable avenue for you to pour your troubles. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
