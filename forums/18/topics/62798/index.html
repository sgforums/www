Even if it can be proven that his friends had intercourse witn you, it will be their words against yours whether it was rape or consensual, unless the sun came up from the west and you can get one of them to testify for you.

To be frank, I won't be surprised if in that intoxcated state you were actually aware of what was happening, especially since you "enjoyed" it.  So don't feel sorry for yourself.
