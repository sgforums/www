The Criminal Procedure Code was amended in 1969 to provide for trials of capital offences to be heard before two Judges and a jury. The accused would be convicted only when the Judges reached a unanimous decision on his guilt. This arrangement continued until 18 April 1992, when the Criminal Procedure Code was once again amended to allow for trials of capital offences to be heard before a single Judge.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
