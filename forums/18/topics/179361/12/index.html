If the threadstarter got banned, surely he has done something wrong? Or else there would be no reason for him to be banned by the moderator. And the error he has done can be found in many of the threads around here if you just<br>look hard enough for them. I believe he has been given enough warnings already so about the 'banned without warning' statement, he's just lying.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
