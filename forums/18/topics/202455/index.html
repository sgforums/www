            <div class='col-md body'>The Electric New Paper :<br>Strip shock at petrol kiosk<br>Cashier accuses man of stealing sunglasses. He denies it<br>FIRST he was accused of stealing a pair of sunglasses.<br>By Teh Jen Lee<br>29 July 2006<br><br>FIRST he was accused of stealing a pair of sunglasses.<br><br>But what he did next stunned those who witnessed the incident: He pulled up his shirt and pulled down his jeans, to prove his innocence.<br><br>Did he over-react at the allegation of shoplifting?<br><br>Tattoo artist Lee Kai Woon, 31, maintained that he did not, because, according to him, it was an employee at an SPC petrol kiosk, where the incident took place, who told him to strip.<br><br>He claimed that the cashier at the kiosk in Jalan Bukit Merah sparked off the dispute when he wrongly accused Mr Lee of stealing the sunglasses.<br><br>When Mr Lee denied the theft, he claimed the employee told him to strip if he was innocent.<br><br>DIFFERENT ACCOUNT<br><br>But the SPC casher denied this. He gave a different account.<br><br>He claimed that Mr Lee appeared to be 'high' that night and reacted by shouting when he asked about the sunglasses.<br><br>Going by his version, Mr Lee had apparently stripped on his own. He insisted that he did not ask Mr Lee to strip.<br><br>Both sides have since lodged police reports.<br><br>But the police told The New Paper that they are not investigating the matter because no law had been broken.<br><br>Still, Mr Lee said he felt humiliated by the incident.<br><br>He said: 'It's such an insult. I have been losing sleep over this.'<br><br>On 16 Jul, around 11pm, he went to the SPC petrol kiosk near Bukit Merah Central to buy some canned drinks.<br><br>Mr Lee, who is married with a young daughter, was there with friend who lives in the area.<br><br>'My friend was looking through the papers while I was looking at the sunglasses. I casually commented that I had lost my Oakley sunglasses, worth about $400.<br><br>'I put back those I tried on because they were too cheap, about $40. I felt they would spoil my eyes,' he said.<br><br>After he moved away from the rack, the cashier asked him whether he had taken a pair of glasses.<br><br>'I said no but the man didn't believe me,' claimed Mr Lee.<br><br>'He asked me to pour out the contents of the plastic bag I was carrying.'<br><br>There were no sunglasses in the bag.<br><br>Next came the alleged order to strip. The cashier asked him to do it, even though there was a female customer around at the time, Mr Lee claimed.<br><br>He pointed out that the cashier was tall and bigger than him so he felt he had no choice but to comply.<br><br>'He stood behind the counter, pointed his right hand and ordered me to strip. You can see it on the CCTV,' said Mr Lee, noting that he was aware that the kiosk had installed a security camera.<br><br>'I wanted to clear my name so I took off my T-shirt. He was still not satisfied so I had to pull down my jeans too. I have never been so humiliated in my life.'<br><br>When no sunglasses were found, the cashier did not apologise. Neither did the customer service department, claimed Mr Lee.<br><br>A spokesman for SPC confirmed that Mr Lee had reported the matter to their head office.<br><br>'We gave him the assurance that we would look into the matter immediately,' said SPC.<br><br>As it turned out, the missing pair of sunglasses were later found elsewhere in the shop.<br><br>Mr Lee said: 'If they had apologised, I would have let the matter rest.<br><br>'This was my first time at this kiosk. I can't believe they treat customers like this.'<br><br>He made a police report that night though it was past midnight.<br><br>'I was so mad. After making the report, I went home but I could not sleep the whole night.<br><br>COULD NOT SLEEP<br><br>'I kept thinking about what happened. The next day, I made another report because I felt it was sexual harassment,' said Mr Lee.<br><br>He also complained to the SPC customer service unit.<br><br>Mr Lee's wife, Debbie, 30, a cafe manager, said: 'I've never seen him getting so angry.<br><br>'I think he felt discriminated against, just because he has tattooes.<br><br>'That's probably what irked him the most.'<br><br>SPC's version of events is quite different.<br><br>In a police report filed the following night, the cashier reported that Mr Lee and his friend 'appeared to be high'.<br><br>Mr Lee was also 'seen loitering suspiciously at the sunglass rack'.<br><br>After that, a pair of glasses appeared to be missing.<br><br>When the cashier asked Mr Lee about the glasses, he denied taking them and started shouting.<br><br>Even when the cashier went back to the counter to serve another customer, Mr Lee continued to shout.<br><br>Then he 'suddenly took off his shirt and trousers' and he told the cashier that he would come back to look for him.<br><br>The cashier added that he lodged the report because he feared for his safety.<br><br>Mr Lee denied being high that night and denied threatening the cashier.<br><br>'They can say anything they want. I'm not stupid,' he said.<br><br>Mr Lee insists that he was wrongly accused and badly treated.<br><br>'I know there's a CCTV recording. Why would I complain about this if it was my own doing?'<br><br>A police spokesman told The New Paper: 'We will not be investigating this incident because no crime was committed.'<br><br>When told this, Mr Lee was indignant but resigned.<br><br>He said: 'If the police don't think there is a case, what can I do?' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
