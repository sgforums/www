            <div class='col-md body'>Fashion is a statement of yourself without having to use words.  Don't ever allow it to control you though, even if you're not in fashionable clothes you'll still be the same person.  But coming out and knowing other people look enviously at you does reinforce confidence...Simply it's a lifestyle, and you should enjoy it!  I love walking around London....Some of the best fusions of fashion can be found here.  I'm a super fan of Diesel &amp; Energie, some wicked streetwear.  Then there's Base, Topman, H&amp;M.  Topman's been going lower on my list since it went global...don't like clashing clothes with others.<br><br>Really enjoy Japanese fashion too.  Okini, Michiko Koshino, Yen Jeans, Evisu, Maharishi...quality stuff.<br><br>Selfridges is amazing!  Convent Garden, Bond Street, Carnaby Street, Soho.<br><br>Certain things I dislike though.  Really hate Bathing Ape though, probably the worst 'expensive' product that I've ever seen being done in retail!  So what if the t-shirts are unique, they look like shit!</div>

Rich people don't necessarily have good taste, unless "fashion taste" is defined by the brand.  I think people walking aroud with armani t-shirts do not necessarily equate to good taste.  Rather, people who know how to match colours, choose clothes with style/pattern/cut etc. are the real fashion peeps.  That doesn't necessarily come at a high price,  keep your eye open for trendy clothes AND a reasonable price.  Those that simply go out and dump cash upon brand names are lazy-assed sheep with no creativity.</div>

I find so call following "fashion" trend costly and in a couple more months, the trends moved away to long skirts and pants, etc. I don't know what's call fashionable since I am really into long term classic, generic clothes without acessories and all thoss dangling things, and this is another form of lazy, and I don't like to shop. So to the eyes of some "fashionable" xiao mei mei/ Ah Lian, when they look me up down... I must be an eye sore... anyways, I get pass down clothes from friends.. So if you guys wanna donate clothes to me... I am about M size...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>theres a fine distinction between fashion and style.<br><br>anyone can buy fashion, but not everyone has style.<br><br>as Diesel.Okini pointed out, style and taste go hand in hand.  Usually, people that can recognize trends, styles go for labels, because labels are the tastemakers.<br><br>Obviously, if you look at people that buy fake versace clothes, its highly likely that its just for the label, because anyone with half a brain will tell you that dontella's work is not close to gianni's standards at all.  the versace versus line, is quite terrible imo.  sure, its decent, but its not genius anymore.<br><br>you dont have to keep up with fashion's and trends, to be stylish.</div>

Those were the good old days where things last longer than battery life) and its such a classic piece. Chilli Red, lycra. Its a piece that always brings attention and wear it sparingly cause it makes one too many nose bleed... This is my kinda fashion. No one can get it anywhere and its one of a kind today.  I tend not to go for trend pieces cause they don't last and in the next season, its just plain tacky to wear them.  I don't shope in shopping centers cause the things they sell are so mass media. I head off to the China town shops and they import HK pieces.<br><br>There was once I saw some stranger on the street who wore the same gap T-shirt... its strange cause we both notice it immediately.  So what are your worse fashion mistakes. I remember making so many. I cannot wear skirts especially the ones with pleats. They make my butt look like a pumkin.<br></div>
