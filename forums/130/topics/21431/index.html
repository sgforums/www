            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys it is Prim@+!ve here,<br><br>Im jus wonderin here what the SH|T is happenin to our clan guys? First you all scold me for organising clan matches wit' clans, now you want me to. I have already cancelled all our matches u know. I have moved house from Choa Chua Kang to Springdale Condo just near Bukit Timah Plaza. Im gettin to play at $2.50 per hour or $6.00 for three hours which is rufus. I will only be able to play at Zone X once a week. I have been offered to join another clan too, this does not mean i am quitting just that i may not have enough cash to play sometimes. What the SH|T? Our clan is so damn lazy man. We haven't had a match in a month now. What the SH|T. Also everyone seems to be writing the same things in their BIO's and they are really gettin' BORING! Please try and use the left side of your brain and be more CREATIVE. Anyways here is our team motto-<br><br>" Everybody wanna run, everybody wanna hide from the gun "<br><br>It is off the Limp Bizkit song of the Mi2 soundtrack. Also Neo, for our site could you please put in some cool mp3's coz it gets a bit dull otherwise ya know. Im just saying that we all need to get off our asses and stop living off our past clan matches, we need to broaden our horizons and pick a definite goal for our clan. If you want i can organise a match with ELM anyday now. Just that it will probably be at E-Games. Is that a problem? I am really getting pissed off that my whole school holidays i havent play one single clan match yet! Today i met a fellow [kOd] member for the first time, he called himself [kOd]-RuSTyNailS-|^im.s^|.<br>Oh well i leave you with a short poem.<br><br>" The suns falling again on an autumn day, at the crack off dusk is when they plan to enter. Rookie gives the official nod, clan<br>[kOd] acknowledges. Lonelguy had already been over the stratergy, even the it was hard to predict the movements of the terrorists faction known as EleMenTS.<br>Prim@+!ve, Nan_Zai and AntiS@int flank around the big red container as TopGunner picks off enemies one by one. His beloved AWP has never let us down. As ???? succumbs to a head shot we see his lifeless body hit the ground. Brains side by side with his mp5 is where is shall forever lay. LonelyGuy pulls the pin off his grenade, and strafes around the corner. "Fire in the hole" he alerts. We all duck for cover. AntiS@!nt scouts with a spare scope. "Two behind the car, 1 behind the box. Oh, i can see a guy clutching a pistol, but he has no legs". "Thanks to me" giggles LonelyGuy. TopGunner slowly lifts his rifle on top of the box just as a silver metallic object is hurled from the opposite set of crates. "Fuck i can't fucking see!" the flash took the whole team. I rushed back. There was a flurry of gun fire. My eyes refocused. The maimed bodies of my friend lay before me. "Fucking para bastards" I yelled. The victory cheers from behind the crate suddenly stopped. I grabbed Nan_Zai's Bennelli and hurled myself behind the wall.<br>Just as I.......<br><br>(to be Continued)<br><br>Sorry guys, i know it sucked. But if you really want to know what happened read my next post on Friday Night. Guys start using the forum again ok. Cos if i see no replies im gonna be pist off.<br><br>]kOd[-:*Prim@+!ve*:-|^im.s^|<br></div>
