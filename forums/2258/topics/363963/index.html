              <p><em>Thursday, June 11, 2009</em><br><br>It's rare when real-world events 
              perfectly mirror experiments that scientists are conducting. <br><br>That's why 
              neuroscientists at the University of Washington were delighted at the reactions 
              of former President George W. Bush and Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki 
              when an Iraqi reporter flung his shoes toward the two men during a Baghdad news 
              conference. <br><br><strong>When Bush ducked and Maliki didn't flinch as the first shoe 
              sailed toward them, it was a real-world example supporting the theory that there 
              are two independent pathways in the human visual system. <br></strong><br>"The original 
              idea proposed is that one system guides your actions and the other guides your 
              perception. The interesting part is the 'action' system allows the brain to 
              'see' things your eyes do not perceive," said Jeffrey Lin, a UW psychology 
              doctoral student and lead author of a paper appearing June 11 in the journal 
              Current Biology. Co-authors are Scott Murray and Geoffrey Boynton, UW psychology 
              assistant and associate professors, respectively. <br><br>"When we throw two 
              balls at you with very similar trajectories, they may look the same to your 
              perceptual system, but your brain can automatically calculate which one is more 
              threatening and trigger a dodging motion before you've even realized what has 
              happened," said Lin. <br><br><strong>"If you look at the shoe-throwing video you will 
              see that the prime minister doesn't flinch at all. His brain has already 
              categorized the shoe as non-threatening which does not require evasive action. 
              But Bush's brain has categorized the shoe as threatening and triggers an evasive 
              dodge, all within a fraction of a second." <br></strong><br>To explore how this dual 
              visual system works, the researchers set up several experiments that were 
              similar to what baseball players experience when they step into the batter's box 
              and get ready for the pitcher to throw the ball. In a split second their action 
              system determines if the ball is going to hit their body and whether to initiate 
              a defensive bail out of the batter's box. <br><br>Instead of baseballs, college 
              students participating in three experiments looked at a computer monitor and 
              were instructed to quickly locate a target oval among a field of circular discs, 
              determine its path and press a key when they had found the oval. The key 
              manipulation in the study was that some of the trials began with a looming 
              stimulus at the position of the target oval. When this looming motion was on a 
              collision path with a student's head, the participant responded faster to the 
              target than when the looming motion just missed the head. The experiment showed 
              that a stimulus on a collision path with a student captured attention but one on 
              a near-miss path did not. Critically, subjects could not differentiate between 
              the subtly different collision and near-miss looming stimuli in a separate 
              experiment. <br><br>The authors strongly believe the research supports the idea 
              that the human visual system is composed of two independent systems. <br><br>"A 
              major focus of neuroscience is understanding how we deal with sensory 
              information," said Boynton. "There is no way the brain can possibly process and 
              analyze everything we are exposed to. We have to select what is important. In 
              the real world you are on your own and what you pay attention to is part of 
              survival. This experiment shows that threatening stimuli grab your attention, 
              even those we can't consciously identify. That this is more accurate than our 
              conscious perception is pretty amazing." <br><br>### <br><br>University of
