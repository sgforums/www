              <p><em>Friday, June 12, 2009</em><br><br>Fingerprints mark us out as individuals 
              and leave telltale signs of our presence on every object that we touch, but what 
              are fingerprints really for? According to Roland Ennos, from the University of 
              Manchester, other primates and tree-climbing koalas have fingerprints and some 
              South American monkeys have ridged pads on their tree-gripping tails, so 
              everyone presumed that fingerprints are there to help us hang onto objects that 
              we grasp. This theory that fingerprints increase friction between the skin and 
              whatever we grab onto has been around for over 100 years, but no one had 
              directly tested the idea. Having already figured out why we have fingernails, 
              Ennos was keen to find out whether fingerprints improve our grip, so he 
              recruited Manchester undergraduate Peter Warman to test out fingerprint 
              friction. <br><br>Because the friction between two solid materials is usually 
              related to the force of one of the materials pressing against the other, Ennos 
              and Warman had to find a way of pushing a piece of acrylic glass (Perspex®) 
              against Warman's finger before pulling the Perspex® along the student's finger 
              to measure the amount of friction between the two. Ennos designed a system that 
              could produce forces ranging from a gentle touch to a tight grip, and then 
              Warman strapped his index finger into the machine to begin measuring his 
              fingerprint's friction. <br><br>But after days of dragging the Perspex® along 
              Warman's fingers and thumbs, it was clear that something wasn't quite right. 
              Instead of the friction between each finger and the Perspex® increasing in 
              proportion to the amount that the Perspex® pushed against Warman's fingers, it 
              increased by a smaller fraction than Ennos had expected. Ennos realised that 
              instead of behaving like a normal solid, the skin was behaving like rubber, 
              where the friction is proportional to the contact area between the two surfaces. 
              <br><br>To check that skin behaves more like rubber than a normal solid, the duo 
              varied the area of each fingerpad that came into contact with the surface by 
              dragging narrow and wide strips of Perspex® along Warman's fingerpads. They 
              found that the friction did increase as more of the fingerprint came in contact 
              with the surface, so the skin was behaving just like rubber. <br><br>Finally, 
              the friction issue was clinched when Warman measured his fingerprints' surface 
              area. The area of skin in contact with the Perspex® was always 33% less than if 
              the fingerpads were smooth resulting in the maximum contact area. Fingerprints 
              definitely don't improve a grip's friction because they reduce our skin's 
              contact with objects that we hold, and even seem to loosen our grip in some 
              circumstances. <br><br>So if fingerprints don't tighten our grasp on smooth 
              surfaces, what are they for? Ennos explains that our fingerprints may function 
              in other ways. They might have evolved to grip onto rough surfaces, like tree 
              bark; the ridges may allow our skin to stretch and deform more easily, 
              protecting it from damage; or they may allow water trapped between our finger 
              pads and the surface to drain away and improve surface contact in wet 
              conditions. Other researchers have suggested that the ridges could increase our 
              fingerpads' touch sensitivity. Whatever our fingerprints are for, it seems that 
              the idea that they provide friction for grip is just another urban myth.
