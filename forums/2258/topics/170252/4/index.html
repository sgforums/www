This is just the intermediate pit stop," said project manager Tom Duxbury of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which managed the $212 million mission.<br><br>About a million comet and interstellar dust particles Â— most smaller than the width of a human hair Â— are believed to be inside a sealed canister.<br><br>The particles are thought to be pristine leftovers from the birth of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. Some samples could be even older than the sun.<br><br>The next stop for the capsule is the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where scientists will unlock its canister later this week. After a preliminary examination, they will ship the particles to laboratories all over the world for further study to analyze their composition.<br><br>"Inside this thing is our treasure," said principal mission scientist Don Brownlee of the University of Washington.<br><br>Stardust's successful return was welcome news to the space agency, which suffered a setback in 2004 when its Genesis space probe carrying solar wind atoms crashed into the same Utah salt flats and cracked open after its parachutes failed to deploy.<br><br>After the Genesis mishap, engineers rechecked Stardust's systems. Duxbury said its return home went "like clockwork."<br><br>Early Sunday, the Stardust mothership released the shuttlecock-shaped capsule, which plunged through the atmosphere at 29,000 mph.<br><br>The first parachute unfurled at 100,000 feet, followed by a larger chute, which guided the capsule to a 10-mph landing at Dugway Proving Ground.

They convert heat from the decay of radioactive plutonium pellets into electricity for the spacecraft's systems and science instruments.<br><br>The probe contains 24 pounds (11 kg) of plutonium processed into fire-resistant ceramic pellets, which, if fractured, tend to break into large chunks, not hazardous microscopic particles.<br><br>EXPLORING THE KUIPER BELT<br><br>The plutonium use sparked a small protest at the Kennedy Space Center earlier this month. A second protest was planned on Tuesday.<br><br>NASA said there is a 1 in 350 chance of a mishap that releases plutonium around the Cape Canaveral launch site. Even so, the agency said, the chance of dangerous radiation exposure to workers and the public is low.<br><br>NASA prefers to focus on a potentially rich scientific return from a mission to unexplored Pluto.<br><br>Scientists have come to understand, in recent years, that Pluto is not in strict terms a planet. It is one of thousands of planet-like objects in the distant region of the solar system called the Kuiper Belt.<br><br>Kuiper Belt Objects, which also include Pluto's largest moon, Charon, and two other recently discovered satellites, far outnumber the terrestrial inner planets -- Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars -- as well as the gas giants of the outer solar system, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.<br><br>Kuiper Belt Objects are believed to contain materials largely unchanged since they were formed at the birth of the solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago.<br><br>"Studying Pluto, Charon and the Kuiper Belt Objects are key to understanding the origin and evolution of the solar system," said science team leader Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.<br><br>If NASA launches New Horizons before February 2, the probe will be in position to fly by Jupiter within a year and pick up speed during a slingshot maneuver into Jupiter's gravity field.<br><br>That boost will allow the probe to fly by Pluto in July 2015. Otherwise, the journey will take until 2018 at the earliest.</div>

The company specializes in finding the genetic roots of human diseases by studying the Icelandic population. Decode Genetics first found the genetic variant in Icelanders and has now confirmed the finding in a Danish and an American population.<br><br>An immediate practical consequence of the discovery, Decode's chief executive, Kari Stefansson, said, will be a diagnostic test to identify people who carry the variant gene. If they know of their extra risk, he said, they will have an added incentive to stay thin and exercise.<br><br>Diabetes, which allows excess sugar to build up in the blood, leading to damage throughout the body, has reached significant proportions in many parts of the United States. It is a leading cause of blindness and loss of limbs. Type 2 diabetes, the predominant form, is typically diagnosed in adults and adolescents, though it is creeping into younger age groups.<br><br>The 38 percent of Americans who have inherited one copy of the variant gene have a 45 percent greater risk of Type 2 than do unaffected members of the population, and the 7 percent who carry two copies are 141 percent more likely to develop the disease, according to the Decode researchers, who were led by Struan F. A. Grant.<br><br>What scientists call the "population-attributable risk" of the new variant is 21 percent, which means that if all the variant genes were removed, so would 21 percent of diabetes cases.<br><br>The finding is "a beautiful piece of work and as convincing as any initial publication could be," said David Altshuler, a medical geneticist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, who has in the past taken issue with certain aspects of Decode's claims.<br><br>"In terms of the epidemiological risk of diabetes, this is by far the biggest finding to date," he said, just after hearing a lecture on the finding by Decode's chief statistician, Augustine Kong. Diabetes is thought to be caused by a variety of different genes, each conferring a risk for the disease. Because most of the variants exert a minor effect, they are hard to detect, and many claims to have found diabetes-causing genes have turned out to be unfounded.<br><br>"This has turned out to be the disease that has been the most difficult for geneticists to crack, probably because of the large environmental contribution," said Dr. Stefansson, the Decode chief executive.<br><br>The new variant identified by Decode is of a somewhat obscure gene that had not been suspected of having any involvement in diabetes. The gene, designated TCF7L2, is one that controls the activity of other genes. Its role may include setting the level of a hormone that acts along with insulin to control blood sugar levels.<br><br>Discovery of the TCF7L2 gene could be therapeutically helpful, Dr. Stefansson said, because it identified a major biochemical pathway through which the disease developed. Any of the genes and proteins that govern the pathway is a potential target for new drugs.<br><br>Dr. Altshuler, of Massachusetts General, agreed. "Being directed down that pathway is very helpful," he said, though he added that the process of developing better treatments might take a decade or two.<br><br>While Type 2 diabetes is more common in African-Americans, Latinos, American Indians and Asian-Americans, Dr. Stefansson said more studies were needed to see whether there were significant differences in the variant gene's distribution among races.<br><br>He said he could not yet say if the genetic variant was more common in African-Americans and so might explain their greater burden of Type 2 diabetes. But he noted that the variant was ancient, having arisen before the dispersal of modern humans from Africa thousands of years ago, and was found in all populations.</div>

Their conclusion is based on their finding that patterns of fungus outbreaks and extinctions in widely dispersed patches of habitat were synchronized in a way that could not be explained by chance.<br><br>If the analysis holds up, it will be the first to link recent climate changes to the spread of a fungus lethal to frogs and salamanders and their kin. The chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has devastated amphibian communities in many parts of the world over the last several decades.<br><br>But experts on amphibian disease and ecology are divided over the finding, which is being published today in the journal Nature. Several scientists criticized the paper yesterday, saying it glossed over significant sources of uncertainty; others said it was important evidence that warming caused by humans was already harming wildlife. Climate scientists have linked most of the recent rise in the earth's average temperature to the buildup of greenhouse emissions from smokestacks and tailpipes.<br><br>The new study was led by J. Alan Pounds, the resident biologist at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in Costa Rica. In an accompanying commentary, two scientists not involved in the research say it provides "compelling evidence" that warming caused by human activity was already disrupting ecology.<br><br>"The frogs are sending an alarm call to all concerned about the future of biodiversity and the need to protect the greatest of all open-access resources - the atmosphere," write the scientists, Andy Dobson, a Princeton University ecologist, and Andrew R. Blaustein, a zoologist at Oregon State University.<br><br>More than 110 species of brightly colored harlequin frogs, in the genus Atelopus, once lived near streams in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere, but about two-thirds of them have vanished since the 1980's.<br><br>A leading suspect is the chytrid fungus, which in recent decades has killed amphibians from deserts to lowland tropical forests to mountainsides. It is not clear whether the fungus has been spread around the world by human trade in amphibians or whether it has laid largely undetected and has only recently erupted.<br><br>Paradoxically, the fungus thrives best in cooler conditions, challenging the theory that global warming is at fault. But Dr. Pounds and his team, in studying trends in temperature and disease around the American tropics, found patterns that they say explain the situation.<br><br>Because warming increases evaporation, it can create clouds that tend to make days cooler by blocking sunlight, and make nights warmer by trapping heat. In an interview, Dr. Pounds said those conditions could have created favorable conditions for the spread of the chytrid fungus.<br><br>He said that because the seeming extinctions had occurred in lockstep over dispersed field sites, they were hard to attribute to anything other than the broad warming trend that scientists have linked to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases.<br><br>But some experts who have read the paper said they were troubled by definitive statements like "Our study sheds light on the amphibian-decline mystery by showing that large-scale warming is a key factor."<br><br>Cynthia Carey, an amphibian disease expert at the University of Colorado, said that while both climate and amphibian die-offs were serious problems, this particular paper failed to offer anything beyond circumstantial evidence.<br><br>"It is difficult to prove cause and effect on the ground where multiple factors interact in complex ways," she said.<br><br>Stephen H. Schneider, a climate expert at Stanford, who has worked with Dr. Pounds on other studies and consulted on this one, acknowledged that uncertainties remained but said the work was significant.<br><br>"It's like anything else that's complex," he said. "When you're in the early phases of learning you look for multiple lines of argument, and when they converge with basic theory, you increase your confidence in a connection."</div>
