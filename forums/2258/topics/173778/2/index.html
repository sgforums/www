It's 113 feet tall (34.5 m), weights approximately 9 million pounds and has entire fir trees for arms! Jim Sysko of Newry, Maine was the designing engineer and construction supervisor of this impressive snow structure. There's no way to roll the segments for something this big, so a circular frame 80 feet (24 m) wide and 4 feet (1.2 m) high was required to stabilize the base so this big boy wouldn't topple. About 60 people helped build it by climbing inside the frame to collect and pack the snow. The frame was then made smaller, more snow was added and packed and this process was repeated several more times until the sought after height was achieved -- kind of like making a huge layer cake of snow. In order to work on the upper most layers, volunteers were lowered into the sprouting snowman by a "cherry picker." The end result was a world record, according to the Guinness Book of Records, surpassing a 96 foot (29 m) monster built in Japan. Big "Frosty" finally melted away on June 10!<br><br>Provided by:<br>Jim Sysko</div>

These delicate crystals were formed when water vapor from the humid indoor air condensed on the very cold window glass -- the outdoor temperature was about -20Â°C (about - 4 F). Once the air temperature drops lower than about -10 C (15 F), vapor will condense on solid objects as hoar frost. Though the window glass looks clean and unblemished, it probably has some scratches or tensions, which resulted in these ice crystal trails -- the width of the ice trails is 5 mm maximum.<br><br>Provided and copyright by:<br>Sari Yli-Koivisto</div>

Here one has caught a fly, which is seen silhouetted against the green jaws in backlit sunlight. The Venus Fly Trap is found in nitrogen-poor bogs in the southeastern United States, mainly within a 100-mile radius of Wilmington, North Carolina. It has no cousins and is the only member of the Dionaea genus. Dionaea comes from the Greek Dione , a name for Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. Oddly enough, the history of muscipula seems to be lost. Some claim it means mousetrap, from the Latin mus for mouse. Others think it is from the Latin musca, for fly.

They were an abundant life form two to three billion years ago, but now are quite rare. The ideal present-day condition for stromatolite formation is warm, shallow, high-salinity seawater with restricted circulation, under which they grow less than a millimeter a day. This photo shows a stromatolite-rich layer that formed in a shallow sea in Morocco some 600 million years ago and then was buried by volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits of the Ouarzazate Group. The stromatolites were later exposed through uplift and erosion of the Anti-Atlas Mountains in the late Paleozoic and Cenozoic. Their remarkable preservation is due to the modern-day arid climate, making it appear that the sea just receded (see Shark Bay, Australia link].<br><br>Provided by:<br>Bill Burton, U.S. Geological Survey</div>

Mazama 7,000 years ago uncovered a remarkable cross section of the structure of that volcano, which is visible today on the inner walls of Crater Lake caldera in southwestern Oregon. During the final stages of Mt. Mazama's existence, pressures within the mountain caused large, radial cracks to form within it. In some instances those cracks were forced open and filled with hot, molten rock that later cooled and crystallized into huge vertical slabs of resistant rock, forming what geologists call radial dikes. Devil's Backbone is one of those dikes, standing tall and strong on the western shore of Crater Lake as the softer pumice and lava flows that once enclosed it weather away. The left hand image was taken in the late morning from the rim of the crater, leaving the side of the 'Backbone' facing the camera in the shade. The right hand image (a composite of 2 photos) was taken from the lake later in the afternoon. Note that the triangular slab in the foreground of this image stands 130 m tall (427 ft), dwarfing the pine trees that grow on and around it.<br><br>Mt.

This popular New England mountain is climbed (not all reach the summit) by nearly 100,000 people per year -- more than any other mountain in the U.S. The photo shows that steep slopes aren't necessary for mountainsides to crumble. Exposure to winter temperatures suffices -- freeze-thaw cycles. You can also see that the gaps between the granite blocks are too wide to be explained by mere cracking. The detached blocks have moved downhill, even though the slope is too slight for them to slide freely. Frost wedging may have contributed to widening the gaps initially, but they're now many centimeters wide. The blocks must have been displaced by frost creep. Water seeps under the blocks during freezing episodes, and they're "lifted" as the water expands when it freezes into ice. This allows the blocks to shift slightly downhill each winter.<br><br>Provided and copyright by:<br>David Albeck,</div>

It was mined for its copper and goes down approximately 1 mile (1.6 km). When the mine was being excavated, timbers were needed for support, and many trees in the vicinity of the mine were cut down. This caused a chain reaction that nearly destroyed the surrounding landscape. Additionally, over the years, excavated dirt and ore residue washed into streams, fouling wetlands and destroying aquatic habitats. Though an effort has been made to clean up the watersheds near the mine, 300 acres of denuded land has been set aside as a memorial to the ecological devastation. Though the mine is no longer active, garnet and pyrite can be collected.<br><br>Provided by:<br>James Douglas,</div>

Sun pillars are created by sunlight reflecting off the bottom faces of hexagonal plate-shaped ice crystals -- pencil shaped crystals can also produce pillars. The heigth above the Sun a pillar extends is equal to about twice the average tip angle of the crystals.<br><br>Provided and copyright by:<br>Lucy Orloski,<br></div>

It looks like it was just put together by Cupid -- with bits of white fleece left over. Though this fair weather beauty is tilted on its side here, I'm guessing a lusty gust of wind was waiting to right it. Monida Pass is at an elevation of 6,824 ft (2,080 m) and is located on highway I-15 in the Centennial Mountains -- just west of Yellowstone National Park.<br><br>Provided and copyright by:<br>Judy A Mosby,<br></div>

The stunning oranges and golds shown here handsomely frame the more timid blues. A combination of the long path length of sunlight near the horizon and well placed altostratus clouds resulted in these rich colors. Most, but not all, of the shorter wavelengths (violets and blues) have been scattered out of the observer's line of sight.<br><br>Provided by:<br>Hernando Cardenas, F.T.S / PASL<br></div>

Seven individual images were "stitched together" to make this panorama, which includes Half Dome (left center) and the high Sierras (background). In essence, Yosemite is a glacially sculpted, granitic batholith -- the glaciers have long since retreated. A batholith is a very large mass of exposed igneous rock (greater than 100 square kilometers or 40 square miles) that forms when magma solidifies at depth.<br><br>Referred by:<br>Phil Dombrowski,</div>
