For example, if our organs failed, we can create a clone of us and transplant it to our body. No need to worry about rejection from the body.<br><br>However, what do we do with our clones? Do we just clone them to get the organs that failed us? Religious people don't agree with it, so do the non-religious people.<br><br>Besides, too many people on Earth is not good. It will deplete our natural resources even faster. That's why we don't we want it.<br><br>The third reason is that despite having the same DNA as ourselves, the clones have their own thinking. Your parents can't teach them the same way they taught you. Even if they do, they still have different thinking from you. Would you like your own clone to be a cannibal? Your clone feels that it is right, but you feel that it is wrong. How about the police coming to your house to arrest you for a crime that your clone did? Same DNA will result in same thumbprint.<br><br>Cloning also has side effects. Dolly the sheep died younger than original sheep. As cloning produces the same species with the same weaknesses, if a disease strikes, it will wipe out the whole species and that species will become another dinosaur. That's the reason why nature blessed us with evolution. With evolution, it will prevent the total wiping out of any species unless some disaster strikes (asteriod hits the Earth or another Ice Age)</div>

Not quite sure what the stem cells could help us with, but it can help us to avoid cloning as far as possible, unless we really need it.<br><br>Anyway, there are a lot of ethical issues with cloning, and the recent South Korean scientist case is making us think real hard on this issue.</div>
