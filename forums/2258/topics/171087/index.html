            <div class='col-md body'>The human body was never meant to consume<br>rice! You see, our genes have<br>hardly changed in more than 30,000 years.<br>However, our food choices and<br>lifestyle have changed dramatically. The caveman<br>would hardly recognize our<br>food or way of life.<br><br>Caveman food was never cooked as fire was not<br>yet tamed. Thus, he ate only<br>those foods that you can eat without treatment<br>with or by fire. He ate<br>fruits, vegetables, fish (sushi anyone?), eggs, nuts<br>and meat. Yes, even<br>meat. You can even eat meat raw if you were<br>starving in the forest. You<br>have the necessary enzymes to digest meat.<br><br>However, rice, like wheat and corn, cannot be<br>eaten raw. It must be cooked.<br>Even if you were starving in the desert, you cannot<br>eat rice in the raw<br>form. This is because we do not have the system<br>of enzymes to break rice<br>down. You were never meant to eat rice. To make<br>matters worse, you not only<br>eat rice, but also make it the bulk of your food.<br><br>In some parts of Asia, rice forms up to 85% of the<br>plate. Even if you take<br>rice, keep it to a minimum. Remember, it is only<br>for your tongue - not your<br>body. Actually, rice and other grains like wheat<br>and corn are actually<br>worse than sugar. There are many reasons:<br><br>Rice becomes sugar - lots of it<br><br>This is a fact that no nutritionist can deny: rice is<br>chemically no<br>different from sugar. One bowl of cooked rice is the<br>caloric equal of 10<br>teaspoons of sugar. This does not matter whether<br>it is white, brown or<br>herbal rice. Brown rice is richer in fibre, some B<br>vitamins and minerals<br>but it is still the caloric equal of 10 teaspoons of<br>sugar. To get the same<br>10 teaspoons of sugar, you need to consume lots<br>of kangkong - 10 bowls of<br>it.<br><br>Rice is digested to become sugar.<br><br>Rice cannot be digested before it is thoroughly<br>cooked. However, when<br>thoroughly cooked, it becomes sugar and spikes<br>circulating blood sugar<br>within half an hour - almost as quickly as it would if<br>you took a sugar<br>candy. Rice is very low in the "rainbow of anti-<br>oxidants"<br><br>This complete anti-oxidant rainbow is necessary<br>for the effective and safe<br>utilisation of sugar. Fruits come with a sugar called<br>fructose. However,<br>they are not empty calories as the fruit is packed<br>with a whole host of<br>other nutrients that help its proper assimilation and<br>digestion.<br><br>Rice has no fibre. The fibre of the kangkong fills<br>you up long before your<br><br>blood sugar spikes. This is because the fibre bulks<br>and fills up your<br>stomach. Since white rice has no fibre, you end up<br>eating lots of "calorie<br>dense" food before you get filled up. Brown rice<br>has more fibre but still<br>the same amount of sugar.<br><br>Rice is tasteless - Sugar is sweet. There is only<br>so much that you can eat<br>at one sitting. How many teaspoons of sugar can<br>you eat before you feel<br>like throwing up? Could you imagine eating 10<br>teaspoons of sugar in one<br>seating?<br><br>Rice is always the main part of the meal - While<br>sugar may fill your<br>dessert or sweeten your coffee, it will never be the<br>main part of any meal.<br>You could eat maybe two to three teaspoons of<br>sugar at one meal. However,<br>you could easily eat the equal value of two to three<br>bowls (20 - 30<br>teaspoons) of sugar in one meal. I am always<br>amused when I see someone eat<br>sometimes five bowls of rice (equals 50 teaspoons<br>of sugar) and then asks<br>for tea tarik kurang manis!<br><br>There is no real "built in" mechanism for us to<br>prevent overeating of rice<br><br>How much kangkong can you eat? How much fried<br>chicken can you eat? How much<br>steamed fish can you eat? Think about that! In one<br>seating, you cannot take<br>lots of chicken, fish or cucumber, but you can take<br>lots of rice. Eating<br>rice causes you to eat more salt.<br><br>As rice is tasteless, you tend to consume more<br>salt - another villain when<br>it comes to high blood pressure. You tend to take<br>more curry that has salt<br>to help flavor rice. We also tend to consume more<br>ketchup and soy sauce<br>which are also rich in salt.<br><br>Eating rice causes you to drink less water. The<br>more rice you eat, the less<br>water you will drink as there is no mechanism to<br>prevent the overeating of<br>rice. Rice, wheat and corn come hidden in our<br>daily food. As rice is<br>tasteless, it tends to end up in other foods that<br>substitute rice like rice<br>flour, noodles and bread. We tend to eat the<br>hidden forms which still get<br>digested into sugar. Rice, even when cooked, is<br>difficult to digest<br><br>Can't eat raw rice? Try eating rice half cooked.<br>Contrary to popular<br>belief, rice is very difficult to digest. It is "heavy<br>stuff". If you have<br>problems with digestion, try skipping rice for a few<br>days. You will be<br>amazed at how the problem will just go away.<br><br>Rice prevents the absorption of several vitamins<br>and minerals. Rice when<br>taken in bulk will reduce the absorption of vital<br>nutrients like zinc, iron<br>and the B vitamins.<br><br>Are you a rice addict? Going rice-less may not be<br>easy but you can go<br>rice-less. Eating less rice could be lot easier than<br>you think. Here are<br>some strategies that you can pursue in your quest<br>to eat less rice:<br><br>Eat less rice - Cut your rice by half. Barry Sears,<br>author of the Zone<br>Diet, advises "eating rice like spice".<br><br>Instead, increase your fruits and vegetables.<br><br>Take more lean meats and fish.<br><br>You can even take more eggs and nuts.<br><br>Have "riceless" meals. Take no rice or wheat at<br>say, breakfast. Go for eggs<br>instead.<br><br>Go on "riceless" days - Go "western" once a week.<br><br>Take no rice and breads for one day every week.<br>That can't be too<br>difficult. Appreciate the richness of your food. Go<br>for taste, colors and<br>smells. Make eating a culinary delight. Enjoy your<br>food in the original<br>flavors.<br><br>Avoid the salt shaker or ketchup. You will<br>automatically eat less rice.<br><br>Eat your fruit dessert before (Yes! No printing error)<br>your meals.<br><br>The fibre rich fruits will "bulk up" in your stomach.<br>Thus, you will eat<br>less rice and more fruits.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting concept....... well, this is not say totally wrong..... this is just another school of thought regarding nutrition. thus there isn't any real wrong or right about the info. This is just like the methods of dieting that are available, there is a few but there isn't really a concept that is totally wrong or right..... as there are people who each lost weight using the various methods. thus i conclude unless  further info are available.... we can really say it is not true or true but this is a concept we can explore further.</div>
