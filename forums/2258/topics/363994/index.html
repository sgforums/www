              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">Wednesday, June 10, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>As Darwin observed, natural selection 
              leading to adaptation of individuals and populations is occurring gradually and 
              all the time. But over very long spans of time, the major channels of genetic 
              organization, organism form, and the different ways organisms develop arose as 
              outcomes of history-dependent variation that is now channeled, or constrained, 
              within different groups of organisms. For example, most cats look like cats, 
              develop like cats, but have a fossil record that begins from less than cat-like 
              ancestors. So do snails, and crabs, and so on. But what if the broad 
              evolutionary diversification of one of these groups were repeated by a few 
              species in a single genus tens of millions of years after that initial 
              diversification? What would that say about the roles of contingency, constraint, 
              and adaptation? In other words, how big is the role of chance in the history of 
              life? <br><br>An international team of researchers including Field Museum 
              curator Scott Lidgard, PhD, has discovered a group of closely related living 
              species that independently repeated the different step-like changes that 
              occurred in the major diversification of their kind during the Cretaceous 
              Period, roughly 100 to 90 million years ago. But this group of species arose 80 
              million years later! <br><br>The findings of Dr. Lidgard and his collaborators 
              will be published online this week by the British journal, Proceedings of the 
              Royal Society B. Dr. Lidgard's research focuses on cheilostome bryozoans, marine 
              animal colonies whose bodies are made up of many genetically identical box-like 
              individuals (zooids). In the simplest, most primitive cheilostomes, the soft 
              feeding organ is squeezed out of the box by muscles pulling on a flexible 
              membrane. The next step in diversification was calcified spines around the 
              membrane, then fusion of the spines, then reduction of the fused spinal shield 
              and membrane and invention of a water sac inside the box to provide enough 
              volume to squeeze out the feeding organ. Lineages showing each of these stages 
              are alive today. Then as now, these steps are seen as evolved defenses against 
              small predators and parasites on the colony surface. <br><br>What is remarkable 
              is that the molecular genealogy of the living species shows their origin only 15 
              million years ago, with the same trajectory as in the distant past! Evidence 
              suggests that trajectory has occurred again and again in other groups. The 
              authors argue that the original trajectory was highly contingent on a set of 
              initial conditions, but that given the possibilities afforded by time, a genetic 
              background would arise (like flipping a coin long enough to achieve 10 heads or 
              tails in a row) that was visible to natural selection, most likely driven by 
              predation. Acting together, the eventual realization of a particular genetic and 
              developmental channel, and natural selection opened the way for an adaptive 
              solution. <br><br>### <br><br>Field Museum</span></p>
