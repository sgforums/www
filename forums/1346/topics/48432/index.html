            <div class='col-md body'>Scenario 1<br>Dennis &amp; Sufen were at a department store. She saw a teddy bear<br>&gt;&gt;  &amp; exclaimed,<br>&gt;&gt; "Oh! This is really cute!" He offered to get it for her,<br>&gt; &gt; but she hesitated &amp; replied, "No....it's okay..." He shrugged<br>&gt; &gt; his shoulders &amp; moved on to look at something else. Meanwhile Sufen stood<br>&gt; &gt; rooted to the spot, feeling very miffed.<br>&gt; &gt; His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; I offered to get the bear for u but u said u din wan it.<br>&gt; &gt; What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; Of cos I wanted the bear, u IDIOT!! I din give u a firm "no",<br>&gt; &gt; did I??<br>&gt; &gt; U would insist on getting it for me if u were sincere abt the<br>&gt; &gt; offer!<br><br>Scenario 2<br>&gt; &gt; Cheryl &amp; Kenming were at a jigsaw puzzle store, &amp; his was abt<br>&gt; &gt; to pay for a brand new 2,500 piece set for himself. Suddenly, Cheryl<br>&gt; &gt; held out another box &amp; asked, " Do u think I should get thus<br>&gt; &gt; puzzle?<br>&gt; &gt; It's so nice, but it's expensive...." "Well, u can always wait for the<br>&gt; &gt; next sale, he replied. She refused to talk to him for the rest of the<br>&gt; &gt; evening<br>&gt; &gt; &amp; the next 2 days. She continued to ignore him regardless of how many<br>&gt;times<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; he apologized. " So, what do u want me to do?" he asked in<br>&gt; &gt; desperation. "I can't tell u what to do, can I?" she answered.<br>&gt; &gt; His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; I thought u were seeking advice on whether to get that jigsaw<br>&gt; &gt; puzzle, so I gave u my suggestion. U were really angry &amp; I din know<br>&gt; &gt; how to make up for it. So I chose to apologize anyway, but u<br>&gt; &gt; continued to be angry regardless of the no. of times I said I was sorry.<br>&gt; &gt; What<br>&gt; &gt; more am I supposed to do if "sorry" isn't enough?<br>&gt; &gt; What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; I was hinting that I wanted this jigsaw set, &amp; I was hoping<br>&gt; &gt; you'd get it for me. I'm fed up b'cos u're so 'blur' u can't take a hint.<br>&gt; &gt; If<br>&gt; &gt; u're genuinely sorry, u would make up for ur mistake by going back to that<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; store &amp; getting that puzzle for me.<br><br>Scenario 3<br>&gt; &gt; Terence &amp; Mealanie were out on a date. Slightly b4 dinner time,<br>&gt; &gt; she casually<br>&gt; &gt; mentioned something abt a nice little French restaurant<br>&gt; &gt; nearby.....When dinner time came around, he asked her what she would like<br>&gt; &gt; to<br>&gt; &gt; have for dinner. "Anything" she replied. They ended up in a foodcourt &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; she did nothing but to sulk over a bowl of beef noodles.<br>&gt; &gt; His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; I asked u what u wanted &amp; u said "anything". I thought u really<br>&gt; &gt; din have any preference, &amp; were leaving the decision up to me. So I<br>&gt; &gt; suggested the foodcourt &amp; u din object.<br>&gt; &gt; What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; I really want to have dinner at that French restaurant. That's<br>&gt; &gt; why I'm telling u how good it's supposed to be. I just din want to say<br>&gt; &gt; it directly b'cos it's quite an expensive restaurant.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; ***************************************<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Scenario 4<br>&gt; &gt; It was 2am. Faizai &amp; Rina had a good time at a disco &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; decided to call it a night. As they were hailing for cabs, Rina said,<br>&gt;"It's<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; quite late now, I wonder if it's safe....." "Of cos it is" he assured her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; They<br>&gt; &gt; took separate cabs home, &amp; she turned him down the next time he<br>&gt; &gt; asked her out on a date.<br>&gt; &gt; His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; I thought u were just asking for my opinion as to whether it<br>&gt; &gt; was safe to go home at that hour! I wouldn't have minded sending u back if<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I'd known u'd wanted me to, but u seemed so self-assured &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; independent.<br>&gt; &gt; What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; I think u should be sending me home at this hour. If u had been<br>&gt; &gt; a gentlemen, I wouldn't even have needed to drop that hint!<br><br>Scenario 5<br>&gt; &gt; SuWei &amp; Vishnu were planning to get their close friend a<br>&gt; &gt; birthday gift, but couldn't agree on what to get. She spent hours trying<br>&gt;to<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; convince him that her idea of a haversack was better than his suggestion<br>&gt;of<br>&gt; &gt; an<br>&gt; &gt; arcade game voucher. Finally, she said in frustration,"Why izzit always so<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; difficult for u to understand what I'm trying to say?"<br>&gt; &gt; His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; Why do u keep insisting that I dun understand what u've said. I<br>&gt; &gt; understand perfectly. It's just that I don't agree.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; Why can't u just agree with me?<br><br>Scenario 6<br>&gt; &gt; Carl asked Fiona if it would be alright with her if he stayed<br>&gt; &gt; at home this coming Saturday to catch a soccer match, &amp; she said,"Sure,<br>&gt; &gt; go ahead." She was unhappy when he actually did so.<br>&gt; &gt; His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; U said "ok", so I thought everything was okay<br>&gt; &gt; What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; Obviously, I din want u to stay at home &amp; watch some stupid<br>&gt; &gt; soccer match!<br>&gt; &gt; I was just trying to be magnanimous! U should be smart<br>&gt; &gt; enough to know that, &amp; then ditch ur game to catch a movie with<br>&gt; &gt; me.<br><br>Scenario 7<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Nizan had forgotten abt Yati's birthday until the very next day.<br>&gt; &gt; When he called her to apologise, she said "It's alright.." He hung up<br>&gt; &gt; the phone shortly after &amp; continued to watch TV. She called him<br>&gt; &gt; back shortly &amp; started to cry<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; I thought u'd already forgiven me for forgetting ur birthday,<br>&gt; &gt; since u said it was alright...<br>&gt; &gt; What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; It's so not aright! How could it be aright when u forgot abt my<br>&gt; &gt; birthday &amp; din even bother to make up for it! I'm so upset that I can't<br>&gt; &gt; even bring myself to explain. But u should know!<br><br>Scenario 8<br>&gt; &gt; Mary asked,"Am I fat?" Mike replied that she was just slightly<br>&gt; &gt; plump, &amp; she got upset.<br>&gt; &gt; His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; I thought u were asking for my opinion abt ur body size, &amp; I<br>&gt; &gt; was just trying to be honest.....Am I supposed to lie?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; I want u to tell me that I'm the most beautiful gal in the<br>&gt; &gt; world, &amp; I expect u to insist that u're being totally honest!<br><br>Scenario 9<br>&gt; &gt; He noticed that she was unhappy abt something, but din know<br>&gt; &gt; what it was.<br>&gt; &gt; He asked her what was wrong &amp; she said. " Nothing." He continued<br>&gt; &gt; to do whatever he was doing, &amp; suddenly he realised that she was<br>&gt; &gt; fuming mad.<br>&gt; &gt; Again, he asked her why she was upset. But once again, she<br>&gt; &gt; insisted that everything was fine.<br>&gt; &gt; His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; Since u said nothing was wrong, I had to take it that<br>&gt; &gt; everything was fine.<br>&gt; &gt; How am I supposed to know what's wrong when u keep insisting<br>&gt; &gt; that everything was fine?<br>&gt; &gt; What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; Of cos something is wrong! Of cos I'm upset! And dun tell me u<br>&gt; &gt; dun know what's wrong! Gosh, I can't believe u're such a hopelessly<br>&gt; &gt; insensitive creature - u greeted everyone else so warmly when u arrived,<br>&gt; &gt; but din come say hello to me!</div>
