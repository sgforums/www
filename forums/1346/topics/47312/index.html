            <div class='col-md body'>The Great White Monkey<br>There was once a British traveller who heard about a great white<br>monkey which could be found in a small village in Thailand. Since<br>it is an extraordinary if one could find a white monkey, he<br>decided to see it all by himself.<br>From his hotel, he took a taxi to go to the village.<br><br>When he was in the taxi, he asked the taxi driver whether he has<br>ever heard about the great white monkey. The taxi driver just<br>remain silent.<br><br>However, he just warned the traveller by saying "Do not touch the<br>great white monkey".<br><br>When he finally reached the village, he asked a villager, a lady,<br>about the way to the great white monkey. The villager just direct<br>him the way and also warned him "Do not touch the great white<br>monkey".<br><br>The traveller walked towards the direction given to him when he<br>finally bumped into a small boy and asked whether he has ever<br>heard about the great white monkey. The boy pointed to an old<br>small hut and he said "Do not touch the great white monkey".<br><br>When he finally reached the hut, he saw an old man sitting at the<br>door of the old hut. The traveller asked him about the great white<br>monkey.<br><br>The old man led him to the back of his hut and there he saw the<br>huge white monkey, sleeping in a cage. Before the old man go, he<br>warned him "Do not touch the great white monkey".<br><br>By now the traveller was getting very curious and annoyed by all<br>the same warning that he got. When he got closer to the great<br>white monkey, he could see its long and sharp nails placing on its<br>legs. The traveller felt a great urge to touch the great white<br>monkey.<br><br>Without thinking of the consequences, he touch the leg of the<br>great white monkey.<br><br>By doing that, he had woke up the great white monkey. The great<br>white monkey opened its big red eyes and tried to reached for the<br>traveller.<br><br>Seeing that, the traveller ran as fast as he could. He ran passed<br>the old man, the small boy and the lady. However, the great white<br>monkey is still angrily chasing just right behind him and they did<br>nothing about it. Instead, they just looked stunned as they<br>watched him running and screaming for help.<br><br>The traveller got onto the same taxi which sped up back to his<br>hotel. When he looked back, the great white monkey was still<br>chasing just a distance away from him.<br><br>When he reached the hotel, he rushed into the hotel and in the<br>lift. He was panting and was telling himself "Wow, that was<br>close". When he reached the 15th floor, he walked slowly to his<br>room, thinking the great white monkey had lost him.<br><br>To his surprise, he saw the great white monkey rushed out from the<br>staircase exit and chased after him. The traveller sprint to his<br>room and took out his roomcard to slide at the door. When he<br>turned, he was too late. The great white monkey raised its huge<br>hairy hand..........<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;tapped him on the shoulder............. and it said "Touch you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;back."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
