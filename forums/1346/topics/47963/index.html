            <div class='col-md body'>This story always make me cry...no matter how many times I have read it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>From the very Beginning, Gal's family objected strongly on her dating this guy. Saying that it has got to do with family background, &amp; that the gal will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him. Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrelled very often. Though the gal love the guy deeply, but she always ask him: "How deep is your love for me?" As the guy is not good with his words, this often cause the gal to be very upset. With that &amp; the family's pressure, the gal often vent her anger on him. As for him, he only endured it in silence.<br><br>After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated &amp; decided to further his studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the gal: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?" The gal agreed, &amp; with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in &amp; agreed to let them get married. So before he leave, they got engaged. The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love through emails &amp; phone calls. Though it's hard, but both never thought of giving up.<br><br>One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realised that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. she has lost her voice.. The doctors says that the impact that had on her brain has caused her to loss her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down.<br><br>During the stay in hospital, besides silence cry.. it's still just silence cry that accompanied her. Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone, which pierced into her heart every time it rang. She does not wish to let the guy know. &amp; not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer. With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent millions &amp; millions of reply, countless of phone calls.. all the gal could do, besides crying, is still crying.... The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything &amp; be happy.<br><br>With a new environment, the gal learn sign language &amp; started a new life. Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her friend came &amp; told her that he's back. She asked her friend not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore news of him.<br><br>A year has passed &amp; her friend came with an envelope, containing a invitation card for the guy's wedding. The gal was shattered. When she open the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her friend what's going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her. He used sign language telling her "I've spent a year's time to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. "Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped the ring back into her finger. The gal finally smiled.<br><br>"Love is the greatest thing in the World".<br><br></div>
