            <div class='col-md body'>1. Be realistic about each other.<br>Don't try to turn your partner into something he or she is not. Let's face it,<br>guys-there's only 1 Pamela Anderson in the world, and even she has had her<br>implants removed! Give your gal a break and understand that her physical<br>appearance is NOT going to change overnight with the help of a few facials<br><br>or treatments. And ladies, Brad Pitt has already been taken, so you are gonna<br><br>have to do with what your guy is like! Chill out, love each other for what you<br><br>are. There is more to your partner than what meets the eye.<br><br>2. Always talk things out.<br>Now guys, I know this is not ur fave pastime or mode of resolving issues, but u<br>know what? This works with the gals. Don't make assumptions about each other's<br>feelings. Learn to xpress urself better so that ur partner undrstands what u're<br>angry about, or hurt about, or even happy about! When u stop talking to each<br>other from the heart, it's the beginning of the end.<br><br>3. Do stuff together.<br>Make an effort to do things together. Do some sports or involve urselves in some<br>shared activities; something both of u enjoy or are interested in. It could be<br>as simple as watching movies together, or jus strolling hand-in-hand down<br>Orchard Road. Watch soccor with him once in a while though the green patch on TV<br>puts u to sleep in 3 seconds. And guys, do give in if ur gal asks for another<br>day at window-shopping, rather than suggest that she go out with her girlfriends<br>for "that sort of activities" instead. If u're spending more time with ur<br>friends rather than with ur partner, it's a warning sign that u're drifting<br>apart!!!<br><br>4. Meet each other halfway.<br>If he agrees to throw out that rotten T-shirt with the "The_Rock" print, u<br>shouldn't kick up much of a fuss if he asks u to keep ur room tidy. There's<br>gotta be a little giving and taking in a relationship, so learn to meet each<br>other halfway.<br><br>5.Show ur love<br>Buy her flowers or candy or perfume everynow and then, even if u have been<br>together for 5years. It's wonderful to continue showing someone that u care for<br>him or her. Cook him a special meal, paint him a Valentine's Day card. Knit him<br>mini-socks he can't wear ( like for decoration purposes =&gt; ), buy him a packet<br>of milk for breakfast, or pack his wardrobe for him...so he knows you can still<br>be romantic and loving despite having been together for quite a while.<br><br>6. Respect each other.<br>Stop making jokes about her hair or skin, or whatever it is u love to laugh at.<br>Ask urself if she thinks if its funny. And if he has an inferiority complex<br>about his height, stop ogling at tall guys and make him feel worse! Love is<br>about respecting each other's feelings and being sensitive to each other at all<br>times.<br><br>7. Bury the past.<br>Stop bringing up the past. Gals..don't bring up the happy things about you and<br>your ex to your guy, it would jus make him jealous or unhappy. And guys, don't<br>talk about the happy times that you had with ur ex or mention about her in ur<br>every other sentence as it would make your gal feel unhappy and she might think<br>that you saying all this because you are gonna get back with your ex or not interested<br>in her anymore.<br><br>8. Sit on ur jealousy.<br>All of us go through spells of insecurity at the beginning of the relationship,<br>but don't translate that insecurity into jealousy. If you are gonna go through<br>your partner's mail and cupboard, and eavesdropping on conversations, you<br>know something is wrong - with you!!! Jealousy is like a poison that slowly<br>spreads through the relationship before finally killing it. Trust your partner;<br>love has to have trust in it.<br><br>9. Keep ur commitments to each other.<br>If ur partner is standing you up all the time and cancelling dates and breaking<br>promises, you need to talk! If you're in a relationship, make your partner your<br>priority and don't disappoint them if you can help it. It's really terrible when<br>someone promises to take u to dinner, and then calls to cancel it. Don't make<br>promises you can't keep. If your partner starts to feel that he/she is not important<br>enough to you, you may jus lose him/her.<br><br>10. Be honest.<br>Honesty is not scowling at how awful she looks first thing in the morning, or<br>telling him that he has the biceps of a fly~~! When we say "be honest", we mean<br>expressing your feelings clearly, not being bitingly cruel. When you are hurt, say<br>so, and when you are angry, tell him/her, without getting hysterical. If you can't<br>be honest with ur partner, who can u be honest with? ?Love is also about<br>honesty, and a relationship where no honesty exists probably isn't worth it!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
