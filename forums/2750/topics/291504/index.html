He is a real monster and thus feared by both monsters and humans alike.  He wields two blades, one silver - to kill monsters, and one steel - to kill humans.<br><br>Betrayed and killed by the very humans that he protected during the great war of the monsters, nobody knows why he is alive today.  Not even himself.  Walk the path of evil and take revenge on the humans or continue to protect the undeserving humans?  The choice is yours.<br><br>Gameplay:<br>A very interesting rpg where there seems to be no clear right or wrong choice.  Every choice you make will have an impact somewhere in the distant future which you might not be able to see clearly in the present.<br><br>An example will be, a human that the witchers have captured in their castle.  The human is begging for his life quite pitifully.  Do we set him free knowing that he will report the location of the castle, interrogate him with torture to find out why he is here, use a truth serum which might have a chance to kill the prisoner instead of working, or kill him swiftly?<br><br>The results can only be known much later in the game.  Choices made in the game will have realistic consequences.  If we had tried to be merciful and set the prisoner free, many of our friends will die as the enemy as discovered the location of our castle.  If we had killed the prisoner swiftly without pain, we wouldn't know where the enemy hideout is and our friend who was captured later will be killed as we can't rescue him.  If we used the truth serum, sometimes it might be a good result and we learn the enemies hideout sometimes it is bad and the prisoner dies.  If we interrogate him, it will turn out to be the best choice in the end.<br><br>Imho you have to constantly think about what impact your current decision is going to have in the future which makes the game fun.  You can't keep saving and loading either as the consequences are only known many hours of gameplay later.<br><br>Another thing that is very interesting is that stats like str, dex, int are not just numbers that you increase on leveling up.  Add more str and your hero appears more muscular, his armor looks heavier and more ornate.  Add more agi and the hero begins to block arrows with his sword in fights, does more stylish moves in combat etc...  More int, and his spells become flashier and more powerful.<br><br>System requirements:<br>Pentium 2.4Ghz<br>1Gb ram<br>Good video card<br><br>or wait for console version  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a></div>
