              <p>That's an excellent observation you just made!</p>
              <p>It all boils down to a question of worldview, which everyone has, a set of belief system with which we view the world and make sense of things. Do you now finally get the whole point I have been trying to make all this while?</p>
              <p>The atheist's worldview is closely tied to naturalism. This worldview colors everything he sees. No supernatural explanation or causation is allowed into his way of explaining any phenomenon he encounters. It can and must only be explained by or away in naturalistic ways. If there's no naturalistic explanation now, one will come up later eventually, by faith it will come. Even if it is ridiculous the naturalistic explanation must be maintained.</p>
              <p>The theist's worldview is not restricted to our five senses. Effects can have both natural or supernatural causes. Theism recognises that natural causes are incapable of doing certain things, and that certain effects are best explained by intelligence, even a supernatural one.</p>
              <p>It all boils down to which worldview is the best worldview to view the world with. And when you do take the time to seriously and critically compare the ability of the two worldviews of atheism and theism to explain and account for the questions of utmost significance you will realise that theism wins handsdown.</p>

              <p>Words may fail to fully define or describe the infinite God, but they are adequate so long as we remember that however we try to speak of God it will always fall short because we are talking about the infinite God. The Bible teaches that the invisible things of God are seen in the visible things that are made. The created order points and speaks about God and can tell us some things about God.</p>

              Yes, that is true. However, without the holy scriptures of the world that existed throughout the ages, we humans could never envisage the portion of GOD and His Attributes. Now, let say we could define HIM in one word or in one holy scriptures, that means GOD is finite and HE is like most living things.....Life and Death I mean. Now, without the holy scriptures of the world there could never be a Religion for Mankind to follow the good attributes of GOOD GOD. I can understand people would like to see HIM, meet HIM and talk to HIM but there is no way you could see, meet and speak to HIM accept in prayers. Like a way of messaging HIM via a medium of a human beings or through your own medium that is your mind itself. How many holy scriptures in the world are there? Many but none of them could complete the knowledge of HIM in one holy scripture. HE is infinite and therefore eventhough we have millions and millions, billions and billions, trillions and trillions of holy scriptures....the list goes on.......we cannot concluded GOD and HIS Attributes within those myriad of holy scriptures that we have on earth now.

              <p>My belief in all powerful God who created the world in 6 days is much more logical and sensible than your belief that the universe made itself from nothing. And your adding billions of years is merely trying to make the impossible look possible but it is certainly a delusion. Chance + Time != Universe because chance is not a causal thing. It is not even a thing. So when you really think about it, it is the atheist who believes in magic and fairy tales. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>That's an excellent observation you just made!</p>
              <p>It all boils down to a question of worldview, which everyone has, a set of belief system with which we view the world and make sense of things. Do you now finally get the whole point I have been trying to make all this while?</p>
              <p>The atheist's worldview is closely tied to naturalism. This worldview colors everything he sees. No supernatural explanation or causation is allowed into his way of explaining any phenomenon he encounters. It can and must only be explained by or away in naturalistic ways. If there's no naturalistic explanation now, one will come up later eventually, by faith it will come. Even if it is ridiculous the naturalistic explanation must be maintained.</p>
              <p>The theist's worldview is not restricted to our five senses. Effects can have both natural or supernatural causes. Theism recognises that natural causes are incapable of doing certain things, and that certain effects are best explained by intelligence, even a supernatural one.</p>
              <p>It all boils down to which worldview is the best worldview to view the world with. And when you do take the time to seriously and critically compare the ability of the two worldviews of atheism and theism to explain and account for the questions of utmost significance you will realise that theism wins handsdown.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, that is true. However, without the holy scriptures of the world that existed throughout the ages, we humans could never envisage the portion of GOD and His Attributes. Now, let say we could define HIM in one word or in one holy scriptures, that means GOD is finite and HE is like most living things.....Life and Death I mean. Now, without the holy scriptures of the world there could never be a Religion for Mankind to follow the good attributes of GOOD GOD. I can understand people would like to see HIM, meet HIM and talk to HIM but there is no way you could see, meet and speak to HIM accept in prayers. Like a way of messaging HIM via a medium of a human beings or through your own medium that is your mind itself. How many holy scriptures in the world are there? Many but none of them could complete the knowledge of HIM in one holy scripture. HE is infinite and therefore eventhough we have millions and millions, billions and billions, trillions and trillions of holy scriptures....the list goes on.......we cannot concluded GOD and HIS Attributes within those myriad of holy scriptures that we have on earth now.</p>

              <p>We can know God TRULY without knowing God FULLY. As such the Scriptures are SUFFICIENT for us to know Him. The Scriptures tells us what we NEED to know in order to be right with Him. And when the perfect comes we will know God in a more excellent way.</p>

              <p>The best worldview is that which adequately accounts for what needs to be accounted for. You can make up a list and check it off if you are serious about it. That's what I mean by theism winning atheism handsdown. Yes, assumptions will be made, and this happens on both sides of the debates. But there are assumptions and there are assumptions. You will have to judge for yourself which assumptions are reasonable and which are not. I can only show you.</p>
              <p>You don't think naturalism is ridiculous because you probably did not give much thought to it. Tell me, how does life comes from nonlife? How can the universe makes itself? How can a rock think? But that is essentially what atheism entails, that nonliving matter over time can change into living things with self-consciousness and can engage in reflection and think about life!</p>
              <p>I can defend theism with logic and reason, and I have shown it in my postings. What has Jacky done exept to pour scorn and ridicule on my beliefs? He just takes the attack mode but never made a case for atheism. You would be hardpressed to find me a cogent argument that Jacky has made for his beliefs. All he has are question-begging slogans about God being like Superman in DC comics.</p>
