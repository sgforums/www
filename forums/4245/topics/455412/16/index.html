              I think what the Scientists have stated about the Universe has nothing to do with any religion or any religious scriptures. Science is not trying to proof to the world that God is non-existence, rather Science is trying to understand what caused the Universe to be in existence. Science is a way for mankind to be more aware about what is going on around them.

              YOU HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS CLEARLY. YOU ALREADY ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IF ASK A BELIEVER WHO BELIEVES IN THE INFINITE GOD, THAT IS A FLAWED QUESTION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ASK A BELIEVER OF SCIENCE, IT IS A VALID QUESTION. ITS A VERY LONG AND ENDLESS JOURNEY TO GET THAT ANSWER NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES AND ALONG THE WAY THEY DISCOVER NEW THINGS AS THEY SEEK FOR THE SOURCE OF CREATION, WHICH I SEE IS GOOD AND MANKIND CAN LEARN FROM IT. I SEE IT AS A LONG TUNNEL WITHOUT SEEING ANY LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL, BUT IT IS OK THE SCIENTISTS ARE HAPPY TO SEEK THE CAUSE AND EFFECT OF THE CREATION WITHOUT ANY REGRETS. ITS THEIR WAY TO KNOW ABOUT THEMSELVES.
              
              THERE IS NOTHING WRONG BEING AN ATHEIST OR A BELIEVER OF GOD AS LONG YOU HAVE A GOOD AND LOVING HEART.

              Twins - A Parable
              
              Once upon a time, twin boys were conceived.
              
              Weeks passed and the twins developed. As their awareness grew, they laughed for joy: "Isn't it great that we were conceived? Isn't it great to be alive? "
              
              Together the twins explored their worlds. When they found their mother's cord that gave them life, they sang for joy! "How great our mother's love is, that she shares her own life with us!"
              
              As weeks stretched into months, the twins noticed how much each was changing.
              
              "What does it mean?" one asked.
              
              "It means our stay in this world is drawing to an end." said the other.
              
              "But I don't want to go," said one. "I want to stay here always."
              
              "We have no choice," said the other. "But maybe there is life after birth."
              
              "But how can there be?" responded one. "We will shed our life cord and how can life be pos sible without it? Besides, we have seen evidence that others were here before us, and none of them has returned to tell us there is life after birth. No, this is the end. Maybe there is no mother after all."
              
              "But there has to be," protested the other. "How else did we get here? How do we remain alive?"
              
              "Have you ever seen our mother?" said one.
              
              "Maybe she only lives in our minds. Maybe we made her up because the idea made us feel good."
              
              So the last days in the womb were filled with deep questioning and fear.
              
              Finally, the moment of birth arrived. When the twins had passed from their world, they opened their eyes and cried for joy - for what they saw exceeded their fondest dreams.
              
              That is birth ... and that is death.

              <p>I beg to differ. Modern science was founded on a Judeo-Christian worldview which teaches that the universe is not the result of random chance, as such it exhibits order and design which makes the scientific method practical. Such was the roots of modern science. Sad to say, rationalism and empiricism has undermined that foundation and thus science has taken on a naturalistic and materialistic bias since then till today. Nevertheless, all facts and data that science has discovered are consistent with what the Bible teaches. And today there are many scientists who are firm believers who see the handiwork of God in all the science that they do.</p>
              <p>Some people think that with the rise of science that belief in God is relegated to the God of the Gaps, that in time to come the need for God will disappear. But here's my tongue-in-cheek response to that: God is BOTH the God of the Gaps and the Non-Gaps! Why do I say that? Because there are really things that cannot be explained naturalistically and there are things that even when we can explain it such only points to intelligence as being the only viable explanation. Ultimately we can sum it all up and take the universe as a whole and say that only God is the cause of the universe.</p>

              <p>I think there's a false dichotomy there. It is not as if one can be either a believer of God or a believer of science. Many Christians are believers of science and have impeccable credentials in many scientific disciplines.</p>
              <p>One can ask whether there is anything wrong with believing that the earth is flat. In one sense there is nothing wrong since you have the right to believe in whatever you like to believe. Yet clearly that belief is wrong as a matter of fact. The Bible does not say that there is nothing wrong with being an atheist. In fact, the Bible teaches that it is foolish to deny that God exists. Even the devil believes there is one God. So either God exists or He does not. If He does, then there is a reason for having a good and loving heart for such flows from God. But if there is no God then there is no good basis to have a good and loving heart or to see such as something objectively and morally good. </p>

              <p>Twins – A Parable</p>
              <p>Once upon a time, twin boys were conceived.</p>
              <p>Weeks passed and the twins developed. As their awareness grew, they laughed for joy: “Isn’t it great that we were conceived? Isn’t it great to be alive? “</p>
              <p>Together the twins explored their worlds. When they found their mother’s cord that gave them life, they sang for joy! “How great our mother’s love is, that she shares her own life with us!”</p>
              <p>As weeks stretched into months, the twins noticed how much each was changing.</p>
              <p>“What does it mean?” one asked.</p>
              <p>“It means our stay in this world is drawing to an end.” said the other.</p>
              <p>“But I don’t want to go,” said one. “I want to stay here always.”</p>
              <p>“We have no choice,” said the other. “But maybe there is life after birth.”</p>
              <p>“But how can there be?” responded one. “We will shed our life cord and how can life be pos sible without it? Besides, we have seen evidence that others were here before us, and none of them has returned to tell us there is life after birth. No, this is the end. Maybe there is no mother after all.”</p>
              <p>“But there has to be,” protested the other. “How else did we get here? How do we remain alive?”</p>
              <p>“Have you ever seen our mother?” said one.</p>
              <p>“Maybe she only lives in our minds. Maybe we made her up because the idea made us feel good.”</p>
              <p>So the last days in the womb were filled with deep questioning and fear.</p>
              <p>Finally, the moment of birth arrived. When the twins had passed from their world, they opened their eyes and cried for joy – for what they saw exceeded their fondest dreams.</p>
              <p>That is birth … and that is death.</p>

              <p>But there is no real literal death anywhere in this parable, perhaps only the "death" of wrong beliefs? But how sad to wait until one is dead to know for sure that there is life after death. The Bible teaches that it is appointed for man to die ONCE and after that to face judgement. There is no reincarnation and no second chance. We have one short life to make a decision for eternity.</p>
