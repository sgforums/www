              <p>Playing word replacement game is easy, any bloke can play this game. Question is, after changing the words can you support what is being said? For atheism, the answer is a resounding NO.</p>
              <p>You are shifting goalpost and invoking strawman here, the issue is not whether you believe IN something, but whether you believe THAT something exists. The person who knows nothing believes nothing. But the atheist claims to know that there is no God. Or if he is being less dogmatic about it he claims he does not believe there is a God. So either the atheists KNOWS or BELIEVES there is no God. Unless the atheist wants to defend a knowledge that he claims he does not have, I don't see how you can evade the need for faith.</p>
              <p>I read your link, but you did not read mine. Too bad then, it shows you just conclude without doing due diligence. Don't be lazy.</p>
              <p>You did comment on the question? When? Which post? Before or after I pointed that you didn't?</p>

              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">The first man did not make a mistake, calling sin a mistake is a mistake! </span><span style="color: #333333;">It trivialises the enormity of rebellion against a holy God.</span><span style="color: #333333;">"</span></p>
              <p>Huh? They did made a mistake for not obeying God. Rebellion? How were they resisting authority, control or convention? So they became sinners. Whats so bad about being sinners when all are sinners?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"In the natural world the consequences of one's actions is always felt by others. There are natural consequences and there are logical consequences. Our opposition and distaste that the effects of one's action should extend to others and his surroundings does not make it false. I believe the same applies to the spiritual realm. Sin affects and distorts everything. The whole creation groans until the time of restoration."</span></p>
              <p>Prove?</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">Is it inevitable that Adam and Eve would sin?"</span></p>
              <p>Learn to read! I posted "<span style="color: #333333;">Its is inevitable that the fruit would be taken,..."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">My answer is NO. We could speculate all day about what might have been but the fact is that they did sin. The forbidden tree was there as a test of obedience which only makes sense if there is free will. If there is no free will it makes no sense to issue any commands to eat or not to eat. And it has absolutely NOTHING to do with humans evolving from apes. Being naked is not wrong per se, but sin distorted nakedness, which is why women are told to dress modestly.</span></p>
              <p>Ignores the above as you premise was incorrect.</p>
              <p> "<span style="color: #333333;">So long as you are capable of making choices (regardless of whether made with or without knowledge) you are exercising free will. You should not confuse the amount of information with the ability to choose. Sometimes people have the information that smuggling drugs is wrong but they still choose to smuggle drugs. So you see, it is nothing to do with information or education at all. People act based on what they know, true, but they also can act in spite of what they know. And sometimes we also act when we have no information on hand. So I think this argues against determinism as well. And while free will can be suppressed, as in someone overriding your choice by force or other means, that does not negate the existence of free will. It may hinder your exercise of free will, but not the existence of free will. Moreover, it is meaningless to hold one responsible for actions if determinism is true. But it makes perfect sense under a free will view."</span></p>
              <p>You have not figure out the consequence part... I shall not proceed to elaborate further.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">The definition of God can be taken from the dictionary, how come you don't use it? Here's one for you </span><a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.1828-dictionary.com/d/search/word,god">http://www.1828-dictionary.com/d/search/word,god</a>"</p>
              <p>Learn to read and understand clearly! You missed reading an "and" and apparently that made a whole lot of difference in interpretations. Jesus does not have this habit.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Having problem with the dictionary lately? Dictionary.com defines mistake as</p>
              <p><em>1. an error in action, calculation, opinion, or judgment caused by poor reasoning, carelessness, insufficient knowledge, etc. </em></p>
              <p><em>2. a misunderstanding or misconception. </em></p>
              <p><em>3. to regard or identify wrongly as something or someone else: I mistook him for the mayor. </em></p>
              <p><em>4. to understand, interpret, or evaluate wrongly; misunderstand; misinterpret.</em></p>
              <p>How does the above relates to Adam's rebellion? God said not to eat but they did. If this is not rebellion then what? To call that a mistake is really to downplay sin. If children disobey their parent's instructions you call that a mistake?</p>
              <p>Prove what? That consequences of one's actions are felt by those around him? This is a matter of common sense and experience. There's no need for me to prove such evident things.</p>
              <p>Your English is bad. To take the fruit when it is forbidden to do so, that act of eating of the fruit IS sin.</p>
              <p>So convenient, did not show how my premise is incorrect just ignore the whole thing I said. And then say no need to elaborate because I did not figure something out, but also never show what I did not figure out. What a cop out.</p>
              <p>Fact is, intellectual honesty demands an admission that REDEFINING atheism as lack of belief is an evasive debate tactic to avoid the burden of proof. Another intellectual cop-out, which of course atheists will deny it with all their might. See <a href="http://carm.org/i-lack-belief-god">http://carm.org/i-lack-belief-god</a></p>

              <p>"Playing word replacement game is easy, any bloke can play this game. Question is, after changing the words can you support what is being said? For atheism, the answer is a resounding NO."</p>
              <p>How would you know when you are not an atheist? Would anyone consult a doctor for toothache when there's an available dentist? Feel free to voice your opinions that nobody asked...</p>
              <p>"You are shifting goalpost and invoking strawman here, the issue is not whether you believe IN something, but whether you believe THAT something exists. The person who knows nothing believes nothing. But the atheist claims to know that there is no God. Or if he is being less dogmatic about it he claims he does not believe there is a God. So either the atheists KNOWS or BELIEVES there is no God. Unless the atheist wants to defend a knowledge that he claims he does not have, I don't see how you can evade the need for faith."</p>
              <p>I have been very consistent. I using different ways of expressions for you to understand. Its your misinterpretations that's causing your confusion. You liked to appear smart (mis)using the various fallacies however the opposite is true...
                      <br>One who knows no god believes in no god...  One who knows god, believes according to one faith. No knowledge, no faith. No faith, no believe. What God is to you, is but an sign of delusion to atheist. What knowledge is to atheist is but a rejection of godly faith to you.   Faith is needed to believe in anything. How can one believe without knowing what is it to be believed?</p>

              <p>Yup! That's right! As for the problem of evil, one has to ask "What is the right time?" Is allowing Hitler and Stalin to exist part of a non-evil plan? The whole idea that God will do it sometime is somewhat unconvincing if one doesn't affirm belief in such a deity. The premises conflict insofar as not all 3 premises can be correct at the same time. Is God willing to prevent evil but not willing? Is God willing to prevent evil but not able? Is God both willing and able to prevent evil - then where cometh evil? (Echoing Epicrurus' question). I think the Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga captures it eloquently in the following passage.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;">"Why does God permit all this evil, and evil of these horrifying kinds, in his world? How can they be seen as fitting in with his loving and providential care for his creatures?... The Christian must concede he doesn't know. That is, he doesn't know in any detail. On a quite general level, he may know that God permits evil because he can achieve a world he sees as better by permitting evil than by preventing it; and what God sees as better is, of course, better. But we cannot see </span><em style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;">why</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;"> our world with all its ills, would be better than others we think we can imagine, or </span><em style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;">what</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;">, in any detail, is God's reason for permitting a given specific and appalling evil. Not only can we not see this, we can't think of any very good possibilities. And here I must say that most attempts to explain</span><em style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;">why</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;"> God permits evil—</span><em style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;">theodicies</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;">, as we may call them—strike me as tepid, shallow and ultimately frivolous. Does evil provide us with an opportunity for spiritual growth, so that this world can be seen as a vale of soul-making? Perhaps </span><em style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;">some</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;"> evils can be seen this way; but much leads not to growth but to apparent spiritual disaster. Is it suggested that the existence of evil provides the opportunity for such goods as the display of mercy, sympathy, self-sacrifice in the service of others? Again, no doubt some evil can be seen this way.... But much evil seems to elicit cruelty rather than sacrificial love. And neither of these suggestions, I think, takes with sufficient seriousness the sheer hideousness of some of the evils we see."</span></p>

The person who knows nothing believes nothing. But the atheist claims to know that there is no God. Or if he is being less dogmatic about it he claims he does not believe there is a God. So either the atheists KNOWS or BELIEVES there is no God. Unless the atheist wants to defend a knowledge that he claims he does not have, I don't see how you can evade the need for faith."</p>

You liked to appear smart (mis)using the various fallacies however the opposite is true...<br>One who knows no god believes in no god... One who knows god, believes according to one faith. No knowledge, no faith. No faith, no believe. What God is to you, is but an sign of delusion to atheist. What knowledge is to atheist is but a rejection of godly faith to you. Faith is needed to believe in anything. How can one believe without knowing what is it to be believed?</p>

              <p>Why must I be an atheist to know that atheism is not supported by the evidence or consistent with science? It's OK to ask me questions, don't have to deprecate yourself by calling yourself a nobody.</p>
              <p>You still failed to understand simple English. On what basis does an atheist claims to KNOW there is no God? Does he knows all there is to know in order to conclude that there is no God? The atheist KNOWS what the theist is talking about in referring to God. The atheist can only feign ignorance. He does not lack the belief that God exists, he REJECTS the belief that God exists. Please stop playing semantic games.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, you obviously did not read my link. You just saw it was a blog site and you simply dismissed it.</p>
              <p>You evaded my question again, your comment came BEFORE or AFTER I mentioned that you have not commented on the question "Does God exist"?</p>
              <p>For you it is a case of BOTH bad English and wrong understanding. Adam did not suffer from poor reasoning, carelessness or insufficient knowledge when he chose to eat of the forbidden fruit. God's Word is the authority. If rejecting God's Word is not resisting authority, what is?</p>
              <p>Prior to Adam taking the fruit and eating it, he was NOT a sinner. Again your lack of Bible knowledge shows itself. Yes, it's a LACK of knowledge which should be made up for with knowledge. But Adam did not lack any knowledge about why he should not eat from the tree. A clear command was given. A direct act of disobedience was committed. Simple as that. Don't downplay things by calling it a mistake or complicate the story.</p>
              <p>Your take on the tree of knowledge was not lost on me. It was WRONG and I pointed out why. Who cares about your private take on what it means to you? A Bible exegete is concerned with what the text means, not what the text means to him personally. You don't determine what the text means, but you discover what the text means. Haiz...I wonder if you can even tell the difference.</p>
              <p>Intellectual honesty also you want to play daft with? And don't deflect things please. You were obviously trying to save face by saying that you intentionally misinterpreted things AFTER being exposed.</p>

              <p>Yup! That's right! As for the problem of evil, one has to ask "What is the right time?" Is allowing Hitler and Stalin to exist part of a non-evil plan? The whole idea that God will do it sometime is somewhat unconvincing if one doesn't affirm belief in such a deity. The premises conflict insofar as not all 3 premises can be correct at the same time. Is God willing to prevent evil but not willing? Is God willing to prevent evil but not able? Is God both willing and able to prevent evil - then where cometh evil? (Echoing Epicrurus' question). I think the Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga captures it eloquently in the following passage.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">"Why does God permit all this evil, and evil of these horrifying kinds, in his world? How can they be seen as fitting in with his loving and providential care for his creatures?... The Christian must concede he doesn't know. That is, he doesn't know in any detail. On a quite general level, he may know that God permits evil because he can achieve a world he sees as better by permitting evil than by preventing it; and what God sees as better is, of course, better. But we cannot see </span><em style="font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">why</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;"> our world with all its ills, would be better than others we think we can imagine, or </span><em style="font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">what</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">, in any detail, is God's reason for permitting a given specific and appalling evil. Not only can we not see this, we can't think of any very good possibilities. And here I must say that most attempts to explain</span><em style="font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">why</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;"> God permits evil—</span><em style="font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">theodicies</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">, as we may call them—strike me as tepid, shallow and ultimately frivolous. Does evil provide us with an opportunity for spiritual growth, so that this world can be seen as a vale of soul-making? Perhaps </span><em style="font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">some</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;"> evils can be seen this way; but much leads not to growth but to apparent spiritual disaster. Is it suggested that the existence of evil provides the opportunity for such goods as the display of mercy, sympathy, self-sacrifice in the service of others? Again, no doubt some evil can be seen this way.... But much evil seems to elicit cruelty rather than sacrificial love. And neither of these suggestions, I think, takes with sufficient seriousness the sheer hideousness of some of the evils we see."</span></p>

              <p>The disciples also asked Jesus before He ascended to heaven, "What time you coming back to restore all things?" I am sure you know Jesus' reply to them. But you are right, any answer is unconvincing to an atheist. But then again, the atheist issue is not more Bible knowledge but the issue of God's existence.</p>
              <p>The premises themselves do not conflict necessarily, unless you supply another premise to make it so. Like I said, any perceived conflict among the premises is dissipated by the Biblical teaching that the removal of evil WILL take place in the near future.</p>
              <p>I agree with Plantinga that the Christian only knows in part. That is not a problem for Christians at all. We are not promised all the knowledge and whys of this world, but we are commanded to place our trust and hope in God who will put all things right in His time. While everyone demands total answers from God, He is not obligated to us. He has already told us what we NEED to know in the Bible. The atheist may not accept this answer but I don't see how he can fault it as wrong or illogical or irrational.</p>

              <p>I don't see a need for another premise to make it incompatible through. Yes, one may not accept an answer but that doesn't imply that the answer is wrong. I fully understand this mutual tolerance or the "I respect your beliefs; you respect mine" kind of pluralistic thinking and I agree with that. But in order to convince an unbeliever, you have to appeal to objective things, not just subjective revelations which, may be convincing to some and not others.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The Greek philosopher Epicurus (341–270 BC) stated the classic form of the problem of evil. His syllogism may be stated:</p>
              <p>1. If a perfectly good God exists, then there is no evil in the world.</p>
              <p>2. There is evil in the world.</p>
              <p>3. Therefore, a perfectly good God does not exist.</p>
              <p>The logic behind the argument, again attributed to Epicurus, runs thus: “Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to. If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent. If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked. If God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it, why is there evil in the world?”</p>
              <p>Biblically and philosophically, Epicurus’ first syllogistic point is false since a perfectly good God who allows free will can exist and thus, his syllogism fails. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Epicurus’ logic behind the argument fails because he proposes a restricted number of options—it is a false dichotomy.</span></strong> Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or He can, but does not want to. Yet, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>biblically and philosophically a third option is that God wants to abolish evil and can, yet He functions on his own timing and He has not done it yet because He has a higher purpose in allowing evil to persist for a time.</strong></span> God created a world without evil which He called "very good" at the end of creation week. It is thus not a matter of God's will or God's ability, but a matter of God's ETERNAL PURPOSE as revealed in Ephesians.</p>
              <p>I am sure you would agree that it is hard to convince someone who refuses to be convinced. So I think the test is not whether an unbeliever is convinced, but whether the argument itself is valid and sound on its own merits, and adequately supported by the evidence. An argument can be unconvincing to A but convincing to B and a lot depends on one's existing belief system. It would be unhelpful to say that B is uncritical and unthinking and gullible just as it would be to say that A is playing hard to catch or incapable to respond to a good argument.</p>
              <p>Are you referring to the Bible as a subjective revelation? I beg to differ. In addition, the Christian, while basing his thinking on the Bible, does not just restrict himself to the Bible but is free to use evidences from other fields to support his argument.</p>

                      to differ. In addition, the Christian, while basing his thinking on
                      the Bible, does not just restrict himself to the Bible but is free
                      to use evidences from other fields to support his argument.</p>

              <p>I think Epicurus' point stands because a perfectly good God cannot allow evil to exist in the world. Sure, free will can exist (which is doubtful on a philosophical perspective, but assuming there is), and it would be morally neutral. Epicurus' point is not regarding whether a perfectly good God can allow free will. Rather, the argument seeks to address if a perfectly good God can allow evil. In this scenario, the theist can offer a couple of options. First, God is not perfectly good (William Lane Craig's stand) and is also not morally accountable insofar as how he acts. Secondly, the unknown purpose defense. It goes like "I don't know why God allows evil, but it's probably for some greater good." This position, I think, has been refuted by Alvin Plantinga as we can see that certain evils exist without any conceivable good. Thirdly, the theist can offer "Well, God will come and restore all things in the future." (Your stand, as I understand it) This line of reasoning postulates certain premises which I do not think have been sufficiently verified. There is first, a presupposition that a God exists and in particular, the Christian God. There is also a claim that God will come down in the future. What reasons do we have to accept those two premises as true? I simply don't see any. The Bible is clearly a subjective revelation as you do see people who do and do not receive revelations from the Bible. If it was an objective revelation, then why is there so much dispute over the reliability of these revelations? Why then would we have people claiming that the Koran is the word of the prophet, or that the Torah is the word of God?</p>

              <p>But you have not shown why a perfectly good God cannot allow for evil to exist in the world. As for free will, the Bible teaches that it exists and that humans are endowed with free will. We can choose obedience or rebellion. If free will does not exist then it is oxymoronic to speak of choices.</p>
              <p>Part of the answer to the problem of evil, or rather an integral part of the answer, is that humans have free will. Free will makes possible the entrance of sin and evil into God's perfect world. As an argument I think it fails to establish that the existence of a good God means that evil cannot exists. Let's consider the various options you put forth.</p>
              <p>1. God is not perfectly good. I don't think this is Craig's stand but let's just set that aside for now. This answer simply does not cut because it is contrary to Scripture. As such I completely reject this answer. A deist may offer this answer but the Biblical theist cannot.</p>
              <p>2. The unknown purpose. I do not read Plantinga much so no comment on whether he did refute this. Again setting this aside, in view of Paul's teaching about God's eternal purpose I do not think this answer is valid. I would say we know in part but not in full.</p>
              <p>3. God will set all things right. This view is what the Scripture teaches. That much I can verify, and you can too, just be checking the Scriptures. But if you are talking about other independent verification I don't think this is possible at all, nor is it necessary.</p>
              <p>But let's set the context again. The Christian is free to use the Bible as his answer, and rightly so. Things that are to happen in the future cannot be proven or verified. But I don't see why this would invalidate the answer. The Christian can appeal to fulfilled Scriptures or the general reliability of Scriptures to support the case that what God says will happen will indeed happen.</p>
              <p>And while God's Word may come to certain people (e.g. Moses, David,) and not to all people, the information to written down and made known to others. It is objective revelation because it comes from God and not of one's private interpretation. In other words, no one is claiming to have made up the contents of the Bible. Instead it is a record or documentation of what happened or what has been revealed by God. And it can be tested in many areas. The fact that many people claim that their sacred writings are true only necessitate that there must be discernment exercised to show which is true indeed. It does not mean that therefore there is no God at all, or that the truth cannot be known.</p>
