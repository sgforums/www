              <p>I think the issue is about creation in the absence of time. Since the creation of time itself must be an event outside of time. No, scientists do not agree that time, space and matter were created - scientists hold to the view that time, space and matter began to exist.</p>
              <p>I understand. The same applies to the theory of gravity. However, theories can be translated into facts. There are 4 pieces of evidence in favor of the big bang. Two of which are microwave background radiation and general relativity. To say that someone believes in the big bang is no different from saying that one believes in gravity. Sure, one may say that, but it's merely semantics. Big bang did not create anything in particular (energy can neither be created nor destroyed). I think you speak of dis-order? That has to do with entrophy - the universe progresses towards chaos, not order.</p>
              <p>The age of the Earth can be dated using uranium dating (uranium has a half life of 4.47 billion years). Uranium compunds in igneous rocks can be dated backwards to achieve a fairly decent estimate of the age of the Earth. If someone can offer an alternative method of determining the age of the Earth, I'll be glad to hear it.</p>
              <p>Yes, is there a creator? I addressed some issues about "creating time" in a couple of my previous posts. Thus far, I have not heard any justification of such a premise and how this can be done.</p>

              <p>If time has a beginning, and this not an issue of contention among secular scientists (see <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html">http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html</a>), then it does not make sense to speak of anything prior to or before time. But note that while science has only RECENTLY come to this conclusion, the Bible has taught that for thousands of years! Again I see this as another evidence that supports belief in the divine inspiration of Scripture.</p>
              <p>But I think we should not translate the issue about how the cause could have brought about the effect ( the universe, including time itself) to denying the need for a cause, which is what I think you are suggesting. That anything that began to exist, and scientists are saying that they began to exist simultaneously (hence the singularity), means that there must be a cause. I am sure you are familiar with William Lane Craig's defense of the Kalam cosmological argument.</p>
              <p>There is the theory of gravity (to explain the big things) and there is the law of gravity which we all experience every moment of our lives. Gravity can be affirmed via operational science, repeated tests via the scientific method. But the big bang, if it is true, is a theory/hypothesis/model/belief about the past to explain the present. You cannot go back to test it. It depends on many unproven and untested assumptions. While there are evidence that supports the Big Bang, there are others that do not. Such evidence must of course be interpreted, and interpretation depends on one's worldview, be it naturalism or theism.

              <p>Dating methods are often appealed to as proof that the earth is immensely old, in the region of 14.7 billions years (I suspect the decimal point is put there to make it sound more correct).

              I think we should not downplay the significance of what is it the Bible is right about. The fact is that it teaches that the universe had a beginning. Science only recently caught up with the theologians. The Bible is not just right on some trivial matter but on a very foundational question. Neither am I saying that this means or prove the divine inspiration of Scripture, but it supports the belief.
              
              <p>Regarding the age of the earth, you need to understand that this cannot be proven because no one was there to observe earth's creation, be it six thousand years or six billion years. Any dating method involves untested and unproven ASSUMPTIONS about the past. But there are numerous natural processes which, if we use uniformitarian assumptions, do not allow for am earth that is billions of years old. Besides, wrong ages have been derives from rock samples for which we knew the actual age where the calculated ages were far far older. I hope you will take some time to read up on RATE.

The past is history, not science. God has told us what happened and that He spoke the created universe into existence. It is a miracle in itself, and science cannot disprove that because it does not have the methodology to.

              <p>I think we should not downplay the significance of what is it
                  the Bible is right about. The fact is that it teaches that the
                  universe had a beginning. Science only recently caught up with the
                  theologians. The Bible is not just right on some trivial matter but
                  on a very foundational question. Neither am I saying that this
                  means or prove the divine inspiration of Scripture, but it supports
                  the belief.</p>
              <p>Regarding the age of the earth, you need to understand that this
                  cannot be proven because no one was there to observe earth's
                  creation, be it six thousand years or six billion years. Any dating
                  method involves untested and unproven ASSUMPTIONS about the past.
                  But there are numerous natural processes which, if we use
                  uniformitarian assumptions, do not allow for am earth that is
                  billions of years old. Besides, wrong ages have been derives from
                  rock samples for which we knew the actual age where the calculated
                  ages were far far older. I hope you will take some time to read up
                  on RATE.</p>

              <p>Indeed, I share the sentiment that the Bible/Koran is right on the universe beginning to exist. However, I do not think that humans were created. I think that humans evolved from a common ancestor to where we are today. So it seems to me, that we have to both look at what the Bible/Koran is right and wrong about and make the necessary adjustments to our worldviews. No one was there to observe it, therefore it cannot be proven? That is so untrue. Demonstrably untrue, in fact. How do forensics officers determine the time of death to an accuracy of that of a millisecond? Newton's Laws of Cooling. The whole notion of "You weren't there to see it, therefore it cannot be proven" is not supported by any good reasons. I don't know what to say to someone who insists that knowledge of the past is not possible despite the plethora of methods to establish facts about the past to a breathtaking certainty.

No, I do not think so, no more than science can offer a dis-proof of Zeus, Quetzalcoatl, Yahweh and so forth. <span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto;">But not every rational belief has to rest on proof.

              <p>That the universe has a beginning is a fact that has been established beyond reasonable doubt. The question is, what is its cause? It cannot not have a cause, despite the difficulties in understanding how a cause can bring about the existence of time space and matter.</p>
              <p>How something can come from nothing (creation ex nihilo) is a problem for naturalism/atheism, but not theism. Another problem for atheism is how life can come from nonlife. Before one can talk about evolution from a common ancestor, one has to explain or account for the origins of life. As of now, it is a matter of FAITH on the part of atheists that abiogenesis occured. And it is also a matter of FAITH to hold the view that simple life can evolve into complex lifeforms like human beings.</p>
              <p>Creationists also believe that humans "evolved" from a common ancestor, namely Adam and Eve. We do not subscribe to the belief that simple life can evolve to complex life. The issue is INFORMATION. Where does it come from? Creationists believe that kind begat kind. Human beings will always reproduce after their kind. You don't get humans from apes nor apes from fish, regardless of how much time you put in. I think it takes greater faith and a bigger miracle to believe in the grand scheme of evolution.</p>
              <p>You have misunderstood me. I am not saying that we can know nothing about the past. I am saying that the past cannot be proven, not by the scientific method. What you have access would be legal-historical evidences. And what you have is an inference to the best explanation. Forensic science is historical science, it gathers data that exists in the PRESENT and tries to piece them together to make up a plausible story about the PAST. Assumptions are being made in such cases. You may wish to read up more about it here <a href="http://creation.com/whos-really-pushing-bad-science-rebuttal-to-lawrence-s-lerner">http://creation.com/whos-really-pushing-bad-science-rebuttal-to-lawrence-s-lerner</a></p>
              <p>The issue is not whether you personally see a point in believing in something, the issue is whether there are good reasons for believing in it. Atheists will say what's the point, theists will say got lots of point. But the point is not whether you think there's a point, but whether there are reasons for it. Yes, there are things we do not believe in because we have no good reason to, e.g. Zeus, elves etc. And no one defends their existence anyway. But God is not so easily cast away.</p>

              <p>I disagree. Perception is NOT reality. It is a way of looking at reality which may or may not be true. What animals think of us is really irrelevant or moot since we have no inside access to their inner world. But the fact is that we are FINITE beings, and no amount of perception otherwise would change it. </p>

              Personally I do not have enough faith to be an atheist. It takes more faith to believe that the universe was caused by nothing than that it was created by an all powerful God.

                      of how much time you put in. I think it takes greater faith and a
                      bigger miracle to believe in the grand scheme of evolution.</p>
              <p>You have misunderstood me. I am not saying that we can know
                      nothing about the past. I am saying that the past cannot
                      be proven, not by the scientific method. What you have access would
                      be legal-historical evidences. And what you have is an
                      inference to the best explanation. Forensic science is historical
                      science, it gathers data that exists in the PRESENT and tries to
                      piece them together to make up a plausible story about the PAST.
                      Assumptions are being made in such cases. You may wish to read up
                      more about it here <a rel="nofollow" href="http://creation.com/whos-really-pushing-bad-science-rebuttal-to-lawrence-s-lerner">http://creation.com/whos-really-pushing-bad-science-rebuttal-to-lawrence-s-lerner</a></p>
              <p>The issue is not whether you personally see a point in believing
                      in something, the issue is whether there are good reasons for
                      believing in it. Atheists will say what's the point, theists will
                      say got lots of point. But the point is not whether you think
                      there's a point, but whether there are reasons for it. Yes, there
                      are things we do not believe in because we have no good reason
                      to, e.g. Zeus, elves etc. And no one defends their
                      existence anyway. But God is not so easily cast away.</p>

              <p>It is a fact that the universe has a beginning? Where did you get that premise from? How odd then, to see many physicists and philosophers who do not think that time can be caused. I think you meant "the universe began to exist?" That would be true, and is accepted by almost everyone. Abiogenesis is not a matter of faith, abiogenesis is a result derived from the Urey-Miller experiment. If thinking something which has been verified again and again is called faith, then I propose that you are implicitly defining faith in a question begging manner. Furthermore, the letter to letter correspondences in the DNA between any group of animals, if plotted out, form a perfect hierarchy - a family tree. Not to mention, there is the record in the nucleic acids which is obtained by DNA sequencing. In which we can trace the evolutionary past of animals. So to say that evolution is a form of faith is simply non sequitur. I define faith as "belief in the absence of evidence". </p>
              <p>But the past can be proven. In view of the techniques available to know facts about the past, the epistemic skeptic has to show that acquisition of past knowledge is unachievable. Just because one isn't there is no reason to think otherwise. Could you give me a scenario where epistemic claims aren't possible?</p>
              <p>No doubt, we have to access the reasons for it. So what reasons are there to think that time can be caused?</p>

              You are not following my logic at all. Both the theist and the atheist has faith. Saying that everyone is born an atheist, even technically speaking, is abusing definition of atheism amd misleading. No one is born declaring that there is no God. It is true to say that everyone is born ignorant since he comes into the world with a clean slate in terms of knowledge.
              
              <p>As for focusing on the question, I have already made my comments concerning the nature of the question. I don't think you have done so.</p>

              That the universe began to exist and that the universe has a beginning are different ways of saying the same thing.
              
              <p>The Bible supplies the premise that the universe has a beginning and more recently science has come to the same conclusion so clearly stated in the first words of Holy Writ.
              
              </p><p>The Stanley Miller experiment did not prove abiogenesis at all. They did not produce life. Far from it they got a deadly mixture of stuff. But even if they did manage to produce life in the lab it would prove that intelligent design was required, rather than a naturalistic undirected process.
              
              </p><p>Again I am NOT saying that we know nothing about the past. The Bible tells us a lot about the past that have been vindicated by other historical sources and archaeological findings. What I am saying is that you cannot repeat the past in the lab.
