              I read the recent postings today from the members within this topic and I really don't know what to say...maybe its best we speak well about the objective without getting ourselves angry ya....well at least don't get irritated or emotional. Like Jesus said, "Treat others like the way you want them to treat you."
              
              Ok lets do this....for now since I'm online I would like to speak to BrolnChrist. BrolnChrist hope you are available. Others I hope you listen and don't speak until its time. Lets talk BrolnChrist and I give you my word I won't dishonour your belief. I like to be honest with you and likewise I hope you too can be honest with me...with that hopefully we get to know where we stand and where we go from here. I start first...
              
              I'm 49 years old. My wife is a Catholic and we have a civil marraige done in Singapore. I'm born in Singapore, in a Muslim family and my name is a Muslim name. Both my late parents had gone for the Muslim pilgrimage twice. I have siblings who is a Christian and the other a Hindu. The rest of my siblings are still Muslims. As for myself, though I have a Muslim name but I see myself a non Muslim. I'm a noncomformist to any religion. I came to realize about myself 20 years ago while I was in Bali. I came across a German man who converted to Islam with an Indonesian Muslim wife. I asked him whether he could read the Qur'an in Arabic and he said no. He said he read the Qur'an in German or English. He said that the most important thing is that Allah/God wants him to understand the messages within the Qur'an. That statement really opened my eyes and I agreed with him totally. From that day onward I read the Qur'an in English, Malay or Bahasa Indonesia.....and began my soul searching journey to know about God. I came to realize that man has no faith unless he has a faith that lies within his heart. That faith will make him see things different about life, death and God.
              
              What I really like to know from you is whether you have experience such incredible feeling about yourself in the past until you spend time seeking for Him and the Truth? I hope you could let us know here truly without any fear. You can ask me question I really don't mind.

              <p>Thanks for sharing. I believe that those who have found Truth no longer need to seek for it. But just when you thought you "found" the Truth you realised the truth which Paul wrote in Ephesians 1:4 that</p>
              <p>"<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even before he made the world</span></strong>, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes. God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure."</p>
              <p>It's a paradox and a glorious truth. I was privileged to have "found" God when I was still a kid and other than parental objections I would say there's no Damascus experience for me to talk about.</p>

              Thanks for your honest reply. I agree that Jesus is a very loving man and he still lives within all Christians and in others too who could understand his preaching.
              
              I can understand you have done alot of researched too to come this far and really have strong faith in Christianity. I admire your strong faith in Him.
              
              I read many holy scriptures during my soul searching and I hope it helps here. The reason I did that to understand more about God. I read many scientific books to understand the beauty of its discoveries that make me think even more in depth about my search for Him. 
              
              How about you? You did that research with thoughts of find the Truth too?

              <p>hello guys and wlecome to the forum zulkifli...anyway we have deviated from the topic but i tink its quite clear alredi tat before the qn ''who created God'' can be asked, we must 1st affirm if we are toking abt a finite god or infinite God...</p>
              <p>its possible for man to create god but such a god is surely finite and limited...in the entire of human history, i dun tink theres anything that was created by man that is infinite and eternal...</p>

              I understand what you mean there...as for my brother who is a Christian he found happiness in Christianity. I really like to talk to you too despondent. However, with due respect I just want to talk to BrolnChrist. I will get back to you despondent and the others. Thanks.

              ok thanks despondent for that reply. Do you agree with him BrolnChrist? As for me its about the same answer. Good and Evil knowledge is from God and it was corrupted when Adam ate the forbidden apple in paradize and was thrown down to earth for his sin...yes.

              <p>The Bible teaches that every good and perfect gift comes from God. Therefore no (moral) evil comes from God. The forbidden fruit was on earth in a specific place called the Garden of Eden which was not a heavenly Paradise, though in a sense it was like Paradise prior to the Fall. The Bible teaches that the only creature thrown down because of sin was the devil himself, the serpent of old.</p>

              <p>The Bible teaches that God has revealed Himself and that He is not the author of confusion. God does not contradict Himself. While He is infinite He can certainly communicate to finite beings. God is not so transcendent that He is not immanent. The incarnation speaks of the infinite God taking on the form of a man. Jesus says He is THE Truth, THE Life, and THE Way. As such I believe there is such a thing as the one true religion, even though such a notion is offensive to many. But then again, truth by definition is exclusive.</p>

              I understand you understand the truth about God via your understanding through Christ and Christianity. That is Theology Knowledge from God. Science is also one of God Knowledge. Geology and Languages too are from Him. Some of us realize the real greatness of God via those knowledges from God too. What are they meant for if not to know  and understand God better and closer.

              Like Jesus spoke to his disciples that his words is not his words but from God speaking through him. He didn't write the bible but was written by his disciples. Like a father talking to his sons and his sons converse to their sons....yes. Again, I can't really see the meaning of your thoughts here.....Is the holy scriptures of God really completed?
