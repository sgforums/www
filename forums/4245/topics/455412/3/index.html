              <p><br> That the universe began to exist and that the universe has a
                      beginning are different ways of saying the same thing.</p>
              <p>The Bible supplies the premise that the universe has a beginning
                      and more recently science has come to the same conclusion so
                      clearly stated in the first words of Holy Writ.</p>
              <p>The Stanley Miller experiment did not prove abiogenesis at all.
                      They did not produce life. Far from it they got a deadly mixture of
                      stuff. But even if they did manage to produce life in the lab it
                      would prove that intelligent design was required, rather than a
                      naturalistic undirected process.</p>
              <p>Again I am NOT saying that we know nothing about the past. The
                      Bible tells us a lot about the past that have been vindicated by
                      other historical sources and archaeological findings. What I am
                      saying is that you cannot repeat the past in the lab.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>They are not the same. Beginning predicates temporal priority and the concept of "before" and "after". They did produce the amino acids capable of sustaining life over a couple of months - a huge feat and perfectly in line with abiogenesis. Deadly mixture of stuff?! What deadly mixture are you referring to? There is no deadly mixture involved. Are you perhaps referring to the amino acid compunds formed? Also, how does it prove intelligent design? Where did you get that premise from? We certainly cannot repeat the past in the lab, but that doesn't mean we cannot know about the past. Not everything has to be repeated ad infinitum to be known. I don't need to live repeated lives to verify my existence. I don't need to repeat the birth of an animal to verify the animal's parents. We have much better reasons for that, such as our cognitive faculties and the ability to test family relations via DNA sequencing.</p>

              You failed to get the meaning about not having enough faith to be an atheist.
              
              <p>An atheist is one who says there is no God. Newborns do not say that. It is only recently that atheists redefine atheism as lack of belief so they can evade the burden of proof that comes with declaring that there is no God. It is an intellectually dishonest cop out.

              <p><br> If something began to exists, it means it has a beginning. That
                          seems pretty clear.</p>
              <p>Miller's experiment yielded 85% tar. See

              <p>Why would scientists tinkering with chemicals in the lab to
                          produce life not be deemed as intelligent design in action? Human
                          intelligence and intervention was present at all stages. But
                          evolution is supposed to be undirected. See
                          http://creation.com/why-the-miller-urey-research-argues-against-abiogenesis</p>
              <p>Any attempt to verify the past will involve the use of the
                          legal-historical method of proof, not the scientific method.</p>

              <p>So what you're offering is that time can be caused. Okay, so do you have any justification for that? Tar was not formed during the experiment. The article is really, really wrong. LOL. I don't know how to expose the error of the article except via explaining how tar is actually formed so please bear with me. Tar is produced via the distillation or burning of long chain carbon compunds and fossil fuels. Tar is the result of carbon residue being left due to imcomplete combustion (what we call black soot). Tar was not formed during the experiment because short chain amino acids cannot decompose to form tar. They simply denature, and here's why. Ever wondered why your meat doesn't produce tar when cooked? Proteins (amino acids) denature when exposed to heat and the whole connection between amino acids and tar is absurd. I would also like to add that the results are remarkably in line with abiogenesis, 13 amino acids were produced using merely 2 percent of the carbon present. Here's a paper from Duke University.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.chem.duke.edu/~jds/cruise_chem/Exobiology/miller.html">http://www.chem.duke.edu/~jds/cruise_chem/Exobiology/miller.html</a></p>
              <p>No, the tinkering of chemicals would not be considered intelligent design because the tinkering is meant to make it as unintelligent as possible. It is precisely the point to make things happen randomly (whilst stimulating the initial conditions of the Earth) without any interference during the organic synthesis. How one goes from stimulating the initial conditions of the Earth to intelligent design is simply non sequitur.</p>

              <p>There maybe God, but there is definitely no God like a grand old man with a white beard seeing everything and rewarding every good deed carrying a stout wooden walking stick.. There maybe Devil, but definitely no Devil like a  red skinned  being with two horn and an arrowhead tail carrying a trident.</p>
              <p>For want of a better word, God and all its variants is used for good, and Satan or Devil and all the bad spirits for evil.</p>
              <p>Both God and Satan should they exist, would be equal. God can create religion and Satan can also create religion in order to win the eternal battle of good and evil. We humans are the pawns.</p>

              <p>Different ethnic groups have different ideas of God and Satan. No one is wrong or correct. It is just their idea of the champions of good and evil. And they would want their community and others to adopt their belief for their own betterment and safety.</p>
              <p>This discourse would go endlessly, and to get to the point I want to make in this topic about God is that God would be omnipotent and not petty, so it matters not to Him what "faith you belong to". Just chose to live the good life. It matters to Satan, for He represents evil and wants your unwavering allegiance to stifle humanity.</p>
              <p>God "whatever you conceive Him to be" wants humanity to flourish, to progress, to advance, to be happy. It takes time to build. The reverse, Satan wants the opposite, and has the advantage because to destroy is easy. Thats why evil is rife while good is plodding along.</p>
              <p>Nobody knows the truth about heaven, hell, reincarntion and rebirth, or curtains where death means zap! nothing. This is not the time to worry about it.</p>
              <p>Human are different from other creatures, because of the ability to think more deeply.</p>
              <p>And to decide what is better. Advance in harmony or regress in misery.</p>
              <p>Think. Don't be afraid to be wrong.</p>

                              <p>I certainly rejoice in the wisdom and interesting literature of
              the Bible. I used to learn and teach from it over the past 12 years
              after all. However, over the past 3 years, I have come to find
              certain portions of the text to be insightful whilst others
              horrifying. </p>

              Interesting. In what capacity and setting were you teaching the Bible for 12 years? Did you give up Christianity? Why?

                  Wow, his mission in life is to promote atheism by bashing theism? And Christians are castigated for promoting theism by refuting atheism? Double standards!
                  
                  <p>Anyway Sam Harris has recently debated William Lane Craig and you can watch it online. I give the debate to Craig. In my view the new atheists lack the philosophical depths to challenge theism while atheism itself lacks a philosophical justification.</p>

              <p>the belief system is collapsing like a house of cards in the

              Collapsing in the next 100 years? Why not the next decade or within your lifetime? I know, you would be too dead to be embarassed by then. You are too optimistic. Anyway, the death knell for the Bible and Christianity has been sounded for hundres of years but those who made the most noise have all perished but still the Bible remains and Christianity remains.
