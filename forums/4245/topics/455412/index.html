              <p>Personally I think it is an honest question prima facie, depending upon one's notion about what God is. But if by God one refers to the Christian concept of God, then I think it is both invalid and flawed. </p>

              <p>True. I also think people asking this question also holds an unstated assumption about things in general, which is that everything must have a cause. However, the more correct restatement would be that every EFFECT must have a cause. But not every cause must have a cause. The first cause does not have a cause. If it has, then it cannot be the first. So by definition, the first cause has no cause.</p>

              <p>The Bible teaches that creation of the universe and all that is in it took place over 6 days. We are time bound because we are physical beings. God lives in eternity and is the cause of the 3 dimensional universe we live in.

              <p>u need to understand that to creationists time is finite and hence is part of creation...so yes, causality can only occurred in the realm of time...since time is finite, its therefore created and so the creator of time has to live outside the realm of time...the qn: who created God suggests a God that is bounded by time which makes the God finite...</p>

              There is no chicken or egg issue. The chicken came first! Now the first cause must necessarily be God. If you know of any alternative please share.

              <p>We live in a four dimensioned universe. Time is the fourth dimension. One says that causality can only occur within the realm of time yet postulates that time can be created (an event which has to exist outside of time). In order for the premise to be accepted, one has to demonstrate how causality can occur outside of time. With all due respect, I simply do not think this has been done. Furthermore, the universe and all that is in it was not created within 6 days. It was created over billions of years. Let's discuss the age of the Earth while we're at it too! </p>

                                  <p>We live in a four dimensioned universe. Time is the fourth
                  dimension. One says that causality can only occur within the realm
                  of time yet postulates that time can be created (an event which has
                  to exist outside of time). In order for the premise to be accepted,
                  one has to demonstrate how causality can occur outside of time.
                  With all due respect, I simply do not think this has been done.
                  Furthermore, the universe and all that is in it was not created
                  within 6 days. It was created over billions of years. Let's discuss
                  the age of the Earth while we're at it too! </p>

                  Put it this way, the Bible says that with God a day is like a years, this verse means that God is not bound by time as we know it. Linear time as we experience it had a beginning. Time, space and matter were all simultaneously created ex nihilo, out of nothing. God who inhabits eternity created time together with space and matter. We shouls not make the mistake of boxing God in time. See http://creation.com/universe-had-a-beginning 
                  
                  <p>The Bible tells us that God created the universe in six days about six thousand years ago. It is interesting that you used the word "created" but over billions of years. But created by who or what? No human can prove how old the universe. It is a matter of fairh whichever view we take. But there are many lines of evidence that point to a young earth. See http://creation.com/age-of-the-earth</p>

              <p>Let's not make the mistake of asserting that creation is possible without time. You still have to demonstrate that causation can occur in the absence of time. Second point, created by the big bang of course, all that there is, the spiral galaxies, the supernovas and so forth were created by the enormous explosion of energy from the singularity we call the big bang. It is interesting to note that it is possible to attain a very good estimate of the Earth's age (4.6 billion years old). These methods can be discussed in more detail if you like.

              <p>I think the issue is not that of creation without time, but that time itself is created since time has a beginning. Scientists generally agree that time, space and matter were created simultaneously. See also <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/God-time.html">http://www.gotquestions.org/God-time.html</a> and also <a href="http://www.reasonablefaith.org/god-time-and-creation">http://www.reasonablefaith.org/god-time-and-creation</a></p>
              <p>Secondly, bear in mind that the big bang theory is not fact, but a theory or model to explain the universe. It is a belief and one not without its critics (see <a href="http://creation.com/secular-scientists-blast-the-big-bang">http://creation.com/secular-scientists-blast-the-big-bang</a>). But it only confirms the fact that the universe has a beginning. Did the big bang "create" everything that exists? How does order comes from that? By what means?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, whatever age we derived about the earth is based upon unproven assumptions about many things in the past. I am aware that many Christians hold to a long age view, but that doesn't mean they are right in doing so. In fact, I would argue that they hold to a compromised view. Contrary to what you think, I see the age of the earth as a big issue of contention.

              <p>I think the issue is about creation in the absence of time. Since the creation of time itself must be an event outside of time. No, scientists do not agree that time, space and matter were created - scientists hold to the view that time, space and matter began to exist.</p>
              <p>I understand. The same applies to the theory of gravity. However, theories can be translated into facts. There are 4 pieces of evidence in favor of the big bang. Two of which are microwave background radiation and general relativity. To say that someone believes in the big bang is no different from saying that one believes in gravity. Sure, one may say that, but it's merely semantics. Big bang did not create anything in particular (energy can neither be created nor destroyed). I think you speak of dis-order? That has to do with entrophy - the universe progresses towards chaos, not order.</p>
              <p>The age of the Earth can be dated using uranium dating (uranium has a half life of 4.47 billion years). Uranium compunds in igneous rocks can be dated backwards to achieve a fairly decent estimate of the age of the Earth. If someone can offer an alternative method of determining the age of the Earth, I'll be glad to hear it.</p>
              <p>Yes, is there a creator? I addressed some issues about "creating time" in a couple of my previous posts. Thus far, I have not heard any justification of such a premise and how this can be done.</p>
