              <p>I think you may be confused between discussions and debates. In discussions you mostly share opinions and talk about and around the topic, list pros and cons and research data and bounce off ideas etc. In debates you attempt to persuade the listeners using the tools of rhetoric i.e. you want to have the better argument but to do that you also need to back up claims with evidence or challenge the claims of the opponent.</p>
              <p>It is in the nature of arguments that claims be supported and conclusions be sound. If you want your argument to be sound and not just valid then you also have to show that the premises are true or well supported by the evidence. It is unheard of that both sides can make claims and arguments but no one calls the other to back up the claims.  Maybe you personally just do not like debating but prefer only discussion? I agree with you though that sometimes we can get carried away and end up being argumentative instead of making arguments. That's where the Mods should play their part to steer things back on track. Sad to say there are some who prefer to blow up the tracks and sometimes the trains as well.</p>

              <p>What do you mean by argue for the sake of arguing? To me that refers to arguments<span class="st"> that an individual will make despite the fact they don't believe the central premises of their own arguments. They have nothing to proclaim or defend, just want to be heard and seen.</span></p>

              <p>That's a very serious allegation you make, that I show basically NO FORM of respect for atheists. You sure it is not the other way round where atheists are showing no respect for believers and their faith? When I say someone is confused I actually explain why I said that. You have confused disagreement with confusion.</p>

              <p>Wrong. I believe that atheists are wrong about there being no God, and that makes the rest of their beliefs which flow from this belief just as wrong. I have many times said I am not infallible. The only reason why you get this impression is because I dwell mainly on the subject of the Christian faith which I believe is true. And it so happens that the atheists on this forum really entertain a lot of wrong ideas about Christianity which I know enough about to refute. But talk about cars and politics and other stuff I will be wrong on many things.</p>

              <p>If you tell me that you have the ability to see invisible things then I will tell you that I can see God. That's a valid argument for you. *roll eyes*</p>
              <p>Please understand the subject matter first before saying things that reflect utter ignorance which just show that you are arguing for the sake of arguing. Basic Christian doctrine is that God is Spirit, invisible, i.e. no one has seen God. However, the invisible things of God can be seen in the visible things that are made. For example, the vastness and design of the universe speaks of the infinite power and intelligence of God.</p>
