              <p>That is true. In fact, I think there are actually good reasons
              to think that God does not exist. The plethora of evils in the
              world is a good case against the concept of an
              omnibenevolent/onmipotent God. Even if it doesn't amount to a
              complete disproof, it is strong evidence against the existence of
              such a deity.</p>

              But I think the case has not been argued that the existence of evil means that God does not exist.

              Lots of people have also embraced Christianity because they found it coherent, logical and intellectually satisfying. Among these included scholars and scientists as well.  The existence of God was the only explanation for why the universe existed. For these people, there is no doubt that God existed.

              <p>I used to teach Bible studies and apologetics in a church, and yes. I think our discussion has yielded some reasons for my non-belief. I wanted to talk more about the Urey-Miller experiment...</p>
              <p>I think you've misunderstood the argument. The argument from evil is not to prove that God does not exist. The arguments tries to show that an omnipotent/omnibenevolent God does not exist. If one professes one's God to be non-omnibenevolent (such as William Lane Craig, and I suspect Alvin Plantinga), then the argument from evil will not be a suitable disproof as an non-omnibenevolentl God is perfectly compatible with the existence of evil in the world.</p>

              <p>I used to teach Bible studies and apologetics in a church, and yes. I think our discussion has yielded some reasons for my non-belief. I wanted to talk more about the Urey-Miller experiment...</p>
              <p>I think you've misunderstood the argument. The argument from evil is not to prove that God does not exist. The arguments tries to show that an omnipotent/omnibenevolent God does not exist. If one professes one's God to be non-omnibenevolent (such as William Lane Craig, and I suspect Alvin Plantinga), then the argument from evil will not be a suitable disproof as an non-omnibenevolentl God is perfectly compatible with the existence of evil in the world.</p>

              <p><br>Interesting that you taught Bible study and apologetics for 12 years in a church. So I presume you had been a Christian for more years than that? If so, then I assume you will not have much trouble following my arguments.</p>
              <p>Please feel free to speak your mind on the Miller experiment. My earlier point was that had they been successful they would not have proved that abiogenesis happened, but that life required intelligent design. They would only have proven that life could be formed in a lab, but not in a primordial soup millions of years ago which they assumed they knew how it was like.</p>
              <p>But why would the existence of evil means that the Christian God does not exist? Clearly you must have added some other premises to come to that conclusion.</p>

              <p>yes what I find odd was the belief in an imaginery god and holy book which was written by ancient primitive people who doesnt have our knowledge now. the people in that era was illiterate and science was rudimentary. when you tell them it was acts of god then, people who not challenge you, but if you ask a modern man that earthquake as an act of god, to hell with your act of god.</p>

              <p>The books were written thousand or hundreds of years ago. In the language and vocabulary of that time. Previous to that the records were handed down by word of mouth. So there is distortion and limited vocabulary.</p>
              <p>Those writings are then translated into English, using the current vocabulary. So the translations was fitted and refitted with present day vocabulary until it made the best sense. Then attribute it to God and that finalise it.</p>
