              some things about God that are true.</p>
              <p>We can know God TRULY without knowing God FULLY. As such the
              Scriptures are SUFFICIENT for us to know Him. The Scriptures tells

               The Revelations has to do with the personal and indirect or direct experience of an individual to see GOD. Like for instance when we do something we know we are doing wrong and then without your realization....there it is within yourself you see something or some form of insights which sees why and when and where we have gone wrong. Revelation of the Holy Spirit comes in the form of angst or euphoria within oneself which constitutes the live of oneself and learns from the image of self existence and with the thoughts of how we can be in one with the higher self. Revelation has not been found in many of us because we are either not listening or not liking the intangible image of a like GOD. Yes, the holy scriptures has explained and told the meaning of the some of the incidences that had accurred thousands of years hoping the we in the present generation could envisage what they had gone through to receive such revelation of the super being that we call GOD.

We die and we can see that ourselves are not in physical form anymore but we live as in the world of intangibles.....we compose this as to make it worth to make man believes in life after death.

What happens to those energies from our dead bodies....it goes right back to the soil, water, air and the breath we breathe in.....see simple but its complex for most of us to understand.....science and theology as a religion has thought many new things new revelations to us and science too has evolved from ancient theologians that believed in knowing GOD and to understand GOD..yes.

              <p>The Bible teaches that man is complete when he is body, soul and spirit. Death is what separates the soul/spirit from the body. But the Bible also teaches that there will be a resurrection of the dead, the body will reunite with the soul/spirit.</p>

              <p>The Bible refers to actual physical bodies that are also spiritual bodies. In case you think there's a contradiction there is none. I am not saying that the physical body is a spirit, but that the physical body is also a spiritual body.</p>

              Glory indeed and Glory to GOD. It does seem peculiar here we aren't the body which is only the body matter but we much more than that...Energy that comes from our dead body which you see as the holy scriptures said....which energy has written the myriad of the holy scriptures of the whole world.....So whose is doing the writing there.....humans, mind, energies of the dead living soul which you said either as the soul/spirit then we see GOD in all things....even after we are long gone from this living world.....yes.

              <p>Since when did the government ban public preaching? Are you referring to standing on soap boxes to preach like in the US? Schools and hospital ban evangelism I know. But I do not know of any law that says I cannot approach you at bus-stop and share with you about my faith. If there is such a law please enlighten me.</p>
