              Yes I believe that only the Bible is God's written revelation to us. God has no official language. No such notion is taught in the Bible. The Bible teaches that people from every tongue and every tribe will worship Him.

              Hi Jacky, thanks for the advise. Well, it wasn't easy for me to let go of my religion at first since I was raised in a Muslim family and imbued with Islamic teachings. However, somewhere in the year 2000 I think, I let go of my religion. Thencefore, I continue my search for more enlightenment until now. I free my soul from religious doctrines and I can see boundless space for my soul to learn, grow and develop.

              <p>I suggest you go read the world's religion and compare them if you have the time.</p>
              <p>I did, here is my conclusion.</p>
              <p>god is a myth and fallacy. god is invented by man due to fear of the unknown and supernatural and ignorance of the laws of nature. also partly wishful thinking in an eternal happy ever after life in heaven.</p>
              <p>all god religion have their tales of how the world came about etc. all claimed to be the truth. I suggest you use critical thinking and analytical thinking to think about whether god is a myth and fallacy.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Jacky, thanks for the advise. Well, it wasn't easy for me to let go of my religion at first since I was raised in a Muslim family and imbued with Islamic teachings. However, somewhere in the year 2000 I think, I let go of my religion. Thencefore, I continue my search for more enlightenment until now. I free my soul from religious doctrines and I can see boundless space for my soul to learn, grow and develop.</p>

              <p>you just have to know the type of society when these religions first sprang up....science and technology were non existent. superstitious beliefs must have reigned during that era, esp god religions. fear and unknown of nature caused man to seek solace in religion. otherwise how you have sun god, moon god, monkey god etc...........also were earthquakes, tsunamis an act of god? people thought they need to appease god, so turn to sacrifises of humans and animals. this is the fear of punishment, hence sin sprung up too.</p>

              There various ways to understand GOD like you did and others who have found happiness in CHRIST. Universally, we are all one but it doesn't mean you need to be a holyman or a pious individual for TRUTH to find you brother Despondent.....yes. There is a verse in the holy bible that mention to you if GOD invested in you HE too would like you to see you be more wise in searching the Truth as man, women and children.....can you see what I'm talking about here...see with your inward heart ....hear that voice. Like you being call by.....GOD in yourself.
