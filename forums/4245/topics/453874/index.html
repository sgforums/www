              <p>This thread is to highlight books that I have read or am reading which I find to be educational and edifying for the growing Christian. Feel free to share your own recommendations too.</p>
              <p>If you love to buy books online, I recommend <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/">http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/</a></p>
              <p>For a start I recommend "Defending Inerrancy" by Norman Geisler. Inerrancy and infallibility of Scriptures are distinct but closely related doctrines of the Christian faith. Undermine either one or both and there is really little for the Christian to stand on. This book is written to address the works of those who says that the Bible has errors and it is OK.</p>

              <p>I am currently 1/3 way through David Glass' new book "<span id="btAsinTitle">Atheism's New Clothes: Exloring and Exposing the Claims of the New Atheists". I would recommend this to Christians who would like to be better equipped to respond to the anti-faith claims of the new atheists. While the author does not affirm Biblical creation, much of his book is good stuff and good learning.</span></p>

              <p>This book I really recommend to Christians (and atheists) if they want a very comprehensive and systematic way of showing why atheism is simply untenable as a worldview.</p>

              <p>Here's another very useful book to answer the so-called top stumper question of the atheist and other non-believers, the problem of evil. Norman Geisler masterfully confronts this question headlong and show why Christianity is best positioned to answer this question.</p>

              <p>Many nonbelievers often have this view that with all the many and varied denominations existing, the church must be hopelessly confused and divided about the doctrines of the faith, and thus justifies the non-committal attitude of the nonbeliever. But in this book the author explains what are the doctrines that must be affirmed and what can be debated and held in Christian love and liberty.</p>

              <p>Written by a secular Jew this book is dripping with witty quips, sardonic humour and satire as the author examines atheism and its arguments against God and religion.</p>

              <p>Bertrand Russell's "Why I am not a Christian" has often been posted as the primer for reasos against being a Christian. But it is plagued with many flawed arguments, see <a href="http://ntrminblog.blogspot.sg/2005/11/why-im-not-bertrand-russell.html">http://ntrminblog.blogspot.sg/2005/11/why-im-not-bertrand-russell.html</a></p>

              <p>This new book comes from the pen of an unlikely person, Bart Ehrman, who has written many books undermining faith in Christianity, especially the Bible. In this book Bart examines the claims of the few loud people who assert that Jesus never existed and finds them wanting.</p>

              <p>Many people have nonbiblical views about the church. In this series of books the author invites the reader to set aside the "we have always done it this way" mentality and rethink what the church is and how it should function. Highly recommended!</p>

              <p>Many people think that the Bible is just a book of fairy tales. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Bible is a book rooted in history. God's dealings with man happened in real time history. In a time when attacks on the reliability of the Bible is on the rise, and many believers have compromised and caved in to intellectual intimidation, the authors of this book have mustered a strong defense of the Bible's inerrancy and historical reliability.</p>

              <p>I'm somewhat lazy to create a new account. Would things be easier if I created the topic here instead? It seems to me, that your threads tend to be locked for no reason at all.

              <p>I'm somewhat lazy to create a new account. Would things be
              easier if I created the topic here instead? It seems to me, that
              your threads tend to be locked for no reason at all. That speaks a
              lot about the intellectual stature of the person/people who locked
              your threads and the attitudes of some of the
              moderators/administrators here.</p>

              I do agree with you that my threads have been locked for no reason, or if there is it is not communicated. And even if communicated I am doubtful that it is justifiable. Anyway, the owner and moderatress can do anything they like without giving any reason.

              <p>Richard Dawkins, the undisputed high priest of evolution/atheism, says his book <em>The Greatest Show on Earth: the evidence for evolution</em> is the first time he has presented all the evidence for evolution/long ages. It is promoted as an unanswerable demolition of creation. Scientist, logician, chessmaster and author of the world’s biggest-selling creationist book, CMI’s Dr Jonathan Sarfati, relentlessly demolishes Dawkin’s claims point-by-point, showing biblical creation makes more sense of the evidence. A must-read!</p>
