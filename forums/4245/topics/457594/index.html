              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: start;">OF ALL the organisations that serve America’s poor, few do more good work than the Catholic church: its schools and hospitals provide a lifeline for millions. Yet even taking these virtues into account, the finances of the Catholic church in America are an unholy mess. The sins involved in its book-keeping are not as vivid or grotesque as those on display in the various sexual-abuse cases that have cost the American church more than $3 billion so far; but the financial mismanagement and questionable business practices would have seen widespread resignations at the top of any other public institution.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: start;">The sexual-abuse scandals of the past 20 years have brought shame to the church around the world. In America they have also brought financial strains. By studying court documents in bankruptcy cases, examining public records, requesting documents from local, state and federal governments, as well as talking to priests and bishops confidentially, <em class="Italic" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The Economist</em> has sought to quantify the damage.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: start;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: start;">The picture that emerges is not flattering. The church’s finances look poorly co-ordinated considering (or perhaps because of) their complexity. The management of money is often sloppy. And some parts of the church have indulged in ungainly financial contortions in some cases—it is alleged—both to divert funds away from uses intended by donors and to frustrate creditors with legitimate claims, including its own nuns and priests. The dioceses that have filed for bankruptcy may not be typical of the church as a whole. But given the overall lack of openness there is no way of knowing to what extent they are outliers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: start;">
              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">The retirement funds for Wilmington, Delaware, were largely lost when it settled sex-abuse claims for $77m in February 2011. Those funds had been tossed into a pooled investment account that also contained parish investments and funds for cemeteries and the education of seminarians. The Eastern United States province of the Passionists, a missionary order, has diverted retirement funds to cover operating expenses. In a bid to stave off bankruptcy it has sold off property, including a 14-acre piece of New York waterfront, and made an unorthodox investment in a Broadway show, “Leap of Faith”. It flopped.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">In a public company, this type of thing would attract regulatory scrutiny. In the church, retirement is still largely in the gift of the bishop. Retirement plans for priests are typically set up as diocesan trusts rather than proper pension funds with structured benefits. They do not fall under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the law that establishes standards for plan trustees and remedies for beneficiaries, including access to federal courts. Priests thus have no recourse to law if they are hard done by. Nor, as a matter of course, can they take their pensions with them if they leave for another diocese.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">Richard Vega, who recently stepped down as president of the National Federation of Priests’ Councils, estimates that 75-80% of clergy pension schemes in America are underfunded. He says that only a small minority of priests will have set aside enough of their net average salary of $25,000 a year to cover themselves. Others will be less fortunate.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 1em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The clergy and its creditors</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">The principle of separation between church and state in America means that religious groups are not required to file tax returns, list their assets or disclose basic facts about their finances. Some dioceses do publish accounts, but these tend to provide an incomplete picture. Though lawyers for dioceses facing bankruptcy have fought to keep most financially sensitive documents sealed, the process has forced the church to let in unaccustomed light.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">The documents that have been disclosed reveal that some bishops in the bankrupt dioceses presented the diocesan funds of parishes, schools, hospitals and retirement accounts as separate when they were really simply book-keeping entries in the same pooled investment account. The diocese of San Diego, for instance, reported to the bankruptcy court that it had over 500 accounts. But these were merely entries in a “Parish, School Diocese Loan Trust Account”, maintained in a single bank account at Union Bank of California.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">Such pooling saves on administrative costs and allows dioceses to use a surplus in one area to cover shortfalls in another, often a legitimate course of action. But it has presented problems when it comes to working out which assets belong to whom in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">The vast majority of parishes that commingled their funds with those dioceses now in bankruptcy lost all their investments. In some cases they were misled into believing that the money would be kept separate from the main diocesan funds, and thus safe in the event of bankruptcy. The judge in the Wilmington bankruptcy, Christopher Sontchi, said parishes that had suffered this fate had grounds to sue the diocese for breach of fiduciary duty. None has—but that is hardly surprising, given that the bishop and the chancellor of the diocese sit on the five-member board of trustees of each parish.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">Some parishes were more careful than others in ensuring their funds were handled properly. According to a document in <em class="Italic" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The Economist</em>’s possession, a parish priest in Wilmington wrote to the diocese: “Find enclosed a cheque for $1,000,000 to be invested in [the parish of] St Thomas’s name in the diocesan account. It is my understanding that if the need arises, this is and always will be available for parish use. If this is not the case, please return it and I will put it under my mattress for safe keeping.” The diocese cashed the cheque, apparently depositing it in a general cash account. The parish lost the money when the diocese struck a sexual-abuse settlement. By contrast St Ann’s parish, also in the Wilmington diocese, wired its deposits directly into a segregated investment account at Mellon Bank rather than to the diocesan cash account at Citizen’s Bank. Its trustees also insisted on drafting a special agreement stipulating that funds provided to the diocese were held in trust.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">Plaintiffs’ lawyers have raised questions about financial transfers in dioceses threatened with bankruptcy. These tend to go the other way—moving money out of diocesan accounts and into parish accounts, trusts of various sorts and any other receptacle at hand. According to an independent report commissioned by a bankruptcy judge, at one point priests in San Diego were taking cash out of accounts and putting it in safes in the rectories because they wanted to keep it out of reach of plaintiffs. Nobody becomes a priest, monk or nun in order to spend their professional life as a financial manager, so no doubt part of this money shuffling is down to innocent incompetence. But the church does shift between considering all assets as part of a single pool when that suits, and claiming that funds have always been separate and ring-fenced when they are exposed to claims.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">Creditors in the Milwaukee bankruptcy case, which is still in progress, have questioned the motives behind a $35m transfer to a trust and a $55.6m transfer from archdiocese coffers to a fund for cemeteries. Cardinal Dolan, who was Archbishop of Milwaukee at the time, authorised both transactions. The creditors think the movement of such large amounts had more to do with shielding cash from sexual-abuse victims than with the maintenance of graves, calling the manoeuvre fraudulent. Cardinal Dolan’s office responded to questions about these allegations by pointing to blog posts in which he described them as “baloney” and defended the transfers as “virtuous, open and in accord with the clear directives of the professionals on our finance council and outside auditors”.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">As “debtors in possession”—entities that have filed for bankruptcy yet retain their assets—bust dioceses have an obligation to enlarge their assets to satisfy their creditors. On the contrary, “we have seen a consistent tactic of Catholic bishops to shrink the size of their assets, which is not only wrong morally but in violation of state and federal law,” says Ken Brown of Pachulski Stang, a California law firm that has represented creditors in eight of the ten Catholic bankruptcy cases.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">In a particularly striking example, the diocese of San Diego listed the value of a whole city block in downtown San Diego at $40,000, the price at which it had been acquired in the 1940s, rather than trying to estimate the current market value, as required. Worse, it altered the forms in which assets had to be listed. The judge in the case, Louise Adler, was so vexed by this and other shenanigans on the part of the diocese that she ordered a special investigation into church finances which was led by Todd Neilson, a former FBI agent and renowned forensic accountant. The diocese ended up settling its sexual-abuse cases for almost $200m. If it had not done so, the bankruptcy would have been thrown out of court and the bishop and chancellor of the diocese and its lawyers might have faced contempt charges.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">Some assets are not listed at all. In a corporate bankruptcy, if insurance is relevant to the reason for the company’s failure then its insurance policy has to be listed as an asset. Not so those of the Catholic Mutual Group (CMG), which stepped up its help for Catholic dioceses in the mid-1980s—a time when liability insurance became too expensive as a result of the increase in sexual-abuse claims. Since the CMG is technically not an insurance company but a voluntary religious “mutual benefit society”, its policies do not have to be disclosed as assets in a bankruptcy proceeding, even though it contributes substantial funds towards settlements.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">One way to reduce costs is to reduce the number of parishes. There are two ways to do this. The first is to merge one parish with another parish and combine their buildings, congregations and finances. The second, more controversial way is to “suppress” the parish, which involves the transfer of all of the assets to the bishop, who reassigns parish priests as he sees fit. The funds in the parish bank accounts are placed in the general treasury of the diocese, as are the proceeds of land sales, none of which is subject to disclosure. Faced with shortfalls in Boston (where he was a temporary administrator) and later in Cleveland, Bishop Richard Lennon suppressed dozens of parishes as part of reorganisation plans for each of the two archdioceses; given the pervasive commingling of accounts, some of the money thus accumulated could have gone to pay operating expenses and, at least in Boston, court settlements.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">The parishioners were unimpressed. Some heckled the bishop when he visited their parish to celebrate mass. One of the Boston parishes, St Frances Cabrini in Scituate, Massachusetts, has been occupied for the past eight years by parishioners who have refused to accept its closure. They have a roster chart to ensure at least one person is at the church at any time, so that the archdiocese can’t change the locks. Some parishes have filed appeals to Rome. In an unusual move in March, the Vatican reversed the closing of 13 of the parishes that Bishop Lennon had suppressed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">As well as questionable financial management, the church also suffers from fraud and embezzlement, according to Jason Berry, an expert in Catholic finance and author of “Render Unto Rome: The Secret Life of Money in the Catholic Church”. In March the former chief financial officer of the archdiocese of Philadelphia was arrested and charged with embezzling more than $900,000 between 2005 and 2011. Hundreds of priests have been disciplined for taking more than a little “walking around money” from the collection basket.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">In the corporate world, those who witnessed such malfeasance might alert a higher authority. But priests make unlikely whistle-blowers. It is often hard for them to imagine a life outside holy orders, which could be their fate if they alienated the bishop who has a hold over their salary, pension and private life. Would-be whistle-blowers will also be aware that local and federal authorities are loth to investigate mainstream religious groups for fear of the political consequences. Assistant United States attorneys in two different federal districts have pushed the FBI to investigate concealment, coercion and financial mismanagement in parts of the church but have got nowhere.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 1em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The taxpayer as good Samaritan</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">Growing financial pressures have encouraged the church to replace donations from the faithful with debt. According to figures from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board over the past decade, state and local authorities have issued municipal bonds for the benefit of at least 50 dioceses in almost 30 states to pay for the expansion and renovation of facilities that would previously have been largely paid for through donations. Overall church muni debt has increased by an estimated 80% over that period. At least 736 bond issues are currently outstanding.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">California is the biggest borrower. Although funding for religious groups is prohibited under the state’s constitution, a series of court rulings has opened the door to bond issues. Catholic groups there have raised at least $12 billion through muni bonds over the past decade. Of that, some $9 billion went to hospitals. In one case, in San Jose, the money went to buy chancery offices for the bishop.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">The dioceses back their bonds with letters of credit from banks. Among the most active guarantors are Allied Irish Banks (AIB), US Bancorp and Wells Fargo. None of the banks was prepared to discuss the financial terms of these contracts.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">Muni bonds are generally tax-free for investors, so the cost of borrowing is lower than it would be for a taxable investment. In other words, the church enjoys a subsidy more commonly associated with local governments and public-sector projects. If the church has issued more debt in part to meet the financial strains caused by the scandals, then the American taxpayer has indirectly helped mitigate the church’s losses from its settlements. Taxpayers may end up on the hook for other costs, too. For example, settlement of the hundreds of possible abuse cases in New York might cause the closure of Catholic schools across the city.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;"> </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">It is not wrong for churches to issue bonds. But, like many other aspects of the Catholic church’s finances, this should be more transparent. It is quite possible that church finances are, taken as a whole, not as bad as the details coming out in bankruptcy cases suggest. Dioceses and religious orders that go bankrupt cannot be assumed to be representative. If so, then showing better management in the rest of the church would do a lot to allay concern. And increased openness might have the added benefit of bringing in the acumen of a knowledgeable and concerned laity.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline;">Some influential Catholics are keen to see better management and more openness and accountability. Leon Panetta, America’s defence secretary, called for outside oversight of church finances when he was a director of the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management, a position he relinquished in 2009 to become director of the CIA. Faced with competition from other churches and disgrace from the behaviour of some of its priests, there has never been a more important time to listen to such calls, and to invite in the help and scrutiny that the church’s finances seem so clearly to need.</p>

Yet even taking these virtues into account, the finances of the Catholic church in America are an unholy mess. The sins involved in its book-keeping are not as vivid or grotesque as those on display in the various sexual-abuse cases that have cost the American church more than $3 billion so far; but the financial mismanagement and questionable business practices would have seen widespread resignations at the top of any other public institution.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; line-height: 20px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; border: 0px;">The sexual-abuse scandals of the past 20 years have brought shame to the church around the world. In America they have also brought financial strains. By studying court documents in bankruptcy cases, examining public records, requesting documents from local, state and federal governments, as well as talking to priests and bishops confidentially, <em style="font-size: 13px; margin: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; border: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Economist</em> has sought to quantify the damage.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; line-height: 20px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; border: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; line-height: 20px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; border: 0px;">The picture that emerges is not flattering. The church’s finances look poorly co-ordinated considering (or perhaps because of) their complexity. The management of money is often sloppy. And some parts of the church have indulged in ungainly financial contortions in some cases—it is alleged—both to divert funds away from uses intended by donors and to frustrate creditors with legitimate claims, including its own nuns and priests. The dioceses that have filed for bankruptcy may not be typical of the church as a whole. But given the overall lack of openness there is no way of knowing to what extent they are outliers.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; line-height: 20px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; border: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">The retirement funds for Wilmington, Delaware, were largely lost when it settled sex-abuse claims for $77m in February 2011. Those funds had been tossed into a pooled investment account that also contained parish investments and funds for cemeteries and the education of seminarians. The Eastern United States province of the Passionists, a missionary order, has diverted retirement funds to cover operating expenses. In a bid to stave off bankruptcy it has sold off property, including a 14-acre piece of New York waterfront, and made an unorthodox investment in a Broadway show, “Leap of Faith”. It flopped.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">In a public company, this type of thing would attract regulatory scrutiny. In the church, retirement is still largely in the gift of the bishop. Retirement plans for priests are typically set up as diocesan trusts rather than proper pension funds with structured benefits. They do not fall under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the law that establishes standards for plan trustees and remedies for beneficiaries, including access to federal courts. Priests thus have no recourse to law if they are hard done by. Nor, as a matter of course, can they take their pensions with them if they leave for another diocese.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">Richard Vega, who recently stepped down as president of the National Federation of Priests’ Councils, estimates that 75-80% of clergy pension schemes in America are underfunded. He says that only a small minority of priests will have set aside enough of their net average salary of $25,000 a year to cover themselves. Others will be less fortunate.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;"><strong style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; border: 0px; padding: 0px;">The clergy and its creditors</strong></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">The principle of separation between church and state in America means that religious groups are not required to file tax returns, list their assets or disclose basic facts about their finances. Some dioceses do publish accounts, but these tend to provide an incomplete picture. Though lawyers for dioceses facing bankruptcy have fought to keep most financially sensitive documents sealed, the process has forced the church to let in unaccustomed light.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">The documents that have been disclosed reveal that some bishops in the bankrupt dioceses presented the diocesan funds of parishes, schools, hospitals and retirement accounts as separate when they were really simply book-keeping entries in the same pooled investment account. The diocese of San Diego, for instance, reported to the bankruptcy court that it had over 500 accounts. But these were merely entries in a “Parish, School Diocese Loan Trust Account”, maintained in a single bank account at Union Bank of California.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">Such pooling saves on administrative costs and allows dioceses to use a surplus in one area to cover shortfalls in another, often a legitimate course of action. But it has presented problems when it comes to working out which assets belong to whom in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">The vast majority of parishes that commingled their funds with those dioceses now in bankruptcy lost all their investments. In some cases they were misled into believing that the money would be kept separate from the main diocesan funds, and thus safe in the event of bankruptcy. The judge in the Wilmington bankruptcy, Christopher Sontchi, said parishes that had suffered this fate had grounds to sue the diocese for breach of fiduciary duty. None has—but that is hardly surprising, given that the bishop and the chancellor of the diocese sit on the five-member board of trustees of each parish.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">Some parishes were more careful than others in ensuring their funds were handled properly. According to a document in <em style="font-size: 13px; margin: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; border: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Economist</em>’s possession, a parish priest in Wilmington wrote to the diocese: “Find enclosed a cheque for $1,000,000 to be invested in [the parish of] St Thomas’s name in the diocesan account. It is my understanding that if the need arises, this is and always will be available for parish use. If this is not the case, please return it and I will put it under my mattress for safe keeping.” The diocese cashed the cheque, apparently depositing it in a general cash account. The parish lost the money when the diocese struck a sexual-abuse settlement. By contrast St Ann’s parish, also in the Wilmington diocese, wired its deposits directly into a segregated investment account at Mellon Bank rather than to the diocesan cash account at Citizen’s Bank. Its trustees also insisted on drafting a special agreement stipulating that funds provided to the diocese were held in trust.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">Plaintiffs’ lawyers have raised questions about financial transfers in dioceses threatened with bankruptcy. These tend to go the other way—moving money out of diocesan accounts and into parish accounts, trusts of various sorts and any other receptacle at hand. According to an independent report commissioned by a bankruptcy judge, at one point priests in San Diego were taking cash out of accounts and putting it in safes in the rectories because they wanted to keep it out of reach of plaintiffs. Nobody becomes a priest, monk or nun in order to spend their professional life as a financial manager, so no doubt part of this money shuffling is down to innocent incompetence. But the church does shift between considering all assets as part of a single pool when that suits, and claiming that funds have always been separate and ring-fenced when they are exposed to claims.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">Creditors in the Milwaukee bankruptcy case, which is still in progress, have questioned the motives behind a $35m transfer to a trust and a $55.6m transfer from archdiocese coffers to a fund for cemeteries. Cardinal Dolan, who was Archbishop of Milwaukee at the time, authorised both transactions. The creditors think the movement of such large amounts had more to do with shielding cash from sexual-abuse victims than with the maintenance of graves, calling the manoeuvre fraudulent. Cardinal Dolan’s office responded to questions about these allegations by pointing to blog posts in which he described them as “baloney” and defended the transfers as “virtuous, open and in accord with the clear directives of the professionals on our finance council and outside auditors”.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">As “debtors in possession”—entities that have filed for bankruptcy yet retain their assets—bust dioceses have an obligation to enlarge their assets to satisfy their creditors. On the contrary, “we have seen a consistent tactic of Catholic bishops to shrink the size of their assets, which is not only wrong morally but in violation of state and federal law,” says Ken Brown of Pachulski Stang, a California law firm that has represented creditors in eight of the ten Catholic bankruptcy cases.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">In a particularly striking example, the diocese of San Diego listed the value of a whole city block in downtown San Diego at $40,000, the price at which it had been acquired in the 1940s, rather than trying to estimate the current market value, as required. Worse, it altered the forms in which assets had to be listed. The judge in the case, Louise Adler, was so vexed by this and other shenanigans on the part of the diocese that she ordered a special investigation into church finances which was led by Todd Neilson, a former FBI agent and renowned forensic accountant. The diocese ended up settling its sexual-abuse cases for almost $200m. If it had not done so, the bankruptcy would have been thrown out of court and the bishop and chancellor of the diocese and its lawyers might have faced contempt charges.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">Some assets are not listed at all. In a corporate bankruptcy, if insurance is relevant to the reason for the company’s failure then its insurance policy has to be listed as an asset. Not so those of the Catholic Mutual Group (CMG), which stepped up its help for Catholic dioceses in the mid-1980s—a time when liability insurance became too expensive as a result of the increase in sexual-abuse claims. Since the CMG is technically not an insurance company but a voluntary religious “mutual benefit society”, its policies do not have to be disclosed as assets in a bankruptcy proceeding, even though it contributes substantial funds towards settlements.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">One way to reduce costs is to reduce the number of parishes. There are two ways to do this. The first is to merge one parish with another parish and combine their buildings, congregations and finances. The second, more controversial way is to “suppress” the parish, which involves the transfer of all of the assets to the bishop, who reassigns parish priests as he sees fit. The funds in the parish bank accounts are placed in the general treasury of the diocese, as are the proceeds of land sales, none of which is subject to disclosure. Faced with shortfalls in Boston (where he was a temporary administrator) and later in Cleveland, Bishop Richard Lennon suppressed dozens of parishes as part of reorganisation plans for each of the two archdioceses; given the pervasive commingling of accounts, some of the money thus accumulated could have gone to pay operating expenses and, at least in Boston, court settlements.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">The parishioners were unimpressed. Some heckled the bishop when he visited their parish to celebrate mass. One of the Boston parishes, St Frances Cabrini in Scituate, Massachusetts, has been occupied for the past eight years by parishioners who have refused to accept its closure. They have a roster chart to ensure at least one person is at the church at any time, so that the archdiocese can’t change the locks. Some parishes have filed appeals to Rome. In an unusual move in March, the Vatican reversed the closing of 13 of the parishes that Bishop Lennon had suppressed.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">As well as questionable financial management, the church also suffers from fraud and embezzlement, according to Jason Berry, an expert in Catholic finance and author of “Render Unto Rome: The Secret Life of Money in the Catholic Church”. In March the former chief financial officer of the archdiocese of Philadelphia was arrested and charged with embezzling more than $900,000 between 2005 and 2011. Hundreds of priests have been disciplined for taking more than a little “walking around money” from the collection basket.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">In the corporate world, those who witnessed such malfeasance might alert a higher authority. But priests make unlikely whistle-blowers. It is often hard for them to imagine a life outside holy orders, which could be their fate if they alienated the bishop who has a hold over their salary, pension and private life. Would-be whistle-blowers will also be aware that local and federal authorities are loth to investigate mainstream religious groups for fear of the political consequences. Assistant United States attorneys in two different federal districts have pushed the FBI to investigate concealment, coercion and financial mismanagement in parts of the church but have got nowhere.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;"><strong style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; border: 0px; padding: 0px;">The taxpayer as good Samaritan</strong></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">Growing financial pressures have encouraged the church to replace donations from the faithful with debt. According to figures from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board over the past decade, state and local authorities have issued municipal bonds for the benefit of at least 50 dioceses in almost 30 states to pay for the expansion and renovation of facilities that would previously have been largely paid for through donations. Overall church muni debt has increased by an estimated 80% over that period. At least 736 bond issues are currently outstanding.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">California is the biggest borrower. Although funding for religious groups is prohibited under the state’s constitution, a series of court rulings has opened the door to bond issues. Catholic groups there have raised at least $12 billion through muni bonds over the past decade. Of that, some $9 billion went to hospitals. In one case, in San Jose, the money went to buy chancery offices for the bishop.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">The dioceses back their bonds with letters of credit from banks. Among the most active guarantors are Allied Irish Banks (AIB), US Bancorp and Wells Fargo. None of the banks was prepared to discuss the financial terms of these contracts.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">Muni bonds are generally tax-free for investors, so the cost of borrowing is lower than it would be for a taxable investment. In other words, the church enjoys a subsidy more commonly associated with local governments and public-sector projects. If the church has issued more debt in part to meet the financial strains caused by the scandals, then the American taxpayer has indirectly helped mitigate the church’s losses from its settlements. Taxpayers may end up on the hook for other costs, too. For example, settlement of the hundreds of possible abuse cases in New York might cause the closure of Catholic schools across the city.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;"> </p>
              <div style="clear: both; font-size: 10px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: normal; padding-top: 5px; border: 0px;"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; padding: 0px;" src="http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20120818_FBP004_0.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="335"><span style="color: #000000;">Manhattan’s largest landowner</span></div>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">It is not wrong for churches to issue bonds. But, like many other aspects of the Catholic church’s finances, this should be more transparent. It is quite possible that church finances are, taken as a whole, not as bad as the details coming out in bankruptcy cases suggest. Dioceses and religious orders that go bankrupt cannot be assumed to be representative. If so, then showing better management in the rest of the church would do a lot to allay concern. And increased openness might have the added benefit of bringing in the acumen of a knowledgeable and concerned laity.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">Some influential Catholics are keen to see better management and more openness and accountability. Leon Panetta, America’s defence secretary, called for outside oversight of church finances when he was a director of the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management, a position he relinquished in 2009 to become director of the CIA. Faced with competition from other churches and disgrace from the behaviour of some of its priests, there has never been a more important time to listen to such calls, and to invite in the help and scrutiny that the church’s finances seem so clearly to need.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px;">NOTE: For more detail on how we calculated the annual income and spending for the Catholic church in America see <a style="font-size: 13px; margin: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #08526d; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: underline; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2012/08/catholic-church-america">here</a>.</p>
