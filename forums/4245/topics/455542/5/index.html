              <p><br>Really? What was he explaining? His tact is to give ambiguous comments and then tries to play fallacy detective with a listing of fallacies on one hand and a dictionary on the other. It's a good trick though, he doesn't have to reveal much about his beliefs since he usually gives iffy and non-committal replies and yet gets to take shots at his opponent's arguments by showing off his logical "skills" of flagging fallacies he thinks he has spotted. Nevermind that he doesn't really know his fallacies or definitions.</p>

              <p>Maybe I was confusing you by saying "the Bible"... When actually, more of the OT. Then again, the Gospels and Revelations are NT books that contain symbols toos.</p>
              <p>NT epistles are much more open and explains things more directly. Hebrews was one such book to the Jews that explains the priest, the priesthood, Melchizedek, etc.</p>
              <p>And yes, you are right - Jesus is the thread that runs through it.</p>

              <p>I don't care if it was written by a group 
                      called "The Most Holy holy of the holy God-est God" evangelism group or 
                      if the guy has a phd in theological studies. It means nothing. It must 
                      pass certain tests as the scripture says.</p>
              <p>"If it was written by a recognized apostle or prophet, its place in the canon is secured".</p>
              <p>&gt;
                       I'd take steps even further than that. It's not a deciding factor. 
                      Otherwise Paul's writings are disqualified since he's not the original 
                      11 (12 minus Judas). Also the "Gospel of Peter" (a recognized apostle) 
                      should be deemed canon according to this principle, which is not. And if
                       you find an online version of it and read it, you will know why.</p>
              <p>Which goes back to this (which is 100% related to what I just wrote), why can't someone answer broinchrist's question?</p>
              <p>"A miracle is an act of God to confirm the word of God given through a prophet of God to the people of God"</p>
              <p>&gt;
                       WRONG. Signs and wonders don't always mean they of God 100%... and also depends on what type of miracles. Jesus spoke about them. Why do you think Jesus told His disciples to tell John that blind eyes are opened and the lame walk? "Miracles" (aka signs) can be conjured by 
                      sources that are not of God. Broinchrist will 100% agree with me with 
                      supporting scriptures. End-time teachings also reveal this.</p>
              <p>"The Witness of the Holy Spirit"</p>
              <p>&gt; What
                       should the Holy Spirit bear witness to? The Holy Spirit bears witness 
                      to the truth. What is the truth? Jesus spoke concerning the Holy Spirit 
                      and says specifically what the Holy Spirit is suppose to draw attention 
                      to - Himself.</p>
              <p>I'll tell you one thing. Hit Ctrl + F and type 
                      "Jesus" into this article and you find nothing in there that talks about
                       how Scriptures should point to Jesus and the Truth, which is the SOLE 
                      purpose of scripture. The Word made flesh.</p>
              <p>I am more likely to conclude that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aneslayer should be viewed with utmost suspicion</span> by posing as a "Christian". Not everyone who quotes Bible verses are of
                       God. For Satan tempted Jesus with Bible verses, and also poses as an 
                      angel of light.</p>
              <p>I told you already broinchrist, the enemy and any 
                      spirit not of God will hate and NEVER mention anything about Jesus and 
                      His finished work. No spirit can and will talk about His purpose and 
                      coming. All scriptures testify of Jesus' redemptive work, that is the 
                      Gospel and the whole point of it all - The forgiveness of sins.</p>
              <p>Too suspicious. No? What do you think, broinchrist?</p>

              <p>Bro Joe, while I share your reservations about Aneslayer's recent "revelation" of being a Christian I do not share your reservations about the weblink that he gave.</p>
              <p>Norman Geisler is a noted Christian apologist, one whom I have much respect for and have a lot of his books, though regrettably he espouses the old earth view. This article on Bible canon must be seen on its own context, it is simply a teaching on this topic. I have no problem with this article as it is, my problem was more with Aneslayer's motive for providing this link, what's his point? Of course you would have known by now that he did not bother to elaborate at all. Methinks he likes to set "fallacy traps" to showcase his "mastery" of formal and informal fallacies.</p>
