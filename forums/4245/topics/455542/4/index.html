              <p>You said that the Universe could not come from nothing. Then
              where did God come from? If you assert that God does not require
              creation, then it is logical to say that the Universe does not need

              <p>I also noticed that you are trying to stick all your opinions
              into everyone by saying that the others are wrong, and that you are
              the only correct one, even to the extent of insulting other
              Christians. Well, Christians have many different branches, and
              Christianity itself is only a branch of the world's major religions
              (there are lots more uncommon religions out there).</p>

              No, you are wrong. It is no longer defensible to say that the universe does not need a cause. The conclusion of science is that the universe has a beginning, which is what the Bible tells us at the very first verse of the book. Moreover, the question is what is the cause of the universe, so you should not evade the question by asking what is the cause of God.
              
              <p>How have I insulted fellow believers? Who are you referring to? Also I do not claim to be infallible or inerrant so I think your accusation about me thinking I am always right is wrong. But surely it is not wrong to believe that one can be right on many things while explaining where and why the opponents are wrong, right?

              <p>There's no way to prove that the big bang happened. Nobody was there to witness it.</p>
              <p>Man can only play detective and try to find evidences through science to try to piece it together. My friends say I'm complicated, but evidently not as complicated as other people - lol! - I never bothered to read up on the scientific reasoning process that lead to the conclusion of a big bang. The opposite is also true for God. How to prove it empirically? Man can also play "detective" and piece together testimonies and witnesses to supernatural workings of "God" origin.</p>
              <p>Shouldn't it be equally possible that the "first cause" should be given 50/50 in a truly fair case? Big bang is also biased towards making assumptions what. I think agnostics win this "argument for proof". You can neither claim either one - It's truly a clean slate.</p>
              <p>In order for something to be, there is a Creator. "NO!" says atheists.</p>
              <p>The Universe "simply was." Then why can't God, "simply was" too? There's no reason why the "first cause" (i.e. the beginning) wasn't a sentient being, rather than "a something,-but-I-don't-know-what"...What caused the big bang? Heat cannot exist in a vacuum, so there must be some kind of matter with mass in the beginning before the "big bang", so what is it?</p>

              If you still wanna play daft, then I will be pretty much done with you. You asked what Scriptures I referred to and I told you it is the 66 books of the Bible. Still got problem then just head down to the nearest Christian book shop and ask for the Bible that speaks about Jesus. What will be handed to you is that which I am referring to. Don't try to muddy waters here and throw red herrings by bringing in the canonising process. That is already a done deal a long time ago.

              I think we should not reject something we do not understand. God inhabits eternity and created time when He made the universe. This causation happened at the same time that time was created, if you catch the drift.

              <p>And so? I am saying that the Bible (both OT and NT) speaks of Christ. Again if I am speaking to a reasonable person he would have no problem knowing what I meant by the Bible that speaks of Christ. You are just playing games and playing daft.</p>
              <p>Brother Joe, you here with me on this?</p>

              <p>What ever happened to "... ask and it would be given..."? You are giving a book store when all I ask for is the books in your referenced bible... 3x politely somemore... <br>But I shall forgive you.</p>

              <p>Don't abuse the Scripture. "Ask and it shall be given" was referring to prayers and petitions to God.</p>
              <p>I have already told you that I referred to the 66 books of the Bible, 39 OT and 27 NT. If you still cannot get it, then shouldn't you be heading for the stores? You weren't being polite, you were playing daft.</p>
