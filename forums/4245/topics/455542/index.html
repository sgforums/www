              <p>If I may refine it further, the issue is that the universe must have a cause because it has a beginning. The Big Bang is a theory to explain the phenomena of the expansion of the universe from a singularity event in the distant past. But this initial singularity event itself begs a cause, because "bangs" don't just happen without a cause.</p>
              <p>The argument then is that either God made the universe, or the universe made itself, or nothing made the universe. I think the last two options are not very attractive at all. But perhaps someone might have another view to avoid the God alternative?</p>

              <p>One of the new ideas to avoid having to deal with a divine cause for the universe is to invoke the idea of multiverses which some have claimed to have mathematical and theoretical support. In other words, there are millions or perhaps billions of universes out there and our universe just happened to be the lucky one to contain life. The analogy usually given is that of the lottery, that even though it is highly improbable someone will win the lottery.</p>
              <p>But then here's where I think the double standard comes into play. Atheists would argue that even though it is so improbable yet it must have been so that it happened at least once, since our universe exists, otherwise we won't be here to talk about it. Yet they would deny that similar argument for God, saying that God is so improbable that therefore He does not exist. So on one hand the improbable multiverse scenario means it happened, but the improbable God scenario means no God.</p>

              <p>Well, it's not about the size. To them, there is no God to speak of. He cannot exists because nature is all there is. His existence is entirely unnecessary because only naturalistic answers are allowed, even if it such answers do not make sense.</p>
              <p>As evolutionist Richard Lewontin said. "<strong>We take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs</strong>, <em>in spite</em> of its failure to fulfill many of its extravagant promises of health and life, <em>in spite</em> of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just-so stories, <strong>because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism</strong>. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our <em>a priori</em> adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, <strong>that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door</strong>."</p>

              <p><br>You forgot that before there was time to speak of, God dwells in eternity. You don't speak of time in timeless eternity.

              Yeah right, nothing caused everything. Sounds just about right! Duh.
              
              <p>It seems then that for the atheist it all boils down to nothing. No wonder Dawkins said that there is no purpose or meaning in life but pitiless indifference. Makes me wonder why atheists bother to get up and do anything at all. It only shows that atheism is a false worldview that even the atheist does not live by.

              <p>How the universe works is something that scientists do. But you are confusing it with the issue of what or who caused the universe to exist.</p>
              <p>How the universe come about is a really a HISTORICAL question, not a scientific one.</p>
