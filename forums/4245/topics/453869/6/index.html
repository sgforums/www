              <p>Do you know what is an illogical and incoherent comment? It is the kind of comments and claims that you make that say "the universe is caused by nothing". Duh...</p>
              <p>For you to accuse me of "could not and will not" provide evidences for the existence of God is to make yourself a blatant liar. I have provided arguments and evidences and even book references to show that the weight of the evidence points to there being a God. You, however, have provided NONE.</p>
              <p>I know you have no proof that God does not exist, which is why it all boils down to belief, not reason and certainly not science. If you say you do not believe in God, well and fine. But do not confuse your not believing in God with saying there is no God. A statement of belief is not the same as a statement of claim. As long as you keep to saying that you BELIEVE there is not God then that's just it, a statement of belief and faith. I won't quibble with that at all. </p>

              <p>It is still a lack of belief, a lack. So to be consistent, if
                  lacking a belief means no burden of proof for the atheist then it
                  equally applies to here as well. It has nothing to do with negative
                  or positive claim. A belief is a belief, a claim is a claim. If you
                  claim there is no God then you have a burden of proof on your
                  shoulders.</p>

              <p>Please don't abuse the definition of atheism.</p>
              <p>Christians are not calling everyone outside of Christianity an atheist. At least I don't. But I did say before that I aim my arguments mainly against atheism simply because nonbelievers who are not atheists basically use the SAME kind of arguments that atheists use to justify their rejection of Christianity. So demolishing atheism serves the purposes of one stone kill two birds.</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">A defends P</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">B uses the same tactic as P</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">A blasts B for using P</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Where A is you, P refers to the atheist's using "lack of belief" tactic to negate burden of proof. This is obvious double standards, if not downright hypocritical. And worst is that you can still give that maniacal laugh for acting the hypocrite."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Do you even read? The 2nd "you too" is commited right after you call my hypocrisy(yet to be proven) and dismiss my point.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">The 1st tu quoque was slightly more complicated....</p>
              <dd style="line-height: 19px; margin-left: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.1em; color: #000000; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><em>A</em> makes claim <em>P</em>.</dd><dd style="line-height: 19px; margin-left: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.1em; color: #000000; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><em>A</em> has <em>also</em> made past claims which are inconsistent with <em>P</em>.</dd><dd style="line-height: 19px; margin-left: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.1em; color: #000000; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Therefore, <em>P</em> is false.</dd><dd style="line-height: 19px; margin-left: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.1em; color: #000000; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br></dd>
              <p> A= Jacky. P = burden of prove lies on the one making claim. You said "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">Define what you mean by prove. Chances are, you do not even know the kind of proofs there are and whether the proofs demanded are reasonable." </span>refering to his past inconsistencies to conclude P is false. Took up a double negative position to assimilate a lack of belief and use your conclusion, P is false, to refuse fulfilling the burden of prove.</p>
              <p>Both cases were tu quoques even if you don't understand. If you don't by now... try harder.</p>
              <p> "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">The atheists presented NOTHING because they already disclaim any burden of proof by using the lame "lack of belief" tactic. Of course I never accepted the lame "lack of belief" tactic as valid. But since you obviously did, I was using that same tactic against you. In the Bible this tactic is called "Answering the fool according to his folly" so that you can see the foolishness of your own view. But sad to say, you cannot even see the foolishness of this view. It's worst than I thought."</span></p>
              <p>Appeal to ridicule... appeal to authority (wow bible)... They did present a couple of evidences of lack if you can recall properly... No doubt its in these forums somewhere...</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You are shifting goal posts again by not responding to my point about it being ad hominem to take issue with the way I argue my case. No point flashing fallacy cards when you don't even know how to use the cards or know what they mean."</span></p>
              <p>I'm shifting the priority if thats what you mean. Look, I lay it down openly so that you see. You are accusing without basis... ranting "no you" does not help your position. Argue sensibly please.</p>

              <p>But wait, as an admitted hardcore atheist, do you sincerely and honestly believe that there can be evidence for the existence of God? If so, what form or kinds of evidence is deem reasonable and acceptable?</p>
              <p>After you have thought through it, if you still want the evidences, see <a href="http://www.creation.com/">www.creation.com</a></p>
              <p>Then you must laugh at your fellow atheists who define atheism as "lack of belief" to avoid the burden of proof. If you say you cannot prove the non-existence of God, then atheists should not make bold claims that God does not exist. Just say that you BELIEVE there is no God. Atheists have faith too, but of course they would deny it with all their might.</p>
              <p>Theists are not saying God exists because atheists failed to prove their atheism (though that's true also), but have offered many lines of evidences to show that the most reasonable conclusion is that God exists. I'm sure you must have read some of these.</p>
              <p>If an eyewitness has been shown to be reliable, can you say we cannot admit his testimony as evidence? Good news for you, the Bible has been shown to be reliable in many aspects.</p>
              <p>Lastly, atheism IS a religion. <a href="http://creation.com/atheism-a-religion">http://creation.com/atheism-a-religion</a> This has even gone up to the courts in the States and the court has ruled that it is a religion. As a worldview atheism is not just about what is being denied, but also what is being believed in terms of other areas as well.</p>
              <p>Your various analogies FAIL for obvious reasons which maybe you failed to see. Not collecting stamps is not the same as saying stamps do not exist or that hobbies do not exist. Your hobby could be different. The atheist may not believe that God exists, but the atheist believes that nature is all there is, which is a metaphyiscal claim about reality. Carl Sagan had a religious saying that goes like "The cosmos is all there is, and all that ever was" Does the atheist have proof that matter is all there is? Saying no scientific evidence means no God is just like saying what your net don't catch ain't fish. </p>

              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I NEVER said that it is false to say that the one making a claim has the burden of proof. Darn, I even said that the atheist claims there is no God and thus has a burden of proof! You obviously did not read that. So you are misrepresenting my views. An apology would suffice here?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br></span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Let's do a brief recap. Jacky said I have the burden of proof. Now, not only am I saying that Jacky has really no idea what kind of proofs we should be talking about, I also used the atheist's lame tactic of "lack of belief" against him to disclaim any burden of proof. And you valiantly but blindly went to Jacky's defense because you saw Jacky in trouble and raised the fallacy card. EXCEPT that there was NO fallacy committed, except what you wished to see. You basically and utterly failed to see what I was trying to do. And even after explaining to you also you failed to understand. Trying too hard to spot fallacies or just stiff-necked stubbornness?</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"</span></p>
              <p>The context was Jacky calling for prove for God and Satan. You implied him being unreasonable to ask for prove. I intervened and you adopted the double negative position saying"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Anyway, I can simply redefine theism simply as a lack belief in the non-existence of God. So what burden of proof are you talking about? Duh..."</span> referrencing to Jack's past shifting the burden of prove. Also you said"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">But since my claim is that theism is a lack of belief in the non-existence of God, then what burden of proof you talking about?"</span> I did not interprete wrongly. No apology dispensed.</p>

              <p>Fits tu quoque's definition like a T. Unless you are just prejudiced against Jack as a person and not addressing to his arguments. BTW I'm not defending him but pointing out fallacies in arguments is my calling. </p>

              <p>The evidences/ observations they have do not point to/ conclude any existence of god/s. That is the evidence of lack. You can repeat how you corrected me a millions times and expose your good self being butthurt and hold on to prejudice. I forgive you.</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">///But wait, as an admitted hardcore atheist, do you sincerely and honestly believe that there can be evidence for the existence of God? If so, what form or kinds of evidence is deem reasonable and acceptable?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">After you have thought through it, if you still want the evidences, see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creation.com/">www.creation.com</a></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Then you must laugh at your fellow atheists who define atheism as "lack of belief" to avoid the burden of proof. If you say you cannot prove the non-existence of God, then atheists should not make bold claims that God does not exist. Just say that you BELIEVE there is no God. Atheists have faith too, but of course they would deny it with all their might.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Theists are not saying God exists because atheists failed to prove their atheism (though that's true also), but have offered many lines of evidences to show that the most reasonable conclusion is that God exists. I'm sure you must have read some of these.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">If an eyewitness has been shown to be reliable, can you say we cannot admit his testimony as evidence? Good news for you, the Bible has been shown to be reliable in many aspects.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Lastly, atheism IS a religion. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://creation.com/atheism-a-religion">http://creation.com/atheism-a-religion</a> This has even gone up to the courts in the States and the court has ruled that it is a religion. As a worldview atheism is not just about what is being denied, but also what is being believed in terms of other areas as well.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Your various analogies FAIL for obvious reasons which maybe you failed to see. Not collecting stamps is not the same as saying stamps do not exist or that hobbies do not exist. Your hobby could be different. The atheist may not believe that God exists, but the atheist believes that nature is all there is, which is a metaphyiscal claim about reality. Carl Sagan had a religious saying that goes like "The cosmos is all there is, and all that ever was" Does the atheist have proof that matter is all there is? Saying no scientific evidence means no God is just like saying what your net don't catch ain't fish. ///</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">The Bible is real because the Bible said so, therefore the Bible is real &lt;-- circular reasoning.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Again, you provide no empirical proof, whether it be archaeological or not. Simply by using a Bible, you are not convincing me. I can easily use the Torah, the Quran, or any Buddhist mantras, not to mention a book that says it real because it said so. This is your logic, which is a flaw. We already have dinosaur fossils, and lots of geological and archaeological of the Earth being far much older than just 6000 years. There are also stars that we see from the naked eyes that requires lightyears for the light to reflect back, thus seeing it. The lightyears are a lot lot longer than just 6000 years. We have</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> -</span></p>

              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">And you believe all these to be false? No offence, but so far you have not found any evidence to disprove these datings, except quoting from a 'holy book'.</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">Also, do you actually realise you get your sources from biased pages? Creation.com? Really? You are using a website that supports a being that has not been existing yet.</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">I have also never said that God does not exist, I merely do not believe in God. Sure, I can't 100% bet that a creator does not exist, but by definition, which god? Allah? Zeus? Thor? Yahweh? Quetzacoatl? Izanagi?</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">I am an agnostic atheist, and I consider myself hardcore since I do not consider the existence of a god (much less the one you worship), plausible.</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">You said that just because something has no proof to back it up does not mean it does not exist, which is 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' in short. However, this goes two ways - just because something has not been disproved yet does not mean that it is any more credible. Don't be biased. Atheists and theists have so far not been able to provide actual, foolproof that a god exists or don't exist. I am not going to use Pascal's Wager to actually believe in a god just because no evidence has been found for either side. Pascal's Wager is a fallacy - it only applies if there is one religion in the world.</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">You have also not shown how a book can be reliable. An eyewitness can give false claims. Seriously, do you need me to point out the logical contradictions or the moralistic ones in the Bible?</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">Last but not least, many of the points you pointed out that atheism was a religion was in fact, incorrect. Atheism has nothing to do with science - even an unscientific person can be an atheist. Also, Confucianism and Taoism is a philosophy, not a religion. </p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">The first part of the page said about narratives. Evolution is not an explanation of how everything came from - by saying that this goes to show how ignorant the person who made the page is. The Theory of Evolution is not a gospel to atheists, its only something we refer to. We don't see it as a holy book where we follow ten commandments. </p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">The second part deals with experiential points. Again, invalid. Meaning is life is subjective - nuff said.</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">The third part talks about social - again, another fallacy. There is no power structure, no hierachy. Evolution is not a belief - it's already a fact. Also, communism has NOTHING to do with atheism. This site already reeks of bias. Really? Atheists persecute theists? More like the other way round. I suppose you know that Islam punishes apotasy, or that ignorant Christians say inane things like, "You are going to hell?" Do you have proof of hell? Religion is being prosecuted. Right now, Christianity is the largest religion, and that it is being persecuted? Ridiculous. The site claims that evolution is a lie - proof?</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">The fourth part is self-explanatory. They do not believe and adhere - secular humanism is different from atheism, although it can be considered a branch out. The site also tries to pin blames of communism on religion - which is ironic. Hitler was a Catholic, and here are his exact words, </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The fourth part, which talks about ethical signs of atheism being a religion, is again another fallacy. The site states that an atheist<span style="color: #2d2d2d; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> s</span><a style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #6a9ebf; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" href="http://creation.com/rape-and-evolution">quirmed to justify why he agreed that rape is objectively wrong</a><span style="color: #2d2d2d; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> under his philosophy.</span></p>
              <p>Atheism has nothing to do with morals - it comes from oneself. Rape is wrong. Why? Because it goes against the will of the victim. Nuff said.</p>
              <p>The firth part is ridiculous also. Firstly, atheists celebrate birthdays, and also Christmas. I say that from personal experience, as well as knowing atheists friends from all over the world celebrate it. They celebrate it because it is a CULTURAL act, and they do not divine meaning from Christmas. To atheists, special occasions are seasons of joy. </p>
              <p>Last point is also pure ridiculous. Atheists obviously know that resources have to be conserved, not because of survival of the fittest. By conserving and trying to save the Earth, it is known as adaptibilty or love (or both). The first point shows that this is the true form of survival of the fittest, humans adapted, therefore they could survived. The second point is that, Earth is our planet. Without it, we will die. The second part shown by the site is also riduculous. Nature isn't sacred according to atheists - this is pantheism.</p>
              <p>The site you have given me reeks of propaganda, and it gives false information. Nuff said.</p>

              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">I NEVER said that it is false to say that the one making a claim has the burden of proof. Darn, I even said that the atheist claims there is no God and thus has a burden of proof! You obviously did not read that. So you are misrepresenting my views. An apology would suffice here?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"><br></span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Let's do a brief recap. Jacky said I have the burden of proof. Now, not only am I saying that Jacky has really no idea what kind of proofs we should be talking about, I also used the atheist's lame tactic of "lack of belief" against him to disclaim any burden of proof. And you valiantly but blindly went to Jacky's defense because you saw Jacky in trouble and raised the fallacy card. EXCEPT that there was NO fallacy committed, except what you wished to see. You basically and utterly failed to see what I was trying to do. And even after explaining to you also you failed to understand. Trying too hard to spot fallacies or just stiff-necked stubbornness?</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">"</span></p>
              <p>The context was Jacky calling for prove for God and Satan. You implied him being unreasonable to ask for prove. I intervened and you adopted the double negative position saying"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">Anyway, I can simply redefine theism simply as a lack belief in the non-existence of God. So what burden of proof are you talking about? Duh..."</span> referrencing to Jack's past shifting the burden of prove. Also you said"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">But since my claim is that theism is a lack of belief in the non-existence of God, then what burden of proof you talking about?"</span> I did not interprete wrongly. No apology dispensed.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Fits tu quoque's definition like a T. Unless you are just prejudiced against Jack as a person and not addressing to his arguments. BTW I'm not defending him but pointing out fallacies in arguments is my calling. </p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">What lack of evidences did the atheists produce? I know of none. Telling me it's hidden somewhere in the forums is unhelpful at all. I made my accusations with sufficient evidence. Remember the times I pointed out your ignorance of the Bible and creationism? I actually showed what you were ignorant about. No doubt it's in the forums somewhere.....":</span></p>
              <p>The evidences/ observations they have do not point to/ conclude any existence of god/s. That is the evidence of lack. You can repeat how you corrected me a millions times and expose your good self being butthurt and hold on to prejudice. I forgive you.</p>

              <p>Wrong again. Failure to read. I never implied that it was unreasonable to ask for proof. You were the one doing the implying, not me. I asked if he even knew what proofs are required, and whether the proofs demanded were reasonable. I am not saying that it is unreasonable to ask for proofs, but whether the proofs demanded were reasonable. You still don't get it? I later then used the "lack of belief" tactic to basically say that if the atheist can get away with giving proofs, so can I. And I believe the apology is still pending.</p>
              <p>As to lack of evidences, exactly what evidences do atheists have that point to or conclude the existence of God? They point to nothing and say that there is no evidence for God? Where are they looking and what are they looking at and with what are they looking at?</p>
