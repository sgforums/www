              <p>Fair enough, though it would been rather clear what I meant. I just wanted to be sure we are all on the same understanding. Bible critics like to say that the Bible was written by man to control the masses i.e. it is invented fiction, no real truth to it at all. But what Christians are saying is that while the Bible is written by men it is not a mere invention of men. It is a truthful record of God's dealings with man.</p>

              <p>The URL itself already tells a lot about the prejudice of the
              author than about the subject matter. It is then no wonder that it
              is more Bible bashing than intellectual arguments presented. The
              author exhibits a cavalier dismissive attitude
              and shows no interest in taking creationists
              seriously. Without casting pearls before swine I shall not
              waste too much time responding to such people who does not treat
              those with whom they disagree due respect and civility. Only a few
              points would suffice, and I don't suppose you are keen to defend
              anything on this website, nor do you ever intend to engage
              seriously. As I have shown in the earlier posts you have been wrong
              on the duration of the Flood already.</p>
              <p><em>A world wide flood would leave massive amounts of geological
              evidence behind; and it just doesn't exist.</em></p>
              <p>Indeed the Flood must have left evidence
              behind. Creationists say the evidence is there before us. Both
              creationists and evolutionists are looking at the same world, same
              geological features, but having a DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION on how
              it came to be so.</p>
              <p><em>Every ancient culture had its history and its mythology.
              When an ancient culture records stories about talking snakes, magic
              fruit, people living inside of giant fish, and gathering
              representative members of every species of animal and living on a
              boat for almost a year, one should automatically realize that they
              were recording their mythology and not their history.</em></p>
              <p>Which begs the question, why should anyone "automatically"
              realise that this is mythology and not history? The author is not
              even making an argument, just an assertion that he assumes must be
              true.</p>
              <p><em>The Great Pyramid of Cheops was built about 2589-2566 BC,
              about  230 years before the flood, yet it has no water marks
              on it. </em></p>
              <p>MOST creationists believe that the pyramids were built AFTER the
              Flood, not before (see <a href="http://creation.com/the-pyramids-of-ancient-egypt" rel="nofollow">http://creation.com/the-pyramids-of-ancient-egypt</a>).
              Of course you would then say the dates don't match up. Oh really?
              Then you should catch up with the view that the Egyptian
              chronology is in need of an overhaul (see <a href="http://creation.com/egyptian-history-and-the-biblical-record-a-perfect-match" rel="nofollow">http://creation.com/egyptian-history-and-the-biblical-record-a-perfect-match</a>).</p>
              <p>But I must also point out that there is at least
              one creationist David Larsen I read (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dinosaurs-Ark-David-Larsen/dp/1572585692" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Dinosaurs-Ark-David-Larsen/dp/1572585692</a>), who
              believe that the pyramids were pre-Flood and that
              there are water marks on it (see <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/the-great-pyramid-and-the-great-flood" rel="nofollow">http://www.examiner.com/article/the-great-pyramid-and-the-great-flood</a> and
              <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/277259-how-water-affects-land-formations-and-erosion" rel="nofollow">http://www.helium.com/items/277259-how-water-affects-land-formations-and-erosion</a>).
               </p>
              <p><em>Where did the water needed for the flood come from? 
              Where did it go?  The atmosphere only holds enough moisture to
              account for about an inch of water worldwide.  To cover
              even Mount Ararat, where Noah's Ark supposedly landed after the
              flood, in 40 days would require over 400 feet of water per
              day.  That's not 400 inches, but <strong>400 feet a
              day</strong>.  And Everest would require 725 feet per day -
              that's 30 feet of water per hour!  Some claim that the
              mountains didn't exist before the flood.  But even Bible
              speaks of great mountains in the time before the flood.  Were
              these great mountains mentioned in the Bible only a few feet
              high?</em></p>
              <p>The author, like most Bible critics, obviously did not read
              the Bible carefully. Why should mountains at that time be the SAME
              mountains we see today? Creationists believe that the present
              mountains were uplifted as the floodwaters receded. Also the
              main source of the water is from under the ground when the Bible
              states that the fountains of the deep burst open. Mind you there
              are still large amounts of subterranean water in the earth today.
              Then of course there is the 40 days of rain. And where did the
              water go? See <a href="http://creation.com/where-did-all-the-water-go" rel="nofollow">http://creation.com/where-did-all-the-water-go</a></p>
              <p>This would suffice for now. I want to put my pearls to
              better use. All these usual objections have been answered and
              addressed. Don't just accept what any epic idiot tells you
              (lest you become one yourself), read up the other side here

              <p>Yes, I noticed you haven't argued anything yet, simply a dismissive remark that my replies appealed to authority.</p>
              <p>Anyway, there is NOTHING wrong with appeals to authority per se. We do it all the time when we argue and quote sources to support our views. The issue is whether it amounts to a FALLACIOUS appeal to authority.</p>

              That's like during a duel you tell your opponent not to use his weapon and drop it. Only a fool would do that. The Bible is the Sword of the Spirit by which we demolish arguments raised against the knowledge of Christ. I am not going to lay down the Bible.

                      Spiritual truths and theological statements are not the subject of empirical proofs. Please understand what proofs are about. My faith is in God and His Word. God is the divine Author of the Bible even though He used men to write them. Call me pathetic or what not, such condescension refutes nothing and invalidates nothing about the Christian faith. You put your faith in your own fallible human reason while I put my faith in God's infallible Word that is the basis of my reasoning.
