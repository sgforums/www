              <p>A Christian with a PhD in Physics wrote to express his displeasure that there are believers who insist on a young earth view. Snippets of his letter included:</p>
              <p>"I am a PhD physicist and also a committed Christian. Having read your article I am shocked at the effort that has gone into defending what I consider to be a quite unreasonable position. Perhaps you have seen the Wikepedia website that discusses the age of the earth? There you will see that the earth has been aged by a large number of techniques, and the accuracy of the result (4.54 billion years) has been established to an uncertainty of 1%. ...</p>
              <p>...The assertion that the earth can be reliably dated at 6000 years by biblical genealogy alone, and in the face of modern science, is surely rather childish, and it undermines the authority of the same folks who are trying to spread the gospel of Christ....</p>
              <p>...We need to have a grown up view of the Bible and not to try to make God small enough to fit into a box of our own making. We must accept the conclusions of science that have come from the enquiring minds that God created within us.... "</p>

              <p>I find this article "<a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v7/n2/24-hour-days">Why I Believe in 24-Hours Day</a>" very useful. Excepts below:</p>
              <p>This plain-language (of 6 literal normal 24-Hrs Day) reading assumes recent creation, not one where days “stand for” or “allow” or “are indifferent to” long ages of time. A recent Protestant scholar, James R. Mook, summarizes this way:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"A natural reading of the Church fathers shows that though they held diverse views on the days of creation, and correctly gave priority to the theological meaning of the creation, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">they definitely asserted that the earth was created suddenly and in less than 6,000 years before their time</span></strong>. They left no room for the ‘old earth’ views promoted by Ross and other moderns."</span></p>
              <p>Orthodox scholar, Seraphim Rose (1932–1982), who openly disdains conservative Protestant interpretation of Scripture, nevertheless writes,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Some rather naive “theologians” try to say that the Six Days of Creation can be indefinitely long periods, that they can correspond to the different geological strata. <em>This, of course, is nonsense because the geological strata do not have six easily identifiable layers, or five or four or anything of the sort. There are many, many layers, and they do not correspond at all to the Six Days of Creation. So that is a very weak accommodation. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As a matter of fact—even though it looks as though it might be terribly fundamentalistic to say it—the Holy Fathers do say that those Days were twenty-four hours long.</span></strong></em> St. Ephraim the Syrian even divides them into two periods, twelve hours each. St. Basil the Great says that, in the book of Genesis, the First Day is called not the “first day” but “one day” because that is the one day by which God measured out the entire rest of the creation; that is, this First Day, which he says was twenty-four hours long, is exactly the same day which is repeated in the rest of creation. <em>If you think about it, there is nothing particularly difficult in that idea, since the creation of God is something totally outside our present knowledge. The accommodation of days to epochs does not make any sense; you cannot fit them together. Therefore, why do you need to have a day that is a thousand or a million years long? The Holy Fathers say again with one voice that the creative acts of God are instantaneous.</em> St. Basil the Great, St. Ambrose the Great, St. Ephraim and many others say that, when God creates, He says the word and it is, faster than thought. <em>There are many Patristic quotations about this, but we will not go into them here. None of the Holy Fathers say that the creation was slow."</em></span></p>
              <p>Even very recently, Albert Mohler states,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"What we have here in <cite class="bibleref"><a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Genesis%201.1%E2%80%932.3"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Genesis 1:1–2:3</span></em></a></cite> is a sequential pattern of creation, a straightforward plan, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a direct reading of the text would indicate to us seven 24-hour days, six 24-hour days of creative activity and a final day of divine rest.</span></strong> <em>This was the untroubled consensus of the Christian church until early in the 19th century.</em> It was not absolutely unanimous. It was not always without controversy. But it was the overwhelming, untroubled consensus of the church, until the dawn of the 19th century."</span></p>
              <p>Victorinus (4th century) says,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Even such is the rapidity of that creation, and which is called Genesis. God produced that entire mass for the adornment of His majesty in six days; on the seventh to which He consecrated it. <span class="ellipsis">. . .</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the beginning God made the light, and divided it in the exact measure of twelve hours by day and by night<span class="ellipsis">. . .</span> . The day, as I have above related, is divided into two parts by the the number twelve<em>—</em>by the twelve hours of day and night</span></strong>."</span></p>
              <p>Ephrem the Syrian (306–373), who knew Hebrew, opines,</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Although the light and the clouds were created in the twinkling of an eye, still both the day and the night of the First Day were each completed in twelve hours."</span></em></p>
              <p>Ambrose (337[340]–397) teaches,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>"<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scripture established a law that twenty-four hours, including both day and night, should be given the name of day only, as if one were to say the length of one day is twenty-four hours in extent</span></strong>. <span class="ellipsis">. . .</span></em> The nights in this reckoning are considered to be component parts of the days that are counted. Therefore, just as there is a single revolution of time, so there is but one day. Thus were created the evening and the morning. Scripture means the space of a day and a night, and afterwards no more says day and night, but calls them both under the name of the more important: a custom which you will find throughout Scripture"</span></p>
              <p>The Venerable Bede (673–735) says,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"At this point one day is completed, namely, twenty-four hours."</span></p>
              <p>It is hard to avoid the conclusion of Robert L. Dabney (1820–1898) who teaches,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"The narrative seems historical and not symbolical; and hence the strong initial presumption is, that all its parts are to be taken in their obvious sense. . . . The sacred writer seems to shut us up to the literal interpretation by describing the day as composed of its natural parts, ‘morning and evening.’ Is the attempt made to break the force of this, by reminding us that the ‘evening and the morning’ do not make up the whole of the civic day of twenty-four hours; and that the words are different from those just before, and commonly afterwards employed to denote the ‘day’ and the ‘night,’ which together make up the natural day? We reply: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is true, morning and evening do not literally fill the twenty-four hours. But these epochs mark the beginnings of the two seasons, day and night, which do fill the twenty-four hours.</span></strong> And it is hard to see what a writer can mean, by naming evening and morning as making a first, or a second ‘day’; except that he meant us to understand that time which includes just one of each of these successive epochs:--one beginning of night, and one beginning of day. These gentlemen cannot construe the expression at all. The plain reader has no trouble with it. When we have had one evening and one morning, we know we have just one civic day; for the intervening hours have made just that time. <span class="ellipsis">. . .</span> It is freely admitted that the word day is often used in the Greek Scriptures as well as the Hebrew (as in our common speech) for an epoch, a season, a time. But yet, this use is confessedly derivative. The natural day is its literal and primary meaning. Now, it is apprehended that in construing any document, while we are ready to adopt, at the demand of the context, the derived or tropical meaning, we revert to the primary one, when no such demand exists in the context."</span></p>
              <p>To bring the debate down to the modern day, Gerhard F. Hasel (1935–1994) concludes,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"This paper investigated the meaning of creation “days.” It has considered key arguments in favor of a figurative, non-literal meaning of the creation “days.” <span class="ellipsis">. . .</span> The cumulative evidence, based on comparative, literary, linguistic and other considerations, converges on every level, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">leading to the singular conclusion that the designation <em>yom</em>, “day,” in Genesis 1 means consistently a literal 24-hour day</span></strong>."</span></p>

              <p>The Woodlands Regional Library would be holding a Darwin Day 2013 event today in the afternoon. Interestingly it is hosted by the Humanist society. http://www.humanist.org.sg/darwinday/2013</p>
              <p>If their article in Darwin Day 2012 means anything, it is that there is an agenda to tell people that evolution has made religion nothing more but a superstitious fad that also evolved to help humans cope and survive. Here's what they conclude, "The father of modern evolutionary biology is a figure worth
