              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Hardcore Atheist:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">///But wait, as an admitted hardcore atheist, do you sincerely and honestly believe that there can be evidence for the existence of God? If so, what form or kinds of evidence is deem reasonable and acceptable?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">After you have thought through it, if you still want the evidences, see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creation.com/">www.creation.com</a></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Then you must laugh at your fellow atheists who define atheism as "lack of belief" to avoid the burden of proof. If you say you cannot prove the non-existence of God, then atheists should not make bold claims that God does not exist. Just say that you BELIEVE there is no God. Atheists have faith too, but of course they would deny it with all their might.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Theists are not saying God exists because atheists failed to prove their atheism (though that's true also), but have offered many lines of evidences to show that the most reasonable conclusion is that God exists. I'm sure you must have read some of these.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">If an eyewitness has been shown to be reliable, can you say we cannot admit his testimony as evidence? Good news for you, the Bible has been shown to be reliable in many aspects.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Lastly, atheism IS a religion. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://creation.com/atheism-a-religion">http://creation.com/atheism-a-religion</a> This has even gone up to the courts in the States and the court has ruled that it is a religion. As a worldview atheism is not just about what is being denied, but also what is being believed in terms of other areas as well.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Your various analogies FAIL for obvious reasons which maybe you failed to see. Not collecting stamps is not the same as saying stamps do not exist or that hobbies do not exist. Your hobby could be different. The atheist may not believe that God exists, but the atheist believes that nature is all there is, which is a metaphyiscal claim about reality. Carl Sagan had a religious saying that goes like "The cosmos is all there is, and all that ever was" Does the atheist have proof that matter is all there is? Saying no scientific evidence means no God is just like saying what your net don't catch ain't fish. ///</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">The Bible is real because the Bible said so, therefore the Bible is real &lt;-- circular reasoning.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Again, you provide no empirical proof, whether it be archaeological or not. Simply by using a Bible, you are not convincing me. I can easily use the Torah, the Quran, or any Buddhist mantras, not to mention a book that says it real because it said so. This is your logic, which is a flaw. We already have dinosaur fossils, and lots of geological and archaeological of the Earth being far much older than just 6000 years. There are also stars that we see from the naked eyes that requires lightyears for the light to reflect back, thus seeing it. The lightyears are a lot lot longer than just 6000 years.

              <p>And you believe all these to be false? No offence, but so far you have not found any evidence to disprove these datings, except quoting from a 'holy book'.</p>
              <p>Also, do you actually realise you get your sources from biased pages? Creation.com? Really? You are using a website that supports a being that has not been existing yet.</p>
              <p>I have also never said that God does not exist, I merely do not believe in God. Sure, I can't 100% bet that a creator does not exist, but by definition, which god? Allah? Zeus? Thor? Yahweh? Quetzacoatl? Izanagi?</p>
              <p>I am an agnostic atheist, and I consider myself hardcore since I do not consider the existence of a god (much less the one you worship), plausible.</p>
              <p>You said that just because something has no proof to back it up does not mean it does not exist, which is 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' in short. However, this goes two ways - just because something has not been disproved yet does not mean that it is any more credible. Don't be biased. Atheists and theists have so far not been able to provide actual, foolproof that a god exists or don't exist. I am not going to use Pascal's Wager to actually believe in a god just because no evidence has been found for either side. Pascal's Wager is a fallacy - it only applies if there is one religion in the world.</p>
              <p>You have also not shown how a book can be reliable. An eyewitness can give false claims. Seriously, do you need me to point out the logical contradictions or the moralistic ones in the Bible?</p>
              <p>Last but not least, many of the points you pointed out that atheism was a religion was in fact, incorrect. Atheism has nothing to do with science - even an unscientific person can be an atheist. Also, Confucianism and Taoism is a philosophy, not a religion. </p>
              <p>The first part of the page said about narratives. Evolution is not an explanation of how everything came from - by saying that this goes to show how ignorant the person who made the page is. The Theory of Evolution is not a gospel to atheists, its only something we refer to. We don't see it as a holy book where we follow ten commandments. </p>
              <p>The second part deals with experiential points. Again, invalid. Meaning is life is subjective - nuff said.</p>
              <p>The third part talks about social - again, another fallacy. There is no power structure, no hierachy. Evolution is not a belief - it's already a fact. Also, communism has NOTHING to do with atheism. This site already reeks of bias. Really? Atheists persecute theists? More like the other way round. I suppose you know that Islam punishes apotasy, or that ignorant Christians say inane things like, "You are going to hell?" Do you have proof of hell? Religion is being prosecuted. Right now, Christianity is the largest religion, and that it is being persecuted? Ridiculous. The site claims that evolution is a lie - proof?</p>
              <p>The fourth part is self-explanatory. They do not believe and adhere - secular humanism is different from atheism, although it can be considered a branch out. The site also tries to pin blames of communism on religion - which is ironic. Hitler was a Catholic, and here are his exact words, </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">summoned men to fight against them and who, God’s truth! was greatest </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the</span></p>
              <p><span>Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was his fight</span><br><span>against the Jewish poison. Today, after two thousand years, with</span><br><span>deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact</span><br><span>that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross. As</span><br><span>a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have</span><br><span>the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice… And if there is</span><br><span>anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly, it is</span><br><span>the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty</span><br><span>to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work and</span><br><span>work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only</span><br><span>for their wages wretchedness and misery. When I go out in the morning</span><br><span>and see these men standing in their queues and look into their</span><br><span>pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very</span><br><span>devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two</span><br><span>thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor people</span><br><span>are plundered and exposed.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fourth part, which talks about ethical signs of atheism being a religion, is again another fallacy. The site states that an atheist<span style="color: #2d2d2d; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;"> s</span><a style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #6a9ebf; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://creation.com/rape-and-evolution">quirmed to justify why he agreed that rape is objectively wrong</a><span style="color: #2d2d2d; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;"> under his philosophy.</span></p>
              <p>Atheism has nothing to do with morals - it comes from oneself. Rape is wrong. Why? Because it goes against the will of the victim. Nuff said.</p>
              <p>The firth part is ridiculous also. Firstly, atheists celebrate birthdays, and also Christmas. I say that from personal experience, as well as knowing atheists friends from all over the world celebrate it. They celebrate it because it is a CULTURAL act, and they do not divine meaning from Christmas. To atheists, special occasions are seasons of joy. </p>
              <p>Last point is also pure ridiculous. Atheists obviously know that resources have to be conserved, not because of survival of the fittest. By conserving and trying to save the Earth, it is known as adaptibilty or love (or both). The first point shows that this is the true form of survival of the fittest, humans adapted, therefore they could survived. The second point is that, Earth is our planet. Without it, we will die. The second part shown by the site is also riduculous. Nature isn't sacred according to atheists - this is pantheism.</p>
              <p>The site you have given me reeks of propaganda, and it gives false information. Nuff said.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I never said the Bible is real because it said it is real. This alleged circular argument seems to be your strawman argument.</p>
              <p>Evidences to support the Bible is found in creation.com and many other websites. Note again that I did not merely use the Bible as proof, though I can also argue that what it says is reliable because it has been well supported by other evidences. Again it is like saying I can trust somebody because he has been proven to be a reliable person.</p>
              <p>We have fossils and rocks which are INTERPRETED to be more than 6000 years old through the worldview of naturalism that undergirds evolutionary belief. Has the age of the earth been proven to be 4.5 billion years old? You should be aware that the age of the earth was once "proven" to be much lesser than that by science at the beginning of the 20th century. As for starlight, evolutionists have their own starlight-horizon problem in their backyard. Not to mention that they believe that in the early earth inflation was faster than light. BTW, are you aware that creationists have come up with various models to explain starlight in a young earth?</p>
              <p>I did not say dating methods are false, I say that they are as flawed as the assumptions built into them.</p>
              <p>And if you did not say that God does not exist, then you should not call yourself an atheist, but an agnostic. You may be interested to know that the Bible teaches that even the demons believe THAT God exists, even when they do not believe IN God.</p>
              <p>BTW, I have never used Pascal's Wager to prove or argue God's existence, it is more a decision matrix. You have to understand Pascal's Wager in his own context. Using Ockham's Razor there is no need to talk about gods when all you need is really to talk about one God, as far as the atheist is concerned.</p>
              <p>You can point out the alleged contradictions or moral problems in the Bible, I assure you that they can be refuted or rebutted, if not by me, then others more capable.</p>
              <p>The article that says atheism is a religion is by someone who studies religion. Atheism fits the bill and thus is rightly called a religion. Even the US court has ruled it such. Again atheism is not just about saying there is no God but also involves a lot of metaphysical beliefs about reality.</p>
              <p>I know atheism is not science, it is a belief. But somehow atheists have managed to sell the idea to fool the public that somehow science or reason will make one an atheist. Like it or not, Dawkins himself admitted that evolution made it possible to be in intellectually-fulfilled atheist. Like it or not, atheism and evolutionism goes hand in hand.</p>
              <p>Is meaning in life subjective? How about saying that it is an objective truth that there is meaning in life, or that life has meaning? You may attached a DIFFERENT meaning to life, but that is not to say that you deny life has any meaning.</p>
              <p>I could go on and refute you on each point, but I think for now, nuff said.</p>

              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Wrong again. Failure to read. I never implied that it was unreasonable to ask for proof. You were the one doing the implying, not me. I asked if he even knew what proofs are required, and whether the proofs demanded were reasonable. I am not saying that it is unreasonable to ask for proofs, but whether the proofs demanded were reasonable. "</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You replied "Chances are, you do not even know the kind of proofs there are and whether the proofs demanded are reasonable." when Jack asked for proof. Implying that Jacky's demand for proof is unreasonable or the proof he's demanding is unreasonable. Either way, it was simply implied that Jack was unreasonable to ask for proof. or the proof he's asking for something unreasonable.  Which I intervened, stating there's no reason for the one claiming to provide proof.</span></p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You still don't get it? I later then used the "lack of belief" tactic to basically say that if the atheist can get away with giving proofs, so can I."</span></p>

              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">Wrong again. Failure to read. I never implied that it was unreasonable to ask for proof. You were the one doing the implying, not me. I asked if he even knew what proofs are required, and whether the proofs demanded were reasonable. I am not saying that it is unreasonable to ask for proofs, but whether the proofs demanded were reasonable. "</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">You replied "Chances are, you do not even know the kind of proofs there are and whether the proofs demanded are reasonable." when Jack asked for proof. Implying that Jacky's demand for proof is unreasonable or the proof he's demanding is unreasonable. Either way, it was simply implied that Jack was unreasonable to ask for proof. or the proof he's asking for something unreasonable.  Which I intervened, stating there's no reason for the one claiming to provide proof.</span></p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">You still don't get it? I later then used the "lack of belief" tactic to basically say that if the atheist can get away with giving proofs, so can I."</span></p>
              <p>Tu quoque as proven. Evidently, still no proof was provided.</p>

              <p>Hypocrites need to queue as well. Basic etiquette.  Remember this? "<span style="color: #333333;">Huh? This is so out of context. Why bring in a post from another thread to make a fuss here? Don't be so defensive lah."</span></p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">As to lack of evidences, exactly what evidences do atheists have that point to or conclude the existence of God? They point to nothing and say that there is no evidence for God? Where are they looking and what are they looking at and with what are they looking at?"</span></p>

              <p>But in case you haven't noticed, or maybe deliberately ignored, the evidence for God has been given many times already. Your denial of it does not invalidate that fact.</p>
