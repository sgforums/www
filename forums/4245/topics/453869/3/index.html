              <p>Of course, I agree with you. I was merely making the distinction between the person and his beliefs. I have shown many times why atheism is irrational. But if you can show me why you think Christianity is irrational, I would love to hear them.</p>
              <p>By the way, just to recap, I said atheism is irrational because it states that everything came from nothing all by itself. In other words, nothing made everything or the universe made itself from absolutely nothing.</p>

              <p>So what if creationists have differing views? We do not differ on WHAT the Bible says, but we differ on things where the Scripture is silent and where we have to make inferences or deductions. While everything the Bible says is true it does not tell us everything that is true, geddit? So there is always space for differences in view. Why make a big hoo haa over this? Even evolutionists have differences in views though they all dogmatically assert that evolution is true.</p>
              <p>You err big time, as usual. The fallible chronologies of man is not used to determine the chronology of the Bible. The Bible has its own determined timeline (see <a href="http://www.nwcreation.net/biblechrono.html">http://www.nwcreation.net/biblechrono.html</a>). The Bible does not depend on secular chronologies to determine its own timeline. Secular history's timeline differs from the Bible's timeline, but why assume that secular time should be correct and used to judge the Bible's timeline? In my view, because the Bible history is correct and sometimes people also get it correct there will be overlaps at various points. This only serves as support for the Biblical record. But where they differ is where we have to look closer. See <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab2/doesnt-egyptian-chronology-prove-bible-unreliable">http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab2/doesnt-egyptian-chronology-prove-bible-unreliable</a></p>

              <p>And how are you NOT also guilty of being inclined to what you believe? See how such allegations cut both ways?</p>
              <p>I only believe that Eve was formed from Adam's rib by God, not that women come from the ribs of a man. You are distorting my belief.</p>
              <p>The Bible recorded just two instances (snake in Eden and Balaam's donkey) where animals communicated intelligibly to humans, and both instances involved supernatural intervention. So it is not the case that I believe animals can talk. Again you distort my beliefs.</p>
              <p>Yes, I believe that there has to be a supreme entity, because otherwise nothing makes sense. For you, you have to believe that there is no God, otherwise you would have to live a life that is morally accountable to Him which you do not want. No only that, your atheism does not make any sense of the universe at all.</p>

              <p>So what if creationists have differing views? We do not differ
                      on WHAT the Bible says, but we differ on things where the Scripture
                      is silent and where we have to make inferences or deductions. While
                      everything the Bible says is true it does not tell us everything
                      that is true, geddit? So there is always space for differences
                      in view. Why make a big hoo haa over this? Even evolutionists
                      have differences in views though they all dogmatically assert that
                      evolution is true.</p>
              <p>You err big time, as usual. The fallible chronologies of man is
                      not used to determine the chronology of the Bible. The Bible has
                      its own determined timeline (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nwcreation.net/biblechrono.html">http://www.nwcreation.net/biblechrono.html</a>). The
                      Bible does not depend on secular chronologies to determine its
                      own timeline. Secular history's timeline differs from the Bible's
                      timeline, but why assume that secular time should be
                      correct and used to judge the Bible's timeline? In my view, because
                      the Bible history is correct and sometimes people also get it
                      correct there will be overlaps at various points. This only serves
                      as support for the Biblical record. But where they differ is
                      where we have to look closer. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab2/doesnt-egyptian-chronology-prove-bible-unreliable">http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab2/doesnt-egyptian-chronology-prove-bible-unreliable</a></p>
