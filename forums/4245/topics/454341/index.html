              <p>Interesting analogy.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the Bible teaches that we are not saved BY good works, but are saved FOR good works as it is written in Ephesians 2:8-10:</p>
              <p>"<strong>Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done</strong>, so none of us can boast about it. <span id="en-NLT-29200" class="text Eph-2-10">For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus,<strong> so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago</strong>."</span></p>

              <p>I think that's because many do not really appreciate or grasp the point that Christianity is about being in a RELATIONSHIP with God, being born into a divine family, having fellowship with God the FATHER. Again the familial words are much used but perhaps overlooked by many.</p>

              <p>i would add on tat they dun start off from the creator but start off from man...</p>
              <p>if i may draw the analogy...christianity starts off from God and man being one family, then man separated from God cos of sin, then Jesus the Son came to bring man back home...in other words, it starts off wif man actually having a ''home'' but rebellion and unrepentance made him ''homeless''...then a member of the ''family'', Jesus went out to bring the ''homeless'' man back...</p>
              <p>for them, it starts off wif man separated from heaven cos we are all born imperfect, then we have to make our way back to heaven by doing gd...in other words, its starts off wif man being ''homeless'' then he has to find his own way back...</p>
