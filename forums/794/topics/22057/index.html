            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday my travel agent at Ken Brothers Reliant Air Travel call me and tell me got special offer on cruise.<br>"Nowsaday cruise to nowhere also so expensive,"<br>said my agent. "This one is damn cheap, some more got on-board casino and it actually go somewhere."<br>"Where is the somewhere?" I ask him.<br>"Kutu Island," he said. "A beautiful, rustic<br>island just off the coast of Singapore. An oft-overlooked gem which promises views never seen before."<br>"Eh, nao hiah," I scold him. "Stop reading from your bleddy brochure! Tell me there can see what?"<br>"History one, lah. Got this story say last time got two sailor - one Chinese, one Malay, and they lost at<br>sea, lah. Si beh cham one. Then, they so kan cheong they began to tear their hair out. But their hair got a lot of kutu one, and when they start tearing their hair,<br>the kutu all boh pian and jump-jump-jump out of their hair<br>and start swimming to find land. Then the two sailors followed their kutu until they reach an island.<br>They were so heng, they named the island after their kutu<br>and set up a temple there."<br><br>"What kind of condemn story is that?" I ask him.<br>"You believe, do'wan to believe, up to you," he say. "But nowsaday, hor, got lot of people go there to<br>visit the temple there to pray to Vo Seen, the Goddess of<br>Saloon de Beauts. I hear it's popular with a lot of<br>hairdressers and botak people. My own hair-dresser went there<br>last week and she just touch 4D."<br>"Like that is on, lah!" I say. "Got free bag one,<br>hor?"<br>So that weekend, I and my nephew took the cruise<br>ship to Kutu Island.<br><br>I like to travel because can learn things. And<br>one of the things I always learn is never trust your travel<br>agent 100%.<br><br>For example, the cruise ship is acherly a<br>tongkang, and the on-board casino is basically a Lao Ah Peh<br>dealing cards.<br><br>But neh'mine. Kutu Island itself is very small.<br>(I guess kutu also very small.) There's not very much to<br>do there, so I recommend you come here only if you a bit itchy, like that.<br><br>The temple takes up most of the place. Everywhere<br>you can see statues of Vo Seen, with her big hair and golden highlights.<br>The day I went there got a group of shampoo girls<br>from Hairs Cut International Saloon also visiting.<br>They brought offerings of brushes and combs. Some even brought mousse to spray as they pray. If you donate some money, they will also release a few<br>kutu into their kutu pool for you.<br><br>The temple also got advisors there to help you. For example, if you want to get rid of kutu, then<br>there is a kutu kwee in your head. And what you must do is<br>give money to the temple, and they will spray holy insecticide on your head. Then you must wrap a<br>good morning towel around your head and meditate for<br>one hour.<br><br>And if you are going bald, then you must also<br>give money and they will give you a holy wig, blessed by Vo Seen.<br><br>My nephew's hair is like chee-bye hair - messy<br>and like wire like that, so I pray to Vo Seen for him.<br>I think the prayer worked, because when he came<br>back to Singapore, it was no more like chee-bye hair.<br>It was more like armpit hair.<br><br>So we'll definitely be going there again next<br>year.<br>Even though we never touch 4D.<br><br>------------------<br>Float Like A Bee, Sting Like A Butterfly!!</div>
