Don't stay on the humps too long. Move on.<br><br>When you feel down because you didn't get what you want, just sit tight and be happy, because God is thinking of something better to give you.<br><br>When something happens to you, good or bad, consider what it means. There's purpose to life's events, to teach you how to laugh more or not to cry too hard.<br><br>You can't make someone love you, all you can do is be someone who can be loved, the rest is up to the person to realise your worth. The measure of love is when you love without measure.<br><br>In life there are very rare chances that you'll meet the person you love and loves you in return. So once you have it don't ever let go, the chance might never come your way again.<br><br>It's better to lose your pride to the one you love, than to lose the one you love because of pride.<br><br>We spend too much time looking for the right person to love or finding fault with those we already love, when instead we should be perfecting the love we give. When you truly care for someone, you don't look for faults, you don't look for answers, you don't look for mistakes. Instead, you fight the mistakes, you accept the faults, and you overlook the excuses.<br><br>Never abandon an old friend. You will never find one who can take his place.<br><br>Friendship is like wine, it gets better as it grows older.<br><br>Remember the five simple rules to be happy:<br><br>1.      Free your heart from hatred.<br>2.      Free your mind from worries.<br>3.      Live simply.<br>4.      Give more.<br>5.      Expect less.<br><br>No one can go back and make a brand new start. Anyone can start fom now and make a brand new ending.<br><br>[This message has been edited by marker (edited 10 June 2001).]</div>
