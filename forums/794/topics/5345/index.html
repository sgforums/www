            <div class='col-md body'>my mum was admitted to the hospital today for a mild case of stroke, and i guess, she will have to be hospitalised for quite sometime...a brain scan has shown a blood clot in her brain, causing her to be paralysed(hopefully temporary) on her left side and causing her to be in a semi-concious state...<br><br>her condition has stablised, and the blood pressure has gone down substantially...but something happened made me very scared...while the staff nurse was giving her a routine checkup, she called out to my mum, asking her to open her eyes just so she can check, but no matter how we shake or call out to her, she just wouldn't open her eyes...this went on for a while, until the nurse finally gave up, cos my mum was showing signs of feeling aggitated...at that point of time, i was getting worried...i was scared that what would happen if my mum...*touch wood*...<br><br>i am so used to having her around, everytime i misplaced my stuffs, i will ask her where the things are, even though she might not know...i'm so used to telling her "ma, wo chu men le" everytime i go out...the thought of not being able to do all those things one day makes me shudder...<br><br>but, that day will come, eventually, and hopefully by then, i'm brave enough to accept the truth...in the meantime, i wish for speedy recovery for my mum...<br><br>------------------<br>Float Like A Bee, Sting Like A Butterfly!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess i understand how you feel.<br>My Dad died after a year of being paralysed after he got a stroke. I did not even know if he could listen. All he could do was blink and his eyes were staring blank.<br><br>I felt so helpless for the whole year.<br>He really suffered a lot during that time because being bed ridden he lost weight and other complications.. he stayed in hospital half a year and the other half at home.<br><br>I was doing my O levels..<br>Talk about feeling lost. I rememebr the thing he wanted me to do was study hard and get to University and i did that and i am here now..<br><br>i feel sad that he can't see me graduate.<br>i do regret that sometimes i used to take things for granted that you never expect when someone will go, and it's too late to say you love that person.<br><br>If you have the chance do it now.<br>sometimes it might be awkward especially if you dun do it often.. so do something for for your parents instead or something.<br></div>
