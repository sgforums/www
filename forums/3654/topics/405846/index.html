              <p> <span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">In Singapore,
                      academically-weak students, excluding those who undertake secondary school
                      education, receive education segregated from mainstream students. This limits interaction between mainstream
                      students and them.</span></p>
              <p>we propose two major approach to the problem</p>

                      students and academically-weak students. Long-term workshops would enhance the
                      effectiveness of the workshop as prolonged communication leads to deeper
                      friendship and better understanding.</span></span></span></span></div>

              <p>I feel that elitism exist due to lack of interaction between students in elite school and other school such as neighbourhood schools. This lead to many misunderstandings between the two parties. Thus this workshop will be effective as it provides a rare opportunity for them to mix and communication.</p>
              <p>However, the downside of this workshop is that non-elite students may not be comfortable with studying with elite students. Studying together could emphasis the huge education gap between elite and non-elite students and this would further cause misunderstandings and strain relationships. Therefore I feel that elite and non-elite students should interact, but through other means such as organising activities like CIP or events. Working together will allow bonds to form and the two parties will start to understand each other. </p>

              <p>I agree with the previous person that the existence of elitism is due to the lack of interaction between elite schools and non-elite schools.</p>
              <p>To eradicate elitism, students from these schools should be brought together to interact with each other.</p>
              <p>However, holding a skill workshop for them to study together may not work. After all, there is a difference in the capability of these students, frustration may result if the learning capacity of non-elite students cannot match up to that of students from elite schools. This may further worsen elitism which is detrimental to the society.</p>
              <p>I took part in SPLAT! recently, (http://splattt.org/) which is a musical talent showcase put up by students from assumption pathway school. We are befrienders to the students from APS and through SPLAT!, we actually built rapport with these students and came to realise that these students are pretty much like us. Students from elite schools may be good at studying but non-elite students have their own talents and strengths too. Students from APS are good at dancing and singing. Through SPLAT!, we no longer have that sense of superiority when we compare ourselves to students who are not from elite school. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe you guys can work along these lines and come up with other activities instead of a skill workshop!</p>

              <p>Personally, i think that mixing elite and non-elite students is good because they will all get to see different people. Besides, non-elite students, among getting in touch with elite students, will be more inspired to work harder to catch up with their peers. Getting in touch with different people will also help them greatly when they enter the workforce next time. They will learn how to interact with many different people and learn about each other's good points and bad points. Letting them work together will also serve no harm since they will only be in touch for a period of time. If the results of it are proven to be good, perhaps this suggestion could be implemented long-term and eliminate the problem of elitism.</p>
              <p>However, problems such as communication exist. Elite students and non-elite students may have different ways of communicating, leading to tension between them. But precisely because of this, the problem should be treated right from the start and not when they enter the workforce.</p>

              <p>i agree with Rkhoooo, there is such an existing problem in Singapore.</p>
              <p>As a student from an elite school, i feel that i cannot really get along with the students from neighbourhood schools. Hence my social circle is limited to those students from elite schools too.</p>
              <p>Although we all speak the same language, we speak it in a different manner with all the slangs and such. This is an obstacle which is difficult to overcome.</p>
              <p>However, the skill workshop might be a good platform for effective communication between the students of different academical level. By having such workshop, students will be able to learn and study together, most importantly, interact with one another. The communication breakdown between them will slowly be dissolved after weeks of learning and studying together. They will be teaching each other the slangs and everything. Therefore, i think that the skills workshop is effective and if there is such workshop on going i will be more than delighted to participate in it. :)</p>

              <p>Personally, I feel that such a workshop would actually be countereffective instead of the proposed ideal that everyone would be working together, thus falling short of its purpose.</p>
              <p><br>Realistically speaking, if the students were to know who were the elite and non-elite students, a possible segregation between the students might occur, also common stererotypes of each group might also distant the two groups further.</p>
              <p>Another hurdle would be the innate ability of the two groups of students, elite students might be able to grasp the skill or theory faster and if the non-elite students lag behind, it would create an awkward situation where the non-elite are left out.</p>
              <p>On another note, if both parties are able to accept their differences and work together without disparity, a possible success might result from it, however if the elite are too elitist, negative feelings might occur.</p>

              <p>I read ur posts on other topics, all of them were either
              sarcastic or is negative about that particular topic. I can only
              conclude that u either have no friends at all, trying your mighty
              best to attract attention. Please. Get a life.</p>
              <p>i am just posting my views as my friend needed help. This is
              what friends are really for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. am willing to be your friend.</p>

              <p>Thanks for running a check on me sir. As it seems like your first day in forums. May i request you to learn to quote me properly <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> And please do read through all my posts again. While i find it interesting  that not 1 but 6 new users replied on this topic. Of course that was just a claim. If you claim to be otherwise, thats fine. But i was somehow magically edited instead of given a reply. Does that show something ? hmm maybe..</p>
