            <div class='col-md body'>caramon says:<br><br>If we ask any woman what she's looking for in a man, she'll come out with a long list of ennobling qualities: a sense of humor; a guy who's nice to her and treats her well; good values; a strong moral character, interesting and intelligent, but monetary terms will never be in the picture.. Does that means she will go for the poor guys if he have the above qualities? ... NO...<br><br>Many women lie.. They are experts at self-deceit because if they ever admitted to themselves what they really want from men, then they'd be forced to acknowledge that they don't really want a "nice" guy.. They are equally contradicting as they always lament about the lack of "Nice" men arounds..<br><br>I always watch what a woman does, rather than what she says.. And what does she actually do? When it comes to choosing men, she heads straight for the cash.. What women want most from men -- and therefore the criterion most significant to them in selecting a mate -- is money or the assurance of thereof in the future.. ThatÂ’s probably why guys with a bigger house have an edge over the poor live-with-parents-kid.. And guys driving Lexus have an edge over SMRT riders...<br><br>You'll never catch a woman saying what she wants is a tall handsome man who drives a continental car, with lots of money and lives in a condo.. They got to have thick skin aka leather to do that (and we all know how lovingly soft the skins of sweet asian things are.)<br><br>Some women are blatant about their mercenary choices, openly choosing men with substantial material assets that they can exploit.. But most are subconscious hypocrites, screening out less successful men without admitting it to themselves.. They publicly announce that all they want is a nice guy, but privately disregard any men who don't meet their elevated standards for money, success, and status..<br><br>Let's be honest -- if women really chose men based on what they say they're looking for, then every nice, average guy out there would be besieged with females trying to go out with him.. Like my friend Peter, nice, average looking generally stay at home on the weekends with a date from the PC/TV..<br><br><blockquote>ChristinaTeh says:<br><br>What woman wants............?<br><br>In short;<br><br>Below 20's : Handsome n popular guys.....<br><br>Above 20's : RICH and have good future (aka good security).... anything more than that is a BIG bonus.<br><br>Trust me on this one!

            <div class='col-md body'>caramon says:<br><br>A female friend once told me that one reason why those loose women go for married men is because of their huge egos..<br><br>You see, women have even bigger egos than men.. Their ego depend on their looks and their level of attractiveness.. That's why women are so desperate to get men to pay attention to them.. Their ego depend on male attention..<br><br>Their egos are stroked each time they get a man to look at them.. therefore, their excuses of having a wardrobe full of clothes and dozen shoes justify just that.. If they can attract a MARRIED man to pay attention to them, it's seen as a HUGE boost to their little egos.. They think, "wah, I'm so attractive that even a MARRIED man can forget his wife and pay attention to me instead.. Yay, I am so "good"<br><br>So there, you've got the reason.. She's only interested in boosting her own fragile ego.. Women like to have what they cannot have.. If a man is already taken, then they will try extra hard to get him.. That's how stupid those women are..<br><br>Of course, when caught and trapped like a rat, most of these home-wreckers like to play the innocent little girl who didn't do anything wrong and push the entire blame on the man..

You've obviously got plenty of issues with the world around you, particularly women-issues, and I'm glad you have the guts to voice them out. Your approach does not appear to be gaining you points on the popularity poll in this forum though, but I guess popularity is not on your agenda - another good thing in my opinion. </blockquote></div>

Does that means she will go for the poor guys if he have the above qualities? ... NO...<br><br>Many women lie.. They are experts at self-deceit because if they ever admitted to themselves what they really want from men, then they'd be forced to acknowledge that they don't really want a "nice" guy.. They are equally contradicting as they always lament about the lack of "Nice" men arounds..<br><br>I always watch what a woman does, rather than what she says.. And what does she actually do? When it comes to choosing men, she heads straight for the cash.. What women want most from men -- and therefore the criterion most significant to them in selecting a mate -- is money or the assurance of thereof in the future.. ThatÂ’s probably why guys with a bigger house have an edge over the poor live-with-parents-kid.. And guys driving Lexus have an edge over SMRT riders...<br><br>You'll never catch a woman saying what she wants is a tall handsome man who drives a continental car, with lots of money and lives in a condo.. They got to have thick skin aka leather to do that (and we all know how lovingly soft the skins of sweet asian things are.)<br><br>Some women are blatant about their mercenary choices, openly choosing men with substantial material assets that they can exploit.. But most are subconscious hypocrites, screening out less successful men without admitting it to themselves.. They publicly announce that all they want is a nice guy, but privately disregard any men who don't meet their elevated standards for money, success, and status..<br><br>Let's be honest -- if women really chose men based on what they say they're looking for, then every nice, average guy out there would be besieged with females trying to go out with him..

As more local guys are marrying overseas, its only time before those feminists, intellectual wh0res finally woke up to find themselves in a 'solace' situation and realise they should remain less vocal and in less unassuming position..

Women are the engines of love, acting much like the heart in the body..

So she has her own career, her own car, her own business.. So what? A man also has his own career, his own car, his own business.. So where's the difference.. For a man, it's just like marrying another man..<br><br>Nature had intended men to be masculine &amp; women to be feminine.. That's why there's a ying &amp; a yang.. Opposites attract &amp; complement each other.. If a woman has qualities that are the same as a man, where's the attraction? It's just like being with another man...<br><br>I believe THAT'S the real reason why singaporean Men are marrying foreign women..
