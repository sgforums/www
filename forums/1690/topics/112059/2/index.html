            <div class='col-md body'>caramon says:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">There seems to be a new term for Singaporean women: "dinner wh0res" - They only go out with you if you take them somewhere fancy, classy and expensive for dinner.. Yet unlike guys, they will never offer to share the bills, often sitting there and waiting for you to settle the bills..<br><br>Beggar is define as someone who wants something for free.. dinner wh0res is define as someone who wants something for free and treat them as equal..<br><br>Go around any pubs or disco and you will discovered most if not all bills are settle by guys.. Women wants to be treated as equal, but when it comes to payment, they are not gentleman enough.. For the poor guys who always pay and pay, you will always be at the receiving end.. End of the day, those dinner and drinks wh0res will lament " why you always no money" ? How to marry me in future..<br><br>Can the intellectual wh0res tell me, why the double standard?</span><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>he says even more in the same thread becos simply he does not know how to shut up:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All the time, we(men) get bashed from those feminist-pig... Its not about women-bashing, but the retaliation that we(men) finally did after tolerating all these years.. so those feminist wants equality.. but cried foul when guys back-lash at them..<br><br>Girls likes to assume being in a stronger position, but when presented in such a situation, they find those guys as wimps or not assertives enough.. when going for a date, they like guys to treat them as their equals, but when it comes to payment, they expects guys to pay.. It's officiate as 'correct' or a must, but when urge their counterparts to foot the bills, girls lament them as 'stingy and 'ungentlemen'.. comments like this have become so common place that nobody stops and thinks how 'unequal' or 'unfair' this is..<br><br>I wish I can logically explain this phenomenon, but it's beyond my ability to fathom what's going on in their pea size brain.. They have no problem to treat men as their equals, but they got a big problem in behaving like a gentlemen..<br><br>Apparently, we guys are supposed to take insults 'like a joke' or 'like a man', but when a guy says something about girls, he's label as 'sexist' or a chauvinist.. Girls like to project themselves as independent when around with guys, but when in the presence of ang moh, singapore women turn into submissive sl_uts.. All that 'modern independent woman' crap goes out of the window the moment they start licking the boots of the ang moh..<br><br>But one thing I can do, is say that the phenomenon doesnÂ’t last forever.. As more local guys are marrying overseas, its only time before those feminists, intellectual wh0res finally woke up to find themselves in a 'solace' situation and realise they should remain less vocal and in less unassuming position.. Until then, I propose a toast to all the guys.. You know who you are, and I know you are sick of the double standards thats been practising by the local ladies.. Fear not, as your well deserved vindication is coming.. </span><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Heng jie says:<br><br>another whiney post.

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's the latest proof of caramon repeating himself over and over again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>caramon says (for the hundredth time):<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All the time, we(men) get bashed from those feminist-pig... Its not about women-bashing, but the retaliation that we(men) finally did after tolerating all these years.. so those feminist wants equality.. but cried foul when guys back-lash at them..<br><br>Girls likes to assume being in a stronger position, but when presented in such a situation, they find those guys as wimps or not assertives enough.. when going for a date, they like guys to treat them as their equals, but when it comes to payment, they expects guys to pay.. It's officiate as 'correct' or a must, but when urge their counterparts to foot the bills, girls lament them as 'stingy and 'ungentlemen'.. comments like this have become so common place that nobody stops and thinks how 'unequal' or 'unfair' this is..<br><br>I wish I can logically explain this phenomenon, but it's beyond my ability to fathom what's going on in their pea size brain.. They have no problem to treat men as their equals, but they got a big problem in behaving like a gentlemen..<br><br>Apparently, we guys are supposed to take insults 'like a joke' or 'like a man', but when a guy says something about girls, he's label as 'sexist' or a chauvinist.. Girls like to project themselves as independent when around with guys, but when in the presence of ang moh, singapore women turn into submissive sl_uts.. All that 'modern independent woman' crap goes out of the window the moment they start licking the boots of the ang moh..<br><br>But one thing I can do, is say that the phenomenon doesnÂ’t last forever.. As more local guys are marrying overseas, its only time before those feminists, intellectual wh0res finally woke up to find themselves in a 'solace' situation and realise they should remain less vocal and in less unassuming position.. Until then, I propose a toast to all the guys.. You know who you are, and I know you are sick of the double standards thats been practising by the local ladies.. Fear not, as your well deserved vindication is coming.. </span><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Devil1976 says:<br><br>No one really bother to reply....<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Nelstar says:<br><br>One word to explain what caramon is doing : ' Whining '<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>mistyblue says:<br><br>His mom musta beat him with a stupid stick and drop him on the ground when he was young..<br>Did he escape from IMH again!!!!
