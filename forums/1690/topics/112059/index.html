After that, they go back to army as white horse status and do nothing till they ORD and get a better job because of their degree.<br><br>For poor people, with only a diploma or less, they have to start at the bottom or even worse. The pay sucks and even after working for many years we might not be able to reach the level of the degree holder. The poor that study private U, will have to pay themselves and sometimes take 2 to 3 jobs just to sustain the course fees.<br><br>On top of all this grief, we still have all the crap about local ladies being judgemental of us poor guys.

            <div class='col-md body'>What the topic was about:<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=111517" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer these question before you get married.</span></a><br><br>caramon says: <span style="font-style: italic;">When it comes to making the decision about choosing a life partner,no one wants to make a mistake. Yet, with a high divorce rate , it appears that many are making serious mistakes in their approach to finding Mr/Ms Right!<br><br>If you ask most couples who are engaged why they're getting married, they'll say: "We're in love." I believe this is the one...<br><br>#1 mistake people make when they date. Choosing a life partner should never be based on love (alone). Though this may sound not politically correct, there's a profound truth here. Love (alone) is not the basis for getting married. Rather, love is the result of a good marriage. When the other ingredients are right, then the love will come. Let me say it again: You can't build a lifetime relationship on love alone. You need a lot more.<br><br>Here are five questions you must ask yourself if you're serious about finding and keeping a life partner.<br><br>QUESTION #1: Do we share a common life purpose? Why is this so important? If you're married for 20 or 30 years, that's a long time to live with someone. What do you plan to do with each other all that time? Travel, eat and jog together? You need to share something deeper and more meaningful. You need a common life purpose. Two things can happen in a marriage. You can grow together, or you can grow apart. To make a marriage work, you need to know what you want out of life.<br><br>QUESTION #2: Do I feel safe expressing my feelings and thoughts with this person? This question goes to the core of the quality of your relationship. Feeling safe means you can communicate openly with this person. The basis of having good communication is trust! Make sure you feel emotionally safe with the person you plan to marry.<br><br>QUESTION #3: Is he/she a someone who is a refined and sensitive person. How can you test? Here are some suggestions.<br><br>i) Do they work on personal growth on a regular basis?<br><br>ii) Are they serious about improving themselve. So, ask about your significant other: What do they do with their time? Is this person materialistic?" Usually, a materialistic person is not someone whose top priority is character refinement.<br><br>There are essentially two types of people in the world: People who are dedicated to personal growth and people who are dedicated to seeking comfort. Someone whose goal in life is to be comfortable will put personal comfort ahead of doing the right thing.<br><br>QUESTION #4: How does he/she treat other people? The one most important thing that makes any relationship work is the ability to give. By giving, we mean the ability to give another person pleasure. Ask: Is this someone who enjoys giving pleasure to others or are they wrapped up in themselves and self-absorbed? To measure this, think about the following:<br><br>i) How do they treat people whom they do not have to be nice to, such as waiters, bus boys, taxi drivers, etc?<br><br>ii) How do they treat parents and siblings? Do they have gratitude and appreciation? Do they show respect? If they don't have gratitude for the people who have given them everything, you cannot expect that they'll have gratitude for you - who can't do nearly as much for them!<br><br>iii) Do they gossip and speak badly about others? Someone who gossips cannot be someone who loves others. You can be sure that someone who treats others poorly, will eventually treat you poorly as well.<br><br>QUESTION #5: Is there anything I'm hoping to change about this person after we're married? Too many people make the mistake of marrying someone with the intention of trying to "improve" them after they're married. You can probably expect someone to change after marriage for the worse!" If you cannot fully accept this person the way they are now, then you are not ready to marry them.<br><br>In conclusion, dating doesn't have to be difficult and treacherous. The key is to try leading a little more with your head and less with your heart. It pays to be as objective as possible when you are dating, to be sure to ask questions that will help you get to the key issues. Falling in love is a great feeling, but when you wake up with a ring on your finger, you don't want to find yourself in trouble because you didn't do your homework.<br><br>So now guys you see the problem why your friends could end up in bad marriages?</span><br><br>Otingocni says: <strong>If marriage is like ABC....<br><br>Human = robots.<br><br>If you can predict outcome of marriage with those questions...<br><br>Then you are God.</strong><br><br>No_Problemo says: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If simply answer a few question will help find a suitable partner. ROM should make it a compulsory Q&amp;A session before registering their marriage</span><br><br>Tot4lly pwn3d j00!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

You must keep her on a tight rein..<br><br>Women want total freedom or rather to call things by their names - total licence.. If you allow them to achieve complete equality with men, do you think they will be easier to live with? Not at all.. Once they have achieved equality, they will be your masters..<br><br>In fact the scene have changed drastically.. Last time, a man choose a woman for its gentleness, demure kind but now its different.. It is the girl who accepts / doesn't accept a potential suitor.. And guys compete with each other to impress the girl.. A guy's eligibility is determined by how many C's he possessed..<br><br>I don't know what it will lead to.. But, it will be catastrophe if it continues.. Sometimes, I just can't fathom whats going on in their pea brain.. They want equality yet they won't accept being in a stronger position.. The men in Singapore dont have the privilege of assuming a weaker position and demand the other sex to do the work yet when a guy like my friend Peter comes along, he is often label as a wimp or not assertive enough for the local ladies..</span><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Keuriseudo says:<br><br>The truth is that women don't like you and men thinks u r a disgrace to them.<br><br>That's the difference between both sexes.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>caramon's feeble attempt in retaliation:<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by starblue:<br>lolz... why are all cara's threads lead to the same ends?? time for reflection for SOMEBODY??? lolz... his threads are freaking hilarious...<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Do you mean flame?

His name is Tom and his age modestly 29.. He is rather tall and well-built, walk with an air of confident and spots the trendiest side-burn.. Given his perfect vision, he will occasionally wear a non-degree sun-glass so as to look "cool" even when the sky looks gloom..<br><br>There is, however, one remarkable aspect to Tom: his behaviour as soon as he steps on a bus.. The back seat is for five passengers.. In spite of his moderate size, Tom sits so as to allow room for only four or even three people on the seat.. If four are already seated and Tom is standing up, he demands permission, in an indignant and reproachful tone, to sit down -- which he then does, managing to take up an excessive amount of space.. To this end, he puts his hands in his pockets so that his elbows will remain firmly embedded in his neighbours' ribs..<br><br>Tom's resources are plentiful and diverse.. When he has to travel standing up, he always keeps his jacket unbuttoned, carefully adjusting his posture so that the lower edge of his jacket hits the face or the eyes of those sitting down.. If anyone is reading, they are easy prey for Tom.. Watching him or her closely, Tom places his head near the light so as to throw a shadow on the victim's book..<br><br>On the MRT, If he manages to take the seat, he never gives it up to anyone, but the moment he sees a pretty lady climb on board he immediately stands up..<br><br>For all his inconsiderate and irritating behaviour, Tom surprisingly have his fair share of girls surrounding him.. Not that they mind though, as Tom is more than capable of amusing them with his trendy jokes and overwhelming personalities.. Compare him to Peter I finally understand why people always lament that "love is blind"..<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>icyprincess</strong></span> says: ~<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Have you ever been in love before?<br>I hope one day you will meet someone who can tolerate you long enough to be able to change your mind.<br>And pls dun stereotype ppl according to how they look outwards.
