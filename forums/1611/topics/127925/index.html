            <div class='col-md body'>In this turbulence society, i believe every organisation hav to be competitive in order to surive including non-profit organisation such as NKF. However, it seem that NKF has begin to raise its marketing strategy such that having 3 charity shows barely in 3 wks time. I'm not very critcal about NKF, as i feel its importance &amp; needs in provide utmost subsidaries to the kidney dialysis, children medical funds &amp; cancer patients.<br>But if everyone try to donate to NKF, who shall other non-profit charities get their donation or resources from? Can anyone have the abilty to contribute to many non profit organisation such as community chest or ren chi, they are all as impt as NKF.<br>Does our contribution &amp; donation is fully utilize?<br>Pls share ur view?</div>

How many people are even aware of the existence of KDF? And even if i am, i've no idea of the services they provide and how my donation is going to help the patients. And even if i decide to donate, i'll have to take the trouble to find out where they are and how to donate etc. Whereas for a well-publicised organisation like NKF, it's so simple and straightforward. Just pick up the phone and dial their donation hotline... and u might even win a condo, car, cash etc in the process.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by odysseus:</div><div class="quote_body">I had a friend's father who generously donated (quite substantial amounts) to NKF for many years and then when he needed dialysis NKF said he was denied treatment bcos he didn't fit their (NKF's) criteria.  </div></blockquote>Hmmm.. actually i think that's fair enough. The decision on which patient to help should be based on the patient's individual needs and not on how much he has donated to the organisation before.. unlike buying an insurance policy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, another point i like to add is the power of media. NKF have already gain tremedous support from the newspaper, TV boradcast &amp; the radio. They incrementally build up so call the need &amp; right to help NKF.<br>Another point to look into the number of employees working in the NKF. Not all of them are voluntary workers. They do get some salary &amp; believed to be as good as working for a private sector. Some of our donation will certainly go into substaining its employees' pay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NkF really too much. Always give prize and money. But where the money come from? Why are they are so different? I hate to see the winner get their prizes and shake their butts on the TV. A condo or a car can cost so many calls of donation. Now where got hao xin ren ( good-hearted) want to donate their prize.<br><br>Now they still issue student the NKF card to ask the student to donate. Some sort of CCA then myst participate on behalf of their school.

I will received their yearly NKF donation card. But now ..hmmm, not so warm heartedly liao.<br>Well, i was told that the pple who won the top prize is always pple to call the most "expensive" call, &amp; usually majority of them who so call more well to do than others, i believed the prize is nothing meaningful as they hav already pocessed what was offered. Example is the last winner who won away the volvo car, i think she gave away to her son .... rich pple ...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
