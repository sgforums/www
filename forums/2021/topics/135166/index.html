            <div class='col-md body'>Wah. Sibei pai seh, I hate it when I catch a cold.. My mind will go haywire and die.<br><br>I called up my bank just know, right before lunch, to ask why I couldn't get through their phone banking to check my account balance. Frustrated, I also complaint about why couldn't I get through their internet banking as well!<br><br>KNN ONE. MY UOB BANK ACCOUNT ALWAYS GOT PROBLEM ONE. but dats why its good to save money in, go in very hard to come out.<br><br>I mean, this is my bank account for crying out loud! I can't even check my own balance!?<br><br>Than I was asked for my account number, which I don't remember. So the customer service officer sent me an activation letter to my home for Phone Banking services. Alright one down, now my internet banking. It says I failed my login once and asks me to reactivate my account.<br><br>She says alright, she will activate it again. But it can be once, if I login wrong info again, I will have to reactivate it personally.<br><br>I say, alright. So be it. Oh by the way, what is my account balance. Alright, she replies, its $170.<br><br>Oh.. Okay.. wait.. Something is wrong. I checked DBS bank account awhile ago and it was that exact figure. Wait a minute, something is not right.<br><br>Of course I couldn't use the phone banking services.. I didn't apply for DBS Phone Banking. I was trying to access UOB Phone Banking, not DBS!! I am speaking to a DBS customer support, not UOB. I have no problems with DBS, I only have problems with UOB!<br><br>Apparently, I took out my DBS Mastercard thinking its my UOB Visa and called the number on it.<br><br>After such a long conversation and drama, it dawned to me I actually called up the wrong bank.. I quickly laughed and rejected the offer to reactivate my Internet Banking account.. thanked the lady and hung up.<br><br>She was like "Is there anything else I can do for you? You sure you don't want me to reactivate your account?" I explained I believe I really forgot the login, and I'll reset the pin personally and thanked her repeatedly.<br><br>Wa-ha-ha-ha.. How could that happen to me? What a big blunder. I actually called up the wrong bank, and talked for so longer before realising.. Opps. Damm it!! Wrong number!!<br><br>So sorry!! I feel so guilty!! &gt;///&lt;<br><br>PS: But nice service there, DBS. Can put up with siao siao customers like me. =D</div>
