              <p>Are you looking to get rich or what?</p>
              <p>Forget it; medical school and law school will throw you out before you can say "financial remuneration" in your best standard English accent at the interview.</p>
              <p>Your best bet is to secure an engineering or business degree while you think over what you really want to do in life.</p>

              <p>I applied for NUS Law and Business Double Degree back in my time...
              think it was the first year it was introduced. Would have chose that if
              I had remained in Singapore, because it gives you two degrees and
              offers you more job scope next time I guess. SMU, if I'm not mistaken
              has a Law and Business Double Degree as well. You can look at this option if you are undecided between Law or Business.</p>
              <p>For Law: I would think NUS is a better choice, because it's a bit more select, shall we say? I'm not too sure, but I have heard that SMU does take in some of the NUS law reject. These might just the ones I've heard though....However, looking at your grades, perhaps you might consider a bond free local scholarship? For NUS, if you are taking law, you have to get the NUS GLobal Merit Scholarship I think, and that is really hard to get. To be honest about it, I don't think B for GP holds you in very good stead. BUT, to get funded for your studies at SMU is much easier... they give a whole range of scholarships and dont seem too selective about it... so it's up to you really.</p>
              <p>And by all means try to apply for NUS medicine, I think your grades are alright enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are going for Business, go for SMU Business. I think they have marketed themselves well and my friends get to go on plenty of business study trips etc which I think enriches the learning process. And Business is all about marketing isn't it?</p>
              <p>I would suggest putting NUS choices in this order:</p>
              <p>Medicine</p>
              <p>Law and Business</p>
              <p>Business</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And smu:</p>
              <p>Law and Business</p>
              <p>Business and Accountancy</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are considering NTU, Accountancy and Mass com are the better degrees there.</p>
