              <p><br>Typical JC1 life (for me):</p>
              <p>7am+ report to school. Lectures. Tutorials.</p>
              <p>The breaks in between, I usually do some tutorial homework, go computer lab (certainly not for schoolwork, lol!), or just sit around talk cock with friends.</p>
              <p>Sometime after CCA, leave school around 7 or 8pm. Reach home liao will either do tutorial or watch TV.</p>
              <p>On certain days (i.e. fridays), can even start leave school at 4 or 5pm. Finally can have dinner with family at home yeh?</p>
              <p>Seldom do intensive revisions because I thought still can use sec sch methods of studying: just do your homework and a little but of TYS can score liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Typical JC2 life:</p>
              <p>Start to kan chiong liao. JC2 life is the crazy moment for me.</p>
              <p>CCA wise, no achievements. Wanted something good for my school graduation certificate so I go and join a 'niche' CCA so that I can be involved in SYF and have something I can call 'achievements'.</p>
              <p>Two CCA plus all the lame projects, mountain loads of tutorials really very very crazy. It can kill. Don't even talk about revision. Confirm no time to revise one. Because of SYF, CCA may end at 8pm. Barely enough time for tutorials still want to revise?</p>
              <p>But when the SYF was over and we step down from CCA, there was more time. But this is the period when everything got even crazier because A'level is approaching.</p>
              <p>During breaks, I no longer go on the net or talk cock with friends. I try to finish all the tutorials and homeworks by those breaks.</p>
              <p>After school, no more homework to do liao, so can finally start my 'real' preparation for A'level. Take out TYS, lecture notes, other school's papers, past tutorials and try to understand and become proficient in two years worth of knowledge in a few months.</p>
              <p>It's not unusual to leave school at 10pm in those days. And I prefer to study alone because by that way, I really study, and not talk cock with my friends. Besides, I know where my friends are revising (we revise in classrooms...yes, one classroom to myself, LOL), so I can always go to them for meals or when I have questions to ask.</p>
              <p>So that's typical JC life for me.</p>
              <p>Crazy days. Was so freaking stressed up and mentally drained everyday. Can't even imagine uni life -.-</p>

              <p>Firstly, thanks for your detailed description.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OMG crap now tis stress really scares me. Normally how long are the breaks and how many breaks do you get in a day? I think one important pointer, similar to what ive learnt in sec school, is to focus on loading up your portfolio(achivements and leadership bla) in the earlier school year.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Break is depend from person to person, see your subject combination and school arrangement. Shortest is half an hour, longest can go from two or three hours, or even the ridiculous five hours (that's what I heard from other schools) between two lessons on that one day (and only two lessons).</p>
              <p>But at the end of the day, it'll have to balance up one. For example, if you monday got a lot of breaks altogether, it means your other days will have lesser breaks. If the school arrange it well enough, you have almost equal amount of break time everyday (though very very difficult)</p>
              <p>The stress is all about management. If you look at my description, I did mention I hardly study in  JC1 right? Then first half of JC2 too much work (CCA, projects, tutorials) to study. Only second half onwards then I chiong. That's why I so stress.</p>
              <p>For A'level, preparation should start from the first day of JC1. NOT PARTY UNTIL A'LEVEL START HOR!</p>
              <p>Portfolio maybe also see heng suay bah? If let's say the SYF and all the competitions are held only in your second year leh?</p>

              <p>Reason i ask is because my teacher says JC is very stressful(indeed many ppl say that) He also says that may need to study till night everyday in school. XD</p>

              <p><br>I agree with you, although I didn't cope on my own either. I never did learn anything but somehow still pass the As with good grades. My having learnt nothing would show when I went to uni and found that the stuff I was taught in JC, I don't know any of it. Ultimately I would go on to switch my uni course to something I have an interest and knowledge in, which I never studied at A or even O levels. lol</p>
              <p>Btw when i said ability I had intellect and IQ in mind, not the ability to juggle commitments.</p>
