              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>BEIJING: Authorities
               in northwest China said Monday they had formally arrested the head of a
               kindergarten operating an overloaded bus that crashed into a truck, 
              killing 19 children and two adults.<br><br>The nine-seater mini-bus was 
              carrying 64 people when the accident happened in Gansu province's 
              Zhengning county on Wednesday. The bus driver, who died, was reportedly 
              driving on the wrong side of the road above the speed limit.<br><br>"Li 
              Jungang, the chairman of the kindergarten, was arrested on charges of 
              causing a traffic accident," Yuan Suiming, deputy chief prosecutor in 
              Zhengning, told AFP.<br><br>"He could be given a sentence of more than seven years in prison."<br><br>Li
               violated traffic laws and regulations by re-fitting the bus and having 
              the seats removed to allow more passengers to be crammed in, the 
              official Xinhua news agency reported.<br><br>The kindergarten -- which 
              has more than 700 children enrolled -- only had four mini-buses at its 
              disposal, and seats in all four vehicles had been removed, the report 
              said.<br><br>Local authorities have said families of the victims will 
              each receive 436,000 yuan ($69,000) in compensation for their loss, it 
              added.<br><br>Earlier reports said police had also detained the driver 
              of the truck and two local officials, and that the heads of the local 
              education bureau and traffic department were under investigation.<br><br>Children
               are often crammed into buses for their journeys to school in China, 
              especially in rural areas, despite strict regulations limiting passenger
               numbers.<br><br>Parents of students at the kindergarten in Zhengning 
              said school buses had been overloaded for years despite several 
              complaints, according to previous reports.<br><br>China's education 
              ministry responded to the accident last week by ordering education 
              authorities and schools and kindergartens across the country to carry 
              out safety checks on buses.<br><br>- AFP/ck</span></span></p>
