As the dangerous cat-and-mouse game unfolds, a wild card emerges: Madaline (Jodie Foster), a power broker with a hidden agenda, who injects even more instability into an already volatile situation.<br><br>Starring: Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejiofor<br>Genre: Crime, Drama<br><br><a href="http://www.insideman.net/" rel="nofollow">Official Website</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a slick heist thriller, which doesn't conform to the notions of how a heist movie should be. It's the feel good factor at the end of the movie that makes this movie satisfying. This is perhaps the most accessible, and commercial of all Spike Lee Joint films. I'd watch it again, for its engaging politicking story, and for that opening credit sequence.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/04/inside-man.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The opening was great but the trip to the final revelation and the additional elements beside the monetary heist felt rather sluggish and I swear that there was someone snoring in the cinema during the middle portion of the movie. The final revelation was interesting but it wonÂ’t be an instant classic like Â“Usual SuspectsÂ”.<br><br>Overall "Inside man" was a satisfactory Heist movie, 3.5 out of 5 stars movie for me.<br><br>Sidenote: I caught this movie at Causeway and it was badly censored! All the F word, A word and B word and other words that I didn't catch were MUTED away! Bloody Hell! It was like drowning the characters from showing their expression. For a moment it felt like the Â“Usual SuspectsÂ” again but this is worse, the censorship happened through out the movie. I am not one who uses vulgarities but to have actorÂ’s lines being censored every now and then just pissed me off. I almost wanted to fill in the blank for them.<br><br>When did movies shown in Singapore Cinema have their vulgarities censored?? If I have known about it earlier, I wouldn't have watched it in Cinema and wait for other sources to watch it instead.</div>
