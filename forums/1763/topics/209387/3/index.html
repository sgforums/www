In "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" (1963), Fleming clearly describes Bond wearing a Rolex Oyster Perpetual Chronometer on an expanding metal bracelet.  Given Bond's Royal Navy background, it was probably a 6538 Submariner, which became Royal Navy issue in 1959.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a different opinion. I found the movie utterly boring with no cool factor in it.<br><br>My fav is still Pierce Bronsnan<br><br>I mean, the James Bond franchise is all about the ultra cool guy who does no wrong, with hi-tech gadgets and always looked as if he just groomed himself.<br><br>This guy, whatever he is, is not a James Bond. He is an action hero and not the cool charismatic charmer that James Bone is supposed to be. Fine, they said he just got the mantle but  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> found it all too lame. Even the action parts are  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Personally, I think Huge Jackman might be able to pull it off and he would make a much better Bond than whatever his name is.<br><br>Things I don't like about this movie:<br>1. Bond has no charisma. He bores me to tears. I don't even want to look at him<br><br>2. The Bond girls are 'yawn' They are not even hot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>3.

The plot within the plot is not working. They made it all so messy and dragged the movie unnecessarily<br><br>5. It has successfully shattered the image of the James Bond franchise  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>My ratings: 1/5<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be frank, the next fifteen minutes after the climax of Bond winning the $150mil was a total letdown. The movie seemed to lose a lot of its momentum after that.<br><br>Otherwise, I would say that the movie was quite realistic. It pretty much explains how Bond went from an arrogant and idealistic fella to one who is more cold and distant, as can be showed by how he described Vesper Lynd's death to M:<br><br>'Why do I need more time?
