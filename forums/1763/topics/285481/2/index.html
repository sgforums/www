Timothy Olyphant did a great job as Agent 47 (although I was really Skeptic at first). The only flaw seems to be that there is too much gun-blazing.

            <div class='col-md body'>10 years ago, Philip Noyce directed a movie that was based on an adapted character. He put this character in Russia, and got him embroiled in some political intrigue that's way over his head and should not have involved him in the first place. Naturally, our anti-hero (he's a professional thief by the way) bites back, using skills he honed to perfection, and basically relying on his smarts to escape near misses. His charisma ensured he had a beauty with brains tagging along, albeit reluctantly but given no choice with her involvement in the scheme of things, before forging trust, and possible romance.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/hitman.html</div>

The dead guy that was shown to the detective at the end of the movie was just a scapegoat that 47 presented to the detective.

Anyway there is only one 47. The rest of the clones had other numbers.<br><br>who is the real 47??<br><br>Ans: As long as you see Timothy Olyphant's face on the character, he is 47. Even though there were hitman clones everywhere, their faces aren't identical to one another (in the movie, that is).<br><br>then in the end, the sniper, who is the dead person the bald guy??<br><br>Ans: Probably another hitman, judging by the dressing sense (red tie, black suit)<br><br>i thought 47 got killed by the detective??<br><br>Ans: Errr... no. Where'd you get the idea he was killed? 47 wasn't killed, he merely got caught by the authorities and was escorted off in a police car until Agent Smith gave him a chance to escape. You saw that part... right?<br><br>So in the end wad happen to 47??<br><br>Ans: Alive and well.</span></div>

The dead guy that was shown to the detective at the end of the movie was just a scapegoat that 47 presented to the detective. This was so that the detective would have evidence to his superiors that the 'ghost' was finally eliminated. But of course, the real 47 is alive and well.<br><br>the person whom the detective has been chasing??<br><br>Ans: duh... 47<br><br>then the bald guy is another 47?<br><br>Ans: Uh... which bald guy you referring to? Anyway there is only one 47. The rest of the clones had other numbers.<br><br>who is the real 47??<br><br>Ans: As long as you see Timothy Olyphant's face on the character, he is 47. Even though there were hitman clones everywhere, their faces aren't identical to one another (in the movie, that is).<br><br>then in the end, the sniper, who is the dead person the bald guy??<br><br>Ans: Probably another hitman, judging by the dressing sense (red tie, black suit)<br><br>i thought 47 got killed by the detective??<br><br>Ans: Errr... no. Where'd you get the idea he was killed? 47 wasn't killed, he merely got caught by the authorities and was escorted off in a police car until Agent Smith gave him a chance to escape. You saw that part... right?<br><br>So in the end wad happen to 47??<br><br>Ans: Alive and well.</span></div></blockquote>Oh icic.<br>now i understand.<br>ya i didnt play the game.<br>Thanks polarsnake.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
