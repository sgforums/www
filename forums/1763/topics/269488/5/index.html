Impossible. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I can't tell you more because my English isn't very good. But thank you for supporting this movie! This is my first movie where I played the lead actress. So thank you very much. It actually shows that Singaporeans actually like watching a fat lady on the big screen!"<br><br>"881" is the first commercial feature film by critically acclaimed Singapore director Royston Tan.<br><br>Royston Tan said "My last two films were not box office hits. So it is a very good present for my birthday. I really want to thank the general public. Over this period of time, they've been giving us and crew a lot of love so a very big thank you."<br><br>Kenneth Tan, CEO, Golden Village Cinemas, says: "It has also attracted a wide spectrum of people who probably don't normally go for Getai performances. Young people (are) attracted to the younger talent in the film.<br><br>"You don't need to do something either high art only or something that is based on the conventional man in the street coffeeshop talk. If you make a film on any theme any subject matter that strikes a chord with a broad base of population, people are going to watch the film."<br><br>Very few Singapore-made movies actually hit the S$2 million mark in local cinemas and these are mostly movies by comedian director Jack Neo.<br><br>His previous films took in between S$3 million to S$5 million.<br><br>In 1998, his "Money No Enough" made S$5.8 million, "I Not Stupid Too" made S$4.2 million in 2006 and "I Not Stupid", S$3.8 million.<br><br>His 2007 project "Just Follow Law" about Singapore's civil servants took home about S$2.7 million.<br><br>MediaCorp Raintree Pictures' "881" has gone even beyond that but it is not just about earnings at the box office.<br><br>The film is set to hit new heights.<br><br>"881" has been invited to take part at the prestigious Pusan International Film Festival in South Korea.<br><br>It will be showcased at a new section called the Gala Presentation exclusive only to four internationally acclaimed movie directors. - CNA/ch<br><br></div>
