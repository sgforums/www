A musical and getai is two different thing at all , is like comparing prata and pizza . For me this movie is the only one that make me really weep watching it esp the last part where i really couldn't control my tears and they just rolled out of my eyes a couple of times . I think this movie really score big in the weep factor , i give 10 out of 10 tissue box rating for it . Wehn i went out , i heard  a few gers actually have to look else where just to prevent themself from crying . May want to get the dvd version although my mum keep asking me not to buy it , but she did praise the songs in the movie which i really like also .

Never knew she has such a talent when she was with TCS.<br><br>I feel that Da Mu Gua (Yann Yann) looks like Zhuang Mi Xue (Michelle).<br><br>Tho Qi Yu Wu din utter a word in this movie.. but it's all gan qing xi on his part.. and i think he really played the role very well.. esp the part when he cried.. speaks louder than words.<br><br>Initially I din really feel that this movie is worth watching.. but bcos of the advertising on tv, and my mum wanting to watch.. i went with my family.. and glad that I din miss it.  </span><br><br></div>
