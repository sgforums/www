            <div class='col-md body'>yah when i bought the ost at populor , it was on the counter as they had just take it out to be displayed outside , and before they can display it on the shelf , a lady in front of me grab 1 and i also grab another 1 from the counter directly and paid for it . They should have released all the song in the show as the songs in the cd make pple feel abit " shortchanged " as there is too little song and the song 1 person 1 half  has 3 diff version in it taking up a considerable amount of space . If they were to release part 3 including all the songs featured in the movie i will definitely buy it , otherwise it will be another major letdown cum short changing . If first release is such a sellout , why do they have to make a thrid release ? Why don't they might as well make a full ost of the movie and launch it on the 2nd release . And also i can't listen to the sound track on my pc ley . Hope they don't do the same format to this 3rd release .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I watched 881 2 weeks ago. It's been 2 weeks but scenes from the show still lingers in my mind. It was a strange feeling, something that I haven't felt in a long long time.<br><br>Royston Tan is a young Singaporean, barely over 30. Everyone who acted in 881 are Singaporean (at least most right?). The scenes were captured in the streets of Singapore and reflected Singapore's unique culture. Unlike many of our campaigns aimed at creating a sense of nationalism, 881 is the true Singapore, from the getai, shots of the man of the street, the language and gestures.<br><br>Suddenly, I am proud of my heritage, my culture, my people and the country I live in. I haven't felt like this in a long time.<br><br>I remember the places I used to hang out, places that have been tore down to make way for urban renewal. There were places that I hold close to my heart, places like where I learnt how to ride a bicycle, places where I spent my childhood, most of which are no longer around. Then there are cultures, languages and slangs distinct to Singapore. These were things that were buried because they were deemed too kitsch, too crass, too low class. Strangely, the show brought back all these memories.<br><br>It's just a show you may think. But to me, this is the most accurate reflections of what I perceive my country to be.</div>
