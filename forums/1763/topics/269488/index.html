            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.zhaowei.com/881/img/index.jpg"><br><br>Â“881 is my third film and as a director, I have always wanted to surprise people with different ways of storytelling. 881 will be SingaporeÂ’s first musical film and I hope to bring out the beauty of Hokkien songs and Â‘getaiÂ’ through this brand new interpretation.Â” Royston Tan<br><br>The Seventh Month. The only month in the Chinese Lunar Calendar when the Gates of Hades are thrown open, and ghosts, spirits and all departed souls make their annual pilgrimage back into the land of the living.<br><br>In the seventh month, Chinese folks in places like Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong burn incense and joss sticks, conduct prayers and make offerings to the returning dead. In Singapore, however, they take the business of placating and entertaining the spirits one step further. They have Â“getaiÂ” (song stage), makeshift concerts which pop up all over the island.<br><br>Each year, more than 500 of these concerts take place during the Hungry Ghosts Month. Entertainers lined up include comedians, magicians, opera performers and singers with garish costumes and even more elaborate dance choreography.<br><br>Royston TanÂ’s new movie 881 unfolds against this unique cultural backdrop in Singapore. It is the story of Mindee and Yann Yann, two childhood friends who grew up mesmerised by the glitter and glamour of getai. They are The Papaya Sisters, two of the showiest performers on the circuit because the Â“song stageÂ” with all its pomp and pageantry is a respite from the emptiness and dreariness of their own lives.<br>881 will mark yet another breakthrough for Royston, whose first feature film 15 is a visceral and gritty look at teenage delinquents. His second film 4.30 - about a latchkey kid and his Korean tenant - surprised audiences with its pared down, meditative and almost lyrical story-telling.<br><br>This new film is a musical, with glitzy costumes and lavish choreography. The actors often break into song to express their emotions. All the numbers in the movie are from the treasure trove of the late Chen Jin Lang, a Singapore getai songwriting legend who died in August 2006. A cross between Dancer In the Dark and Moulin Rouge, 881 will also feature documentary-style (ie Â“liveÂ”) footage which captures the fever and excitement of actual getai performances.<br><br>881 features Mindee Ong , Yeo Yann Yann , MediaCorp artiste Qi Yu Wu and twins May and Choy.<br><br>Official website: <a href="http://www.zhaowei.com/881" rel="nofollow">www.zhaowei.com/881</a><br></div>

I just heard Mindee say 'Shit'. But she assured us that she was okay. We were shocked, but we quickly recovered ourselves and continued to wave to the crowd,' Royston told The New Paper yesterday.<br><br>The cast had just finished a 7.30pm-road show at The Heeren Shops and heading to Plaza Singapura where they had another show at 8.30pm.<br><br>Mr Eric Ng, music director of the film, was following in his own car behind the pickup and saw the incident.<br><br>He told The New Paper: 'The traffic was quite heavy. We were driving along the second lane from the left when the motorbike came from the bus lane.<br><br>'Then I saw eggs flying and the men were throwing and smiling. I immediately gave chase.'<br><br>Mr Ng, who had two passengers with him, said the two men rode dangerously, weaving in and out of the traffic.<br><br>He said he lost them when they made a left turn into Central Expressway after the Le Meridien Singapore hotel. He added that they appeared young.<br><br>He also claimed the motorcycle's licence plate was covered with white gaffer tape and he could only see the letters FV.<br><br>Mr Gary Goh, one of the producers of the film, said he received Mr Ng's call about the incident and when the cast reached Plaza Singapura, they were taken to the washroom to clean up and to check for cuts.<br><br>The cast, including Mindee, continued with their show.<br><br>Mr Goh added: 'We asked if she was okay and that we could remove her segment but she said she will press on.'<br><br>The New Paper could not reach Mindee for comments.<br><br>But actress Yann Yann, 30, told The New Paper: 'When it happened, we were shocked for a while. Then we told ourselves that if someone wants to sabotage us, all the more we'd want to give an even better performance.'<br><br>After the performance, Royston, Mr Goh and another crew member said they booked a cab and rushed Mindee to the hospital.<br><br>She was allegedly given an injection, as well as some eyedrops and an eye patch to protect her eye, said Royston.<br><br>Getai singer Karen Lim, 36, who has a supporting role in the movie, said she visited Mindee at home yesterday.<br><br>She said Mindee removed her eye patch and showed her her red and swollen eyes.<br><br>'I am so angry. What if her face was hurt and she was left with scars?<br><br>'I have never encountered such an incident in the 21 years that I have been running the circuit,' she added.<br><br>Royston said that they did not file a police report as they 'did not want to kick up a big fuss'.<br><br>But by not reporting the incident, wouldn't he be putting his cast in danger?<br><br>He said: 'We're too busy with the publicity of the movie and would like to think it's a one-off incident.<br><br>'It would be too difficult to catch the culprits anyway because we did not see their faces or their licence plate number.'<br><br>Royston said he does not know who might want to do such a thing to them.<br><br>He added: 'If it was staged, I would have been more relieved. I don't want people to think it's a publicity stunt. It would make us look very cheap.'<br><br>Meanwhile, the weekend promotional activities at various heartland malls will continue and Royston said they will continue to use the pickup.<br><br>However, Mr Goh said they might consider blasting music from the vehicle instead of having the cast on board.<br><br>'We cannot afford that sort of risk and must protect the interest of the artistes,' he said.</div>
