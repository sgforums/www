              <p>So, to show my passion for films, I thought I'd share some of my 'Mini in-a-nutshell reviews with you guys. Hope you would enjoy them. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Traitor (2008): Better than the previews/trailers made it seem. Solid tension, intrigue and performances. Co-written by Steve Martin - yes, <em>that one</em>. <strong>MATINEE PRICE WORTHY</strong></p>
              <p>Babylon A.D.: Really had potential. Tries to take on some big themes and fails to hold them all together. Plus, worst ending ever! <strong>RENTAL WORTHY</strong><br><br>X-Men (2000) It's aged pretty well (still entertaining and 'not lame' today). Solid adaptation skillfully crafted by Bryan Singer. Quality acting, writing, directing were synergized. <strong>REGULAR PRICE WORTHY</strong><br><br>Gran Torino: "<em>Falling Down</em>" meets "<em>Bad Santa</em>" meets "<em>Karate Kid</em>". Unique characters, semi-predictable story, ballsy filmmaking. <strong>REGULAR</strong><br><br>Slumdog Millionaire: "<em>Usual Suspects</em>" meets "<em>City of God</em>" meets "<em>It's a Wonderful Life</em>." At times bleak, but overall hopeful. <strong>REGULAR</strong><br><br>Rollover (1981): 1980s banking collapse would-be thriller. Really dated (unrelevant to our time). It's like a "Lifetime TV" style drama. But, there are some interesting 2008 economic parallels. <strong>RENTAL</strong></p>
              <p>I Know Who Killed Me: It won 9 Razzie awards, has a boring story idea, weird cinematography, horrible acting, and no tension/suspense - Don't waste your time and see it when it's <strong>EDITED FOR TV</strong>. Turn it up in the background while you're doing something interesting.</p>
              <p>Factotum (2005): Matt Dillon soars as pseudo Charles Bukowski, but the 'drinker/smoker/self-destructive writer' thing is kinda out of date. <strong>MATINEE</strong><br><br>The Cell (2000): It's "<em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em>" meet "<em>The Matrix</em>" meet "<em>Law and Order</em>". Has a standard story, amazing visuals and imagination - <strong>REGULAR</strong><br><br>Strange Days (1995): This is a James Cameron written action/thriller and semi-remake of 1983's "<em>Brainstorm</em>". Has racism, 'apocalypse-ism', and is relevant today - <strong>MATINEE</strong><br><br>Paul Blart: Mall Cop: Don't ask why I paid for this <em>Die Hard</em> would-be spoof. Has generic characters, situations, and predictable laughs. <strong>RENTAL</strong></p>
              <p>Castaway (1986): This inspired "<em>Lost</em>" and proved that audiences are smart and patient enough to watch a dialog-light story of an Island stranded guy. <strong>REGULAR</strong></p>
              <p>Max Payne: A video game adaptation that looks great but feels forced. Has a cliche backstory, bad guys and twists. Cool ideas made boring. <strong>MATINEE</strong></p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The Matrix - It was on TV; had planned to watch it for 10 minutes, then 20, then 30, then it was over. Revolutionary visuals and ideas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Repo: The Generic Opera - Wants to be a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Rocky Horror</span>" cult classic, but falls short. Great ideas and visuals, but bland characters and songs. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Milk - Harvey did for Gay Rights what Martin Luther King, Jr did for African
              American Rights. Solid biopic with typical structure. Sean Penn is
              great! <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Tropic Thunder -<span style="font-style: italic;"> Apocalypse Now</span> meets <span style="font-style: italic;">Bowfinger</span>. Good idea; has solid acting, great jokes, gags and spoofing. Ambitious and refreshing. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR<br></span></p>
              <p>Â Brainstorm (1983) - <span style="font-style: italic;">War Games</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Strange Days</span> owe homage to this big on ideas, average on execution sci-fi drama about mind recording. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>The Eavesdropper (2004) - Straight to DVD <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Files</span>-ish, Sci-Fi Channel drama about a deaf woman who "tunes" into people's thoughts. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Reservation Road - "Lifetime TV" style drama about tragic hit and run and lives affected. Has a great cast, acting, and exploration of guilt and anger. <strong>MATINEE</strong></p>
              <p>Things We Lost in the Fire - A husband's death affects all in his life. Has good acting, good directing and good explorations of addiction and recovery. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Miracle Mile - 1988 drama about a dude trying to get to his girlfriend before a nuke hits L.A. Sounds like... <span style="font-style: italic;">Cloverfield</span>... and, it is! <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Escape From New York - Classic John Carpenter's New York as a massive prison of a dystopian future jailbreak adventure. Outdated but fun. <strong>REGULAR</strong></p>
              <p>Night of the Creeps - 1986 campy alien-zombie-teen-comedy-horror - and it almost pulls all those genres off. Fun, bloody... but dated. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Number One - Darren Aronofsky's "<span style="font-style: italic;">The Wrestler</span>" owes a lot to this Charles Heston aging Brett Favre-ish football drama forgotten gem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Number One (1969) - Darren Aronofsky's "<span style="font-style: italic;">The Wrestler</span>" owes a lot to this Charles Heston aging Brett 'Favre-ish' football drama forgotten gem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>The Mothman Prophecies - Basically a 2 hour <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Files</span> episode. Definitely creepy but kinda slow. Great overall direction and climax. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>No Reservations - RomCom? Drama? DramCom? It's sad, it's funny; it's sad, it's cute? Goodhearted and has good food, but kinda cliche and uneven. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>The Savages - An unflinching quiet look at the theme of aging, changing, growing and family. Great acting, 'invisible directing', good writing. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Righteous Kill - It's an excuse for De Niro and Pacino to act tough before they were forced to remake <span style="font-style: italic;">Grumpy Old Men</span>. Has no tension and it's predictable. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly - Wow. Iconic, epic, has ambitious genre defining/re-defining filmmaking. Oh, who could forget about the music! Great stuff. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Surviving the Game - Good idea that "<span style="font-style: italic;">Hostel</span>" owes a lot to. Great set up - hunting humans for sport - but has a predictable story execution. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The Godfather II - What more can be said about this? Epic in all areas: filmmaking, characters, emotion, etc. This is what sequels should be like: better than the first! <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Vicky Christina Barcelona - Not all that funny, but is actually a nice exploration of art and love. Woody Allen has gotten serious. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Unforgettable - Cool idea - injecting memories of other people - for 1996! It's a big screen <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Files</span> episode for "Lifetime TV". <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Ghosts of Mars - A rare John Carpenter miss! It's a mishmash of his 70s and 80s action hits mixed with vampires and bad acting. <strong>EDITED FOR TV</strong><br><br>Pale Rider - A simple quiet story. Part remake of <em>Shane</em>, part sequel to <span style="font-style: italic;">High Plains Drifter</span>. The religious overtones add nice metaphors. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>X-Men 2: X-Men United - Again, this is what sequels should be like - staying faithful to the first while taking it to the next level on <em>every</em> level. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Scream - The <span style="font-style: italic;">Pulp Fiction</span> of slasher movies takes a syringe of creative adrenaline and injects it into the dead heart of the genre - <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>History of the World: Part 1 - Mel Brooks spoofs 1957's "<span style="font-style: italic;">The Story of Mankind</span>." Dated jokes, kinda slow, with moments of brilliance. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Inglorious Bastards - Typical rag-tag WWII commandos story made interesting because of the unique, engaging, and fun characterizations. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATNIEE</span></p>
              <p>Appaloosa - Ed Harris adapts, directs and co-writes this Western to the big screen. Solid work, but adds nothing real new to the genre. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Carnal Knowledge - Sounds a lot steamier than it really is. Sort of like <span style="font-style: italic;">Chasing Amy</span>... without the lesbians. Risque for its time - <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Choke - A touching mother and son dysfunctional relationship tearjerker warped through Chuck Palahniuk's sadomasachistic satire. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>The Mack - The 'Blax-ploitation' version of <span style="font-style: italic;">Scarface,</span> except with pimps. Funny, wise, heartfelt, great dialog, solid acting. Classic! <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Watchmen - Solid but flawed. Focuses on pleasing fanboy expectations. Great visuals, faithful storyline, but light on emotions. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Two Lovers - Quiet, steady; a character-based exploration of love. Great performances, avoids cliches, discovers uncomfortable truths. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>In Bruges - Unpredictable, cliche-breaking character based drama following two hitmen dealing with the ramifications of their choices. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Miss March - Late 90s Farrelly Brothers gross-out style laughs for the 2000s as shock replaces emotions. Makes you laugh, not feel. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Some Girls - Early roles for Jennifer Connelly and Patrick Dempsey in this uneven eccentric 'dramedy' (drama-comedy). Slow, heartfelt and unpredictable. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Johnny Mnemonic - So bad it's good. Has cheesy lines and (cheesy) acting and wacky characters. It's a cool idea that seemed futuristic but it'd be considered silly today. <span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITED FOR TV</span></p>
              <p>1984 - <span style="font-style: italic;">V For Vendetta</span> owes a lot to this solid adaptation. Creates so complete a reality you feel the boot stepping on your face. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Enemy of the State - Portrays the <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Files</span> 90s "They're watching me" tech paranoia that <span style="font-style: italic;">Eagle Eye</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Echelon Conspiracy</span> owe a lot to. Fun. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>The Proposition - An Australian Western! Cowboys and Aborigines! Interesting, engaging, slow, bloody, character based, existential. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>From Noon Till Three - A cliche breaking, genre reinventing Western/Romantic/Comedy. Unpredictable and funny with social commentary. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Quarantine - A remake 1 year after the original? Kinda sad. Worst of all, it's not better than it! Booooooring till the last 15 min. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Extreme Movie - A straight to DVD Kentucky Fried Movie/Robot Chicken-style boundary-destroying teen sex comedy.Well deserved title. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo - The title says it all! So bad it's good; it's a guilty pleasure and makes a solid drinking game - <span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITED FOR TV</span></p>
              <p>The Santa Clause 3 : The Escape Clause - Gave it 10 minutes; watched the rest in fast-forward and didn't miss anything! <span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITED FOR TV</span></p>
              <p>Alfie (1966) - Michael Cane as a young man! And he's not that nice of a guy as he explores life and dating in a no B.S. kind of way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Sneakers - An all-star cast in a geeky version of <span style="font-style: italic;">Oceans 11</span> and a prehistoric version of <span style="font-style: italic;">Eagle Eye</span>. Good acting chemistry. Light fun. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>The Descent - Takes a while to get going; but once it does, it does everything right. All female cast breaks horror conventions. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Perfect Upset - Documentary about the 1985 NCAA B-Ball Villanova victory over Georgetown. Standard documentary filmmaking with inspiring story. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Stardust Memories - Woody Allen searches for meaning in life, the purpose of art/movies and sanity in relationships. Creative and funny. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Human Trafficking - Pretty hardcore for a "Lifetime TV" movie! But so-so acting and forced camera work distract from the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Funny Games - Seemed like it was a <span style="font-style: italic;">Clockwork Orange</span> torture porn rip off, but it's about the nature of watching film. Unpredictable. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Dancer in the Dark - Bjork is pretty great, the story takes some
              bold twists, musical numbers are creative, but character motivations
              seemed forced.</p>
              <p>Eastern Promises - Steady and quiet. Just brings the viewer into a
              world and lets the characters be who they are. Violent, but not
              exploitative. <strong>REGULAR</strong></p>
              <p>Live Free or Die Hard (a.k.a. Die Hard 4.0) - An inspiration for <span style="font-style: italic;">Eagle Eye</span>; it has outrageous action, 2-D characterization, and John McClane becoming McBain - <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Eagle Eye - Has great car chases and a timely message/theme. Shia plays himself yet again. Defiles story logic. It's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Game</span> meets <span style="font-style: italic;">2001</span> - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Click - <span style="font-style: italic;">A Christmas Carol</span> meets "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo">TiVo</a>". Safe, predictable, shoulda' had more balls, but still, dogs humping stuffed animals is funny - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Casino Royale - Bond is less Hugh Hefner, more John McClane; a dude
              who bleeds, hurts and loves. Great Parkor, boring Poker, no Q! - <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Magnolia - Epic ensemble drama at its daring yet uneven best! Tom
              Cruise's best performance. Paul Thomas Anderson has mad skilz - <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Mirrors - Good idea, great sets, but bad dialog, laughable acting,
              lack of motivation and illogical. It's a 'Japanese-Snor-ror' - <span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITED FOR TV</span></p>
              <p>Deja Vu - Denzel phones it in. The timetravel/looping stuff is okay.
              Predictable and is a case of 'Movie-ja Vu'; as you watch this, you'll
              feel like you've seen this kind of movie before - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Hancock - <span style="font-style: italic;">Bad Santa</span> meets <span style="font-style: italic;">Superman</span>. Will Smith is great - too bad the story isn't. No strong opponent means a boring final 45 minutes - <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>What Happens in Vegas - For a movie that uses gambling as a life
              metaphor, it doesn't take many story/genre risks. Some LOL moments - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Rest Stop 2 - 'Indie' horror. <span style="font-style: italic;">Texas Chainsaw</span> meets <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hitcher</span>. Has close up torture porn moments and average acting/directing - <span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITED FOR TV</span></p>
              <p>Sex &amp; the City - Great if you've seen the TV show. On its own,
              it's kind of an annoying study of four highly materialistic women -<span style="font-weight: bold;"> RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Indiana Jones &amp; the Kingdom of Crystal Skull - Great to see Ford back in action, has an ambitious storyline/idea. But,
              also has flat characters, too much CGI, and not enough emotion. Indy
              doesn't grow, Shia plays Shia (again), Karen Allen is underused. Feels out of
              sync. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Deal - Texas Hold em' themed coming of age/redemption story. Has by the
              numbers filmmaking, low budget/expectations and poker star cameos - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Iron Man - <span style="font-style: italic;">Batman Begins</span>-ish structure. It tries to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Batman Begins</span>,
              but doesn't have a big enough reach. Robert Downey Jr. plays Stark
              perfectly. He's perfect as a millionaire playboy. Great visuals, cliche
              villain, great ending. <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Vacancy - <span style="font-style: italic;">8mm</span> meets <span style="font-style: italic;">Psycho</span> meets <span style="font-style: italic;">Hostel</span>. Decent acting, creepy setting, interesting idea, but, it's predictable and cliche - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Hard Candy - <span style="font-style: italic;">Misery</span> meets <span style="font-style: italic;">Funny Games</span> meets Dateline NBC's <span style="font-style: italic;">To Catch a Predator</span>. Surprising, disturbing, engaging. <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>You Don't Mess with the Zohan - Wayyyy funnier than expected. Over the top, silly, but most importantly, hilarious! <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>Forgetting Sarah Marshall - Was expecting comedy magic; instead,
              found it to be a solid, lighthearted RomCom (Romatic Comedy). More
              chuckles than LOL moments. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>9 Songs - <span style="font-style: italic;">Last Tango in Paris</span> covered this territory without the explicit visuals shown here. It's not exploitative - it's just not engaging. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Star Trek II - Wrath of Khan - One of the best movie villains ever in <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE</span> best <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Trek</span> movie. Don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy. Proves that special effects
              are secondary to drama and character relationships. KHANNNNNNNNN!!! <span style="font-weight: bold;">MIDNIGHT SHOW WORTHY</span> (so good you'll have to catch the first midnight show if there's ever a re-screening)</p>
              <p>All
              the puns have been used. "What Happened", "What's Happening"...etc. The
              idea is great, but the movie execution is embarrassing - <span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITED FOR TV</span></p>
              <p>No, it's not gay porn. This Clive Barker straight to FearNet feature is <span style="font-style: italic;">Hostel</span> on a train. And Predictable. <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>13 Tzameti - Interesting idea. <span style="font-style: italic;">Hostel</span> meets the Russian Roulette scene in <span style="font-style: italic;">Deer Hunter</span>. Needs more close ups for emotional impact - <span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULAR</span></p>
              <p>The Strangers - <span style="font-style: italic;">Saw</span> meets <span style="font-style: italic;">Vacancy</span>. Simple story, simple setting, very creepy. Great filmmaking, but feels like basic tortue porn - <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>Eyes Wide Shut - Kubrick's last movie, Kidman and Cruises' last film before their divorce. Steady, long, creepy, erotic - <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>The
              Departed - Scorsese doing what he does best: crime, expletives, sex,
              betrayal, Rolling Stones music and plenty of headshots - <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATINEE</span></p>
              <p>The
              Hoax - A safe, by the numbers character based story about a down and
              out writer who writes a fake autobiography to make money - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>The Hitcher - Sigh, another sh*tty remake of a great original. Last line of this version sums it up: "I don't feel anything." - <span style="font-weight: bold;">EDTV</span></p>
              <p>Perfect Stranger - A 2 hour episode of <span style="font-style: italic;">Law and Order</span> made for Lifetime TV. Plenty of twists, some too forced. Halle Berry is hot. - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Find
              Me Guilty - Feel good Courtroom Dramedy (Drama-Comedy) that seems like
              it's a made for a Hallmark Channel project. Very safe territory. - <span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITED FOR TV</span></p>
              <p>Freddy
              vs Jason - What's there to say. Does it have Jason, Freddy, sex and
              gore? Yes? Okay then, it delivers. Decent, not great. - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
              <p>Jumper - Interesting concept that turns into an excuse to have a 'visit the 100
              places to see before you die' list. Fun but not fantastic. - <span style="font-weight: bold;">RENTAL</span></p>
