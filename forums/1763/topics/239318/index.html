After failing to make ends meet, Gardner finds himself and his son evicted from their San Francisco apartment with nowhere to go. When he works as an intern at a prestigious stock brokerage firm, he and his son encounter many difficulties. Despite his troubles, Chris continues to honour his commitment as a loving and caring father, using the affection and trust his son has placed in him as an impetus to overcome the problems he faces.<br><br><img src="http://sg.yimg.com/i/sg/movies/360x250_pursuithappy9.jpg"><br><br><strong>Synopsis</strong><br>Have you ever had a day when your wallet is close to empty and you need money ever so badly? That very frustrating feeling is what haunts businessman Chris Gardner (Will Smith) day to day as he goes around trying to sell bone density scanners. Serving little importance, these scanners prove very difficult for Chris to sell and with numerous parking tickets together with outstanding rent and tax returns, Chris is pretty much in bad shape at the end of each day. Unable to cope with the financial strain, his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) leaves home.<br><br>Undeterred by this, Chris, now a single father to 5-year-old Christopher (Jaden Smith), explores the possibility of becoming a stockbroker. Little did he know that the internship programme offered didn't involve any salary for a month! Having no cash in hand, and the only money earned by his sales seized by the government for his tax, Chris and Christopher end up in the streets. This proves to be a challenging time for them as they go to the extent of spending nights in shelters and even a man's restroom. Through it all, Chris channels everything into mastering his skills for stockbroking, relying on the trust that his young son has in him.<br><br>Chris Gardner finds himself attending the interview clad with paint smeared clothes and body after a day in jail, meeting in an accident and turning up for work with just one shoe and having to hand his last five dollars to an executive in the company. In tears and close to break down in various instances, we see him standing out amidst the rest as he works his way into the company.<br><br>Based on a true story, this movie has a very down-to-earth perspective highlighting that even in today's modern society, there are many homeless people roaming the streets due to the choices made in their lives. Will Smith plays the perfect role depicting one with such strong determination and we are reminded several times during the movie that the declaration of Independence itself states that we have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<br><br>"Don't ever let somebody tell you you can't do something ... You got a dream, you gotta protect it ..." Thus as Chris Gardner reminds his son, the film is an awakening to each one of us that we indeed do have the choice to chase the source of happiness in our lives. His sincere love for his son portrayed in this film along with all the tribulations he faced is moving indeed and if you're one who could do with a boost of inspiration, then go watch this film.<br><br>Oh, and if you haven't already questioned why its 'happyness' and not 'happiness' then its even more reason to watch and find out!<br><br><img src="http://sg.yimg.com/i/sg/movies/360x250_pursuithappy1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://sg.yimg.com/i/sg/movies/360x250_pursuithappy4.jpg"></div>
