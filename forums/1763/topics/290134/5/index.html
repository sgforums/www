            <div class='col-md body'>Just watched it yesterday.<br><br>French scholar Michel de Nostredame predicted that doomsday will befall on 2012 which was probably why 2012 was choosen to be the date for the movie to be set.  It's a very depressing movie. But I read that someone said the ending was reshot. If the ending is that Robert was confronted by the dead for killing them, it'd be more closer to the original version by R. Matheson.<br><br>The whole movie seems to explore into the bible's book of Job. Whereby everyone you know is dead. Everything you have build is gone. Your enemies are all over you. And where is God at this moment.<br><br>The loss of Sam was really heart wrenching. I like doggies very much. Even though she was only a dog, yet Sam was Robert's only companion since the apocalyse. With her death, Robert was overwhelmed by his grief to avenge the death of his dog that he'd go head on in a SUV against the more powerful and outnumbering dark seekers. He was simply prepared to die.<br><br>My friends and I were discussing about parts of the movie like the never ending supply of fuel, generators always operate for electricity, unlimited supply of food, ammo.<br><br>Also talked about the difference between the original and the movie. The ending was rather arupt. But we all enjoyed the movie. This movie requires an extremely good actor and Will Smith fits the bill perfectly.  His performance compensated the storyline loopholes.<br><br></div>
