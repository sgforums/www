Besides, not everybody likes watching movies which are too true to life and remind them of the pain in their real lives.<br><br>So most movie studios make a balanced mix of money-churning popcorn flicks and critically-acclaimed arthouse movies to cater to different tastes. And directors of the popcorn flicks are usually too busy thinking up ideas that would entertain the audience to bother about realism. Not to mention different people have different acceptance levels of realism as well, thus it is virtually impossible to make a movie, especially of the action or science-fiction genre, that could convince <span style="font-style: italic;">everybody</span> of its realism.<br><br>So in general, "suspension of disbelief" is an option left to the audience.</div></blockquote>I agree in part with you. But i still feel that the director and the script plays a very important part here. Sometimes, they are soooo bad that there isn't much of an option. Eg. Van Helsing.<br><br>I gather the island isn't that bad?</div>

They may not have always been well-received by critics, but the box office results have nevertheless made Bay one of the most popular directors in Hollywood.<br><br>In this aspect, "The Island" is no exception. The plot has the usual loopholes, but this movie, as one has mentioned in an earlier post, deserves some extra credits for touching on certain ethical issues of human cloning.<br><br>On a personal note, one has high hopes on the new "Transformers" live-action movie that Bay is currently working on. It may not be of the same calibre as "Schindler's List" or "The Shawshank Redemption", but it'd be good fun.</div>
