              <p>This is not the kind of usual movie but a Stage script on a movie screen.....You have to like  Larry David. and Woody Allen. There is a lot of monolog. But the movie screen keep it in perspective as a movie.</p>
              <p>I like this movie because it is Straight Talker and i think Larry David is just great.</p>
              <h2>Synopsis</h2>
              <p>After the failure of his career, his marriage, and his suicide attempt, world-class grouch Boris Yellnikoff, spends his days insulting the small children unfortunate enough to study chess with him and irritating his still-loyal friends with his never-ending tirades about the worthlessness of absolutely everything. A former Columbia Professor and self-proclaimed genius who came close to winning a Nobel Prize for Quantum Mechanics, Boris fancies himself the only one who fully comprehends the meaningless of all human aspirations, and the pitch-black chaos of the universe. As he readily admits, Boris is not a "feel-good person."</p>

              <p>the power of 2 misanthropes combine to make whatever works an enjoyable movie. </p>
              <p>imo woody allen is a gifted comedian and screen writer, anything written and directed by him is worth the watch. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> </p>
              <p>one complain though, the role of boris is really designed for a younger woody allen. larry david's performance is a little off pitch in this one, i much prefer him in curb your enthusiasm. </p>
              <p>i wonder why the best screen writers all happen to be jews... woody allen, charlie kaufman, tony kushner, the coen brothers...</p>
              <p>highly recommend MatchPoint, Stardust Memories, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Crimes and Misdemeanors for those who enjoyed this movie. </p>

              <p>if u're turned off by his paedophiliac tendencies, don't watch stardust memories or manhattan. </p>
              <p>imo we're always inside the character's (woody allen) thoughts, so even if they don't literally 'leap out' of the 2nd dimension n interact with us, the point has long been made. since the 1970s, every film is auto biographical and most of his works are self referential. </p>
              <p>loyal fans like me are just happy he's still making movies because dementia from non working worries him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>will be nice if he uses an unreliable narrator though... sort of woody allen spurns his own alter ego. </p>
              <p>like matchpoint n vicky cristina barcelona, whatever works is just dancing around the idea that fortune death love and sex is mostly random chance/luck except WW ends on a very hopeful note. glad u like it!</p>
