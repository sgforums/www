When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion a ragtag group of retired superheroes Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity but who is watching the watchmen?</p>

              <p><em>LONDON - The $120 million comic book adaptation "Watchmen," one of
              2009's most eagerly awaited films, has had its world premiere in
              London, and reviews on Tuesday generally cast the movie as classy but
              no classic.</em></p>
              <p><em>The red carpet launch late on Monday of the special
              effects-laden action thriller is the culmination of years of to-ing and
              fro-ing over scripts, budgets and, finally, a legal dispute between
              rival Hollywood studios.</em></p>
              <p><em>Directed by Zack Snyder, whose "300" was
              a box office winner in 2007, Watchmen is based on a 1986 comic book
              series of the same name written by Briton Alan Moore and illustrated by
              compatriot Dave Gibbons.</em></p>
              <p><em>Critics gave it mixed reviews, with several predicting approval from the hardcore comic book fan fraternity.</em></p>
              <p><em>How it plays to a wider audience, however, will be more important to its commercial prospects.</em></p>
              <p><em>"For
              those just watching Watchmen for the Watchmen, without any expectations
              or knowledge of the comic's storyline or historical importance, this
              really will be a blast," wrote Mike Ragogna in the internet newspaper
              The Huffington Post.</em></p>
              <p><em>But Robbie Collin, of Britain's top-selling tabloid weekly News of the World, disagreed:</em></p>
              <p><em>"This
              two-and-a-half-hour wannabe pop culture epic isn't the worst superhero
              movie ever made ... But it is one of the most spirit-crushingly
              disappointing," he said.</em></p>
              <p><em>MOORE-LESS</em></p>
              <p><em>As with other movies
              based on his stories, Moore has distanced himself from the film, which
              hits cinemas in Britain and the United States on March 6.</em></p>
              <p><em>Asked
              if Moore was likely to watch the movie, deemed "unfilmable" by some in
              the business, Snyder told Reuters: "Look, you know Alan has famously
              said 'I don't want anything to do with it' and I just try and respect
              that as much as I can."</em></p>
              <p><em>Watchmen is set in an alternate 1985
              United States, where the "Doomsday Clock" charting U.S. tensions with
              the Soviet Union, is permanently set at five minutes to midnight.</em></p>
              <p><em>When
              one of his former colleagues is found murdered, masked vigilante
              Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all
              superheroes, both past and present.</em></p>
              <p><em>The film contains scenes of
              sex and violence, earning it an R rating in the United States meaning
              under-17s can only see it with a parent or adult guardian, limiting its
              commercial potential.</em></p>
              <p><em>The fate of the film was in doubt until
              last month, when studios Warner Bros and News Corp's Twentieth Century
              Fox reached a settlement in a copyright infringement dispute.</em></p>
              <p><em>Warner
              Bros, a unit of Time Warner Inc, produced the film, but Fox sued Warner
              last year to stop its release. Fox, which acquired the rights to the
              "Watchmen" story in 1986, claimed it had a continuing stake in the
              project.</em></p>
              <p><em>Warner was also behind The Dark Knight, the Batman
              sequel which was last year's biggest grossing film globally with ticket
              sales of $1 billion. "Iron Man" was another superhero hit grossing $582
              million worldwide, according to ticket tracking site
              www.boxofficemojo.com.</em></p>

              I suppose everyone would have known by now how Alan Moore really distanced himself from the cinematic version of his highly acclaimed graphic novel. And in all honesty, it's all about control, given that you've written one of your career's best, only for some other guy to roll along, and to interpret it in another medium. It's akin to acceding and handing over your pet project to someone else whom you have no inkling of whether they can do a good job out of it, and it's really a risk put out there since itâ€™s a mass medium, different from where Moore insists Watchmen should belong to â€“ in print.

              <p>Well, hit or miss, at least the Hollywood executives are starting to do stuff correctly or at least on the right track...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you compare this adaptation to the previous Allan Moore's "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" movie... this "Watchmen" movie is way way better.</p>

              <p><span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_m_comments_m_commentsDG_ctl03_m_commentsLBL">I
              really think most viewers won't understand the whole situation of
              the cold war, nuclear warfare, etc. I mean most of the viewers of the
              movie (as it is being marketed) will be people who can't remember two
              germanys, the berlin wall, the threat of Russia looming over the US in
              Cuba, the nuclear race for warheads or any of that matter. <br><br>However,
              since it is being marketed as a blockbuster special effects movie, I think
              it will probably do fairly good in the box office. I mean when people
              go to see X-men, Transformers, Hellboy, 300, etc, most people just want
              to see special effects that they haven't seen before, not paying
              attention to historical events and a lot of people usually don't care
              much about the story (Independence day anyone?).<br><br>Therefore I
              think it will do fairly good at the box office, just don't expect
              people to walk out talking about the intrinsic hero/antihero dilemma,
              the implications of a walking nuclear warhead, the morality of Veidt's
              actions, the psychology behind Rorscharch, etc. They will probably walk
              out talking about how cool Snyder is and how the special effects were
              so awesome. </span></p>

              <p>ya, i definitely didn't really understand the plot. it's abit messy.</p>
              <p>i like rorscatch though. and i really dislike the comedian. </p>
              <p>what i understood was, the blond guy, in order to cause usa and russia to unite under a "less of the 2 evils" scenario, used dr manhattan as the larger evil, and the comedian knew or smth, tts why he was killed.</p>
              <p>i think the quote of the movie is "NONE OF YOU UNDERSTAND, I'M NOT LOCKED UP IN HERE WITH YOU, YOU'RE LOCKED UP IN HERE WITH ME!" =D</p>
