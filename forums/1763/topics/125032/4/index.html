Set 10 years after the last movie, The Legend of Zorro wastes no time in plunging the audience thick into trademarked action pieces that many associate with the Spanish Fox - the acrobatic lunges, flips, swordfights, whip action and horseback riding.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/legend-of-zorro.html</div>

The filmmakers try to up both the intelligence and babe factor by introducing Bond Girl Rosamund Pike (she's a distraction alright) to the plot, but her *ahem* assets fail to maximise the thin plot. With mercenary soldiers, we see the typical sterotyped characters like the rookie, the maverick, the questionable orders, and the hero with a buried past.<br><br>Read the rest at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/doom.html</div>

Sky High is all these and, surprisingly, a whole lotta fun too! Sometimes music makes the movie for me, and when I heard "Everybody Wants To Rule The World", I knew the filmmakers had this done right, for a superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/11/sky-high.html</div>

I believe the trailer does not even hint at this having courtroom drama-mama moments, to which many in the audience that I watched this with, went "bor-ring", "dull", and disappointed many horny teenage boyfriends who thought they could eat tofu with each frightening scene.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/11/exorcism-of-emily-rose.html</div>

Also, with the string<br>of disappointments so far with Mob Sister and Election (the edited<br>version shown here), I'd thought that this one would've lived up to its<br>potential (no coincidence that Yam was in the other 2 films mentioned).<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/11/spl.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Saw II<br><br>I'm such a fan of the original - I like blood and gore, and Saw had one of the more intriguing and sick stories around, which saw the introduction of an original villain in recent memory, Jigsaw. What worked in the first film was the strange premise of 2 seemingly unrelated characters being put in a life and death situation, forced to compromise or die together. Also, the twist at the end was oh-so-nicely done, that it just begs for a sequel to be made.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/11/saw-ii.html</div>

Although this review will be working on the premise that it is a stand alone film, I can't help to notice that, unfortunately, the book told the better story, in terms of characterization (ok, so the movie is relatively short, clocking in about 90mins) and the back story on Tom's (Viggo) history.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/12/history-of-violence.html</div>

Life is like the movies, in which you are the director, producer and the star. In your life, there are other co-stars, and of course, that significant other. But what if you happen not to be sharing the limelight in your other's life? Editing is always a pain, and in the final product, you will then learn if you are sharing the same billing, get relegated to a cameo, or in the worst case, get cut out entirely and lie on the floor of the editing room.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/12/perhaps-love.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Broken Flowers<br><br>Don changes girlfriends like he changes his underwear. Not that he wants to, but his character makes him a difficult person to be with. We're led to believe that he has made enough from his computer business, and is in semi-retirement mode, doing nothing but watch television at the comfort of his home. His latest squeeze, played by Julie Delpy, has left him (gee what a cameo), and so did countless others before her.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/12/broken-flowers.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Elizabethtown<br><br>Before I begin, I confess that I am a Cameron Crowe fan, having seen most of his movies, which I enjoyed, and having met and spoken to him during his Vanilla Sky premiere in Singapore back in late 2001 (with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz in attendance as well). So you might think that this review is biased, that I'm gonna praise this movie sky high. Fact is, I will, only because it's an enjoyable film, with many fascinating facets to it, and one which made me ponder through the points presented throughout.<br><br>While most critics (pah! what do they know?) panned this movie,<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/01/elizabethtown.html</div>
