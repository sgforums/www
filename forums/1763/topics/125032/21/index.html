This Singapore-Shanghai co-production, written and directed by Aubrey Lam, is surprisingly full of arthouse sensibilities, but with all the wrong reasons in doing so, making this less than 90 minute film feel like a plodding dinosaur, hinging on the acting prowess of Karena Lam and Lu Yi (Jasmine Women, Seven Swords).<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/anna-anna.html</div>

I asked why, and got no reason simply other than the curt "not interested". I guess Hindi movies still get stuck in the old "dancing around the coconut tree" mindset, and trying as hard as I can, my persuasive powers fail me. But that of course can never deter me from watching the movie, and I've not regretted an iota for spending a good 142 minutes on Saawariya (Beloved).<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/saawariya.html</div>

If Hello Kitty and the Sanrio gang are deemed to girly, and the Ultraman/Power Rangers/Masked Rider et al deemed to manly, then Doraemon is just the perfect creation to appeal to boys and girls. A futuristic cat with more than a bagful of fantastic gadgets springing out from his pouch, my first brush with the character was through the animated television series, and later through translated comics. I still remember vividly the Doraemon gigantic soft toy (comes without the cotton wool/sponge insert, and you have to DIY) was the #1 toy that NS boys bring back from overseas during my time.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/doraemon-movie-doraemon-nobita-no-kyry.html</div>

No, it's not about Paris Hilton (you can wager some money that one will be out in future), but probably a precursor to her, a woman called Edie Sedgwick, who lived and died hard and fast. It's not the first time where we have rich young girls choosing a totally different career path for herself, the other in recent memory being Domino Harvey, played by Keira Knightley in Domino.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/factory-girl.html</div>

Gone are the fantastical elements and scores of ready, adoring fans, and in comes a serious dramatic piece about the coming of age, growing up, and raging hormones.

He continues that effort with Beowulf, a take on the legendary warrior now given the spin by writers Neil Gaiman (whose Stardust is still playing in theatres) and Roger Avary.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/beowulf.html</div>

While there are whispers about the Kingdom's role in today's security climate, it itself is not immune to the violance that extremists dish out (the Riyadh Bombings), and here's where scribe Matthew Michael Carnahan adapts from, and makes it the key catalyst in having an action adventure set in the oil rich sultanate. While his Lions for Lambs was mainly a talkie picture painting his current perspective of the war on terror from and on US soil, here he crafts a companion piece for those lusting for action.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/kingdom.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Hero<br><br>Movies based on successful television series are natural progressions to make a quick buck, mainly because of the more instant box office dollars it gets translated to. But what I apprehend the most, is when the approach is to not worry whether non-television series followers would be able to get it, so it decides not to afford the time to explain matters, expecting the bulk of the audience to be coming with background knowledge from the series. When you are one of the series' followers, you'll make camp on the side to forgo previous cinematic time on explanation so that the pace does not get slowed, but if you are not, then you'll probably cry foul, not that you don't get to enjoy the movie though, but are lusting after a more complete experience.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/hero.html</div>

He put this character in Russia, and got him embroiled in some political intrigue that's way over his head and should not have involved him in the first place. Naturally, our anti-hero (he's a professional thief by the way) bites back, using skills he honed to perfection, and basically relying on his smarts to escape near misses. His charisma ensured he had a beauty with brains tagging along, albeit reluctantly but given no choice with her involvement in the scheme of things, before forging trust, and possible romance.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/hitman.html<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Heartbreak Kid<br><br>The Heartbreak Kid brings Stiller back to the Farrelly Brothers' fold, joining forces again to bring in the laughs in a situation that unmarried guys my age fear. While we may be nonchalant about staying single and enjoying the status to sow our wild oats, there's always this nagging thought about what would happen when we seem to have met that special someone who could be just the very person to spend the rest of our life with. Thinking about "forever", that it's a long time, make us go into weighing in the pros and the cons of giving up our freedom, and we just want to be darn sure (and suicidal) to be giving up our singlehood.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/heartbreak-kid.html<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Ten Commandments<br><br>I suppose Biblical stories will never run out of fashion, though I find it a bit strange that amongst the numerous potential stories for retelling, the story of Moses got chosen again, and for an animated movie no less, although this one's done in 3D. Remember Prince of Egypt? Dreamworks Animation pretty much nailed it, especially when you have a relatively sucessful hit song as a byproduct (played ad nauseam until it became an irritant). Comparisons are inevitable given the content and the form, and unfortunately, this movie with input from IVL Animation (Singapore) didn't surpass the benchmark set by Prince of Egypt, but it's a slight improvement to the local 3D animated movies that have been released to date (that of Zodiac: The Race Begins and Tales of the Sea).<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/12/ten-commandments.html<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium<br><br>Dustin Hoffman doesn't really quite marquee a movie now, doesn't he? I still remember one of his earlier classics as The Graduate which still remains one of my favourite films ("Do you want me to seduce you?"), and his award winners like Rain Man, Tootsie, Kramer vs Kramer, or even commercial movies like Hero, Hook and Sphere. Lately though I felt he's relegated to support status and bit roles within ensembles, and even though he's the titular character of Edward Magorium, his screen time is still limited, mirroring Magorium's passing of the baton to Natalie Portman's Molly Mahoney the store manager.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/12/mr-magoriums-wonder-emporium.html<br></div>

For those, like me, who have grown up in the 80s watching television cartoons like Mask, Transformers, He-Man, there are those which are less action based, such as Peanuts, and of course, Alvin and the Chipmunks, featuring the trio of Alvin, the de-facto ringleader, Simon the smart one (hence the cliche glasses) and the greedy Theodore.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/12/alvin-and-chipmunks.html<br></div>
