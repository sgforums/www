            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Munich<br><br>The Munich 1972 Olympic games will forever go down in infamy for the killing of Israeli sportsmen by a terrorist group known as Black September. If you wish to know more about the motives and happenings on that fateful day, including the ineptness of the Germans to manage the entire situation, resulting in the deaths of almost all the perpetrators and the victims, do check out the documentary One Day In September. But not to say that Steven Spielberg's Munich fares any less. My recommendation is to watch the documentary first if you wish to understand more of what happened before, then to follow up with Spielberg's movie for the tale of what happened after when the Mossad went after the mastermind planners. So that you'll not be as irritating as the bimbo sitting behind me asking her equally clueless boyfriend "what happened? Why like that?"<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/02/munich.html</div>

I hope I'll be able to dwell much more on what this movie meant to me, and how I related to it. It isn't easy, as my thoughts have been rather scattered, because Gubra meant a lot as I ponder during different times. I am most likely to watch it again, after yesterday's world premiere at GV Grand. So before I begin, let me warn you that the rest of this review (if I may still call it so) is full of spoilers. So watch the movie, then come back and read the rest of it. We will agree to disagree, and I truly welcome your views on your emotions towards this excellent movie. But before you leave, remember, you ABSOLUTELY MUST stay behind for ONE SCENE at the END OF THE CREDITS.

It's a challenging role, one in which she plays a transsexual. No, not a woman who wants to become a man, but the reverse.

One which isn't kind to its genre to begin with, highlighting the evil witch and wolf characters and their impending bloody demise in each tale. The Chinese title "Ren Yu Duo Duo" will already hint about the fairy tale from which this movie draws its inspiration from, with "Ren Yu" being mermaid (in this context).

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Three Times<br><br>Taiwanese auteur Hou Hsiao-Hsien's movie at The Picturehouse is a movie with three stories told very distinctly, one story after another. Take it as three short films rolled into one, with each actor playing different roles, each character having no distinct relation to their counterparts in different eras. Having them set in 1966, 1911 and 2005 provided vastly different material for each short film to stand out from one another.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/03/three-times.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Ultraviolet<br><br>I hate to say this, but Ultraviolet is this year's Elektra. It's a bad hybrid of Aeon Flux, Underworld, Resident Evil and Elektra combined using the production style of Sky Captain, shot against digitally created scenes. Not that it is bad though, I actually sincerely believed, from the trailer, that it had potential to be a really good Milla Jovovich vehicle. Sadly, I was quite disappointed.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/03/ultraviolet.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Ice Age 2: The Meltdown<br><br>Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/03/ice-age-2-meltdown.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Inside Man<br><br>It's a slick heist thriller, which doesn't conform to the notions of how a heist movie should be. It's the feel good factor at the end of the movie that makes this movie satisfying. This is perhaps the most accessible, and commercial of all Spike Lee Joint films. I'd watch it again, for its engaging politicking story, and for that opening credit sequence.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/04/inside-man.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Rent<br><br>The musical movie reunites most of the original cast in the Broadway production, making it a pretty accurate film version in terms of having the right persons play the roles they've already become familiar with. Telling the life of a struggling group of Bohemians in the East Village of New York City, having the musical immortalized on celluloid enabled the production to reach out to commercial masses at the price of a movie ticket.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/04/rent.html</div>

Stay until the end of the credits roll. Not only will you be entertained by the song sung by Will Ferrell during the roll, and some ad-lib at the end about buying 'Mein Kampf' from Borders, Barnes and Noble, and Amazon, you'll be treated to one last short song-dance sequence sung by almost all the cast in turn, telling you to get lost, get out because the movie's over.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/04/producers.html</div>

Manny is your average guy who has been luckless in love. Karen is your attractive television anchor, the quintessential party girl who doesn't know what she wants in a partner. They meet by chance at a pub, and Manny falls for her, hard, after a series of dates. However, Karen only thinks of him as a friend (don't they always?) and soon enough, the couple breaks up.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/04/focus-first-cuts-2-ill-call-you.html</div>
