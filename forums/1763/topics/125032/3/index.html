Given that the 3 stories each touch on different kinds and stages of love, I'm certain the audience can identify with it at certain points in the film's time.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/09/be-with-me.html</div>

Jackie Chan, after the relatively successful return to HK movie industry with the release of New Police Story, teams up once again with Stanley Tong (Rumble in the Bronx) for starters. Tong wrote the story of The Myth, casting Jackie Chan in a never seen before role (yes, audiences are tired with his cop roles already) as a Qin dynasty general. What's refreshing too is that the role requires the use of a real weapon (a sword in this case), rather than having JC's character improvising with tools from his environment.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/09/myth.html</div>

I've pretty much enjoyed their collaborations, from Edward Scissorhands to Sleepy Hollow. Hot off the heals from their box-office success Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, their latest collaboration sees Depp lending his voice to Burton's macabre vision in a stop motion animated movie, along the veins of Nightmare Before Christmas (NBC).<br><br>The story's a little bizarre, a little morbid, but hey, it's Burton on familiar grounds. The Von Dorts and the Everglots have agreed to an arrange marriage between their children Victor (Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson), but Victor, fumbling the marriage rehearsals, runs away to seek solace, and accidentally unleashes the Corpse Bride Emily (Helena Bonham Carter, giving the character an impeccable Brit accent). So begins a crazy love triangle of sorts, involving characters from both the realm of the living and the dead.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/tim-burtons-corpse-bride.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Flightplan<br><br>It's Panic Room in the skies! This is the second inflight entertainment (pardon the jab) movie from Hollywood this year, the other being Wes Craven's recent Red Eye. Jodie Foster again plays a vulnerable yet tough as nails mum, who is on a flight with her six year old daughter from Berlin to New York, taking with them the body of their recently deceased husband/father in a coffin (in the cargo hold of course).<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/flightplan.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Transporter 2<br><br>Jason Statham is back as Frank Martin, a man who lives by his own rules, a man with a military past who now works as a transporter, a man of few words, a man of action. Little has changed since the end of the first movie, he still drives a cool car, though the BMW has been traded for an Audi A8L W12, and ploughing the streets of Miami, girls still find him irresistable (who can forget Shu Qi appearing at his doorstep and throwing herself at him? Here, Amber Valletta does the same. Lucky dude), and the men can't wait to sock his face.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/transporter-2.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Sympathy for Lady Vengeance<br><br>I won't be surprised to see hordes of housewives watching Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, given the Korean drama penetration into Asian households, especially the wildly popular Jewel In The Palace starring the same lead actress Lee Young-ae. Then again, given the theme on revenge, filled with its fair share of blood and gore, this new movie by Park Chan-wook might appeal to just a select few.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/sympathy-for-lady-vengeance.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Dreamship Surprise (Raumschiff Surprise - Periode 1)<br><br>This movie is so insanely gay! And I mean it in both sense of the word. No wonder this comedy broke the German box office with its madcap, low-brow, at times, crass humour. But it's all in good fun.<br><br>If you're looking for a plot, be reminded that a spoof-fest only has an outline of what resembles a story. The story's not award winning material to begin with, and it was never the intention of doing so.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/dreamship-surprise-raumschiff-surprise.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: High Tension (Haute Tension)<br><br>This film has finally made its way to our shores, uncut. For a slasher flick, it's bloody good, pun intended. If you've read me enough, you know that I'm a sucker for revenge films and zombie flicks. The occasional slasher flick appeals to me too, and this one doesn't disappoint, in the delivery of the material that is.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/high-tension-haute-tension.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Domino<br><br>Heads you live. Tails you die. Her name is Domino Harvey. She is a bounty hunter. This unconventional film is based very loosely on the true unconventional life of the daughter of actor Laurence Harvey. Losing her father at an early age, Domino grew up with her mother and lived the good life as a rich girl, becoming a Ford model at one point. But she has always been the aloof social outcast, and tend to loathe the high life (Beverly Hills brat-packers) she has been brought up in. She doesn't mince her words, and packs a wallop of a punch too.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2005/10/domino.html</div>
