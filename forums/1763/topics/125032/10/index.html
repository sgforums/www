            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Banquet<br><br>It's an oriental kung fu Hamlet.<br><br>Everyone's been saying it's loosely based on Shakespeare's tragedy, and to some, the movie's indeed a tragedy with its slowness in pace and lack of action, but I'd like to see it as because of its heavy reference to Hamlet (the poisoned quill, and many other plot points and scenes), it sort of created a crutch on which to lean the movie upon, hence the familiarity to some, therefore having the source serving as a double edged sword - the movie beholden to it and eventually ending it on a weak note.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/09/banquet-ye-yan.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: John Tucker Must Die<br><br>John Tucker Must Die has one of the most interesting trailers for a commercial cheesy girly flick, and it works to a certain extent, with the similarity in playing along the same lines as the Kill Bill title. I remember vividly each time after the trailer was aired, that some girls seated around me will almost always squeal with delight, so it's really no wonder if this flick proves to do well at the box office.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/09/john-tucker-must-die.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Absent (Ausentes)<br><br>To its credit, it does keep you guessing. As the premise goes, a serene family of four moves into the suburbs, only for Julia (Ariadna Gil) the mom experiencing things that go bump, even in the day. Loving husband Samuel (Jordi Molla) and kids Felix (Nacho Perez) and Luis (Omar Munoz) do not experience these strange phenomenon, and therefore this leads to tension within the family.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/09/absent-ausentes.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Imagine Me &amp; You<br><br>Rachel (Piper Perabo, a dead ringer for Rachel McAdams) and Hector (Matthew Goode, from Match Point) are about to get married after years of courtship. On their wedding day, Rachel notices Luce (Lena Headey) from the corner of her eye, and from brief introductions turned into family gatherings, turned into something more. Rachel experiences strange feelings for Luce and the feelings turned out to be mutual, but what about Hector? It's a classic case of everyone's worst nightmare come true, finding out that the person you're about to marry, or have married, actually loves somebody else, and that someone else being the same sex just compounds the effect.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/09/imagine-me-you.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: P.S.<br><br>At first glance the premise of the movie seemed a little like Nicole Kidman's Birth, where someone who's already dead gets reincarnated into a boy who seemed to know all her/their dirty little secrets. Anyway that was my first thought when I heard about the plot outline for P.S., but that said, this story couldn't be anywhere near Birth.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/09/ps.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Little Miss Sunshine<br><br>But wait, before you roll your eyes at yet another story with quirky characters, this one probably proved itself to be relatively superior given its easy going delivery, never taking itself too seriously with the messages it tried to put across, and the cast is a joy to behold. Telling the story of the Hoover family's journey cross-country to bring their young daughter to the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, it's an insane road trip movie as well in their yellow family mini-van.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/09/little-miss-sunshine.html</div>
