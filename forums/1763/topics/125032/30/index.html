              <p>A Nutshell Review: Lakeview Terrace</p>
              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">Watching this movie brought back some memories of the well-publicized spat between neighbours in the neighbourhood of Joo Chiat, with their antics which included the shining of spot lights at each other's house, the trading of barbs and insults, and the use of video recorders to tape down the other's antics. Naturally there are no weapons involved, but otherwise, Ithought Lakeview Terrace rang home some of the issues that these folks probably faced day to day. I'm not sure what the outcome of that spat is now though.</span></p>

              <p>A Nutshell Review: Sing to the Dawn</p>
              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">I believe this animated movie could be crowned as arguably the most expensive local movie ever made. After four long years since the idea was mooted to adapt from one of Singapore literature's most widely read books (thanks to secondary school literature lessons), and S$7.5 million to produce, it finally marks its release in the theatres this week. I wonder why the filmmakers and investors were brave enough to plough so much money into this production, given that the largest ever one-time box office gross for a local film was only about S$6 million dollars for Money No Enough, with no film in recent years ever getting close to that kind of amount.</span></p>

The DVD has countless of versions released to milk its fan base, that I've really lost count just how many variations (Encore? Extended Dance?) there are out there in the market. Even then I didn't really watch High School Musical 2 completely, only zooming into the catchy song and dance numbers, and as for the first movie, I was only familiar with one or two songs that became like anthems for working together?</span></p>

              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">REC has been making its rounds in the festival and cinema circuit, while us folks here have to sit around and twiddle our thumbs, wondering if it'll ever make it to our shores. Hollywood reckoned it was worthy of a remake, and they did Quarantine, which was surprisingly made quite fast, and was penned to be released here as well. Guess someone got smart and decided to pre-empt that remake version with the original, and for some, the decision will be whether to double dip, stick to the original, or the remake when it's released at the end of the month.</span></p>

              <p>While many have applauded the new direction that James Bond has taken with Casino Royale, the same would likely be scratching their heads wondering at Quantum of Solace, not only is the title bewildering on the surface, but the film felt like it might have all the ingredients of sealing Daniel Craig's stint as Bond, but yet also felt like a middle film of a trilogy, firmly continuing where we left off, but yet not being able to stand on its own for a lack of a clear and strong finish.</p>

While it's the usual pop-culture jokes and witty one liners that plague recent animated films, there were some gems in that movie, the ones which stuck suck as the crowd favourite penguins stealing the whole show, as well as the madcap rave party tune Move It!</span></p>

              <p>A Nutshell Review: Dostana</p>
              <p><span style="color: #236d8f; font-family: verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;">Dostana scores a number of firsts. One being set entirely in Miami, with the glorious shots of golden beaches and opportunities for the cast to show off their toned bodies (for the first few minutes, John Abraham seemed too eager to get rid of his singlet every few minutes). And the other first scored was that this is the first Bollywood film to have a focus on a gay relationship, albeit a faked one, between its two leading men. For an industry that's still sans on-screen sex, where kisses still bring upon rage, and nudity a no-no, is it any wonder why this premise, together with its A-list stars, will draw in the crowds without a doubt?</span></p>

After all, it's brought to us by Mamoru Oshii, and as far as his filmography goes, this Japanese maestro's works is often deep, and have more than enough room for multiple viewings, each time allowing you to take away something different, or unnoticed from the previous time round.</span></p>

              <p>A Nutshell Review: Cape No. 7</p>
              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">Based on the skimming of the synopsis alone, I thought Cape No. 7 bore some resemblance to an upcoming Japanese film The Shonen Merikensack which was featured in the recent Tokyo International Film Festival. Well, at least the characters have to come together to form a band, and are managed by a lady. And that this film had Japanese elements in it too. But this is a Taiwanese movie, and its success back at home, being its #1 film of all time, has undoubtedly raised the curiosity level as to what actually made this movie tick, so much so as to garner numerous nominations in this year's Golden Horse awards.</span></p>

After all, as far as Brad's mantra goes, you can't have families without "lies". Anyway it is a situation that I'm fairly familiar with, and his reaction when the television camera gets poked in his face, brought back the memory of my own busted moment many years back.</span></p>

For starters, it's a departure from the Orked storyline which the last three (or four if you count Rabun) had centered around, and quite amazingly, it's predominantly in the English language. Save for the return of Sharifah Amani in one of the lead roles, and supporting roles with Tan Mei Ling and even Ho Yuhang, we see new faces here, with leads Brian Yap and Sharifah Amani's real sister Sharifah Aleysha also in this film as her onscreen one.</span></p>

You have been warned.</span></p>

              <p>To echo the biggest fan in the film, Bolt is fully Awesome! Or at least the 3D version of this film, especially the first 10 minutes where we see the superdog in action, showcasing super powers such as his eyes shooting laser beams, speedy acceleration, super strength, and his signature super bark. These are the avenues where 3D gets put to good use, but don't expect every aspect of the film to come flying toward you from the screen.</p>
