Not that it's the work of the local film censors, as it's passed clean without cuts here, and watching the film transition between the scenes, it's gone without a hint of a bad edit. Somehow it's good to rid of the distractions to focus on the much touted cat and mouse game between Sir Anthony Hopkins' character and Gosling's, vis-a-vis a face off between a multi-award winning actor, and a young up and coming rising star.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/04/fracture.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: 28 Weeks Later<br><br>Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo takes over from Englishman Danny Boyle in the followup movie to the latter's excellent 28 Days Later, and has come up with something worthy. Should a third movie be made and doesn't screw up the good work already done, it should make a pretty neat trilogy. I enjoy the legendary George A Romero's zombies in his movies, though I have to confess I prefer those in the 28-later series, as their constant running pace provides a shot of adrenaline when our helpless victims try in futile to escape, and somehow in that reckless speed, make them truly terrifying (ok, cos I can't run, and if caught in that kind of situation, I'll be dead meat).<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/05/28-weeks-later.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Priceless<br><br>Directed by Pierre Salvadori, Pricess is one heck of a delightful gem. It is playful, cheeky, touching yet breezy, and boasts excellent chemistry between its leads, which is crucial to pull off a romantic comedy so dependent on their banter and interaction.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/05/priceless-hors-de-prix.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Next<br><br>I was wondering the strange selection of Nicolas Cage movies to hit the big screens here. There was no love for his Weather Man or Lord of War, which seem on the surface to be probable successes, and I thought World Trade Center was a mediocre effort, no doubt hitting the big screens because of the subject matter, and helmed by Oliver Stone, who seem to be quite muted and didn't turn on the controversy tap. His latest, recent effort in Ghost Rider was fun, but unmemorable.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/05/next.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Blades of Glory<br><br>I'm fast converting to a Will Ferrell Fan, given that I've laughed out loud at his silly antics, in particular, the recent effort in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. And now, joining forces with yet another up-coming comedian in Jon Heder (School of Scoundrels, The Benchwarmers), I had high hopes of watching Blades of Glory to chase the week's blues away.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/05/blades-of-glory.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Bridge to Terabithia<br><br>Based on a children's fantasy story written by Katherine Paterson, and produced by the same company that did the latest Chronicles of Narnia, I thought that the movie would probably be mediocre given my lukewarm response to films of similar genre like Pan's Labyrinth and The Last Mimzy. And how wrong was I. Bridge of Terabithia trumps over all the movies mentioned, basically because it had a good story to tell, and stuck to telling that story instead of being distracted by the bells and whistles of special effects.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/05/bridge-to-terabithia.html</div>
