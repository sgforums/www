            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest<br><br>It was peculiar, but it might be signs of things to come. When I entered the theatre this evening for the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest gala premiere today at Cathay, on screen was this static frame of the PoTC logo, with the words: "Singapore, Home of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, May 2007". If I may read too much into it, does it mean that there will be no effort spared in having the World Gala of PoTC3 right here on our shores, since Singapore was mentioned in both PoTC1 and PoTC2? And with Chow Yun-Fatt's wife being from here, does it mean we got an additional boost? One can only dream, but you heard it here first.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/07/pirates-of-caribbean-dead-mans-chest.html</div>

In my opinion, this one edged out Initial D. There are many aspects in which Tokyo Drift is superior, and naturally having a bigger budget means that the filmmakers can afford to put more cars on showcase, more cars involved in races, and more races in varied locations like a tight car park, on the streets of Tokyo, and as a homage too to the source, they couldn't miss the mountain range. Scenes were for both day and night, unlike Initial D's predominantly night scenes.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/07/fast-and-furious-tokyo-drift.html</div>

It had a whodunnit feel of a mystery that is carefully revealed layer by layer. The ensemble cast and characters were fantastic, with each character possessing usefulness to the story and to peer characters, and their eccentricities make them a joy to watch. You have the Korean mother and daughter, the Vietnam Vet, a father and son, a new neighbour, a group of cock-talkers, a guy who works out only his right side, and so on. Although most of them are one-dimensional, they are no less than endearing in their own way, like those in Cocoon or Batteries Not Included.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/07/lady-in-water.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Ant Bully<br><br>First, let's get the obvious out of the way. The ants in The Ant Bully look suspiciously similar to those in Antz (199<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Powered by voices from recognizable stars, Antz had a more direct romance theme applied to it, whereas I felt The Ant Bully had a stronger social message to put across, given atrocities that are happening in our world right now.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/08/ant-bully.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Crazy Stone<br><br>So far, the FOCUS: First Cuts series of movies have been rather mediocre. Taiwan's The Shoe Fairy was rather plain, Hong Kong's I'll Call You was concentrated too much on its effects, and Singapore's Love Story was just awful. The three aforementioned movies lacked a compelling story to tell, and I was holding my breath on how a movie titled Crazy Stone will present itself.<br><br>I bought into it, hook line and sinker, within the first ten minutes.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/08/focus-first-cuts-4-crazy-stone.html</div>

It's politically incorrect and doesn't make any apologies for doing so, but yet demonstrates a notion that we can be bigots, and yet not be consciously aware of it.

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The High Cost of Living<br><br>Just to share some quick thoughts on this new local movie. As you would've known by now, I've taken a keen interest in Singapore films, past and present. I got to admit this one was flying under my radar, and I didn't notice it until The Picturehouse publicized it in one of its recent email newsletters. The poster caught my eye, because it had a handgun on it. Sure you can laugh, but seriously, when was the last time you heard of a local action movie (and those co-produced by Mediacorp Raintree don't count)?<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/08/high-cost-of-living.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Lucky Number SLevin<br><br>It's a snappy, snazzy movie with a very slick plot, and I'll not discuss any more of the movie, the premise, nor the themes, otherwise it'll be a dead giveaway. Suffice to say that I'm quite impressed by the way the movie unfolded, and how the editing kept certain key scenes under wraps. However, it is difficult to stop eagle-eyed viewers whose brains are working in overdrive, to figure out the entire plot before the midway mark.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/08/lucky-number-slevin.html</div>
