            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Unleashed<br><br>This review is brought to you courtesy of Moviexclusive.com (otherwise it won't be out so early, and yup, my luck held out again and I won a lucky draw for free premiere tickets)<br><br>Unleashed, aka Danny The Dog (the original title, and the name of Jet Li's lead character), is the latest of a Euro-production meant for the Hollywood market, this one being a French-UK collaboration, with a mainly European production crew, of which the most recognizable name is French director Luc Besson, as the writer of this story.<br><br>Known for his gritty tales like The Professional and Kiss of the Dragon (also starring Li), you'd expect something special from Danny The Dog ("Unleashed" was just typed over the main credits, you'd know what I mean). However, the premise is a bit ludicrous and please, leave your brains at the door. Otherwise you'll have trouble understanding why Danny chose to be treated the way he is, given his incredible fighting prowess when his collar's off.<br><br>A title with "the dog", and references to dog-calling names like "attaboy", "bitch", etc, obviously do not go down well, and probably won't be tolerated by the Asian market, given the deragatory connotations, hence the classier name "Unleashed". Actually everything has doggie connotations - from the collar to Danny's new surrogate father being a blind man. Some characters bark occassionally too.<br><br>But the plot is a bit of a let down, given the main theme which it tries to dwell upon - Family, without much success. Danny lives in a world of thugs and violence, and this world turns upside down when he experiences the sweeter side of life - the normal ones that you and I lead, with Sam (Morgan Freeman) and Victoria (Kerry Condon). OF course when the thugs threaten the new family, you'd expect all hell to break loose as Danny fights to defend the opportunity of leading a new life.<br><br>While the action is stylized in the trailers, there isn't much to offer in the movies, despite its explosive start. You can plenty of throwaway characters that Jet dispatches without much sweat. Given the plot straddles between action and melodrama, the former somehow has less screen time - if you want to make an actioner with Jet Li, the action must stand out, no? All you get are basic street fights with Jet hammering away, and hammering, and hammering some more. You get the drift.<br><br>The soundtrack is done by Brit trip-hop masters Massive Attack (one of my fav groups), and I actually enjoyed their music being featured in the movie - I think I'm gonna enjoy it more as I identify the tracks being played at particular points in the movie.<br><br>I'm not sure if Jet Li had actually opted to do a more dramatic piece, but this film's premise offers him a weak chance to show his acting skills - the audience, in my opinion, as bloodthirsty as those in the underground fight club, secretly hopes that the drama be minimized. It does drag at times, and offers little depth to plot.<br><br>Reommended for Jet Li fans only, and even then you might come out disappointed with this effort. Luc Besson, surely you can write better stuff!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy<br><br>Resistance is useless! Don't panic! The answer is... 42!<br><br>I've read Douglas Adams' book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy once, as a young kid, so I can't really remember the details, and therefore, can't comment from a purist's point of view (heh, wish I had the Point of View Gun). What I can do however, is review the movie as it is, from a cinematic experience.<br><br>And it's fantastic! From the opening narrative, characterization, beautiful stunning CGI, especially on the creation of Earth, this film seems to do no wrong. The wit and dry humour play an important part, though some might not get all the jokes. And key to it all is the intelligent way in which the creators recreate The Hitchhiker's Guide - where slick animation vividly brings forth the tips and tricks to living life in the Galaxy.<br><br>The characters are always the highlight, and rightfully so. Who can forget Marvin the manically depressed robot, who (!) is brought to life on the silver screen. Sam Rockwell shines as the narcisstic President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox. Martin Freeman does a commendable job as Brit Arthur Dent, whose home is set for demolition for a highway (oh, the irony of it all), and Zooey Deschanel provides the eye candy as sassy Trillian. Mos Def as Ford Perfect rounds off the galaxy adventurers. The cameo by John Malkovich proves hilarious as Humma Kavula, religious cult leader waiting for the next big sneeze - Bless you! And I can sense the audience eagerly awaiting the appearance of Deep Thought, spouting that immortal line, the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything...<br><br>While you wonder at the marvels of technology in this sci-fi film (hey, there's a spoof from Star Wars), underlying it all is a simple love story that develops between Arthur and Trillian, and the challenges of admitting your affections to your partner.<br><br>Stay tuned during the end credits, as you get another Hitchhiker's Guide entry, which explains the aftermath of what happened after Arthur uttered the final words.<br><br>I've enjoyed this film tremendously, and I feel it should appeal to non-fans of the book as well, probably reining them in to read it. I know I would.<br><br>To Douglas, for creating this classic and developing new material for the film. So long, and thanks for the fish!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Mr and Mrs Smith<br><br>Nevermind the tabloids, this show is a must watch to see exactly how sizzling the chemistry is between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. And it's no surprise that Hollywood's sexiest couple wraps the entire show in their sensuality.<br><br>Brad Pitt is John Smith (a very generic name which was the highlight of a joke), construction foreman in the day, top killer at the side. Angelina Jolie is Jane Smith (again very generic), IT company CEO as a front, top assassin extraodinaire. Mr and Mrs Smith, living in suburbia New York, to everyone, a perfect marriage (and in my opinion, they do look good together)<br><br>This film takes a very successful and insightful look into relationships, courtship and marriage, albeit with a sprinkle of well timed humour. It's a joy to watch them showcase typical marriage problems (the film starts off with things not going too well after a very successful courtship) like the lack of communication, the petty arguments, the little deceitful secrets, and always, always accidents which somehow come across as deliberate actions. And when things get out of hand, who do they run off to for solace? Why, their best buddies of course! It's these situations that you can connect to in real life, that sets this show apart from your usual action flick.<br><br>They argue, they fight, especially when they find out that they work for rival assassin companies. From guns to knives to fist fights, the action is top class - always something different, always surprises around the corner. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and each time Jolie hits the roof, she's never short of bringing down the house!<br><br>Vince Vaughn shines as Pitt's sidekick Eddie, with his off the cuff remarks. And the film takes a subtle dig at one of Vince's earlier film Psycho, with his character living in solitude with his mom, whom we never see on screen. Fans of the TV Series OC will probably celebrate at Adam Brody's short appearance.<br><br>Before you groan at the action pieces (too many guns, too many chases, etc), let me assure you it's refreshing - not only you get to see the very attractive leads in action (yes, Jolie did the leap-off-the-building stunt herself), but the marital / relationship bickering thrown in for good measure worked buckets. It is with this ingredient (heck, I'm getting all homely now) that makes the highway chase here a tad more entertaining than the one in The Matrix Reloaded. And the finale shootout will make even John Woo extremely proud - sweet poetry in motion.<br><br>Ah, and the trailers don't give away everything (or anything for that matter), so it's a joy to watch when your thoughts get pulled from under (say, didn't the trailer suggest this, or was it that?) Never mind the trailer, watch this movie for what it is - rip roaring action, identifiable life experiences, and the sexy Angelina Jolie!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Batman Begins<br><br>No disrespect to Tim Burton, but Batman Begins blows away ALL the previous films, even Burton's. This is THE Batman film to date, and though Christopher Nolan did take some creative liberties on certain issues (i.e. deviate from canon), he managed to distill the essence of the character (make that all the characters) and put it into one 140min film. Excellent!<br><br>Unfortunately, as a fanboy, this review will be filled with spoilers, but I'll indicate those portions as I go along.<br><br>[Spoiler Paragraphs]<br>Some liberties stem from the flashback scenes of the Wayne murders. The Wayne family didn't actually watch an opera, it was a trip to the movies - "The Mask of Zorro", and Joe Chill, while accurately portrayed as the killer, and was after the pearl necklace (I shuddered when Thomas Wayne showed Bruce that item), Chill was never caught, and neither was he killed when leaving the courtroom. I suppose this was the major liberty taken, but I was felt ok with it.<br><br>There has been talk that Gordon was one of the cops who picked up Bruce, as shown in the film, but if given a choice, I would prefer a cameo by Dr Leslie Thomkins!<br><br>But what Nolan did to hit the head on the nail was to explore to some depth the history of the Wayne Family's involvement in Gotham City, from the railway track beneath the Cave, to the philantrophy of the family to their city. Good research done!<br>[End Spoiler]<br><br>The film runs in three acts, with the first being his training with the League of Shadows and flashbacks of his childhood days. It is during this training that sets Bruce/Batman's principle of never taking a life. And he doesn't. Therefore kudos to Chris Nolan. The Batman just doesn't kill, and neither does he use guns.<br><br>The next act is where the fun begins, as Bruce sets out his journey to rid Gotham of its criminal underworld. Classic scenes include the lone bat appearing in Bruce's room (thus his decision to dress as one), and the "exploration" of Wayne Enterprises with Lucius Fox to obtain his gear (hence the advance technology). Nolan teases the audience for an hour with all the preparation, before the Batman appears. It is dark, mysterious, and the action is fast. Some may complain that you "cannot see anything", but I would like to point out that's how Batman operates - swiftly and stealthily. He doesn't stand around! The anticipation of the baddies for his appearance all the more bumps up expectations, and it succeeds, to the pulsating score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. In particular, I liked the way Batman interrogated his victims - exactly like the comic books! You never saw this in any of the earlier films! I was like, hell yeah, that's exactly how it's done!<br><br>And the last act is where everything comes together - the action and the finale battle. Again, classic scenes were featured, like Gordon's collaboration with Batman, and Bat's trust in him, the very Year One scene of Bats against the SWAT team, and activating a signal to bring his backup of bats to assist in escape (though the scene in the film has changed to Arkham Asylum), and a Year One ending, which sets up a teaser for the sequel (I hope it happens!)<br><br>Fear is the running theme throughout - Bruce Wayne's fear of bats after accidentally discovering the Batcave beneath Wayne Manor, Gothamites' fear of the criminal underworld, Dr Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow's use of Fear as a weapon. The effects of the latter is fascinating to watch because of the effective use of CGI, as we see the victim's fear come alive [spoiler: I was especially pleased with Crane's vision of Batman when affected by his own gas]<br><br>Fans of the comics will get kicks from seeing serial killer Victor Zsas, and though it was somewhat a cameo appearance, he was given respect, unlike Bane's treatment under the hands of Joel Schumacher. We also got a glimpse of Gordon's wife Barbara and kid James Jr, and [spoiler: a mention of Ra's wife, and his reminiscence of her]. Although the Lazarus Pit was never mentioned, we'd probably know it could have been, given what progressed in the movie.<br><br>Many "bat-toys" in this film are born out of necessity rather than to sell more merchandise, which I though was excellent story telling. From his harness to his suit to the utility belt (finally, a working model!), to the cape (which doubles up as a glider) and of course to The Tumbler which would be the Batmobile.<br><br>And judge not a book by its cover. While the first appearance of this vehicle caused many fans to shake their heads in disbelief, watch this film and you see it being used in full glory - it ROCKS! There's also a running joke on how the vehicle was described - from "it's a... a... tank!" to "it's black... you'll know it when you see it"<br><br>Incidentally or otherwise, I felt this film also paid homage to Burton's films, [spoiler: with the rescue-the-girl-in-batmobile-race-to-cave-give-her-cure-send-her-home scene, and the discovery of Bat's identity though re-using dialogue that only the lovers know]<br><br>Singapore was also mentioned (twice) in the film, although it was sort of in negative light (as if we're a major smuggler's paradise) but what the heck! It was a hoot to hear how Bruce and Alfred plan to smuggle their bat-wares using the Wayne Enterprises cargo transhipping though our ports!<br><br>I give the thumbs up to casting Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He brought out the reluctance of living the double life (as the playboy, though he really hammed it up!), his need to getting used to late nights and morning alibis, and the tenacity and menace as the Dark Knight. Michael Caine IS Alfred Pennyworth - the never failing butler and surrogate father who never gave up hope on Bruce while delivery witty sarcasms, and his belief in the Wayne Family, Gary Oldman brought James Gordon into life and gave him the depth we are accustomed to in the comics (unlike earlier Pat Hingle versions). In summary, the casting was excellent, and everyone (except for Ken Watanabe) were given ample screen time to flesh their characters.<br><br>I'll be ready for a sequel, and I hope that the box office numbers will bring it on soon enough! My wishlist will be (apart from the obvious villain) to feature Harvey Dent, as they will definitely need a new District Attorney. If the sequel features this "trinity" of Gordon-Bats-Dent (and the prospect of Dent becoming Two-Face), I'll be in Bat Cloud Number Nine!<br><br>Highly recommended for fans and non-fans (you'll be converted) alike.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: In My Father's Den<br><br>Once in a while, Cathay@Orchard screens their exclusive showcase selection of films which are not part of your mainstream Hollywood offering. In My Father's Den is one such film, and it is not often that I dive head on into a film without knowing at least a bit of the background or production details.<br><br>This film is an NZ-UK production, and it sure is set in NZ alright when I saw the "Pump" brand of bottled water in one of the scenes. Can't get anymore authentic than that! However, I'm in two minds as to how to rate this film. The narrative is painfully slow (butt-numbing 2hrs 10 mins), but necessary to allow you time to think through what is going on, and the revelation of the ending, shocking yet somewhat expected.<br><br>Paul Prior is a renowned war photo-journalist who's back in NZ to attend his father's funeral. Although he missed it, being back home gave him the opportunity to touch base with his estranged brother and his wife (Lord of the Rings fan will recognize Miranda Otto here), his nephew, and hook back up with his ex-flame who's now married to somebody else.<br><br>During this time, he hooks up with one of his students, 16 year old Celia, whose outlook in life, and passion for writing, brought back memories of himself, as well as memories of his ex-flame Jackie. However, an old photograph triggers suspicion that Celia might be the child Jackie bore him, before he literally walked out on his family, and Jackie. Meanwhile, you get a feeling that Celia is beginning to develop feelings for Paul, which all the more should sound alarm bells.<br><br>But things turn for the worse when Celia goes missing, and Paul becomes the prime suspect for her disappearance. It is during the portion of the film that time is juxtaposed, which might make it a little confusing or irate the viewer. There are many characters in this film, and your mind will race as to sieve out the red herrings, and decide who's involved, and who's not.<br><br>The "den" in the title refers to a shed that Paul's father has, which is stashed with good books, and good vinyl music discs. Quite a number of good songs are played throughout, which makes the soundtrack appealing. Many pivotal events take place in this shed, being a place of refuge for Paul, to being a key element of suspense and shock to the audience when the twist is revealed.<br><br>The multi-faceted relationships between the characters form the theme of this film, and the cast put up excellent performances in bringing their roles to life. The ending, when revealed and when you think through it in its proper chronological order, is fulfilling, yet laced with a heavy dose of sadness.<br><br>So if you're in for some classic story-telling, from a plot that really takes its time to unravel, then this is recommended for you. If you'd prefer to get on with action, then you should stick to the blockbuster summer offerings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Upside of Anger<br><br>Starring Joan Allen (whom action fans will recognize as Sean Archer's wife) and Kevin Costner (I think I last saw him in Thirteen Days), this film tells the tale of relationships between an alcoholic mum and her 4 girls, when the man of the household apparently walked out on them to be in Sweden with his secretary.<br><br>And my, with 4 girls, it's eye candy galore - Keri Russell (Felicity anyone?), Erika Christensen (Swimfan), Evan Rachel Wood and Alicia Witt. This film takes its time to tell its tale of the bitterness felt by Allen when her husband left her. To manage this, she turns to the bottle, and naturally, things take their toil on inter-personal relationships.<br><br>With Russell, Allen compares the love she thought Russell had for her dad didn't measure up to the one Russell had for her. Allen imposes her will and desires on Russell, which bred contempt, and Russell thinks she isn't getting all the support she needs from her mom to pursue her dream of being a ballerina.<br><br>With Erika, Allen frowns upon her relationship with her manager "Shep", who is at least twice her age. It is hilarious watching Allen confronting "Shep", with the hard-hitting slaps, and her chancing upon her daughter having sex with him. Of mention is that "Shep" is also played by writer/director (of this film) Mike Binder (hmm... no prizes here)<br><br>With her eldest child Witt, Allen gets frustrated when she's the last to know, during Witt's graduation, that she is pregnant and intends to get married. The scene with the in-laws is laced with so much tension, you'll just be hanging onto your seat for the outburst.<br><br>The youngest child, and the narrator of the story, had to grapple with falling in love with a gay teenager, who happens to also come from a broken home. The scene in which she tests his "gayness" and challenges / questions his sexual orientation is classic.<br><br>Where does Costner come into all this? As a has-been baseball player who now deejays at a local station, who introduced Erika to "Shep", who becomes a drink buddy with Allen, who develops a likeable relationship with all the siblings - a surrogate father of sorts, and somehow seems to be able to take all the bitchiness that Allen exudes, and to almost always, diffuse tense situations.<br><br>There is a key theme running through all relationships, and that is to think before you shoot your mouth off. Sometimes sticks and stones may not hurt you, but words and misrepresented intentions often will.<br><br>It all comes to an end with a depressing revelation that makes you think, what if, and one in which makes all characters think through their current state of being, and to question, the upside of anger.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Initial D<br><br>Just to set the expectations from this review, I have not read the Initial D manga, nor watched any of the anime. Therefore this review's point of view will be from the cinematic experience, and there will be no comparison on how true it stays to the manga/anime.<br><br>Despite all the star power in the film, from teeny boppers Edison Chen and Shawn Yue, to veterans Kenny Bee and Anthony Wong, this still remains a Jay Chou vehicle (pardon the pun). Jay stars as a petrol pump attendant who by day works at a petrol kiosk, and in the wee hours of the night, helps his tofu selling dad deliver tofu in an old Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno using a route that traverses along a winding Mount Akina.<br><br>Naturally, with his 5 years experience, he intimately knows the terrain, and gets faster each time, until a group of street racers set their sights to conquer the route.<br><br>There will definitely be comparisons with Hollywood's The Fast and The Furious series, starring Vin Diesel/Paul Walker. The similarities are there - the fast cars, the beautiful racer babes, the rivalry between arrogant drivers. You even get the same cinematography technique used that starts from the driver's POV, pulling back to the dashboard, the rear seat, the boot, and the car from a "helicopter" view.<br><br>But what sets this film apart is the way it is delivered. Being based on a comic book offers some depth to the storyline, and it helped by staying true to the setting, being based in Japan and not HK. The races in itself might seem repetitive, as the highlight seemed to be focused on its title - the "drift" technique, being used ad-nausem, but having different drivers challenge each other on the one and only route breaks the monotony as you root for your favourite to come out tops.<br><br>Given this is Jay Chou's debut movie role, it is difficult to critique if his acting skills are up to mark, as his lead character Takumi Fujiwara is a nonchalant man of few words. Which is very much like his persona. His co-stars Edison Chen and Shawn Yue could very well be their own persons as well. Chapman To, as usual, brings across the rather light hearted moments, and Anthony Wong as Chou's dad, a veteran race ace who finds solace in the bottle and having a penchant for dozing off.<br><br>Perhaps the only flaw about the movie was the sappy romance between Jay and his Japanese co-star. Not that she isn't gorgeous (which is a saving grace), but their scenes together doesn't further the plot much, and slows down the pace somewhat of this movie about the need for speed.<br><br>This is an enjoyable flick, one in which I waited for the theme song / tune to be featured (only at the end credits!). But no, I don't think I will be converted to a Jay Chou fan boy anytime soon.<br><br>I suspect that in the upcoming weeks, we probably might see parallel imports / makes of the Trueno on our shores to satisfy the racer boy wannabes (heard Singapore only has 2?), although it probably can't run as fast as in the movies (movie magic lah). And yeah, the driving with one hand on the wheel and the other on the face, with the contemplating look.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: 9 Souls<br><br>This 2002 Japanese film is the third feature film showcased in the inaugural Singapore Fantastic Film Festival (The first two being Kontroll and Immortel, which I should be able to watch by the end of the fest).<br><br>9 Souls is at times a complex movie, and at times one which has a simple tale to tell. It blurs and crosses the line so often, it makes it difficult to try and classify its genre - part gore, part comedy, part social commentary.<br><br>The title refers to 9 prisoners, who are introduced in more detail during their escape from prison (in a very creative introduction by the way), ranging from murderers to a porn king, from a juvenile delinquent to a vertically challenged escape artist. It turns into part comedy once they escape, and have to find the means and substinence to help keep themselves alive in a strange new world.<br><br>Prior to their escape, their world is their prison cell, rudely interrupted by a tenth crazed prisoner, a counterfeit king who leaks out the secret to the whereabouts of his stash. With this bit of information, they embark on a quest to recover this lost promise of treasure before going their separate ways.<br><br>Which forms the second half of the movie. Throughout the first half, we are exposed to the dreams and hopes of these escape convicts. Being locked up for some time, they each have a secret desire to either reunite with their loved one, or have plans to live a better life. At some point, you will ponder if it was wise of them to each seek their dream, knowing its dire consequences, or would rather choose to stick together in their new found family.<br><br>Thoughts on second chances in life also crosses your mind, if these serious crime offenders deserve another break in life, or are forever condemned in the eyes of society for their one moment of folly which has kept them locked up.<br><br>The pacing of the film is at times choppy, and you'd have scenes that come out of the blue (like cross-dressing as a disguise). I heard quite a number of people around me give the "hmm... where did that come from" comment.<br><br>The soundtrack is kept simple, to a constantly played guitar tune, which in scenes of peace are kept soft, and in scenes of angst, being played to a crescendo. I find this effective in conveying emotions in the film, without the need of a bloated soundtrack.<br><br>Rated R21 here for its subject content and scenes of gore which is not really shown on screen, this film is recommended for those who seek a different film offering, which is what this film fest is striving to achieve.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: War of the Worlds<br><br>War of the Worlds marks the second collaboration between 2 of Hollywood's most influential figures, that of director Steven Spielberg and megastar Tom Cruise. In this updated adaptation of H.G. Well's classic, we revisit alien territory already familiar with Spielberg (with evergreens like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T.), except that this time around, the aliens are not an iota friendly and wastes no time proving its point with its laser beams.<br><br>Cruise plays Ray, a middle class salaried worker whose ex-wife (Miranda Otto, in an underused role) leaves their estranged kids with for the weekend. Being the selfish carefree man that he is, it is no wonder why he doesn't get much respect, especially from his son. Before you can say move on with the melodrama, worldwide lightning phenomenon gets TV coverage, and soon enough, the horror begins, as the well known battle tripods rise from beneath the earth and annihilate everything on site.<br><br>The special effects are brilliant, and serves as an effective plot device for unspeakable, unexplainable horror. Spielberg teases you with indirect shots of the tripods, from mirrors and reflective surfaces, never letting you see from a first person's perspective for too long, keeping in pace with the initial suspense built.<br><br>Terrorist attacks were mentioned in conversation, and perhaps this movie also serves as a timely reminder of always being prepared, with emergency equipment, stashes of food, and familiarity with emergency procedures.<br><br>This film could take the easy way out and focus on the big explosions ala Independence Day, but since that was already done, we get to focus on the smaller picture, that of the survival of the family unit in crisis, and I applaud this approach. Conflicts arise and sometimes solved through unpopular decisions, and that's the way of life. Most times we do not have complete information, and need to make split second life determining decisions.<br><br>However, the pace slackens toward the end of the movie, and steers us back with reminders that this is after all a summer action blockbuster, with predictable endings, some plot loopholes and worse, rushed explanations.<br><br>Tom Cruise doesn't get to flash his pearly whites so often here, as we see a transformation from irresponsibility, and in his son's opinion, cowardice, to courageous dad whose children are his first priority. I'd dare say Cruise is in his element here, saving the day (in a not so direct manner).<br><br>Dakota Fanning shines as Ray's daughter Rachel, bringing forth a sense of vulnerability with her fear of enclosed spaces, and her love for her father and brother. Being the little damsel in distress, who wouldn't want to save her and ensure that she survives this horrible onslaught?<br><br>Serves well as a Hollywood summer blockbuster, but not the "most anticipated" for this year as claimed by some.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Be With You<br><br>I am going to confess that I am becoming a fan of Japanese romance films, with "Be With You" being the second of the genre I've seen in two consecutive days (The other being "Crying Out Love, In The Center Of The World"). But I think many of you in Singapore, being exposed to these 2 wonderful films, have already become converts yourselves too.<br><br>While similar in themes about love, and love lost, these 2 films shine in the presentation of picturesque scenes, capturing of the atmosphere, fleshing out its characters, and making every scene count towards the narrative - every scene serves a purpose, every pause punctuates the moment. What differs between these 2 are the settings - Be With You having a more "supernatural" element in its plot, and Crying Out probably a bit more anchored to reality / tragedy.<br><br>Death has taken away Mio from Takumi and 6 year old son Yuji, and it is no doubt that they miss their wife/mother dearly. They learn to encourage each other as they fend for themselves - Takumi suffering from a sort of psycho-motor illness which forces him to refrain from overexertion.<br><br>Before she departed, Mio had given her son Yuji a storybook, which pens at the end, that come the next rainy season, she'll be back from the Archive Star. It is this hope that Yuji clings onto, with Takumi going along with, even though he knows it's a tad impossible.<br><br>However, during a trip to an abandoned shed in the woods, where Yuji was searching for his and his mom's secretly buried time capsule, rainy season started, and to the surprise of both father and son, Mio reappeared, somewhat dazed. While the figure looked like her, she had arrived with no recollection of her past, unknown to her that she was married to Takumi, and had a child Yuji.<br><br>Father and son do not know what to make of it, but decide against telling anyone that Mio had returned (how would relatives and friends react, when they already had been to her funeral?). Also, they make it a point to keep it from Mio that she had already passed away, and are determined to make the best of her return into their lives, which definitely needed a woman's touch around the house.<br><br>Is this selfish? I do not think so. To lose a loved one so early, and given a second chance to live what should have been, what would you do? And with Mio back into their lives, everyone around Taku and Yuji could see tremendous positiveness in their outlooks.<br><br>Since Mio couldn't remember much about the past, she asked Taku to go through from the beginning, how they fell in love and got married. His retelling of the story from his point of view, made up about a third of the movie, as we journey back in time to their schooldays, one date, forty seven letters and a breakup, and husband and wife relive the days of sweet romance.<br><br>Will their happy days end? Since Mio explained before she initially left that she's only back for the rainy season, Taku and Yuji had made it an open secret in celebrating each rainy day, wishing that the 6 weeks rainy season will not go, and last forever. You know that it will end someday, and father and son have to go through the pain once again of losing Mio all over. If you know what the ending will be, will you still go through with it, despite the pain and disappointment at the end? This is the thought that runs through your mind as you watch their happy moments together unravel, while secretly crossing your fingers that the ending will change for the better.<br><br>But Mio chanced upon her diary, amongst the 47 letters buried in the time capsule Yuji eventually found, and learns of the inevitable. And from here, she takes charge of the situation, knowing that she couldn't be around longer than she wished to take care of her husband (and child), she teaches Yuji to cook and wash, and presumably other household chores as well, so that he could take care of his father. The strength of her love will make you ponder the efforts one would go to ensure that your loved ones are taken good care of once you're no longer around.<br><br>It is no spoiler to know that Mio did leave after 6 weeks (she's already dead, remember?), but the film doesn't end there. Taku found Mio's diary, and reading it brings about explanations of their early courtship days from her own point of view, which really is Kleenex time as Taku comes to understand the truth behind certain events. The twist at the end explains the phenomenon of her appearance in the rainy season, and the running theme of living a life knowing its ending, makes a comeback.<br><br>I haven't been disappointed with Japanese romances thus far, and it seems to me that every scene, every subplot, every trinket has a point, and are not for the sake of being there. Going full circle to realization seems a style they have mastered, which simply is amazing, in telling a simple tale a different, poignant way. The beautiful soundtrack adds depth and evokes the right emotions amongst audiences, and the main leads Yuko Takeuchi (Mio) and Shido Nakamura (Takumi) exudes commanding on-screen chemistry.<br><br>The kid Yuji, played by child actor Akashi Takei, at times seem like a character mix between the kid from Millions and Jerry Maguire, you know, the cute boy who makes you go "awww..." with each of his antics and love for his mom. And Yuji will make you feel no less with each expression of love and longing, and really tug your heartstrings at his calling his "Mama" in helpless efforts of bringing and wanting her back.<br><br>Based on a romance novel which I can't read during to my language inability, I am so going to own this DVD when it's out. Highly recommended movie to be watched in a theatre with a loved one, do not miss this!<br><br>Postscript<br>If you know what the ending will be, will you still go through with it, despite the pain and disappointment waiting at the end? This thought that lingered throughout the movie stuck a chord in me. And those of you who know me, will know my answer - yes, I might be a sucker for that kind of punishment. 6 weeks is a luxury, I only had 15 minutes, and those 15 minutes lasted like an eternity that I'll forever treasure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Fantastic Four<br><br>OK, I admit I've always been a closet Fantastic Four fan. Before Stan Lee created the better known Spider-man, Hulk, X-Men, he created Fantastic Four, touted as the World's Greatest Comics Magazine, back in the 60s. Reed Richards is Mr Fantastic, Sue Storm/Richards is The Invisible Girl, her brother Johnny Storm is The Human Torch, and Richard's best friend / one time Sue's ex is Ben Grimm, aka The Thing.<br><br>This is not the first time that the origin has been recreated in film (the first one being a desperate attempt to secure movie rights, and is a tacky B-production), but this is the version that's done so right.<br><br>And I dare say this is the BEST Marvel comic book adaptation ever, staying very true to its characterization just as Stan Lee envisioned it to be. Classic touches include the bickering amongst the characters and of course the very cliche (perhaps FF popularized it?) basic plot of cooperation and teaming is stronger than the individual. The spot-on rivalry between Johnny and Ben, the use of their powers on one another (always liked it when Richards overpower Ben), and the costumes themselves serve a purpose, highlighting the Invisible Girl's curves... oops, I mean the suits being exposed to the same radiation and adapting the same properties as its wearer, and Ben's fedora and brown trenchcoat looked so in place.<br><br>I could go on, like Richard's vow to Ben to help his tragic friend (and themselves) reverse the effects on their DNA, his overworking in their penthouse headquarters of the Baxter Building, the rejection of The Thing's appearance by the public, Johnny's impulsiveness and crave for popularity, and Sue's peacemaker role amongst the boys. What I also liked is that this film takes its time to develop their arch-nemesis Victor Von Doom, as his transformation takes place throughout the movie until the finale.<br><br>Compared to Spider-man, there isn't a sappy romance to slow things down (and Mary J Watson was never Peter Parker's first!), nor are there too many heroes and villains like X-Men such that each character has limited screen time because of the focus on its most popular character Wolverine. In this film, each character has their own adequate share of the limelight, though I must mention that the Human Torch outshone the rest in set action pieces, while The Thing stole the show with humour. The film doesn't seem too long (about the same duration as the original X-Men), but it manages to pack all the action, emotion, backstory nicely as one summer flick.<br><br>Kudos to the casting team in bringing together actors who look the role too. Although 3 out of 5 stars are more goggle box actors (Alba, McMahon, Chilklis), they sure looked comfortable in their outing on the big screen.<br><br>If two's a company, and three's a crowd, then Four's just FANtastic! Looking at box office numbers, I don't think it'll outdo Spider-man, but I'm still game for a sequel - they can bring on Galactus for all I care! Look out for the cameo appearance of Stan Lee, whom you always expect in a Marvel adaptation that meets expectations!</div>

And watching it somehow brought a smile to my face, not that I'm extremely pleased with the gratuitous violence and nudity, but because it stuck to the source material so well, you feel as if you're reading the book and hearing the audiotape (if there is one) at the same time.<br><br>For the uninitiated, the Sin City comics consists of various storylines, some of which are adapted for the screen. Created by Frank Miller, he also serves as co-director, which probably explains that this big screen adaptation is as faithful as you can get.<br><br>continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com</div>
