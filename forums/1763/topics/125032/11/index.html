            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Guardian<br><br>There are many, many films out there about various uniformed folk. The police and fire department probably get represented a fair bit in movies, ranging from heroic stories, to tragedies, and some even featuring them in bad light. In my opinion, first movies should always be sort of a tribute story to the boys and girls in uniform, before adding some flavour in subsequent films with more sophisticated stories that can even venture into putting some characters in negative light. Think Backdraft, where you have the good and the bad apples from the fire department. Though on the other hand, first movies can also be hampered by this approach to the storyline, for its emphasis on the introduction of the profession's job scope, in keeping things stuck to a formula, and by having characters no less than heroic.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/10/guardian.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Black Dahlia<br><br>There are a couple of reasons why I wanted to watch The Black Dahlia. First, the trailer was slick, and the strangely hypnotic song used in the trailer, Dirge - by Death in Vegas, actually had this enthralling sublime message which to me was "watch this". Next, it's a police noir set in the 40s Hollywood. Movies set during that era and at that location appeal to me too, as will Hollywoodland. And last but not least, it stars Scarlett Johansson, sexiest woman alive if Esquire Magazine is to be believed (and I actually agree).<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/10/black-dahlia.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Crank<br><br>Just so you know, I'm a fan of Jason Statham, but before you jump to conclusions that I'm gonna give a positive spin on Crank because I'm a fan boy, do note that if you cannot stand mindless action movies, if you're not a Statham fan, flowery vulgarities are not your cup of tea, and MTV styled quick cuts give you headaches, then forget it, Crank is not for you.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/11/crank.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Tiger and the Snow<br><br>The Tiger and the Snow is a beautiful romantic movie, and it opened quite perfectly with an awesome ballad "You Can Never Hold Back Spring", performed by Tom Waits himself. Written and directed by Italian Roberto Benigni (famed for the wonderful LIfe is Beautiful), he also stars as the lead Attilio de Giovanni, a lovestruck poet who falls for a woman in his recurring dreams.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/11/tiger-and-snow-la-tigre-e-la-neve.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: A Good Year<br><br>The first time director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe paired together, they made the award winning Gladiator, and perhaps surprised folks that a mainstream action movie could snag the best picture Oscar. Here, they come together again for a pretty feel good movie, but I don't expect that this would win any major honours. Not that it's a bad film, but it's quite vanilla plain, that you could guess every other step of how the narrative and plot will unfold.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/11/good-year.html</div>

It actually took me this long to get down to it, given schedules and the likes. Five beautiful babes on screen, and it took me more than a week to view it?

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Step Up<br><br>I think I'm fast becoming a fan of the dance genre. The moves and the music just gets to me, be it Mad Hot Ballroom styled documentaries, or street hip hop, or a fusion of both, like in the recent Take The Lead. Step Up is one such movie, full of youthful energy that makes you want to stand up and do a jig or two.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/11/step-up.html</div>
