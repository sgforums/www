              A Nutshell Review: Blood Ties
              
              I had developed a keen interest in Chai Yee-wei's body of short films, besides personal reasons that my friends and I did go up against his many years back in a competition (no guesses who won of course). In fact it was during that 48 hour contest that made me sit up and take notice that here's someone who can tell a good, entertaining story under similar constraints and resources, and his shorts throughout the years are testament to that. Some two years ago during a screening of Blood Ties the short film, he had made mention that he's developing the feature length version, and here we are today. My verdict? It's a stellar debut feature film from a young director from our shores, and possibly one of the very best debuts we've seen over the last few years.

              A Nutshell Review: I Love You, Beth Cooper
              
              Thumb through a video store catalog, and there are a dime a dozen of many teen comedies out there that you'll be hard pressed to find something that either didn't deal with hard partying, road trips, one crazy night of post-graduation party, self-discovery, friendship and the likes. In fact, I Love You, Beth Cooper, has almost all those clichÃ© moments filled with stereotypical characters, but under the direction of Chris Columbus, this story by Larry Doyle actually came across in quite enjoyable terms, thanks to what I thought made the movie â€“ a line that was uttered upon stark realization, and the fear as expressed by the titular character, which made it quite distinct and standing out amongst the competition.

              A Nutshell Review: G-Force 3D
              
              Before you laugh at me for watching this obviously made for children movie, I thought it was somewhat interesting to observe how a Jerry Bruckheimer produced film, his first 3D one at that, would have fared should it have gone up against his long time director Michael Bay in the summer blockbuster stakes. While Transformers 2 had made cash registers worldwide go into overdrive, I thought G-Force had plenty going for it to have trounced those mega-robots. In my opinion, yes G-Force is way better than Transformers.

              A Nutshell Review: Dance Flick
              
              One wonders about the appeal of parody movies, taking genres that happen to be the flavour of the moment, and then adding doses of comedic spoofs into something of an abomination of a film, very much like a patchwork Frankenstein brought to life by the need to make fun of everything. While I could have swore off such films with the likes of the very unbelievably bad film Meet the Spartans, somehow the need to laugh after a rigourous in-camp training, and wanting to give the Wayan brothers a chance as I've enjoyed their Scary Movie spoof, brought me to their Dance Flick.

              A Nutshell Review: Gamer
              
              One wonders if social networking coupled with MMORPG similar to the likes of 3D avatar-based Second Life, would take off on an extremely large scale, with the hardware to support it, coupled with some X-factors to actually induce active participation. We know how fractured such sites and high-tech designs can be, though it didn't work against Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, famous for their Crank movies, to think up of a cautionary tale about the obsession with the virtual over what is real.

              A Nutshell Review: Aliens in the Attic
              
              I think I'm in a phase now where this holiday season's family friendly fare such as G-Force have more than surprised and satisfied in its entertainment value. They're not fantastic films, and perhaps my judgement over them has given way to nostalgia, where once I had unabashedly enjoyed films such as Honey I Shrunk the Kids, and Home Alone, with kids triumphing over the clueless adults in the films.

              A Nutshell Review: 9
              
              Just like how Peter Jackson had produced Neil Blomkamp's first feature film District 9 and I loved that to bits, 9 has visionaries in Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov lend their producing creds in Shane Acker's animated science fiction film, and the result is nothing less than stunning, telling a crisp narrative with plenty of scrumptious apocalyptic styled visuals.

              A Nutshell Review: Crows Zero II
              
              Takeshi Miike returns to helm the second installment of Crows Zero, which is arguably amongst his more mainstream work, based upon the manga by Hiroshi Takahashi. Bringing back almost all the major cast from the first film, one should expect more of the same story of high school violence given the thuggish micro-society amongst the academic community, where it's sans teachers and books, replaced by life's experience though the school of hard knocks (at times literally), coupled with the opening of old wounds and settling them through some good 'ol fisticuffs.

              A Nutshell Review: Moon
              
              Written and directed by Duncan Jones, Moon is strangely unique because while it contained a series of familiar cliches, it still managed to string itself together in an engaging manner, also in a large part thanks to Sam Rockwell's stellar one-man show, acting against himself with the occasional banter with a computer voiced by Kevin Spacey and represented by a smiley emoticon interface.

              A Nutshell Review: Thirst
              
              The response to Park Chan-wook's Thirst is nothing less than polarizing. You either love it like one of my friends who rated it amongst the best he'd seen, or you loathe it like another who had staged a walkout. Personally I do not think this film deserved such a negative response, however, it did get a little indulgent at times, and schizophrenic too in its narrative, but had its moments which basically boiled down to the power wielded by and given to the female of the species, and the havoc that it creates.

              A Nutshell Review: Whatever Works
              
              Whatever Works, worked. To a large extent, this Woody Allen film just happened to be right up my alley with its level of sarcasm, and impressions ranging ranging from relationships, religion and just about everything that life's about under this crazy sun. Having jet-set to Europe with his last few films, Allen returns to New York, and has Larry David star as his mouthpiece, the self-proclaimed genius and know-it-all Boris Yellnikoff, who serves to be our guide through this quirky film with some keen observations and sharp commentary.

              A Nutshell Review: Year One
              
              Compared to the other comedy, I had somehow enjoyed Year One a lot more than Dance Flick if not because the latter had lacked more coherent scenes, slapping incident after incident of spoofs in clear narrative disregard in what would be a sad state of affairs where Hollywood comedies are concerned. Year One, written and directed by veteran Harold Ramis was a lot more fun, even though it had Jack Black and Michael Cera not in top form while playing off one another.

              With the success of 4bia, it's a no brainer for the sequel to be made, now with the addition of Visute Poolvoralaks joining the original team of four in contributing to an anthology that sees each helming a segment, an opportunity to showcase their brand of scare tactics.

              A Nutshell Review: The September Issue
              
              Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada is rumoured to be inspired by Anna Wintour, the legendary editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine Vogue, and it's not hard to see how so. A  cup of Starbucks in hand, the bob hairdo, the cutting remarks, people going into a frenzy whenever her name is mentioned, and worse when dazzled by her presence. Even the vogue office does seem quite similar in terms of layout, and the number of assistants constantly scurrying around looking busy and executing to her every instruction.

              A Nutshell Review: April Bride
              
              It's easy to roll your eyes and dismiss this film as â€œyet another popular Japanese romance weepieâ€�, but truth is it's a dramatic interpretation and enactment of a real person's last days, a youth who was given the short end of the stick by Fate. On one hand you're tempted to frivolously park this under ClichÃ©s, but on the other, realizing that it's based on a true story (with dramatized moments of course), your interest gets piqued in trying to understand the reasons behind the filmmakers decision to want to turn her story into a feature film, because there must be something in it that inspired them to do so.

              An Interview with Blood Ties Director Chai Yee-wei
              
              Chai Yee-wei is quite the prolific short-film maker in Singapore, having made a number of shorts that have won various awards both locally and abroad. He now joins the ranks of those from Singapore making the leap into feature filmmaking with his debut feature film Blood Ties, which was funded under the Singapore Film Commission's New Feature Film Fund. Principal photography began on 1 March this year, and it made its World Premiere on 10 September. I have this opportunity to catch up with Yee Wei over a period of time to talk about the transition, and his film.

              A Nutshell Review: Fame
              
              I had watched the original Fame movie when I was a kid, enough to know the theme song sung by Irene Cara, but little else. Fast forward to today, I'm pretty sure I still enjoyed the reworked theme song, but the film unfortunately is a disaster, with predictable storylines, cardboard characters, and while I'm quite OK that it may have tried to be more documentary like in its presentation, it just fell short on almost all accounts, save for some of the set musical pieces.

              A Nutshell Review: Accident
              
              You know how it is when you cry wolf too much, or are one of those pranksters who ultimately falls for a trick just because of you didn't believe it can happen to you. Accident plays along similar lines, and director Soi Cheang's latest film is an excellent atmospheric piece that adds to Milkyway's repertoire of tautly crafted contemporary crime thrillers.

              A Nutshell Review: What's Your Raashee?
              
              I've been following the films made by Ashutosh Gowariker, who has helmed huge epics and worked with the biggest names in Bollywood today, such as Lagaan with Amir Khan, Swades with Shah Rukh Khan, and his previous film Jodhaa Akbar starring Hrithik Roshan and Ashwarya Rai Bachchan. And it's a fact that his films have runtimes of about 3.5 hours, which goes by real quickly as he keeps the story engaging, and the production values for this films are nothing less than magnificent. So naturally my interest was piqued as the auteur has now turned his sights on a romantic comedy, and I wonder exactly how a filmmaker such as he would be able to tackle this mass-appeal genre.

              A Nutshell Review: Paper Heart
              
              How do you define love? Is it something that's short lived and passionate, or a long drawn commitment? Is it that fleeting and can disappear on a whim, or something that you know for sure is permanent, consistent and wouldn't change? For those who have been through a phase of having loved and being loved before, you're likely to have developed your own philosophy - cynical, sentimental or pragmatic. For someone like Charlyne Yi who has never been in a romantic relationship before, the subject of love, and the dramatized account of her budding romance with Michael Cera, become the parallel stories in Paper Heart.

              A Nutshell Review: Surrogates
              
              What happens if your leading man is wrinkled and balding? Well, in the film world, the rage these days is to be able to do decades worth of flashbacks, or alternative fantasies using your mature actor, with computer graphics providing that painless, silkily smooth and flawless skin, complete with luscious and bouncy hair. Bruce Willis being in his prime, well, that indeed is a draw for the film Surrogates.

              A Nutshell Review: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
              
              Don't watch this on an empty stomach, or in 3D if you're hungry, otherwise you're likely to find yourself reaching out at the screen to want to touch those food products that get constantly rained down from the screen. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is extremely delightful, and could give Pixar's Up a run for its money in both the storyline and the visuals department. And given Sony Pictures Animation's not too bloated filmography with memorable offerings such as Monster House, Open Season and Surf's Up, this film proved that their formula is gaining traction, and we should be in for more treats in future.
