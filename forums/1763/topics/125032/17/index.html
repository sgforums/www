            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Infamous<br><br>Coming up with many movies on the flavour of the day is nothing new. Robin Hood had one by Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman going head to head with Kevin Costner's, we have the clash of the space asteroids with Deep Impact and Armageddon, and volcanic eruptions with Volcano and Dante's Peak. One inevitably is more memorable than the other, partly because of the timing of the release, as well as the stars attached to the project. The biopics of Truman Capote had seen Capote make its way here in 2006, while Infamous was being held back in its local release, until now.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/05/infamous.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Amazing Grace<br><br>Nonetheless some movies might have that one hall screening, and Michael Apted's Amazing Grace managed to squeeze past the Pirates of the Caribbean off a small hall. I was curious about the film as it offered a look behind a familiar song, which has now become a hymn naturally because of the message contained in the lyrics, written by John Newton (Albert Finney). But the movie doesn't tell you that story about the writing of the song per se, much as I thought it would, but instead told of a certain William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd), who embarks on a political journey in 19th Century England to abolish the slave trade in Britain and her territories.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/05/amazing-grace.html</div>

We're used to watching Jack Neo comedies, so it's quite easy to spot some similarities, but I guess that's in our "Singaporean-ness" that we like to jibe at public policies, and do so in coffeeshops and such, which is a set that rarely finds itself not being featured in our films.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/06/charity-gala-men-in-white.html</div>

From what I gathered, the books were introduced to me at an era when teenage sleuths were popular to children growing up at the time (for my case, the 80s and early 90s), with Hardy Boys, Famous Five, and of course, "Carolyn Keene"'s Nancy Drew amongst the more famous ones. I still remember those hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations, usually quite heavy (for a kid) to lug around, and the thickness of the book perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large fonts.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/06/nancy-drew.html<br><br>Click here for a review of Spider Lilies:<br>http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/03/hkiff-spider-lilies.html<br>Click here for a review of Eye in the Sky:<br>http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/03/hkiff-eye-in-sky-gun-chung.html<br>Click here for a review of Hot Fuzz:<br>http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/05/eu-film-fest-hot-fuzz.html</div>

However, for us outside the US, we do not get the Grindhouse double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror and a host of easter egg styled trailers, but rather we get the longer cut of both movies. Many have said that Planet Terror proved to be superior to Death Proof, but without watching the other, I thought Tarantino's offering was pretty decent stuff.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/06/quentin-tarantinos-death-proof.html</div>

It has been almost 12 years since Bruce Willis last starred in the definitive cop role, which some would arguably state that Die Hard had kick started the action movie blockbusters in the late 80s to 90s.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/06/live-free-or-die-hard-die-hard-40.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Flying Scotsman<br><br>The Flying Scotsman is a formula sports biographical movie, based on the book written by a champion cyclist Graeme Obree. As with sports biopics like Cinderella Man and The World's Fastest Indian, Scotsman tells the story of the underdog's triumph against himself and his adversaries through innovation in technique, technology, and of course, perseverance sprinkled with grit and determination. But of course, like A Beautiful Mind, there are inner demons that have to be worked out, before assailing to the summit.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/06/flying-scotsman.html</div>

However, without the return of the titular Wife Cha Eun-jin (Shin Eun-Kyung), this movie is nothing more than just a namesake, but there's no stopping the linkage with the box office success of the earlier movies. The new Wife here (though she's actually a guest rather than a Wife) is none other than sultry looking Shu Qi, who plays Aryong, the daughter of a triad leader (what else) in Hong Kong, starring Ti Lung in a supporting role.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/06/my-wife-is-gangster-3-jopog-manura-3.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Invisible City<br><br>I must confess I had eagerly anticipated Tan Pin Pin's latest work Invisible City since I caught wind of its production. Given that I had enjoyed Singapore GaGa tremendously, and having had the opportunity to view Invisible City in a special bloggers' screening, I just can't contain my glee enough. But the mood I experienced when watching the movie was somewhat sombre if compared to GaGa, which had lovely tunes sprinkled around.<br><br>If I could use a word to describe Invisible City, it will be 'Important'; an aptly timed wake up call. Given the recent (coincidental) slew of news on conserving aged architectural beauties, I thought the documentary touched upon issues of importance vis-a-vis those articles, that as material things get demolished and destroyed, what's left are the memories of what once were. And when memories fade, become faulty, not get recorded in some medium as evidence of its existence, what then? It's as if what was, had fused into a part of our current e-world, something virtual and intangible, from a long time ago, far, far, away, unrecognizable.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/invisible-city.html<br><br>Keen to watch Invisible City and watch for free?

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Ex aka Fast Track<br><br>If I were to look at it, I would say The Ex aka Fast Track forms a loose trilogy of sorts with regards to growing up, and somewhat like a natural progression in the different stages of life that Zach Braff's characters form when stringed together. With Garden State, it's in the 20s where you're having a feel for the ground, exploring your options and not knowing exactly what life will dish out to you.With One Last Kiss, so you think that you're dead sure about your other  half, you're getting married and vowing to spend the rest of your lives together, and suddenly an ingenue comes along, and cast doubts about that.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/ex-aka-fast-track.html<br><br>Watch Tan Pin Pin's Invisible City for free?<br>Click the following link to find out how! http://invisiblecity.sg<br>Review is available here: http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/invisible-city.html</div>

The much touted scene here is The Kiss (about 1 hour into the movie), but seriously, that's much ado about nothing compared to what the rest of the movie has in store for audiences around the world. Just so you know, I've still not read any of the books by JK Rowling thus far, preferring to rely on cinematic magic to condense the ever increasing thickness of the novels into 2hrs and 10-20mins of full sensory invasion.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/harry-potter-and-order-of-phoenix.html<br><br>Watch Tan Pin Pin's Invisible City for FREE?<br>Click on http://invisiblecity.sg to find out how!<br>Review available at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/invisible-city.html</div>

But Zoe Cassavete's movie isn't an outright comedy, or one which deals with language in Mind Your Language style. It's actually a dramatic look at Romance, from the point of view of a 30-something.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/broken-english.html<br><br>Watch Tan Pin Pin's Invisible City for FREE!<br>Click to http://invisiblecity.sg to find out how!<br>Review of Invisible City can be found here: http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/invisible-city.html</div>
