You see, a group of friends and I had an idea which we wanted to short-film, and the trailer for The Benchwarmers was so strikingly similar.

Cine.SG was just launched (you can read the Gala here), and has provided a platform for films made in Singapore, or by Singaporeans, to be screened.<br><br>Director Han Yew Kwang's Unarmed Combat is the first feature film to launch the series, a quirky comedy about a tale of two women, and a man caught in the middle. What strikes you immediately during the opening, are the still shots of the shop front of an old-school laundromat, complete with plenty of nostalgic looking equipment of yesteryears, and that infectious ear-worm of a theme tune, akin to the style and production sets of Kung Fu movies of the past.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/06/cinesg-unarmed-combat.html<br><br>for poster still and trailer<br>Link to gala details and Q&amp;A coming soon!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Re-Cycle<br><br>Be careful what you wish for, because sometimes, they just might come true, whether you like it to or not. A writer's inspiration can also be adapted from real life events, with a dash of dramatic license added to spice things up for the reader. And an environmental message which is worked quite effortlessly into the narrative, makes one wonder in awe too.<br><br>Re-Cycle is the latest horror thriller from the acclaimed Pang Brothers, whose Bangkok Dangerous I had enjoyed tremendously. Perhaps an Asian answer to Hollywood's Wachowski Brothers with their flair for interesting visuals and stories which thread on many levels, Oxide and Danny Pang's latest movie stars Angelica Lee (or Lee Sin-Je if you prefer), already having her fair share of spook fests in her filmography.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/06/re-cycle.html<br><br>Check out the gala and a link to the Q&amp;A here: http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/06/gala-premiere-re-cycle.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Hoodwinked<br><br>Anne Hathaway is currently disrobing on our local screens, and I suspect by the time Havoc finished its run, then she'll be heard but not seen, only lending her voice in the animated feature Hoodwinked, by Blue Yonder Films and Kanbar Entertainment. By not being a product churned out from the usual Disney-Pixar-Dreamworks-Fox studios, it's a delightful departure from the expected norms we already have formed by offerings from the mentioned studios.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/06/hoodwinked.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: 4:30<br><br>All these bells and whistles take a backseat in 4:30, a quiet film save for some lines of dialogue. The closing film of this year's Singapore International Film Festival where it played to a sell out crowd, the first thing that comes to mind is, is this a Singapore movie? With a style so commonly found in arthouse films, you'll probably be amazed that we do have someone here capable of crafting a contemplative movie immersed so richly in green hues. A previous short film closest to the mood and visuals to 4:30 would be Sons (you must check it out!)<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/07/430.html<br><br>You can also check out an earlier interview session with Royston by clicking on this link http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/06/kopi-with-royston.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Unforgiven<br><br>No, this isn't about the US Marine Corps, with the tagline above used in Jarhead. The Unforgiven is a Korean army movie, which I likened in similarity to Jarhead, in that there is no war action. This independent film follows the life of a new recruit, Lee Seung-yeong (Seo Jang-weon), in his journey through the Korean armed forces, and his brotherly relationship forged with his close friend and superior Yu Tae-jung (Ha Jung-woo)<br><br>continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/07/unforgiven.html</div>

Either that, or you've worked in a restaurant before that you can identify easily with some of those nasty or nice customers you've encountered before. You are the folks that have inspired this movie.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/07/waiting.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Basic Instinct 2<br><br>I was still underaged when the original Basic Instinct made its debut in the local theatres under the relatively new R rating system, but suffice to say many already know of the kinky scenes, especially the infamous crossing and uncrossing of legs sans panties which sealed Sharon Stone's status as a Hollywood femme fatale.<br><br>It's been 14 years since, and the sequel is just released here. Which makes one wonder why, given the question would anyone still be interested to see an aging body doing her thing again? It's no wonder that the preview crowd was mainly elderly uncles and aunties, who apparently had a good time dissecting whatever plot there is to this movie, and of the occupational hazards of being a mental doctor if your mental strength is found wanting.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/07/basic-instinct-2.html</div>

I've never seen the movies of Miss World '94, and missed out on Bride and Prejudice. Written by the same team, Mistress of Spices is a mythical tale which makes the Indian spices the star of the movie, set in a medicinal store, with Rai as the conjurer and mixer of modern day "bomoh" like medicine to cure mankind of their ills.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/07/mistress-of-spices.html</div>
