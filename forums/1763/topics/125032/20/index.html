            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Savage Grace<br><br>It's been a long time since I've written a short review and stayed true to the nutshell, and I'm compelled to do just that now. Savage Grace is based on the murder of Barbara Daly Baekeland in 1972, and this movie is a dramatization of that incident, but it goes way back to paint a picture of a sad woman of society who gets no love, and although this is brilliantly played by Julianne Moore, that is about the best aspect of the movie.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/09/savage-grace.html</div>

The first movie opened to much fanfare here with overnight festivities and a graveyard hour premiere, but reality set in soon after that local audiences perhaps aren't game for something too foreign, despite it that it stuck to the familiar action-effects formula.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/day-watch-dnevnoy-dozor.html</div>

Little does she know that she's got to carry on acting the rest of her life, together with her group of idealistic young dramatists, as stage feelings stirred up real emotions that calls for the sacrificial of self for the greater good, for the country. What they lack in experience, they make up with their youthful passion and exuberance. And their rawness shows in the way they clumsily set up their traps for the coming of the prey, and fumbling even with their first blood.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/lust-caution-se-jie.html</div>

So taking on more edgy, angsty characters might just be their quick solution. Anne Hathaway lost her clothes and borrowed a foul mouth for her turn in Havoc, and Justin Timberlake here lost his coolness but almost always brought sexy back in his scenes, despite having tattoos riddling his toned body, and adopting as foul a mouth as Hathaway's Allison Lang.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/alpha-dog.html</div>

The beats of drums in any music always appeal to me (no prizes for guessing I'm a drum and bass fan), because I suppose it's fairly easy to express your mood to beats, and this expression can be done through anything that gives you that satisfying clang, and more so when you need to vent frustrations out in a relatively safe manner by hitting out at something inanimate, without personal injury of course.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/drummer.html</div>

Well there are, however, the best parts of Mr Woodcock are not the sexual innuendos, but come from the various gymnasium scenes, where Jasper Woodcock (Billy Bob Thorton) the PE teacher runs his classes like a sadistic drill sergeant, and all the misfits tremble in fear and loathe as he puts them through the paces, with physical, mental and emotional abuse dished out in deadpan manner. The filmmakers know this, and set the bar high enough from the get go, but only for the movie to spiral in the general southwards direction.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/mr-woodcock.html</div>

Perhaps one could have been jaded by so many revenge themed movies, where things get taken into one's own hands because we believe revenge is a dish best served cold. From the martial arts genre to stylized violent movies like Tarantino's Kill Bill double, I'd warrant a guess that anything more rooted to the reality of today, and in the movie's forced allusion in making a statement about the Iraqi War, will make one roll their eyes in disbelief.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/brave-one.html</div>

After all, Bugis Street of old (not the sterile shopping mall it has now become) had been made in a 1996 Singapore movie entitled Bugis Street. But what came across as inspired from true stories that originates from within that area leaves much to be desired. After all, surely we know of some of these stories if we have friends who have visited the area (*ahem* if not yourself) and lived to tell of their conquests, or countless others that you can read of anonymously, courtesy of the Sammyboy forums, and those are somewhat more honest and to the point that what Pleasure Factory depicted.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/pleasure-factory-kuai-le-gong-chang.html</div>

Instead, I had chosen the Undead today, which also takes place in a hospital, not in the morgue but at a lab for anatomical lessons, where would be surgeons obtain their baptism of fire from those who had decided to donate their bodies for scientific causes. The gimmick (if I can call it that way) of this movie, is that it touts itself having to be the very first to include real dead bodies, aka cadavers, in film.

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The 11th Hour<br><br>I guess we can attest that the local weather of late has gone bonkers. More often than note, we have incredibly hot and humid weather with bright sunshine one half of the day, before the skies turn grey and piss heavily on us. We've seen even more occurences of water spouts emerging just off our shore, and we've done the boogie when neighbouring countries suffer jolts in the earth, from which we will feel tremors enough for us to abandon our high rise buildings. While we're relatively buffered from direct adverse weather effects, not a day goes by without reading or knowing about strange weather phenomenon from around the world.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/leonardo-dicaprio-presents-11th-hour.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Game Plan<br><br>American football team Boston Rebels' star quarterback Joe Kingman (The Rock) has only two loves in his life - Football and Elvis Presley. Like all successful sports superstars at the top of their game, he's living the good life, with his swanky penthouse apartment fitted with the latest luxuries, a roadster that screams "Mo Jo(e)", and endless parties with beautiful women. But alas one fine day he finds little Peyton Kelly (Madison Pettis) at his doorstep, claiming to be his daughter, and thus putting the brakes in his fast life.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/game-plan.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Triangle<br><br>The much awaited Hong Kong movie Triangle has finally hit our shores. It's an interesting project, given that 3 HK directors - Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam and Johnnie To - are combining forces to tell a story in the "exquisite corpse" style, where each one takes over from where the other left off, each injecting their own narrative style and spin to the characters and story. It's friendly one-upmanship between the directors in their bout to demonstrate their innovativeness, spontaneity and resourcefulness, but what comes through is clearly a mixed bag, expectedly so since you have three distinct creative inputs.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/triangle-tie-saam-gok.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Saw IV<br><br>For fans of the Saw trilogy, you'd thought that the end of the third installment had wrapped up the franchise quite neatly, and there's absolutely no way another movie can be made except to go backwards in time with prequels. Well, surprise surprise, director Darren Lynn Bousman brings forth the fourth movie of the franchise, and so long as it continues to churn profits, you can bet your last dollar this isn't the last you see of the Saw movies. To be cautious, here's a little spoiler warning for you if you decide to read further. And one reminder, please refresh your memory of the earlier Saw movies, especially Parts II and III, before you go for 4.<br><br>Continues (with spoilers) at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/saw-iv.html</div>

Based on the novel by Eimi Yamada, Sugar &amp; Spice is not your conventional romantic drama, not that it's because it's not the usual boy-meets-girl-they-hook-up-boy-loses-girl-boy-tries-to-win-girl-back kind of movie, but because it takes a long hard look at a certain condition, and that's the rebound.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/sugar-spice-fmi-zekka.html</div>

And instead of putting himself in yet another one man show, he combines forces and shares the spotlight with a stellar cast comprising Robert Redford, who also takes on directing duties, and Meryl Streep, in a story that touches on quite realistically on current affairs, based on scribe's Matthew Michael Carnahan's take on the entire political situation in the USofA currently, with special focus put into its war on terror.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/lions-for-lambs.html</div>
