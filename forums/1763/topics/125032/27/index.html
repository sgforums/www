              <p>So when Underworld co-star Kate Beckinsale got to make a horror/thriller with Vacancy while waiting for the green light on a possible Underworld pre/sequel, Scott Speedman too had to do something equivalent, and so got himself signed up with The Strangers, written and directed by Bryan Bertino, which takes a fictional look at what it purports to be based on true events with regards to the senseless acts of violence committed against James Hoyt (Speedman) and Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler).</p>

              <p>A Nutshell Review: Hancock</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll stick my neck out and state this: Should anyone tell you Hancock is not a good superhero movie, then that somebody probably isn't a superhero comic book fan to begin with. Or perhaps prefers the heroes as morally upright boy scouts with unexplainable fetish for lycra tights. And for those who reckon that the Hancock trailer had shown its hand, for once I thought that a trailer barely, and I mean barely, scratched the surface of what surprisingly was a thoroughly enjoyable story, which will take its stand proudly amongst this year's line up of comic book/super hero movies.</p>

              <p>A Nutshell Review: Deception</p>
              <p>The big joke making its rounds here about this movie was in its promotional poster for this part of the world. Perhaps to the West, Maggie Q would be just the chick from MI:3 and didn't warrant top billing, or a photograph in its poster. Here, we have a badly pasted "extra" face of hers plastered on the poster, supposedly banking on her popularity with Asians. Only that as it turned out, she only has 5 minutes worth of screentime, appearing in black lacy lingerie, and doing nothing. If that's the case, then Natasha Henstridge should also be included in the poster, since she's famous for showing off her body in the Species movies, and continues to do so here to remind everyone she hasn't really lost it yet.</p>

              <p>A Nutshell Review: It's a Boy Girl Thing</p>
              <p>I know what you're saying. There are countless of movies out there involving body switches, either parental-kid (like Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis in Freaky Friday), and cross-gender, be it deliberate (like Amanda Bynes in She's The Man) or through inexplicable supernatural occurence (like Jack Neo's Just Follow Law, or The Hot Chick starring Rob Schneider and Rachel McAdams). Whatever the case is, it seems that such stories still can find a market and a demand, otherwise they wouldn't be made, will they? And comedies which arise from such situations almost always seem to recycle some jokes, removing plenty of lustre from what could have been funny, but not so, because of familiarity with the subject matter.</p>

Neither can I, and ever since Hachiko I thought none could stand up to the loyalty of that dog, but I guess I was wrong. You think you know the usual drill when it comes to stories about man's best friend, but I guess one can always count on the Japanese to weave a story based on much melodrama that somehow works, no matter if it at first glance might seem to be familiar.</span></p>

While these movies can't possible earn him any action awards, you can't deny the fact that this guy's pretty charismatic in his own right, and I've no qualms about watching him play characters on either side of the fence, taking on his opponents in Crank or War, holding his own opposite Jet Li.</span></p>

So if you're looking for a standard review of the movie, go somewhere else.

              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">I suppose Thai horror movies are still popular and continue to enjoy theatrical releases in Singapore, and black magic still intrigues and provide numerous amount of material from which movies draw upon to conjure another round of scary movies. Black Magic's the dark arts in some parts of cultures of the east, and I still remember vividly some of the Hong Kong movies which elevated the Thai black arts as something horrific and truly scary, for a kid anyway.</span></p>

              <p>A Nutshell Review: Wedding Daze</p>
              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">It seems that the success of the American Pie trilogy which starred Jason Biggs and spawned a franchise of spin off movies bearing the American Pie branding, had somewhat slapped an unfortunate tag on actor Biggs. Of all the movies to date that I recall him in, they inevitably revolve around teenagers, sex, or romantic comedies. He can't shake off this tag, and I will be curious to see him take a big leap out of this unwarranted comfort zone, unless of course these are roles that appeal to him, and pays his bills anyway. What makes it ideal for him in roles as these, is his average everyday man looks and attitude.</span></p>

              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">It's not hard to imagine how time flies, when you realize that one of your best loved television series of all time had already ended its run, and you reminisce the times back when one of your weekend nights revolved around sitting in a bunk with your army mates, all glued to what Chris Carter had conjured as adventures for the two best known goggle box FBI agents, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). While we always needed to crank up the volume to try and make sense of the murmurs involving shadow governments and secret conspiracies, our favourite episodes almost unanimously were those one-off ones, so called the "monster" episodes.</span></p>

But you know what they say about expectations, and this being the first feature film of writer-director Foo Fung Koon, I have had friends who have given me that wry look and stifled laughter when I told them that I am prepared to be scared. And the usual trappings of a first film, with its raw delivery and unpolished feel, comes an accidental, unintentional comedy.</span></p>

Although itself based on a novel, this is a far cry from doomsday, though for the lead character, his life has been made a living hell for the sheer psychological and physical torture he goes through even after his unfortunate ordeal. And it does provoke some thought into the issues it put on screen, though it doesn't provide any answers, which I suppose in a real world equivalent, it's likely to remain under wraps too, for the shame.</span></p>

              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">One of the reasons why I decided to watch this, is because I needed a comedy to laugh at, if it's not possible to laugh together with it. The DVD is already available at the shops, but I don't think I'm ready to fork out a Code 1 DVD price for what's essentially a short comedic film which is based from a Saturday Night Life comedy skit. Written by the same creative team of Peter Gaulke and Fred Wolf with the latter taking on directorial duties as well, Strange Wilderness delivered some genuine laughs, but only if you're tolerant of being insensitive to the kind of subject the film makes fun of.</span></p>

Perhaps it's to bank on the resounding box office success of its predecessor some 10 years ago in getting the crowds back into the halls, in an attempt to repeat that miracle.</span></p>

But this installment of Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, came hot on the heels of the Hollywood bandwagon of raiding their own franchises in order to rake in millions around the world, and therefore fell short on many counts.</span></p>

Local documentarians have found the run up to the Olympic event monumental enough to craft documentaries around it, and earlier this year we have seen Tan Siok Siok's Boomtown Beijing, which provided some insights into how the Games had impacted and inpsired the ordinary folks. Lian Pek's Mad About English too get set during this period of preparation in Beijing.</span></p>
