            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Unseeable<br><br>But when this project was announced, I admit I was a bit apprehensive. I have not fancied many Asian horror movies of late, because of the usual formulaic stories and the employment of cheap shock tactics which bore. At times, scenes become unintentionally comedic, coupled with bad makeup and cheesy special effects, which mar whatever potential the movies could have achieved. The horror genre is no doubt a money spinner, and many times, quality is compromised when everyone jumps on the same bandwagon, knowing audiences will still lap them up despite the inferior product.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/01/unseeable-pen-choo-kab-pee.html</div>

His subject expertise is history, and instead of going the rote way in regurgitating curriculum, he opts for the understanding of rationale behind events, making his classes interactive and interesting. Being a teacher, whether you like it or not, you're a role model, and therefore, a moral compass to your impressionable charges. I have a friend whose other friends are teachers, and he sometimes account their behaviour outside of class, which we are of the opinion that if any parent were to know of their shenanigans, they would immediate withdraw their children from classes.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/02/half-nelson.html</div>

It's kinda strange that while at first glance I'd think his movies are a tad boring, in both occasions - for In the Bedroom and now Little Children, I ended up glued to the screen, and find myself sucked deeply into the proceedings. Somehow he managed to draw me into the story, feel for the characters, build up excellent tension all the way to the end, before releasing me from its grasp in the well thought finale.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/02/little-children.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Letters from Iwo Jima<br><br>Clint Eastwood continues his WWII war drama with Letters from Iwo Jima, the companion film to last year's Flags of our Fathers. Shot back to back, this version shows the same battle from the viewpoint of the Japanese, and if compared to Flags, this is a somewhat more heartfelt, personal story about the pride and honour of the defenders of Iwo Jima.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/02/letters-from-iwo-jima.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Dreamgirls<br><br>Dreamgirls had garnered 8 nominations in the upcoming Academy Awards, but somehow missed out on all the main categories like Picture, Director, and the Actor and Actress nominations. Based on the Broadway musical, with new songs added for the movie (3 of which are in the running for Best Song), it tells of a group of singers' meteoric rise in the music industry in the 60s, and on their trials and tribulation which plague any successful singing group.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/02/dreamgirls.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Norbit<br><br>When I first saw the trailer for Norbit, I have to admit I was tickled, more so by the familiar antics that poke fun at weight and size. Apologies though that I'm laughing at the expense of plus sized people, and it dawns upon you if there's any valid reason why they should be constant punching bags for gags. From Shallow Hal to The Nutty Professor, it seemed that Eddie Murphy is revisiting familiar territory with prosthetics all over again, and can't get enough of piling on fake weight on himself.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/02/norbit.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Hannibal Rising<br><br>The story of Hannibal Lecter continues, what with so many movies starring everyone's favourite cannibal - Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal and Red Dragon. In most of these movies, Sir Anthony Hopkins brought to live the vivid horror of the character, sending chills down your bones with his measured performance and that steely gaze. It's natural that in following recent trend, there would be a prequel movie made of sorts which goes back to the origins of the primary character, in an attempt to explain and discover who he is, and what made him to be.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/02/hannibal-rising.html</div>

Having spent only 2 days in 2004 in the City of Lights is definitely insufficient, and sitting through this tapestry, a series of 18 shorts each helmed by diverse filmmakers, was pure bliss as they each create a story set around the 18 neighbourhoods of Paris itself, bringing back memories of the sights and sounds, each very distinct  with their own style and narrative structure, but all focused on that central theme of Love.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/02/paris-je-taime-paris-i-love-you.html</div>
