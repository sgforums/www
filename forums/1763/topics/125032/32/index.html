There's Rachel Getting Married, the upcoming Bride Wars, and Passengers. Amongst the three, and I'm counting my chickens before they hatch, Rachel Getting Married is a must watch to see how Hathaway has nailed it as a credible actress, while Bride Wars from the trailer does suggest she has some comedic flair, and this one, well, is one of those attempts at her trying to diversify.</span></p>

And for those who complained about the pigeon soaring over the sky overseeing a football game at the Cao Cao (Zhang Fengyi) camp, there're perfect explanations for those too.</span></p>

              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">Biopics work for me because I'm innately curious about that aspect of a person's life which makes it compelling enough for others to want to make a film out of it. This film by Gus Van Sant tells the story of California's first openly gay elected official Harrvey Milk over the span of the last 8 and definitely more fruitful years of his life where he discovers his calling ironically after confessing to a lover that he had so far not done anything constructive with his, and then with their subsequent move to San Franscisco.</span></p>

Yes it's unflinchingly violent, and for those who have issues with screen violence getting too gratuitous, then Punsiher: War Zone is not the movie for you, and you should steer light years clear of it. Being the first Marvel Studios film released under the Marvel Knights label, which is supposedly meant for mature audiences, this is probably the version that stays close to the mythos in terms of Frank Castle's modus operandus.</span></p>

              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">It surprised me that this Hong Kong comedic franchise still had some legs to carry on with yet another installment, given that it's been some 12 years since the last film, which started off in 1992 starring Stephen Chow at his element, filled with plenty of "mo-lei-tau" jokes, and its fair share of obvious spoofs from well know movies. It's title ties in with none other than its release over the Lunar New Year period of the year, because it's believed that cinema goers automatically head for the comedies showing in the cinemas. Right, Jack Neo?</span></p>

              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">That's the golden rule when confronted by a gang of hooligans, or in the first place, not to kick start any interaction for that matter. Not that one’s a coward, but the consequences and the hassle thereafter are never worth it. Swallow that pride and move away, because there’s absolutely no shame in doing so. But I guess should one decide to take some action, to never take them on as a group, because crazed peer pressure to belong gives some intense mental strength that clouts morals. Unity is strength, and taking them on individually presents a much better chance at survival.</span></p>

So far I've seen every film on the big screen that Haley Bannett had starred in, from her breakthrough role as the uber-sexy Cora "Buddha's Delight" Corman in Music and Lyrics, to Kendall of College, and now, the titular character in this horror film. Save for her debut, everything else had been of dubious quality, and I'm afraid without another hit soon, she'll more than be forgotten and should concentrate on her singing career instead.</span></p>

Not only has Hollywood managed to finally get the essence so succinctly and successfully infused it into the animated film Kung Fu Panda, and taking on one of China's icon as its own, India too has shown that it's no pushover now in combining its Bollywood "masala" formula with the martial arts genre, and does so too by snagging the iconic Gordon Liu as lead villain.</span></p>

              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;  ">The trailers may have fooled audiences into believing, like the rest of his films, this is a laugh-fest. The funniest bit in the theatrical trailer is nowhere to be found in the film, as are other scenes too. One wonders if they were trimmed for run time reasons (this clocks in very close to 2 hours), but the decisions to have kept whatever made it to the theatrical cut, were strange indeed because they were very tired jokes, recycling some from Jack's past films, and most turned out to be terribly expected, cliche and rancid.</span></p>

Celebrity couples don't get any bigger than this pairing in Singapore, so exploiting the real for the reel was something quite expected, given after all the timing, with Christopher Lee and Fann Wong tying the knot sometime later this year. If audiences want a glimpse of what their big day would look like, the many costume changes in bridal gowns and suits here would provide for some teaser anticipation.</span></p>

For one so used to attention, love and accolades showered, to be cheered and encouraged, to be handing out high-fives, autographs and pose for photographs, it takes a lot to readjust life back to normalcy, if at all. Such is the fickleness of fame.</span></p>

Victory however is a sports theme movie through and through, adopting the very standard formula (which was also applied to Fashion) where it's focused on the protagonist's meteoric rise to stardom, an equally hard downfall, and ultimate redemption.</span></p>

              <p>When I was born my mom said I looked like an old man. Like everyone else, I turned out to be pretty normal, unlike The Curious Case of Benjamin Button where he's physically developing in the opposite, suffering from common aged ailments like cataracts, hearing, and arthritis first, but mentally developing in proper chronology. One can imagine the challenges of everyone thinking you'll die soon enough, before a miracle actually happens and you're like having drunk some elixir of life, probably a little too much too.</p>

                  <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">It's nothing new for a movie to be a critique of the affairs and matters of the industry it belongs to, but the manner whether it is harsh, direct, honest or just plain tongue-in-cheek, would set the agenda. Like in Farah Khan's <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #226699; font-weight: bold;" href="http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/11/om-shanti-om.html">Om Shanti Om</a>, it's played out in my opinion more light-heartedly, and who can forget that job at sequels, stars and that memorable 9 minute Deewangi Deewangi. Luck By Chance by yet another female director Zoya Akhtar happened to be a more mature examination, with views coming from the bottom up, covers just about almost every angle, and contains a tight 360 degree view in what would be a sharp observation from the inside.</span></p>

Similarly, Defiance has brothers leading a rag-tag group of Jewish refugees in guerrilla warfare and a quest for survival, where being alive everyday means a middle finger to the Third Reich during WWII, and organizing themselves to become a tightly knitted community where, like their Russian neighbours, everyone has an equal role to play to get rewarded with equal food. And with two lion-hearted brothers at the helm, sooner or later the sibling rivalry will rear its ugly head, and differing political ideals will see them part ways.</span></p>

              A Nutshell Review: Raaz: The Mystery Continues
              
              The first Raaz starring Bipasha Basu has nothing to do with this film. The mystery indeed continues here in name only, just like how the Thai horror franchise The Art of the Devil 2 having no relation to Part 1. It's a totally different story altogether with no return of characters from the first film, so this rose could be called any other name, and would it smell as sweet? There's a certain formula followed here and comes with the obligatory "logical" explanation, but the story could have been nipped and tucked a little to help in the pacing.

              A Nutshell Review: Let The Right One In
              
              The cinematic vampires I've seen to date in cinemas recently have usually been the ramped up sexy versions, where it's either black leather on lithe female frames, or dreamy hunks to whom teenage girls would sacrifice their necks to in order to live with their lover boy forever.
              
              While the release of Twilight had made a lot of noise in the commercial theatres last year and raking in an obscene amount of money sending fan-girls into a frenzy, one vampire movie has been making its rounds very successfully in the film festival circuit, and the accolades garnered thus far have been nothing less than stellar. Come next week, you too will know why, as Let The Right One In (LTROI) gets its deserved commercial release here.

              A Nutshell Review: Billu
              
              Billu Barber had already courted some controversy because some hairstylists protested that the term "Barber" was offensive. I don't understand it, but this meant the word has been dropped, and it's now known simply as "Billu", still after its titular character. A remake of the Malayalam film "Katha Parayumpol", Billu is one of those films that work because of its spot-on capturing of the ugliness and greed of man.

              A Nutshell Review: Valkyrie
              
              Since it's based on a true event, unless you have your head buried in the sand, you'll know the outcome, or at least the end result, of Operation Valkyrie, an ambitious plan put into the hands of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) together with his entourage of high ranking officers and political officials in a coup-de-tat to bring down the Fuhrer, disrupt his chain of command, and assume control of Berlin, thanks to quite a contingency strategy that Hitler had. If it had been successful, history would turn out rather different, but we are where we are now. So what makes it still a compelling story to sit through?
