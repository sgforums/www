But it's really, not good. The animation is rather coarse (ok, so you're telling me we cannot compare with Pixar?), and looks like it's straight out of a bad blocky videogame. There are certain sequences that looked like a cheap ripoff of old puppetry techniques, though I'd like to think of it as an excuse that the filmmakers were being lazy, or in a rush to finish this in time for the lunar new year.<br><br>More at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/01/zodiac-race-begins.html</div>

Sure, they are there, but it doesn't take centrestage. What is core in the movie, is how relationships amongst the various characters are played out.

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Constant Gardener<br><br>Finally! After such a long wait, this movie has finally made it to our shores (I have been lamenting the same fate of other acclaimed movies recently). Directed by Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (who did City of God), The Constant Gardener finds itself sandwiched between two others movies released here in the same period, sharing with North Country an aspect about whistle-blowing, and with Syrianna on the corruption of conglomerates.<br><br>While Syrianna takes on oil corporations, Gardener tells a tale of clandestine governments, and the morality issues faced by pharmaceutical companies. Adapted from the novel by John le CarrÃ©, Gardener explores and suggests what-if scenarios (I say "what-if" as I humbly ask if what was suggested by the film could have been inspired by some form of real happenings), of having human guinea pigs in the testing of new medicine. In contention here is a new drug for the treatment of tuberculosis, though HIV was also briefly sharing the spotlight in the plight of the African nations. The stark question posed, which makes you wonder, is whether it is right to have dying Africans, or those who are already terminally ill, test new medicine, and presenting to them Hobson's choice.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/02/constant-gardener.html</div>

Finally a decent yet different war genre movie set during the first Gulf War, which featured what was touted by Saddam as the Mother of All Battles, not. Jarhead is based upon the book by former Marine Anthony Swofford, on his experiences in the Desert Shield and Desert Storm operations.<br><br>But we start the journey from the beginning, at the boot camp, and that, to many NS men, will bring back fond memories of the BMT days when nasty drill sergeants rained down vulgarity filled commands, and punishments meted out from whims and fancies. You'll chuckle wholeheartedly, but of course not when you're at the receiving end. The burly platoon mates, the sexual innuendos, the male bonding sessions in the bunks, the various antics, the talk-cock sessions; nostalgic I tell you.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/02/jarhead.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Pink Panther<br><br>The Pink Panther actually refers to an enormous pink diamond with a flaw in the shape of a panther, and not to Inspector Jacques Clouseau, but because of the iconic pink panther's appearance in the animated opening credits, along with the all too familiar theme by Henry Mancini, it's all too easy to associate one with the other.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/02/pink-panther.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Zoolander<br><br>I am five years late. Just as I was so prepared to watch a Ben Stiller caper, with the posters all up at local theatres, the movie disappeared from the radar, and was banned in Singapore. Why? Because the plot was about a fashion model being brainwashed ala The Manchurian Candidate to assassinate the Malaysian Prime Minister.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/02/zoolander.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Hidden (Cache)<br><br>There's a full scene in which a boy hacks up a chicken's head, and the camera lingers until the chicken dies. This is what this movie is, a headless chicken running around in futile, boring audiences until its end. The plot is like Georges' character when he was almost knocked down by a cyclist - exhibiting great bravado with his initial challenge, but when challenged back in return, cowers and wraps up with the tail in between its legs.

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Final Destination 3<br><br>I wonder why I missed the first two movies of the franchise, given that I'm a fan of gore (the bloodier the merrier). But you need not have watched the first two movies in order to enjoy Final Destination 3, as it's pretty much a stand-alone movie utilizing the same premise.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/02/final-destination-3.html</div>

It's pretty creative to have that story and characters intertwined with the narrative of this movie.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/02/rumor-has-it.html</div>
