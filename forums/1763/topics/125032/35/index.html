              A Nutshell Review: Traitor
              
              It sure took a long time for this film to debut here, and if memory serves me right, it took almost a year, and the DVD has already been released. If not for a press screening already held, I would have thought that the film would be one of those that are difficult to pass by the censors and required some lengthy debate as to the merits for its theatrical release. That's because it deals with the current topic of terrorism in an unflinching manner, with the hijacking of religion to further the terrorists' extremist and violent ends being told in a style yet unseen from films such as The Kingdom, Syriana, The Siege and Body of Lies, to name but a few films dealing with the topic.

              A Nutshell Review: Star Trek
              
              Non-fans might find some reason to scoff at Star Trek being a bit stiff, but this version makes it all sexy again. There's a wonderful story that doesn't pander to the audience nor disrespect its rich history, perfectly fused moments of humour, adequate action, and that core story of how the Enterprise crew got together for its maiden mission, and primed for more when the end credits roll. And it's just nostalgic to see the good 'ol USS Enterprise NCC-1701 given a facelift by Industrial Light and Magic, and taking flight again!

              A Nutshell Review: X-Men Origins: Wolverine
              
              I guess the major news items coming out from this movie, are its infamous internet leak where the only consolation are some few minutes of missing footage, plus some unfinished special effects, and its rumoured six different codas after the end credits roll. I won't know what the illegal downloadable version looks like, and neither am I interested to find out, but the six codas reek of the time of how the comic book industry shot itself in the foot with the variant covers just to get the fanboys to buy them all. I don't suppose this will cause anyone to want to sit through this bland and mediocre film so many times just for a few extra seconds as well.

              A Nutshell Review: Gu Gu The Cat
              
              I guess we've seen enough canine movies coming out from Japan, that it's now the turn for felines to get the spotlight. I would have half expected the plot to follow the usual formula, if not for the fact that Gu Gu the Cat actually became the side show of the plot, despite being the titular character, and worse, a replacement cat in fact.

              A Nutshell Review: The Meerkats
              
              Let the wildlife documentaries roll in. I suppose it's lucrative enough to make a film based on animals both in wildlife, or in captivity, protecting them from the threat of extinction. You can name such films with ease, starting from the award winning March of the Penguins, to the fictional story The Fox and the Child and to the latest screened here in Panda Diary. The Meerkats took a bow at last year's Tokyo International Film Festival, and while we may not be that familiar with this species, the story weaved into this documentary has universal themes going back to basics on survival.

              A Nutshell Review: The Horsemen
              
              I was gearing up for a good serial killer movie given the premise of having the four horsemen of the apocalypse, with the trailer piquing my interest from its fair share of unflinching blood and gore. Sad to say though that the distributors preferred to appeal to a wider audience for this, and some scenes were clearly butchered for its language, conversational content as well as snipping off some of the more gory moments of annihilation. I guess even the horsemen themselves are powerless when up against the censors' scissors, which is the more potent weapon here.

              A Nutshell Review: Kabei - Our Mother
              
              My introduction into Yoji Yamada's cinematic world is through his famed and recent Samurai Trilogy with The Twilight Samurai, The Hidden Blade and Love and Honor. I had enjoyed all three films, and looking at the prolific, veteran director's filmography, I think it'll take me a very long while to watch all his films, especially the Tora-san series. Needless to say when Kabei Our Mother has finally reached our shores, I jumped at the chance to watch what would be an ode to Mothers everywhere, celebrating their innate love for their children.

              A Nutshell Review: The Uninvited
              
              I haven't seen the original Tale of Two Sisters by Kim Ji-woon to begin with so I won't be able to do any meaningful comparisons. But if a remake is any indication of how the original is generally miles better, especially if done by Hollywood, hen it probably is worth my while to put the Korean horror movie in my to-watch list. After all, Kim Ji-woon's film is one of Korea's top box office draws when released.

              A Nutshell Review: Angels &amp; Demons
              
              Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels &amp; Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.

              A Nutshell Review: Dive!!
              
              I guess you know the drill by now for a typical Japanese zero to hero story, and while it's easy to lump this together with Waterboys, this one plays it serious and is pretty much devoid of humour. However it is no pushover in its drama, and its role in elevating the sport itself, given ample opportunity to explain its basic 101 diving principles to any rookie. Watching this for its spectacular dives is pretty much akin to watching it on a television sports channel, but of course the actors here make their characters more endearing as they battle their own personal demons.

One plan I have is to quit the job, sell off everything, pack some essentials into a backpack, and hit the road to travel round the world, even though I know at some point I would probably succumb to whatever's sapping my life away, and at some unknown place, but man, imagine the adventure where risk is but a word in the dictionary.

              Rather than Fireball: Muay Thai Dunk, this could have been more aptly titled as Firebrawl: Anything Goes, and I mean that in a nice way. We know enough of how sports and martial arts can coexist in movies, either in comical fashion like Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer, or played in a more deadpan, idol-movie like manner with the Jay Chou vehicle Kung Fu Dunk. Joining their ranks is this latest action film directed by Thanakorn Pongsuwan, which fuses an illegal underground basketball league, and Muay Thai fighting.

But seriously, do we need another half-vampire, half-human hybrid being for the big screen, even though this has anime roots?

              I'm beginning to wonder whether the 3D novelty is wearing out already, especially if slapped on films that think the beauty of visual effects and animation take precedence over a solid story. Everything here worked to a perfect T, from the very key component of animation, to voice casting, and sound, but what the film ultimately lacked, was a compelling narrative, and soul.

              A Nutshell Review: Night at the Museum 2
              
              I didn't particularly enjoy my first Night at the Museum as I thought it had tried really hard to be funny, and going from set piece to set piece from within the New York Museum of Natural History, taking a while before it got its engine cranking. For me, the funniest Ben Stiller comedies had been the relatively more adult fare like There's Something About Mary, The Heartbreak Kid and such, but this family friendly fare surprised me, and belonged to the rare few sequels which actually surpassed the original.

              A Nutshell Review: Echelon Conspiracy
              
              At one glance, it's easy to dismiss Echelon Conspiracy as yet another Eagle Eye wannabe. Face it, it has a man who receives mysterious and anonymous instructions, being on the run from authorities, and constantly getting put into various lines of fire. Only that despite its plot loopholes and common ground factors, this B-grade movie is a lot more fun than the big budgeted action thriller from last year, and Shane West being a lot less irritating that Shia LaBeouf.

              A Nutshell Review: The Young Victoria
              
              The cinematic interests in the British monarchy continues with Queen Victoria (1837 to 1901), after having seen in recent years, the efforts with Keira Knightley's The Duchess, Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth films, and Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman's take on the Boleyn sisters with The Other Boleyn Girl. More contemporary stories would include Helen Mirren's award winning portrayal of The Queen on the current reign of Queen Elizabeth II at the turn of Princess Diana's death.

              A Nutshell Review: Sunshine Barry and the Disco Worms
              
              School holiday season would dictate more animated and family oriented films being released in the theatres, and while we would rue at having to wait until September for Pixar's Up, we have to make do with the rather lacklustre Monsters vs Aliens with 3D gimmick, and the little unknowns (pardon the pun) like Sunshine Barry and the Disco Worms, set in the insect kingdom with earthworms species being put in the spotlight.

              A Nutshell Review: Terminator Salvation
              
              One thing's for sure about the Terminator franchise now, we can begin to dash all hopes of a Cameron-Arnie comeback, given the former has mentioned he has done all he wanted with the first two films, and the latter now a politician. Terminator Salvation, with McG at the helm and a bevy of writers attempting to do a one-up on the original two films, only managed to bring about a thrill ride which is miles better than the third installment, but has plenty of catch up to do if the new films were to stamp their authority on the franchise.

              A Nutshell Review: Hannah Montana: The Movie
              
              My only exposure to the father-daughter make believe Disney World that Billy Ray and Miley Cyrus have gotten themselves into, as the reel father-daughter team up as Robby Ray and Miley Stewart, was the Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour 3D film. While I had enjoyed her performance with 3D gizmos, it didn't actually pique my interest enough to follow the adventures of Hannah Montana and her alter ego, which is some art imitate life imitate art kinda tween series, which has recently been green-lit for yet another season.

              A Nutshell Review: State of Play
              
              I'm a fan of a good investigative thriller, and State of Play combines that with some good old fashioned action from the newsroom with dogged reporters seeking perennial truth. Written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray, you know you're in for one gripping ride with relentless twists and turns, as between them they are responsible for stories such as Lions for Lambs, The Kingdom, Michael Clayton, the Bourne franchise screenplays, Proof of Life, Breach and Shattered Glass. Whew! Imagine all the going points about those films all combined into one!

              A Nutshell Review: Drag Me to Hell
              
              This film sucks a lot. As if the mouth tends to get in the way and having stuff shoved deep into it, be it the chin or even an entire arm socked right into it. Or at least that's one of the images that got is now permanently scarred in my head. With its copious amounts of drool salivating out from mouths, extremely wet slobbering and dribbling from lips, Drag Me to Hell is erm, deliciously frightening yet funny at the same time, thanks to Sam Raimi going back to his horror roots and delivering one thrilling ride with an old school flavour to it.

              A Nutshell Review: Man on Wire
              
              James Marsh directed Man on Wire to critical acclaim, and snagged amongst other recognition, the best documentary feature in this year's Academy Awards. Containing the usual talking heads styled interviews with everyone involved one way or another in high-wire walker Philippe Petit's 1974 stunt at New York's World Trade Centers' Twin Towers, this film is extremely engaging as you the audience get to participate in what is sadly a stunt that can no longer be replicated.

              A Nutshell Review: Ghosts of Girlfriends Past
              
              For those who have played the field and sown some wild oats around town, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past might be a walk down a personal memory lane into why nothing lasts longer than possibly that first, genuine relationship. There are reasons abound why some are either commitment freaks, or just plainly wanting to chalk up a list of conquests to show off, and for top fashion photographer Connor Meat, erm I mean Mead (Matthew McConaughey), it's a run from responsibility, and the fear of never ever wanting to be hurt again.
