If you're looking for a movie that has all those elements, then look no further than Hostel, which has got them all.

He's been performing under the walkway near the Bedok hawker centre for months. Do I stop to listen? Frankly speaking, not really, even though I use that same walkway to get me home almost everyday. It's like he (and his performance) has become intrinsically part of the landscape, one that has blended in the background as I go about with my life. But I do hear the music. Sometimes folk, sometimes rock, an occassional Elvis or Beatles, sometimes even silence as he takes a smoke break or chat with some passers-by.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/04/singapore-gaga.html</div>

Cliche and overused sequences which will probably make you scream "haven't I seen this somewhere before"? Firewall offered nothing very new in terms of plot outline, as it contains modified scenes from even Ford's own works like Air Force One (the family's survival being threatened, and it's up to one man to save the day) and The Fugitive (the frame up and one man's run from the law).

Directed by illustrator Dave McKean, you'd come to expect the stunning visuals which MirrorMask offered, right from the opening credit sequence in 3D. MirrorMask tells the story of protagonist Helena, a young girl belonging to a family of circus performers. She often dreams of life outside performances, that of what she deems as "real life", as opposed to her own fantasy world of make believe inside the Big Top.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/04/mirrormask.html<br><br>And click here for more SIFF reviews: http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/04/in-camp-training-10th-apr-to-24th-apr.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: When a Stranger Calls<br><br>When a Stranger Calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes, with movies like Poseidon just over the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) helms this updated version, with plenty of relative unknown casts, which signals either the death rate is high (it isn't), or that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkey.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/05/when-stranger-calls.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Find Me Guilty<br><br>We're all familiar with Vin Diesel being the new action hero, with his buffed muscular body, bald pate, gruff voice and his high octane movies like Fast and the Furious and xXx. He took a different path into comedy with The Pacifier, and now, into drama with Find Me Guilty. How did he fair?<br><br>Pretty good, in spite of the focus being on his new look hairdo and belly (ok, so it's prosthetics and makeup assisted). Playing a real life mobster Jack DiNorscio, and the true story of his defense of himself in court without a lawyer, in an extremely long trial spanning 21 months, where it's the US Government versus the Lucchese crime family.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/05/find-me-guilty.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Bewitching Attraction<br><br>Billed as a romantic sex comedy, Bewitching Attraction is neither full of raunchy sex (ala another movie in town now - Lie With Me), nor is it full of laughs. It's an acquired taste, with sporadic nudity and sex, and rests its wit in black comedy instead.<br><br>continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/05/bewitching-attraction.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Nun (La Monja)<br><br>This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles, even though the story's about the character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we'll have spinoffs like The Monk, The Priest, and others belonging to various religious sects.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/05/nun-la-monja.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: Poseidon<br><br>Director Wolfgang Petersen has the credentials to do a remake of the movie, based on a novel by Paul Gallico. Given that he's got his feet wet enough with Das Boot and The Perfect Storm, and enough experience helming big budgeted summer movies like Air Force One and Troy, however, what's the point of a remake?<br><br>continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/05/poseidon.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Wild<br><br>2006 is the year of the animal animation. Earlier in the year, we had the local stinker Zodiac Race, and over the next few months, there are offerings like Over the Hedge, Barnyard, Happy Feet (no doubt inspired by March of the Penguins) and Open Season.

            <div class='col-md body'>A Nutshell Review: The Da Vinci Code<br><br>This movie is becoming as controversial as the book. Since the day it was announced that it's gonna be made, there were protests against it being done, and it has escalated to calls for boycotting, or banning the movie altogether. I'll not waste time and go into its controversies, nor discuss what's real and what's not. Neither will I explain in detail the plot, as I believe most of you readers would already have some vague idea of what it's about, or have read the book, since it's on the bestsellers list for months.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/05/da-vinci-code.html</div>
