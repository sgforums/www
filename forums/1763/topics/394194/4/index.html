              </p><p class="MsoNormal">guess it's peter principle. the producers of bob rose to a level of
              incompetence when they made the pacific. will give it a ten for telling a
              pretentious story about WWII.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">it doesn't have to be great or fantastic, it just has to be
              a normal film or tv show about WWII. but even the mediocre flags of our fathers
              &amp; letters from iwo jima beat this one hands down.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">heard they were stretching the air time in ep 10 too. dunno how
              true.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">will watch the rest online, can't give my viewership for the
              last 3 episodes even though they're sitting right there in the tv box.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">the only
              good thing that came out of this was stumbling upon angels of america made in
              2003.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">i like hbo. i think they have made some unforgettable and
              original american tv shows out there but the pacific is rubbish. i hope they move out of this rut quickly.</p>

              <p>no idea hitman.</p>
              <p>i may know nuts about military science but won't be surprised if they made psyche wounds look stupid in the pacific. </p>
              <p>btw eugene sledge's buddy snafu, the one who started the whole business of cracking japanese skulls... i think he's one actor to look out for. pretty intense in a slow burning manner, much like ben foster &amp; ryan gosling. </p>

              <p>according to the veterans interviewed in bob, some chose to be paratroopers for an extra $50 pay cheque. later, others like ronald spiers returned to combat in korea even though they had enough points to call it a day. john basilone is just one out of thousands. possibly millions. </p>

              <p>generation kill is an old show, its about the recon marines during the invasion of iraq.</p>
              <p>it shows incompetent leaders, ball carrying sergeant majors and a bunch of grunts.</p>
              <p>but i always watch these shows while i check out what is their actual mission on the web.</p>

              <p>i know its acting but at least its most interesting for me to link a documentary and the war scene</p>

              <p>Unfortunately for HBO as well since the production cost is the most expensive mini series ever for HBO but the ratings had been nowhere near to those of BOB.</p>
