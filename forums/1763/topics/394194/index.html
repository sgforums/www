              <p><br>I think that is because the movie leap into Gaudalcanal  immediately without really introduce the characters and audience have yet to built relationship with the characters and people start dying its kind of confuse to put names on faces.</p>
              <p>You got to read the book and understand the sequence of the campaign. Than put the battles in the movie into perspective of where, when and how it happen in respect to the entire War Zone in Gaudalcanal.....Because In this series the film maker only filmed the important battles. It is what the 3 person account and not explain the entire war.  So goes the rest of the mini series you kinda of have read the entire campaign.</p>
              <p>Maybe this is what Tom Hank and Steven wants to educate the audience. Spark questions...go read up..both film makers don't just do this without intend.  They also have a tendency to go off Tangent....</p>

              With The Old Breed
              By
              Eugene B. Sledge
              Corporal Peter A. Swigart
              31 Area Maintenance, Headquarters Company
              Weapons &amp; Field Training Battalion
              06/01/26
              With The Old Breed by Eugene Sledge is a startling account of World War II and
              was based on his personal experiences as he served as a mortar man with Kilo Company,
              Third Battalion, Fifth Marines on Peleliu and Okinawa. These battles were known for
              their bloody and savage fighting. Private First Class Sledge gives a straightforward
              approach, illustrating the climate, conditions, and describes in detail the actions of the
              Marines as they fought the Japanese.
              After enlisting in the Marine Corps, Sledge goes to boot camp in San Diego.
              Corporal Doherty, Sledgeâ€™s drill instructor, amplified everything it meant to be a Marine
              and set a positive example for the recruits of his platoon. He demonstrated the attitude,
              character, strength, endurance, enthusiasm, experience, and determination of a true
              professional. He taught his platoon the basics of being a Marine. Weapons handling,
              shooting, marching, and basic discipline were emphasized throughout the entirety of boot
              camp. Sledge would use this basic Marine Corp knowledge as he furthered his training
              and preparation for combat at Camp Elliott. Arriving at Camp Elliott, Private First Class
              Sledge had to make a decision about which weaponry he wanted to be assigned and He
              chose 60 mm mortars. A Non Commissioned Officer taught Sledge his entire knowledge
              of how to effectively operate his weapon, assemble and disassemble, and how to strike
              the enemy when the opportunity came. For Sledge, the opportunity to apply his training
              in combat came earlier than anticipated.
              On September 15, 1944 the 1st Marine Division landed on Peleliu. Peleliu was a
              defensive stronghold for the Japanese, who were entrenched in caves and waiting for the
              attack. The 10,000 Japanese covered every square inch of Peleliu with interlocking fields
              of fire and fought using a new defensive style of fighting. The defense-in-depth tactic
              would be used to cover more areas and inflict many more causalities than previous
              strategies. In previous campaigns, a Marine landing would be met with the bonsai attack,
              in which the Japanese would charge in a costly frontal assault. The defense in depth
              tactic was now used with greater effect.
              Sledgeâ€™s accounts of the battle are a great illustration to the actual battlefield.
              With his description of the fight, the reader can imagine the nervousness, adrenaline, and
              fear of the men. His account details the sound of explosions, the whistling of rounds
              flying down range, and the cries of dying and injured Marines. From the beach assault to
              making landfall, Sledge carefully describes every footstep. Sledge begins to learn that
              war changes a man forever. He witnesses a dead Japanese soldier, cut open like an
              animal carcass at slaughter and how a combat veteran comes upon the scene and without
              hesitation begins to pilfer the personal belongings of the dead man. Sledge is astonished
              at the indifference to a dead human being. He would become hardened later on as the
              battles became bloodier and the loss of friends weigh deeper on his mind. The Marine
              Corps basic disciplines helped Sledge overcome his mental and physical exhaustion and
              emotional pain to maintain his focus of fighting and survival. Sledge leaves Peleliu a
              very different man than when he arrived.
              As the American forces drew closer to the Japanese home islands, the tougher the
              fighting was expected to be. The Japanese were expected to defend their homeland using
              every able Japanese soldier to prevent the United States from winning the war in the
              Pacific. The fighting became tougher as the strategy of the defense-in-depth with
              interlocking fields of fire was refined and the number of defenders increased.
              After Peleliu, the Men of Kilo Company, prepared for their next campaign on the
              Japanese island of Okinawa. As the day of the assault drew closer, fear and worry came
              over them as they contemplated the difficult fight ahead. Okinawa was to become an
              even more difficult fight for the Marines. It was even tougher than previous campaigns
              in that it lasted longer and involved larger numbers of men fighting, more ordinance
              expended, resulting in more death and destruction than any other battle of the Pacific.
              The battle for Okinawa was the ultimate test of the fortitude of men in combat.
              Their resolve was tested daily as the fight consumed men and energy at a rate never
              experienced in fighting in the Pacific. For the infantry units, the losses were hard to
              comprehend, when compared to what are considered heavy losses by todayâ€™s standards.
              Sledge describes the challenges of climate as the Marines deal with cold, rain and heat,
              all the while engaging the enemy in fierce combat. The sustained exposure to the stresses
              of combat, push the men to their limits and beyond as they fight for control of the island.
              This book reminds all Marines the importance of the basic fundamentals of being
              a United States Marine. Eugene Sledge constantly referred to the necessities of personal
              hygiene habits, rifle cleaning and safe weapons handling, and maintaining his uniform.
              To have an enlisted Marine Private First Class give his perspective of combat through his
              own eyes and how he endured such nightmarish conditions is something everyone should
              know about.
              I feel every Marine should read With the Old Breed. As a Corporal of Marines, I
              found the book to be motivating, in that it reminded me of the sacrifices of my
              predecessors and the responsibility I have in maintaining that standard. Throughout all
              the turmoil that surrounded Sledgeâ€™s life, he was able to keep his sanity along with a
              compassionate optimism for humanity. No one truly knows how he or she will handle
              combat until they actually experience it. Sledgeâ€™s account gives an idea of the limits to
              which a man can go. I found the accounts of Sledgeâ€™s experiences to be instrumental in
              my understanding of the battles of the Pacific and the Marine Corpsâ€™ contribution to the
              defeat of the Japanese.

              <p><br> I think that is because the movie leap into Gaudalcanal
               immediately without really introduce the characters and
              audience have yet to built relationship with
              the characters and people start dying its kind of confuse
              to put names on faces.</p>
              <p>You got to read the book and understand the sequence of the
              campaign. Than put the battles in the movie into
              perspective of where, when and how it happen in respect
              to the entire War Zone in Gaudalcanal.....Because In this
              series the film maker only filmed the
              important battles. It is what the 3 person account
              and not explain the entire war.  So goes the rest of the
              mini series you kinda of have read the entire campaign.</p>
              <p>Maybe this is what Tom Hank and Steven wants to educate the
              audience. Spark questions...go read up..both film makers don't
              just do this without intend.  They also have a tendency to go

              <p>part 1 n 2 has alot of closed up night time shooting and that may have affected how the scene on screen also considered in tropical jungle it is difficult for audience to guage the battle. Unlike band of brothers there was a lot of daytime fighting and open area shooting.</p>

              With The Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa 
              E. B. Sledge 
              
              â€œRifles were high and holy things to them, and they knew five-inch broadside guns. They talked patronizingly of the war, and were concerned about rations. They were the Leathernecks, the Old Timers..They were the old breed of American regular, regarding the service as home and war as an occupation; and they transmitted their temper and character and viewpoint to the high-hearted volunteer mass which filled the ranks of the Marine Brigadeâ€¦â€�
              -â€œThe Leathernecksâ€� in Fix Bayonets
              By John W. Thompson, Jr. 
              
              My wife got me a Kindle for this Christmas. Itâ€™s an amazing little gadget, but it needed some reading material. I must admit that most of my reading has been of the war in Europe and Africa. I needed something to read concerning the war in the Pacific. So I came across this title in Amazon.com and decided to download it. I donâ€™t think I could have done any better.
              
              This is not a grand strategy or even a fire and maneuver book. It is not a about clever flanking operations, but about a personal war through the eyes of a young nineteen year old from Alabama. His relationship to the Corps and his fellow USMC recruits and his admiration of the Old Breed are artfully spread throughout the book. 
              
              E. B. (â€œSledgehammerâ€�) Sledgeâ€™s personal account of his WWII experience is told at the very deepest personal level. This book brings you right into the very essence of combat with all the emotions and horrendous sights, sounds, and odors under the worst of conditions and for long periods of time. The emotional roller coaster of going into combat the first time and the return to combat after an R&amp;R period are all captured and laid out for the reader. Sledgehammer is an astute observer of the human condition under the most trying of situations. 
              
              â€œWar is brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waster. Combat leaves an inedible mark on those who are forced to endure it. The only redeeming factors were my comradesâ€™ incredible bravery and their devotion to each other. Marine corps training taught us to kill efficiently and try to survive. But it also taught us loyalty to each other â€“ and love. That spirit de corps sustained us.â€�
              
              Sledgehammer laments about the terrible toll of war and the effects on those that fight and survive it. Yet he understands that is a necessary thing that must be done, but perhaps not at Peleliu.
              At one point Sledgehammer and his buddies, come to question the real need for taking Peleliu. It is a chilling moment.
              
              His narrative is akin to a word â€œmovie cameraâ€� taking in all it sees and distilling the horror and sorrow of mortal combat. He describes how intensely just the local environment could He also sees responsible leadership in his CO as well.
              
              Night time was a particularly unnerving to the newly combat immersed Marines on Peleliu. Just south of the Bloody Nose Ridge on Peleliu, K Company 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (K/3/5) was dug in and facing a Japanese defense in depth build into the islandâ€™s coral ridge system. From this position, Japanese soldiers always tried to infiltrate the American lines at night.
              
              His description of his CO, Capt Haldane in action, is just such a movie: 
              
              â€œI was ordered to carry a five-gallon can of water over to the company CP. When I got there, Ack Ack (Capt Haldane) was studying a map by the light of a tiny flashlight that his runner shielded with another folded map. The companyâ€™s radioman was sitting with him, quietly tuning his radio and calling an artillery battery of the 11th Marines.
              
              Putting the water can down, I sat on it and watched my skipper with admiration. Never before had I regretted so profoundly my lack of artistic talent and inability to draw the scene before me. The tiny flashlight faintly illuminated Captain Haldaneâ€™s face as he studied the map. His big jaw, covered with charcoal stubble of beard, jutted out. His heavy brow wrinkled with concentration just below the rim of his helmet.
              
              The radioman handed the phone to Ack Ack .He requested a certain number of rounds of 75mm HE to be fired out to Company Kâ€™s front. A marine on the other end of the radio questioned the need for the request.
              
              Haldane answered pleasantly and firmly, â€œMaybe so, but I want my boys to feel secure.â€� Shortly the 75s came whining overhead and started bursting in the dark thick growth across the road.
              
              Next day I told several men what Ack Ack had said. â€œThatâ€™s the skipper for you, always thinking of the troopsâ€™ feelings,â€� was the way one man summed it up.â€� 
              
              Sledgehammer traces the hellish combat and loss of his friends all the way through the Peleliu campaign which took more than four months versus the predicted 4 days. 
              
              And he graphically describes another type of hell found on the island of Okinawa. I personally thought that â€œWhat could have been worse than Peleliu?â€� until I read Sledgehammerâ€™s book on Okinawa. 
              
              One final passage reveals the true nature of Sledgehammer. He wasnâ€™t a glory hound or slacker. He did his duty especially on that first amphibious landing at Peleliu and his baptism under fire. He never won a medal for gallantry, but one of the Gloucester vets had a quiet conversion with Sledgehammer after K/3/5 left Peleliu for refit and rest at Pavuvu.
              
              â€œAfter we had been back on Pavuvu about a week, I had one of the most heartwarming and rewarding experiences of my entire enlistment in the Marine Corps. It was after taps, all the flambeaus were out, and all my tent mates were in their sacks with mosquito nets in place. We were all very tired, still trying to unwind from the tension and ordeal of Peleliu.
              
              All was quiet except for someone who had begun snoring softly when one of those men, a Gloucester veteran who had been wounded on Peleliu, said in steady measured tones, â€œyou know something, Sledgehammer?â€�
              
              â€œWhat?â€� I answered.
              
              â€œI kinda had my doubts about you,â€� he continued, â€œand how youâ€™d act when we got into combat, and the stuff hit the fan. I mean, your ole man being a doctor and you havinâ€™ been to college and being sort of a rich kid compared to some guys. But I kept my eye on you on Peleliu, and by God you did OK; you did OK.â€�
              
              â€œThanks ole buddy,â€� I replied, nearly bursting with pride. Many men were decorated with medals they richly earned for their brave actions in combat, medals to wear on their blouses for everyone to see. I was never awarded an individual decoration, but the simple, sincere personal remarks of approval by my veteran comrade that night after Peleliu were like a medal to me. I have carried them in my heart with great pride and satisfaction ever since.â€�

              <p>..............dun sound like much of a war....</p>
              <p>japs had mostly 80% armed with bolt actioned outdated slower non  auto loading rifles and with no submachineguns or much practical weapons!their hand grenades even had to be knocked over their helmets to ensure that it really exploded somewhat!the officers sidearm pistol looked like a badly designed plastic capgun that was inaccurate and jammed often......the weapons on jap sides were a joke!</p>
              <p>the americans had 60% M1 rifles which loads itself automatically , thompson submachineguns and other better and faster machineguns.their grenades dun need to be knocked on anything once pin is out and thrown at target.their colt  auto pistol made in 1911 never jammed and is often used up to this day.</p>
              <p>the germans had almost the same variation as the americans but still lost anyway.</p>
              <p>the americans with superior weapons fighting with an ancient japanese army with outdated weapons in the jungle sounds odd......</p>
              <p>fighting a war like that would be like fighting the war in iraq where coalition forces would be armed with modern  automatic weapons while the mujahideens armed only with old ww2 heavy clunky weapons that cant even fire on automatic.</p>
              <p>american versus jap army sounds like an unfair fight where the japs would lose due to bad weapons.</p>
