              <p class="MsoNormal">testimonials in BOB are also a lot stronger, evoked more emotions. In The

              screenplay is quite bad. hence audiences are confused.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">nothing to do with leaping right into the story.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">or perhaps, because stephen e ambrose himself has passed and
              unable to co produce and maintain the consistency n integrity.  </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">peleilu so far has rather exciting combat battles in terms
              of action, but still, the lines are bad. not much soul. Leckie, Sledge and
              Basilone's personal experience in the war are supposed to be the focus in The
              Pacific, sadly they were quite poorly shown. especially Leckie.<span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Leckie's conversation with Eugene at night with references
              to Kipling and God, Eugene's scene with his pal by the beach, they're all fit
              for war films with cliches in 1950, not the 21<sup>st</sup> millenium.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">i'm looking forward to Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The big eyed
              bugger who dugged out the Japanese's gold tooth sure can act. am looking
              forward to future episodes. hopefully it gets better from now. :D and by the
              time Basilone returns to war, there's some decent improvement.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I still like BOB. watch Bastogne. one of the best
              screenplays and most moving episode written ever. took them only 1.5 episodes to make us feel the medic.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">it's always the screenplay that makes or breaks, nothing to do with showing things in chronological order or giving characters air time with proper introduction. done with my longwinded post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> </p>

              <p>didn't read helmet under my pillow, neither did i read eugene sledge's third person account of the war but i think in The Pacific, they may be trying to do more with material that's so much thinner and less acclaimed than Ambrose's works. hence the backfire. like you said, Ambrose had good perspective. </p>
              <p>will definitely pick up these titles soon. maybe then will be able to appreciate The Pacific for what it's worth. so far the only thing I've read by ambrose is lewis and clark's great voyage and it's rather well written. </p>

              <p>testimonials in BOB are also a lot stronger, evoked more emotions. In The Pacific they seem disjointed and sparse. some barely even lasting 10 seconds. inspite of the best intentions,<span> </span> this screenplay is quite bad. hence audiences are confused.</p>
              <p>nothing to do with leaping right into the story.</p>
              <p>or perhaps, because stephen e ambrose himself has passed and unable to co produce and maintain the consistency n integrity.  </p>
              <p>peleilu so far has rather exciting combat battles in terms of action, but still, the lines are bad. not much soul. Leckie, Sledge and Basilone's personal experience in the war are supposed to be the focus in The Pacific, sadly they were quite poorly shown. especially Leckie.<span> </span></p>
              <p>Leckie's conversation with Eugene at night with references to Kipling and God, Eugene's scene with his pal by the beach, they're all fit for war films with cliches in 1950, not the 21<sup>st</sup> millenium.</p>
              <p>i'm looking forward to Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The big eyed bugger who dugged out the Japanese's gold tooth sure can act. am looking forward to future episodes. hopefully it gets better from now. :D and by the time Basilone returns to war, there's some decent improvement.</p>
              <p>I still like BOB. watch Bastogne. one of the best screenplays and most moving episode written ever. took them only 1.5 episodes to make us feel the medic.</p>
              <p>it's always the screenplay that makes or breaks, nothing to do with showing things in chronological order or giving characters air time with proper introduction. done with my longwinded post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> </p>

              <p>i have to agreed that screen play is not as good as BOB i wonder is it because of CG technology.....I know that the Peleliu set was a model completely came out from Australia.</p>
              <p>I notice Peleliu + 0 there was a Japanese beach bunker they did not show how that was attack kinda of skirt thru....equally on Peleliu part 6.  There is a lot of chop battle field scene again.

              <p>didn't read helmet under my pillow, neither did i read eugene sledge's third person account of the war but i think in The Pacific, they may be trying to do more with material that's so much thinner and less acclaimed than Ambrose's works. hence the backfire. like you said, Ambrose had good perspective. </p>
              <p>will definitely pick up these titles soon. maybe then will be able to appreciate The Pacific for what it's worth. so far the only thing I've read by ambrose is lewis and clark's great voyage and it's rather well written. </p>

              </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>maybe it lacks
              literary perspective, thus no emotional depth in terms of dialogue, atmosphere
              and acting. </span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>as for camera
                  perspective, the DP has done a pretty decent job with limited landscapes. Imo,
                  it jives with Spielberg’s idea of bringing the war ‘right to your face’ by
                  creating a first person’s perspective through framing. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>in episode 5’s
                  beach landing on peleliu, it’s quite common to dehumanize enemies of protagonists
                  (sledge) by only filming from his point of view. in doing so, reduces a fair
                  amount of CGI work and more importantly, enforces distance with Japanese while
                  enhancing audience r/s with the Americans. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>but in comparison,
                  I still prefer bob. the engagement between audience and protagonist was
                  seamless, whether literally, or indirectly.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>for example, when
                  Winters was forced to kill a teenage German soldier and subsequently, haunted
                  by the memory till end of war. the duality of human nature, the difficult
                  things an ordinary man was made to do in combat, were quite subtly told and
                  clearly felt. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Pacific, all
                  the more needing this level of personal conflict and depth, so far hasn’t
                  delivered any. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>maybe like what
                  most critics say, The Pacific is trying to do too much of everything. pay
                  tribute to the veterans, be historically correct, bullet proof the critics, account
                  for the budget while bringing home the memoirs of Leckie and Sledge. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>imo near mid of
                  pre production, Spielberg n Tom Hanks realized the material has gone off key
                  and decided to screw everything and just do what Hollywood producers do best,
                  invest heavily in CG, effects followed by heavy marketing. </span></p>

Ambrose, university historian turned hugely popular -—and prolific—author of nonfiction historical narrative. Originally known for his scholarly biographies on Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon, Ambrose broke into the popular market with <em>Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest,</em> which was turned into a well-known, and much rebroadcast television series. After he retired from teaching, Ambrose set up a family company, Ambrose-Tubbs, Inc., to help him lead historical tours and work on best sellers about such diverse topics as the Lewis and Clark Expedition, World War II, Crazy Horse, and much more.</p>

Citing faulty citations, Ambrose apologized, and his publisher promised to put the sentences in question in quotes in future editions. But shortly after, other accusations arose: about passages in books like his <em>Crazy Horse and Custer, Citizen Soldiers,</em> and a volume of his three-volume biography <em>Nixon.</em> Ambrose responded that the relevant material was cited in his footnotes.</p>

The article says that while Ambrose always claimed to have been asked by Eisenhower to write an authorized biography, in fact he himself asked permission to do so. Further, while he said that he had had numerous long and often personal discussions with the general, he really met him just a few times. The story came to light after officials at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum came across unpublished correspondence.</p>

              <p>pacific war drama remindfs me of The  Waltons 2 decades ago.slow moving and in the end makes some kinda sense.............this is a war movie...it sounds like a soap opera that wiped out good movies like the all talk no action 2007 battlestar galactica series .</p>
              <p>can u believe if the Stargate SG-1 movie was all talk no action where all of them discuss about their love lives and juvenile anger etc etc and focusiing less of the real action??!!!</p>
              <p>maybe i missed out on most of the exciting episodes...i watched the episode on melbourne and the episode on the island where this dude had his bayonet in some japanese dead soldiers mouth.</p>
              <p>maybe i should go out and buy the dvd as i do find the colour and scene quite refreshing apart from plenty of talking and less action and i refuse to believe steven spielbergs other episodes  have been reduced to  another M.A.S.H. equivalent.</p>

              <p>i was thinking....that they want to focus on the human toll. In part there is an unpolular war going on that might be too much to stomach for audience.</p>

              <p> i have seen 3/10 of the episodes,i think The Pacific sucks BIG TIME!</p>
              <p>I DIDNT SEE ANY FIGHTING JUST DIRTY UNIFORMS AND DEAD SOLDIERS!</p>
              <p>i can imagine band of brothers being a movie with the same content.walking into a MASH looking hospital and talking lots with no action and real fire.</p>
              <p>in band of bros they had artillery shells....soldiers running,tanks blazing away,hordes of german soldiers ,fighting in a town,real 2 sided views from the enemy as well from the own troops ,even the training days seem to be very realistic on the kind of men they had and they had a real fight ina really beautiful place.</p>
              <p>in the pacific, all i saw were men digginbg out gold outa someones head and men showing their butts often.and theres no fight....only cheap talk and dragging their boots in their dirty uniform.seems like the pacific was thought out by a 60 year old woman with no military training.however all these are gratiously coverd up with no brainer uncensored movies like 100 times more gruesome stuff as compared to band of bros.its not dull gruesome stuff of badly mutilated corpses and all small talk that counts ina war movie...........i dont know even where to begin and end with such a half baked film as the pacific.that fil should never even be made.</p>
              <p>perhaps time has taken a toll on steven spielberg and tom hanks creative juices or they got the same scriptwriter as the inglorious bastards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THE PACIFIC I WOULD RATE AS A  4/10 WAR MOVIE.ITS A FLOP FOR A MOVIE AND WOULD DO BETTER IF IT WERE A REMAKE OF THE WALTONS.</p>
              <p>its a FLOP as a war movie even though they claimed it was from steven spielberg n tom hanks!</p>

              <p>band of bros however is rated as 7/10 because  its more human.more war-like and realistic without even having much people blown up.ive seen it 20 times band of bros and i never get tired of it.</p>
              <p>the pacific make me feel like.....is this the end???is the fighting over already???zzzzzzz</p>
