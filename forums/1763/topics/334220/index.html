              is a popular screening of new local short films and is followed by a
              Q&amp;A with the filmmakers. A platform for new filmmakers and anyone
              who is interested in filmmaking to meet, exchange ideas and show their
              work. See the future talents of Singapore film!<br> <br> 1. Together / Ivy Lee / 31 min / 2008 / PG<br> Bee’s boyfriend QQ insists to spend a Christmas holiday at her home.
              However, Bee always finds her family an embarrassment and does not wish
              to let QQ meet her ugly family. Thus, she conjures up all sorts of
              funny ideas to chase her family away. However, QQ turns out to a
              cheat...<br> <br> Ivy likes to work on social issues and loves getting story ideas from
              friends’ experiences and daily news reports.  For e.g., many young
              people today have placed their love relationships prior to kinship.
              “Together” is a short film that reminds everyone the importance of
              family, and that there is no place like home. “Together” is also her
              final year film project that unites her teachers and classmates in Hong
              Kong together with film students from various polytechnics in
              Singapore. The film is also a co-production with Ad Infinitum Films,
              headed by The Substation’s Associate Artist Kelvin Sng.<br> <br> 2. A Fistful of Yusof Ishaks / Nelson Yeo / 4 min / 2008 / PG<br> A son witnesses his father confront a long-awaited assassin sent by his arch-nemesis. <br> <br> Nelson Yeo graduated from Nanyang Polytechnic with a diploma in digital
              media design. During his poly stint, he clinched 2 prestigious crowbar
              awards: Gold for animation “One-armed swordsman” &amp; Bronze for an
              experimental short “The Experiment”. Aside from his studies, Nelson
              also works on independent film projects. This is the first piece he is
              submitting for competitions. Nelson is currently majoring in digital
              filmmaking in the NTU School of Art, Design &amp; Media.<br> <br> 3. Tak Dong Cheng / Suffian Zainuddin / 36 min /2008 / PG<br> Best Friends Jas and Farid are interested in learning lion dance.
              However, they face many obstacles and challenges while learning a
              different culture. In a multi-cultural country such as Singapore, will
              they be able to realize their dreams?<br> <br> Suffian’s interest in filmmaking started from his many back packing
              trips with friends. Armed with a camcorder and digital camera, their
              enthusiastic and trigger-happy selves always resulted in hours of
              footages and piles of pictures. Shorter footages of the trips in the
              form of music videos were made and the passion for filmmaking soon
              followed.<br> <br> His first short film, “Mat Superhero” was first screened at The Substation in 2007.<br> <br> <br> <br> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> SUBMISSIONS ARE WELCOME ALL YEAR ROUND! For more information or to
