              <p>Engineer is a Tamil language film originally slated to be released in 1999. It is supposedly based on the true story of the Narmada dam project. The original film was based on a dam being built across a village.The premise of the film is set in a village that faces the threat of perishing if the dam is constructed. The engineer (played by Arvind Swamy) undertakes the project for corporate interests. The wife of the engineer (Madhuri Dixit), fights against insensitive authorities that do not seem to be concerned with villagers' woes. She is left numb when she learns that her husband is also a part of the dam project.The construction of large dams on the River Narmada in central India and its impact on millions of people living in the river valley has become one of the most important social issues in contemporary India</p>
              <p>It is a multi-budgeted film being made in three different languages, that is Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. It stars Arvind Swamy and Madhuri Dixit.The director of this film is Ghandi Krishna.Music for this film is composed by A.R. Rahman. Cinematography was by Jeeva and dialogue by Sujatha Rangarajan The film was to be first South film of the former 90s queen of Bollywood, Madhuri. However, the film was shelved due to unknown reasons after 80 percent of shooting was completed. As of 2007, the project was restarted and the film will have a new look with a different cast and producer.</p>
              <p><strong>Pre release</strong></p>
              <p>The film was announced in early 1997 with a pre release promotional poster. No news of the film's production was heard of in the media.The film's hype has been in the news for long. Initially the production team had offered the film to Madhuri, but she declined. The film went on hold. After the Supreme Court order on the Narmada dam project, Gandhi approached Madhuri  and this time, the actress agreed to play the role with renewed interest. In 2007, it was announced that a different producer Kalaipuli S. Danu has restarted the film with actor Surya in the lead. Sources say that Krishna approached Surya with the script and the latter was impressed. Now the director is busy finalizing a suitable heroine.<br><br><strong>Production</strong><br><br>The original film was to be produced by Ramachandra Rao. Kalaipuli S. Danu will be producing the new film in 2007.</p>
