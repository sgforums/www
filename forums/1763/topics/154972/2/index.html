            <div class='col-md body'>Good Reccs! I've watched some of those already. Can't believe i forgot to mention Amelie; its one of my all-time favourites!<br><br>I've watched Amorres Perres(SP?) and City of God. I felt they were just good-ish. Esp Amorres Perres.  Ditto for Y tu mama Tambien. The americans seem to like the movie very much, but i suspect part of that feeling stems from them wanting to show the finger to the US film rating board!<br><br>I think i will be going for Das Boot next since i've heard good things about it.<br><br>Btw, TuaTau, is Rabbit Proof Fence very preachy? I don't normally like obviously preachy movies.<br><br>Anyway, i am in the UK, so no netflix for me. I am also too cheap to subscribe to UK online dvd rentals, and i think i've just about exhausted all the free trials!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>O well, the Uni Library will have to do.

If you like Australian humour, you could perhaps try "The Castle", which has been hailed as a comedy classic by many Aussies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Technically speaking, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is also made in New Zealand, but as it was funded by the American production company New Line Cinema, the three films could not be considered as foreign films.<br><br>That was why even though "Diarios de motocicleta (The Motorcycle Diaries)" and "Un long dimanche de fianÃ§ailles (A Very Long Engagement)" were apparently foreign language films, they were also not considered as foreign films by the Academy because of the funding by American film companies.</div>

Not great, but slightly better than the American fraternity movies.<br><br>For those inclined towards "mature audience only" movies, one interesting note about the French actors is their relatively liberated view of sex and nudity. Almost every internationally-renowned French actress has appeared nude in at least one movie in her career. For Tautou, one of those was the period comedy "Le Libertin".</div>
