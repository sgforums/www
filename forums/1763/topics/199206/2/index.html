            <div class='col-md body'>I love it. And in the spirit of all movies Shyamalan, I'll keep mum about the plot.<br><br>I loved the pace, the control, and the development of how the plot unfolded. It had a whodunnit feel of a mystery that is carefully revealed layer by layer. The ensemble cast and characters were fantastic, with each character possessing usefulness to the story and to peer characters, and their eccentricities make them a joy to watch. You have the Korean mother and daughter, the Vietnam Vet, a father and son, a new neighbour, a group of cock-talkers, a guy who works out only his right side, and so on. Although most of them are one-dimensional, they are no less than endearing in their own way, like those in Cocoon or Batteries Not Included.<br><br>Read more at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/07/lady-in-water.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the critics had a problem with it from a film theory point of view because it didn't build on the characters, often leaving them stereotypes to work with and unexplained backstories. You can't say that any of the characters have relevant depth. At least thats what I get when they say Shyamalan has no narrative cohesion which was arguably Sixth Sense's most notable point.<br><br>But from a perspective of a film-going experience, I can see see why I like it and why the 8 others might have liked it as well. It is a bedtime story come to life which is why the overwrought scenes work. It's like something you might have daydreamed about after reading a fairy tale anthology. It's so visceral and in the moment for the greater part of the film, when you're on your toes to find out what he's going to pull out of his hat next. Maybe a witch? Perhaps a character reversal that was not hinted at? It does seem like a story he made on the fly which somehow made sense in the context of the tale.<br><br>It's also a beautiful picture that puts you right in the atmosphere of the apartment complex that it hardly departs from, imaginative angles and the intriguing dialogue is something I've come to expect from his films. He's also tried out humour this time round with the critical inclusion of Paul Giamatti which I felt was its biggest asset. He manages to switch between drama and comedy with such ease that his character is rightly the centre of the entire film.<br><br>I also don't see the big hullabaloo about Shyamalan casting himself as the future's intellectual saviour, he could have easily casted somebody else but its not like his acting ruined the film. He wasn't Sofia Coppola bad by any stretch of the imagination. It's a personal project for him, especially with the critic character's inclusion. It's an audible F**k You to those that can his films after Sixth Sense like they were the biggest creative flops ever made. If they failed to see some humour in that then they do deserve to get flipped off. Director's have egos, some have vast vanity projects, and people need to understand why thats interesting not insulting.<br><br>I really do feel like watching the movie again, I would think it'd be better the second time around. Like being told a bedtime story again and again or playing through an RPG again just because the glut of characters and mythos were so exciting the first time round.</div>

In this case, I can clearly see why they don't like it but I can see why others love it.<br><br>Seems a kind of movie that needs someone to watch it to make up their mind (a catch-22 i know) and no review can change that.

He made the story up himself, wrote a screenplay that made us laugh, smile, cringe, and jump just a little, and directed a great ensemble cast including himself.<br><br>This movie will surely earn its detractors due to its slow story telling. Todays audiences become bored the second something does not explode or die. This film isn't going to be a broad hit but instead it feels like a curious little independent film with big studio backing. Its more so a tale of finding ones purpose and will to live on as opposed to the fairy tale story that is ultimately its background. A nice change of pace from the stuff like  "Mission Impossible III". Not all movies are going to be liked by everyone, but given the chance Lady in the Water will find its following and make them feel a little bit better after seeing it , especially the people who are like Cleveland<br><br>the character of Cleveland is real. There are may examples of such characters aorun us. Deviod of hope and having a terrible memory disturbing them  and eventually finding their redemption</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another point i forgot about Night:<br><br>Since the Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has undergone a maturing process in his films by incorporating these themes starting with his second feature "Unbreakable"<br><br>He's not really making movies about ghosts or aliens<br>It's about people struggling with love, family, tragedy, mental illness, self esteem  or loneliness. Those are about the scariest things I can think of, not aliens or ghosts. These emotions are real.<br><br>For anyone who has undergone this very process, the soul's mission to transform a heart from absolute despair to one of absolute joy and hope, this movie by Shyamalan will resonate deeply.<br><br></div>

Narf itself is already pagan, the dog, evil spirits, rain is simply rain, eagle is something like wat pagan tales always tell of large animals flying around.

I think if u look in a biased way even barney is religious. </div></blockquote>what u are quoting about being pagan , i don seem to agree. It seems too superficial.<br><br>about the healer, She represents Christianity. LAdy in the Water overall is about Faith. Faith which grows stronger when other believe.<br><br>Some points for u to take note.<br><br>a) Early Christianity offered a new, streamlines and superior healthcare system<br><br>i) Healing cults of Isis and Asclepius more costly and difficult to access; faith in Jesus as the Christ all that was required by Christian healers<br><br>ii) Lay healers important figures in early Christianity</div>
