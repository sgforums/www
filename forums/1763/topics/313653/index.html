              <p>i am also a huge fan of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. And yeah, this movie is in a way a disappointment. The original story is changed by a lot. Thus they commited a lot of errors in the chronological order of events.  However, i find that Andy Lau acted quite well. The movie's costumes and weapons are neatly designed. The battle scenes are pretty impressive as well, though there is still much room for improvement.</p>
              <p>i really hope that Red Cliffs will be better, but Takeshi Kaneshiro is playing the role of Zhuge Liang. i find that there is a huge contrast in his role in "Warlords" and the role of Zhuge Liang. In "warlords", his role is rather simple-minded. Then suddenly he become the Zhuge Liang...</p>
              <p>Well lets hope for the best.</p>

              <p>the history has been twisted! zhao yun was not died in battle cos he actually laugh to death.</p>
              <p>as aged zhao yun was having his birthday, there was a general who praised him dat although zhao went countless battle, he had nvr have scar or hurt himself. tis made zhao happy.</p>
              <p>on the quiet night when he was bathing, he could admire himself though the reflection of the water n he saw there were smoothness on his figure, zhao was laughing n died on the spot.</p>

              <p>kinda agreed with u, really dun understand why they had to use expolsives and sarcrifice their own since they already more troops than Andy. Though Maggie is a eye candy but she is really out of place in the movie since there aren't really any female warriors during the three kingdoms period.somemore she can outsmart Zhuge Liang and fought so well, I m like wtf?</p>
