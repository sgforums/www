              <p>can you eludicate on the elements that makes "lust caution" full
              of "depth" for you ? ..... the sex scenes ? .... a naked tang wei ?

              <p>or what about "red cliff" ? .... zhuge liang fanning his pigeons
              after their bath ? .... tony leung asking if they'll catch a cold ?
              ..... I dunno about you mate, but I was laughing at this and many
              other scenes, as were the rest of the cinema .... or tell me what
              the gu zheng music sounded like to you ? ..... do you dare say you
              appreciated the meaningless strummings ? ....</p>
              <p>not bad ... maybe we are catching up with bollywood ....

              <p>I was about to say "Red Cliff" is utter crap. It's like watching "dynasty warriors" the movie. Who the hell would want to do that when you can just play it at home rather than watch some director play it out on the big screen!</p>
              <p>Felt so sleepy after the first 20min but the horrendous direction by John Woo kept me awake with laughter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tonnes can be done to salvate this film, firstly, they
              should just get one scriptwriter to make sure there is proper script
              continuity! There were areas where there were obvious differences in the manner in which they spoke! One moment, they sound like how people spoke in typical period dramas, the next moment, they sounded like something out of a modern HK film. Super wtf!</p>
              <p>The film could also have been a lot tighter. You can probably cut out 1hr of the show and the audience would not have known the difference. So many scenes in that film were damn extra and unnecessary.</p>
              <p>Now, the first and easiest thing they can do to improve the show is to kill their sound designer. The sound track just destroys the film, screaming at audience to tell them what this shot and scene is all about. It's like "The Warlords" except way worse. That show was another comedy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About the depth present in "Lust, Caution" and "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon", let me ask you first then. What did you manage to see in the movie? Was it totally nothing at all apart from the naked sex scenes? After that response, I can go on and give my interpretation on some of the scenes that introduce some depth into the characters and give the film that added dimension from the usual two dimensional movies we see.</p>

              <p>just watch on veoh, its quite ok I guess but would be better if they left out those unnecessary scenes. Most of the major characters look and sound the part, the worst one has to be guan yu,doesn't look or sound anywhere close to such a lengendary figure. Best ones are Cao Cao and Zhao Yun,Zhang Fei looks good but that part where he charge into the fray  WITHOUT ANY WEAPON is really ridiculous.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Theres too much focus on the generals fighting  prowess  that  looks  so much like  dynasty  warriors game.  I also wonder why  they  need so many generals to fight the ground troops in the second battle,  at least  they should let Zhou yu stay at the naval camp  incase the enemy naval force attacks right?<em></em><span class="results-bar"><strong><em></em></strong></span></p>

              <p>I agree with your observation. History never records Chief Minister CaoCao as evil but a maverick who admired talent. <br><br>It is the later generations thru' poetry, stage wayang, song etc that painted an evil CaoCao.</p>

When I read the Romance Of The Three Kingdoms, my hair stood up when I read how Zhu GeLiang defeated 3 times a tribe in ancient China. This tribe had blue eyes and golden (blond) hair. <br><br>Interesting hor. Actually history can be interest too, you know.</p>
