              <p>The Substation Moving Images presents<br> FIRST TAKE<br> 6 October 2008<br> The Substation Theatre<br> 8pm, FREE ADMISSION<br> <br> First Take, happening every 1st Monday of the month at The Substation,
              is a popular screening of new local short films and is followed by a
              Q&amp;A with the filmmakers. A platform for new filmmakers and anyone
              who is interested in filmmaking to meet, exchange ideas and show their
              work. See the future talents of Singapore film! <br> <br> <br> 1. In Our Own Words / Melinda Tan / 17 min / 2008<br> What is the definition of normality? Two young kidney patients go on a
              quest to challenge society’s perception of them. In the process, they
              discover their own ability to redefine what being normal is all about.<br> <br> Melinda Tan is a Psychology graduate from the National University of
              Singapore with interests in the arts, film and literature. She was Vice
              President (Programmes) of nuSTUDIOS Film Productions, a student film
              production house under the NUS Centre For the Arts, where she pursued
              her love for films beyond its production through promoting film
              appreciation via film outreach platforms and programmes. In Our Own
              Words marks her first directorial effort in short film. Her new film
              CASHLESS is currently in post-production. <br> <br> <br> <br> 2. A Series of Brief Conversations / Na Xin Yi / 10 min / 2007<br> Is it better to learn from mistakes and make more of them, or to abide
              by rules as much as possible? A student and a teacher talk about the
              virtues and drawbacks of schooling and conformity while waiting for a
              video to upload to the web. An attempt at non-linear narrative. <br> <br> As a child in Temasek Secondary, Na Xin Yi spends most of her time
              daydreaming about being Darth Vader and telling people interesting
              happenings in her life. She also remembers vividly the first film she
              acted in and made was titled “Ghosts are Friendly.” She enjoys making
              films because she gets to do things people normally don’t get to do,
              like climbing over fences. <br> <br> <br> <br> 3. The Plan / Kelvin Ke / 17 min / 2008<br> The Plan tells the fragmented stories of three characters as they grow
              into the world of adulthood. A social escort, a gambler and a
              happy-go-lucky drifter find their lives spinning out of control as they
              try to cope with the cost that comes with it.<br> <br> Kelvin Ke is a pioneer graduate of La Salle’s Putnam School of Film who
              writes, directs and photographs all his films. His short film ‘Caramel’
              was selected for Winnipeg International Film Festival, Bridge
              International Film Festival and for the 5th Singapore Short Cuts. <br> <br> <br> <br> 4. 5000 NTD / Raymond Tan / 7 min / 2008<br> "5000NTD" revolves around two desperate buddies who amateurishly invade
              a convenient store, and later engage in an embroilment while tallying
              the loot. Feeling disturbed and unsettled, one of the buddies seeks
              revenge by pulling an act which will ultimately affect their
              relationship and lives forever.<br> <br> An Engineer by degree, but a filmmaker at heart. Raymond Tan spends
              time outside his day job fulfilling his passion in filmmaking. His
              debut short feature, "the rebound", won the Subtations' "First Take"
              Audience Award in August 2005. In 2007, his feature-length script, "The
              Season" was shortlisted in the Pitch-A-Movie@CANNES competition
              organized by Cinetopia. "5000NTD", which he wrote, produced and
              directed, was shot entirely in Taiwan with enormous enthusiasm and puny
              budget. <br> <br> <br> SUBMISSIONS ARE WELCOME ALL YEAR ROUND!
