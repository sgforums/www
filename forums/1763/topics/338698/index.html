                  walks with a limp, and is obsessed with collecting news articles on car

                  is Possible Your Heart Cannot Be Broken is a short film about the
                  innocence and disintegration of love. It tells the story between two
                  people, Apple and Ah Tat, told in two different perspectives. Ah Tat, a
                  dreamy simpleton romantic meets the jaded but equally insecure Apple.
                  Can these two people - obviously completely different yet yearning for
                  the same thing- sustain their relationship?<br> <br> “This is a big city, but sometimes it’s the loneliest place.”<br> <br> Festivals

                  2006<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> POST-SCREENING Q&amp;A WITH WOO MING JIN<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Director’s Statement:<br> <br> My
                  films have focused on nature and its relationship with humanity. I have
                  always been fascinated by the “beauty of ruins”. Nature is an element
                  that man must live with, and that is something that plays out in my
                  films. In these films, the characters struggle to reconcile their
                  broken lives with their surroundings. Each character is flawed, and
                  none of them has a solution to fix themselves.<br> <br> Each film is framed and lit the way I intended, and in some ways, they reflect my thoughts and views of the world.<br> <br> These
                  four shorts best represent my work as an artist. The stories are small
                  and intimate, but they are also powerful and poignant. They are also
                  funny.<br> <br> About Woo Ming Jin (Writer/Director)<br> <br> Ipoh born
