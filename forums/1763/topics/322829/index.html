              <p>I just went to Cathay AMK for a show tonight. But what happen make me very upset.</p>
              <p>I am buying 2 tickets , pass staff credit card, sign for it, staff keep the signature slip , pass me back ticket , credit card and customer slip.  As i was walking, with the 3 item on my hand  out of the cinema, suddenly the staff come after me - he just say i took the signature slip, which was not true - he keep it before he pass me back the ticket and card. <br><br>He see that i have a slip on my hand grab it , but then later realise it is the customer copy. Next he insist we go back to the counter, then at there he keep accusing me of having taken the sign slip.  I check , no everything was on my hand, he kept it before he pass me the 3 items.  The best thing was he say without the sign slip - I must sign again for ticket !!!  I refuse as if it will mean double charge . <br><br>The manager came - instead of being understanding that I am pissed off being accused a thief by his staff for their own mistake of misplacing things, which is their internal issue.  Why drag a customer back to counter just because they misplace their own things and try to push the blame to customer.   The manager try to force me to sign for ticket again which can end up as double charges to my card,  which is unfair .  He say that if since they misplace their copy of sign slip - it is invalid transaction . He even went as far as threaten to by stop me going in and tear up my tickets.  </p>
              <p>Imagine you buy things from shop, you pay the casher $20 , you left with goods. The casher misplace the money .... then they come to say you steal things and threaten to take back your items  as they misplace the $20 so it become invalid transaction ? - is that fair  ? that is their own internal company business !!!</p>
              <p>In the end, after all the threats, i got no choice by to sign on the customer copy - which to my surprise the manage kept it  ..... instead of just keeping a photocopy  !!! Customer copy is for customer !!!</p>
              <p>What pissed off me big time is - it is over just $12 that the cathay manager and staff , shame, threaten  us over !  What about my human and customer rights !!!<br><br>Very shameful of Cathay cinema. Instead of being sorry for their own internal mistake, they shame, abuse and threaten their customer and try to push the blame to customer.</p>
              <p>I will frankly boycott cathay for such behaving so shamefully over $12. To them customer reputation, time and dignity can be drag through mud over $12 which was their own mistake... totally shameful.</p>

              <p>I myself are not impressed by the service in this Cathay outlet.</p>
              <p>They are relatively slow in their service.</p>
              <p>From your account, I think they are really not doing their job well.</p>
              <p>Well, you can email them about this incident. They probably will give you free movie tickets.</p>

              <p><br>did u ask them to void the 1st transaction? in the both the customer and merchant slips, there is a <strong>transaction reference number</strong>. they can simply enter the refer number into the swipe machine and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">print a duplicate copy...<br></span><br>and it is also used for voiding the transaction... e.g. cashier swiped and enter wrong figures... e.g. under/over charge...<br><br>and when the monthly bill comes... call up ur credit card hotline and question the transaction bill... they will fax the company to verify the transaction by providing the signature copy within 1 month of the bank fax, or else the credit card company will void and refund u the money.... that's y the company must keep the receipts for 5 years for audit, according to the law.</p>

              <p>The thing with credit card billing is that they can reprint the last transacted invoice or even search by the transacted number....If i recall correctly, more checks can be done but they  have to close the terminal momentarily and may mess up their accounting for the day....</p>

              <p>they wun care. They'll just send u a standard apology email and maybe some vouchers. This is how customer service everywhere generally works.</p>
              <p>Unless u forward the email to Today, Newpaper, etc, and especially when the journalist have nothing to write and happen to chance upon ur complain and wants to "make it big" by doing an article about the dropping standards of service in sg.</p>
