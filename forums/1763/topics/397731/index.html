While the home opens its doors to any child, it only supports them until they turn 18.

With no direction, no financial support and no idea about the future, both teens are painfully aware that there is no room for error.<br><br>Heikal has worked on various short films and commercials, some successful and others that can only be appreciated by his mother. He graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a Diploma in Mass Communication, before moving on to join a good friend at a production house, where they suffered in the name of passion.
