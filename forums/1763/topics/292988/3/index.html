Yo! a $800+ DV cam leh....<br><br>Why? Because of budget.<br><br>1. When shot on DV cam, the "world" becomes smaller, there is no top-view, overall view, global view, etc....<br><br>The director just needs like 10-12 people, when seen through the DV cam, will look like a disaster like that, but if you zoom out, and use 35mm projector tape, it would look ridiculous, like a small mob-team running around town only, doesnt look like a national disaster at all.<br><br>2. 35mm traditional tape is more expensive and has wide view and need rails etc for the recording. DV is cheapo.<br><br>Front part is a waste of time, took 25 mins, talk crap on the party etc. It is obvious the script dont have enough substance.<br><br>And it is not realistic at all, even now you use a DV cam, an average people can capture videos much better and without that much vibration and shaking as that. It is obvious shaking and not realistic. I think 9 out of 10 people using DV cam can capture a better and less shaky video that the cameraman in the movie.<br><br>Overall grade: -10 out of 10.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Pooi!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Do not even bother buying this C-rate movie on DVD or VCD, just let it go like bad smell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't understand the people who say they hated the movie because "it left too many questions unanswered."<br><br>What questions? "Where did the monster come from?" Let's say Abrams did have a scientist in a labcoat pop up irrationally and tell us "Oh, the creature came from Uranus, and it's also invulnerable to our weapons because of a sub-positronic antimatter forcefield as you may have noticed, thanks for watching." How would that improve the viewing experience at all? Certain sci-fi films (Independence Day for example) are built around that kind of silly expositionary technobabble, but Cloverfield is clearly not that kind of film. You may not like the kind of film Cloverfield is--an intimate survival narrative and "road story"--but don't fault it for being what it is, and in my opinion, doing it really well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it might have been successful at being a road story, but the dissonance between audience and movie is largely blamed at the hype generated which was wholly disproportionate and unsuitable for such a postmodernist film.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>whether it is realistic or not is never the question, nor about the nature of the monster....<br><br>if you read clearly what everyone is saying, we are saying that the shaking of the camera is overly done to the extent that it is unrealistic and damn irritating.<br><br>No amateaur videoman will film that way either.<br><br>Last thing is that, I also noticed that this film do not even have budget for proper film trailers to be on TV etc.<br><br>So...my conclusion, next time if some film do not have credits on its poster, do not have trailers/adverts set on TV or those TV trailer seen at movie cinema, then do not watch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Do not read if you don't wanna know  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><span style="color: white;">Sunday, 6pm, Shaw @ Balestier.<br>I bought a ticket for this "cannot-see-monster" from the the trailers. I was hoping to see something better than ID seeing how a Statue of Liberty's head got slashed off from the trailer.<br><br>OMFG, this show sucks and puke. Literally puke. I had eaten some stuff before the show and this stupid "Blair-Witch Project" cheapo copycat alien show make me having to rush to toilet to throw out stuff. Later part of the show, I have to shut off my eyes each time some of the idiot fall and shake the camera.<br><br>Trust me, this is one hell of a show that everyone in the cinema was cursing and swearing on the way out of the cinema when the show end.<br><br>Show time : 85 mins<br><br>Brother A woke up in his gf's house and start fooling around with the cam. Some stupid shots within the gf's house and such. Fast forward that, they will supposely to prepare a farewell party for Brother B which is leaving for a CEO job in Japan.<br>(kaoz... from NY to Jap, I take that as a demotion anytime)<br>All friends were inside an apartment and Brother B arrive. Party begin.<br>(For a whole freaking 30 mins, the entire show is in this party!!!)<br>Suddenly building shake, scream everwhere. TV switch on, CNN report a big tanker exploded near SOL. As usual busybody human being say let go to the rooftop to get a better view. Wala, more explosion in the far. Some buildings went down, more screaming and the bunch of busybody say let go to the street.<br>(This is where the SOL head was send crashing to the street)<br>From far distance, a gigantic moster machiam like Gozzila was seen throwing out its bad breath and causing explosion everywhere.<br>Police was diverting people out of NY thru Bridge A.<br>Everyone run on Bridge A. Moster decided that he need some chow and appeared next to Bridge A and chew out Brother A + others. So everyone make their way back to NY city again.<br>Then Brother B was worried for his GF which is trapped in the apartment and make his way back. Brother A's GF + Cameraman (Brother's A pal) + AlwaysDrunk ***** (which Brother's A pal is dying to lay her) accompany Brother B back to apartment. On the way, street fighting between US Army and Gozzila could be seen. Pathetic M-16 and some rocket lauchers shooting the big monster.<br>(Only at this time, we get to see closer shots of the monster. Gozilla lookalike minus the neck and keep laying small aliens on to the streets of NY.
