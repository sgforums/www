              <p>hmm....i think this show is quite unique.....its not everyday that you get to watch a movie like this, besides, i think it would be really boring if they made it from the military's point of view.....</p>
              <p>coz basically they got no story to tell other than bombing here and shooting there........</p>
              <p>whilst the 1st person point of view is better as they really do have a target which is to reunite with their loved ones and hopefully escape alive......</p>
              <p>if taken from militray point of view i'm not sure if they can put romance, comedy etc. into it coz the event was an all of the sudden kinda event.......</p>

              <p>Dude you can't be serious. I just think the concept is great but ruined in the hands of untalented people out to make a quick buck.</p>
              <p>If it's not a monster movie, then why did JJ Abrams, a self proclaimed Godzilla fan say he wanted Cloverfield to be even more intense and scarier than the original flick?</p>
              <p>If it is not a monster movie and Matt Reeves was supposed to focus on emotions, then why the lousy acting and self awareness? </p>
              <p>Not here not there with no definite genre. Even as an experimental movie it sucked to the core.</p>

              <p>Hmm...this movie ah..mixed feelings about it. When i came out of the thearter i'm like oh shit i wasted 8 bucks.</p>
              <p>On 1 hand, movie no head no tail. Some parts are so unbelivable (Severely Wounded girlfriend can tahan walking down 47 flights of stairs and more.. Helicopter trying to escape still fly so low for the monster to attack at..) that it's more funny than realistic. My eyes are so tired at some parts of the movie that i just shut them to rest for awhile.</p>
              <p>On another point of view, cool thing is it's filmed entirely to put you in a first person point of view, like you are in the movie itself. Not only do they use the shaky camera technique to achieve this, the way they end so adruptly adds on to this experience as well. It's like as the characters die, you die with them so u hav no idea what happen to the monster in the end as well. Similarly, like the characters in the movie, we have no idea how this monster came from..etc</p>
              <p>Oh ya the guy telling everyone at the party that his best friend and the girlfriend had sex is damn bastard la <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Err...ist't that the whole bloody point of the mvoie? To  put you in the same shoes as the movie characters? To ensure that you don't have more info than the people running away.</p>
