              Michigan, Ann Arbor, with a business degree. After working in an MNC
              for several years, Yee Wei turned entrepreneur and started a
              restaurant, Curry Favour. He is still a partner at Curry Favour, which
              is looking to open its 3rd restaurant this year. Through his studies
              and work, Yee Wei maintained a strong passion for film and TV. After
              making several short films and working on different film projects, he
              received the MDA Feature Film grant this year to make his first feature
              ‘Blood Ties’.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Facebook link - http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=188894904497</strong></p>
