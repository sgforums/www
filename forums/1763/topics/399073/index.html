              <p>I think the ending for the movie ip man 2 is very boring.</p>
              <p>I have suggestions on how the movie should end.</p>
              <p>ip man fought with twister and it was a draw. Both of them punched each other and both fell down and both could not stand up so the battle ended with a draw.</p>
              <p>Many years later, his student Bruce Lee became a martial art expert.</p>
              <p>bruce lee than fough with twister and killed him. Everybody start talking and saying that Bruce Lee is better than his teacher ip man because he managed to kill twister which ip man failed to do so. They also say that bruce lee jeet kund kune do is superior to wing chun.</p>
              <p>When ip man heard that he is very angry. he went to bruce lee martial art school and beat up all his students and challenged bruce lee to a fight.</p>
              <p>bruce lee fought and accidentally killed ip man.</p>
              <p>before ip man died, he cursed bruce lee saying that he defeated him and twister not because his skills is better than him but because they are old already and so got no strength to fight bruce lee. ip man also cursed bruce lee for betraying wing chun and create a new martial art jeet kund do and that he will die a early death as retribution.</p>
              <p>this is known as "The curse of Ip Man" which explains why bruce lee died a early death.</p>
              <p>True enought, bruce lee died not long after the curse.</p>
              <p>His students were very angry and thinks that their teacher bruce lee died because of ip man's curse.</p>
              <p>So they went to challenge ip man's students to a fight.</p>
              <p>ip man's students use wing chun to fight bruce lee's students who use jeet kund do. bruce lee's students were defeated.</p>
              <p>So the movie should end with this conclusion:</p>
              <p>Wing Chun is the best martial art in the world and that Bruce Lee is not a real martial art expert. He is just a movie actor who knew some martial arts,</p>
