            <div class='col-md body'>A warning to all who attempt to watch this without watching the first movie - you'll be lost, totally. It doesn't come with a summary or a montage, and dives right into where the first film left off. You'll probably have plenty of questions, and there is almost zero character introduction. Even the brisk recap of the Death Note capabilities quickly flips by, offering you no time to complete reading what's on screen. So you've been warned. A review of the first movie can be <a href="http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/10/death-note-desu-nto.html">found here</a>.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/12/death-note-last-name-desu-nto-2.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Storyline of Death Note 1 (Movie)</strong><br><br>Light Yagami is a young but bright high school student who has until recently led a boring and uneventful life. He wanted to be a head police inspector, like his father.<br><br><img src="http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/1625/vlcsnap258772nf4.png"><br>However, one night out at the bar, he was disgusted by the sight of a murderer who escaped scot-free after being acquitted by the Court.<br><br><img src="http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/2765/vlcsnap259496cp3.png"><br>He dashed out, saddened by what he seen and the Law of the land.<br><br><img src="http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3095/vlcsnap260537ee5.png"><br>At the same time, he found a strange notebook with the title "Death Note" lying on the ground.<br><br><img src="http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/9278/vlcsnap262621ss9.png"><br>He did not take it seriously, until he has seen it for himself when a criminal he wrote in the book before going to bed was reported dead in the newspaper the next day.<br><br><img src="http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/9375/vlcsnap261316qq9.png"><br>It wasn't until later that he realized that this "Death Note" was the tool of a shinigami (god of death in Japanese) from another world named Ryuk, and that it had the power to kill whoever's name was written on its pages, so long as the writer knew the victim's face as well so it wouldn't kill anyone sharing the same name.<br><br><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/5420/vlcsnap182588rf1.png"><br><br><img src="http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/24/vlcsnap267018kp0.png"><br>He managed to get access into the police database and he was frustrated by the many criminals who were never prosecuted.<br><br><img src="http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3987/vlcsnap266211vv9.png"><br>Light realizes his ability to kill whomever he wishes, and he uses it to begin a "cleansing" of the world from evil.<br><br><img src="http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/8315/vlcsnap265126tw9.png"><br>KIRA (Japanese pronunciation of Killer) took the society by storm for eradicating the criminals and became the talk of the town.<br><br><img src="http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/7228/vlcsnap268442re8.png"><br>It does not take the police long to realise that somebody is responsible for the mysterious deaths of criminals, and he is then soon hunted by the Japanese police force and a mysterious detective known as "L". So as Light works towards his "perfect" world, devoid of crime and injustice,<br><br><img src="http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/603/vlcsnap269387hb2.png"><br>Light's father and leader of the investigation team, Soichiro Yagami, was dedicated and determined to arrest Kira at any cost.<br><br><img src="http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/5855/vlcsnap269023cd5.png"><br>L was enlisted to help in the team, but he gave instructions through a notebook, with Watari acting as his agent, without revealing his identity or face.<br><br>L works to catch the Kira by the press and end the increasingly senseless deaths of criminals and anyone who gets too close to the truth. L and Light soon begin a cat and mouse chase to see who will be the first to have their identities exposed.<br><br><img src="http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/6884/vlcsnap271214hr4.png"><br>Through a fake TV broadcast by a FBI criminal Lind L. Tailor, who happens to have "L" as his middle name and is to be hanged, L found out that Kira can kill just by knowing a person's name, hence he cannot kill L as he did not reveal his real name and face.<br><br><img src="http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/7255/vlcsnap271661os2.png"><br>L finds out that the timing of Kira's killings conincide with the timetable of a college student, but since Light has access to the police database, he could see their daily reports, and started killing one criminal every hour. L hence suspects that he is an insider.<br><br><img src="http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/1976/vlcsnap273101ts6.png"><br>With the help of the FBI, L tracks down Light as a suspect. Raye is a member of an FBI team sent to Japan to investigate the Kira killings. Tasked to investigate the life of Light Yagami covertly, his covert actions were detected by Ryuk, who tells Light not because he was on his side, but because it was creeping him out.<br><br><img src="http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/1184/vlcsnap184651av4.png"><br><br><img src="http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/5267/vlcsnap276093rp1.png"><br>Light used a pre-planned hijacking incident (as he could describe the cause of death in the Death Note) to confirm the identity of the person who is following him as an FBI agent.<br><br><img src="http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/5500/vlcsnap276972io3.png"><br>Light then devises an ingenious plan that forces Raye to unsuspectingly kill the rest of the undercover FBI team right before he dies, but his fiancee Naomi had followed him on the train and witnessed his death.<br><br><img src="http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/751/vlcsnap277731pt3.png"><br><br><img src="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/944/vlcsnap277553lr2.png"><br><br><img src="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/2208/vlcsnap278748yx8.png"><br><br><img src="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/9613/vlcsnap280420jj8.png"><br><br><img src="http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/2575/vlcsnap281208mc3.png"><br><br><img src="http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/1360/vlcsnap282164xi9.png"><br>The members of the investigation team were shocked by the deaths of all the FBI agents and Soichiro dismissed the original team, and keeping only 6 of those who were willing to risk their lives to capture Kira.<br><br><img src="http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/4258/vlcsnap283488sr5.png"><br>The investigation team requests to see "L" to get trust in him after all the deaths that have been caused, and Watari brought them to "L".<br><br><img src="http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/8162/vlcsnap284367hx0.png"><br>After some convincing, Soichiro allowed L to monitor Light and the Yagami household closely through video cameras and microphones installed in Light's bedroom for 7 days, or at least until there is a killing by Kira.<br><br><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/8449/vlcsnap189635zd7.png"><br>However, Light quickly realizes that he's being spied on and plans several convoluted yet smart moves such as hiding a miniature TV, pencil and a piece of the Death Note inside a bag of potato chips to continue killing criminals without appearing to do so. Although no evidence is found against Light and the video cameras are eventually uninstalled, L still suspects Light.<br><br><img src="http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/9159/vlcsnap287269ov7.png"><br>Naomi then instigated Light to kill her with a false name, where "Naomi" is written in hanji instead of katakana, and even though Light refused to admit that he is Kira, he realises that he can't kill Naomi.<br><br><img src="http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9134/vlcsnap289587eq8.png"><br>Light then checked up her real name at the local church's wedding registry, and plans to use the Death Note on Naomi. She would kidnap Shiori, ask Light to come to the art museum and to try to force him to admit that he is Kira. Light, however, refused to do this.<br><br><img src="http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/8528/vlcsnap192087iu8.png"><br>Soichiru, upon seeing this, sent in the police. Naomi immediately became upset and distracted, allowing Light's girlfriend to run away from her. Naomi, however, fired her gun and shot Shiori, who died in Light's arms shortly afterward, and then shot herself.<br><br><img src="http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/8058/vlcsnap290310sw1.png"><br>Later, Ryuk found out that Light actually engineered Naomi's death using the Death Note, as he had already found out her name through his own investigation and written a scenario whereby Naomi would kill herself after shooting Shiori.<br><br><img src="http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/3612/vlcsnap291058rt6.png"><br>Obviously, Ryuk was confused, as by doing this, Light would end up killing Shiori, but Light revealed that he'd also written her name in the Death Note, which shocked Ryuk.<br><br><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/7220/vlcsnap193844xv8.png"><br>Using these events to foster hatred for Kira, he asked to join the investigation team when his father checked on him. While Soichiro was slightly reluctant, L immediately granted his wish.<br></div>
