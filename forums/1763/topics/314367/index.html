              <h1 class="clr">'The Warlords' dominates Hong Kong film awards</h1>
              <p>HONG KONG (AFP) - - Historical epic "The Warlords" dominated the Hong
              Kong Film Awards on Sunday scooping eight gongs including best film and
              best actor in martial arts star Jet Li.</p>
              <p>The film, set in wartime 19th century China and with an all-star
              cast -- including Hong Kong heartthrob Andy Lau who missed out to Li
              for best actor -- scooped best director for Peter Chan and best film at
              the glittering ceremony.</p>
              <p>"If I had not made a lot of kung fu
              films, I could have won the best actor award 20 years ago," the Chinese
              star Li said in his acceptance speech.</p>
              <p>Lau, who was nominated for
              awards in two separate roles, scooped up the supporting role for his
              performance in "Protege," which also won best film editing.</p>
              <p>The movie is a crime thriller about an undercover policeman seduced by the lifestyle of his mafia boss, played by Lau.</p>
              <p>"(I
              was) told that if I played this role, I would be respected by the
              entire film industry," he said picking up the best supporting actor
              award.</p>
              <p>However, Lau, who is also a singer, missed out on best original song, which went to the theme from "Love is Not All Around."</p>
              <p>The
              celebrity-mad Hong Kong press pack was out in full force at the red
              carpet event, as hundreds of screaming fans waved banners and cheered a
              string of glamorous leading ladies and men as they arrived outside the
              Hong Kong Cultural Centre.</p>
              <p>Controversial Second World War Epic "Lust, Caution" from director Ang Lee won the best Asian Film Award.</p>
              <p>The
              film has faced a tough time from mainland censors for its explicit sex
              scenes and its subject matter of a government that collaborated with
              the Japanese occupation. Lee was not in Hong Kong to accept the award.</p>
              <p>The
              best actress award went to Siqin Gaowa for her lead role in the quirky
              "The Postmodern Life of My Aunt," about a woman in her 60s who falls
              for an amateur Peking Opera performer, played by megastar Chow Yun-fat.</p>
              <p>Prolific
              director Johnnie To enjoyed a better return than his blank score last
              year, with his crime flick "Mad Detective" winning best screenplay
              after drawing plaudits at last year's Venice film festival.</p>
              <p>To
              also produced "Eye in the Sky" which won best new director for Yau
              Nai-hoi and best performance by a newcomer for actress Kate Tsui.</p>
              <p>The
              professional achievement award was given to much-loved comic actress
              Lydia Sum, better known as "Fei Fei" (literally meaning "Fat Fat") who
              died from cancer earlier this year.</p>
              <p>The lifetime achievement award was presented to Hong Kong movie boss Raymond Chow.</p>
              <p>Chow's
              Golden Harvest studios helped produce a string of talent from the
              former British colony, including action star Jackie Chan and martial
              arts legend Bruce Lee.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong enjoys a rich film heritage and
              became an international movie powerhouse in the 1970s, but it has
              fallen on tough times in recent years with dwindling box office
              receipts.</p>
              <p>However, its stars still enjoy huge popularity across Asia.</p>
