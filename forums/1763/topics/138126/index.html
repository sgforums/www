Where will the cinema operators earn their revenue? I'm 17 now.. i can tell you age group 13-16 are very regular movie-goers. It will cause revenue for the cinema operators to decrease significantly. Plus if you ban under 16s, who will watch movies during 9am-5pm? Cinemas will onli need to operate at night?! Price will increase again no doubt! So do you think they will consider your suggestions?<br><br>People choke when eating fishballs, so do we ban fishballs? Certainly there is other ways of doing things.<br><br>As for teens petting or doing what haf you in the cinema, why are you looking at them in the first place? you should be concentrating on the movie. Pls note that couples age 16 and above do do such stuff ( intimate stuff) in cinemas too.<br><br>I have to agree that some young kids do not behave themselves. But banning the whole age group is certainly unfair and harsh. Perhaps ushers can 'patrol' the theatres. Keep out children in NC-16 shows etc as well.<br><br>jus my $0.02 cents worth</div>
