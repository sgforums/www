              <p>Watched Raavanan. The Tamil version is much better than the Hindi one which has the flop actor Abishek Bachan who cant act. *sigh* just because he married Aishwarya Rai, he is getting all the big movies..</p>
              <p>I was one of the lucky few who got to watch it on the first day. The story in its most basic senses, is a modern adaptation of the Indian epic 'Ramayana'. But Mani Ratnam has brought to this movie a magical touch that would indeed change the trend of movies to come in Indian cinema.</p>
              <p> What moved the movie along was the cinematography, have so effectively captured the beauty of the southern forests in the most mesmerizing manner and also the mood is dark and full of tension.</p>
              <p>here are some new things about this movie which makes it unique</p>
              <p>1) This movie was actually shot twice in different languages with a different cast. One in Tamil , the other in Hindi. Raavanan(Tamil), (Raavan) -Hindi<br><br>2) The movie premise is loosely based on and inspired by an episode from an ancient epic called the Ramayana<br><br>3) Its a story based on multiple plots - Crime, action drama, adultery, Revenge, and the story of primal rivalry happens far away from civilization <br><br>4) Both the version have the same lead heroine Aishwarya Rai. and two characters who previously have done lead roles in the director's earlier movies come in supporting roles<br><br>5) The tamil version has a better presentation style and acting compared to Hindi<br><br>6) This movie was actually shot completely in out door landscape under natural light . No movie sets were used. A lush forest in Kerala was used as a giant set The cameraman actually has to choose his lens and technique carefully for ideal condition and the scenes which makes shooting this more not an easy task but rather tedious<br><br>5) Water is actually used as one of the characters to depict the mood and atmosphere of a monsoon season.<br><br>7) The visuals in this movie is unlike any other indian movie and is intentionally shot in a brilliant way so that people will go to the theatres to watch it instead of home video. The director had also commented that his intention is to curb piracy<br><br>8) One of the scenes of a photograph of Aishwarya Rai was actually a still from her photoshoots from the mid 1990s<br><br>9) The last time the director had made a similar movie was in 1993 also revolving around an action adventure story like Raavanan and shot completely in natural outdoors</p>

              <p>Best Indian movie of 2010.. Awesome atmosphere , action and climax!,Watch out for the climax, it's a cliffhanger ending...
                          
                          Yet again the director maniratnam proves he is no 1. The character of raavana which is the bandit king, is actually inspired by both the Ramayana  character and a real  life character called veerapan,
                      
                        Koose Muniswamy Veerappan, January 18, 1952 – October 18, 2004) commonly known as Veerappan, was a notorious dacoit, or robber bandit, of India. He was active for a period of years in a broad swath of land covering 6,000 km² in the states of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. He long defied three state governments and Indian Border security paramilitary forces, maintaining at one point a small army numbering in the hundreds.
                  
                          He was wanted for killing approximately 184 people,[1] including senior police and forest officials, poaching about 200 elephants, and smuggling ivory worth US$2,600,000 and sandalwood of about 10,000 tonnes worth US$22,000,000. He had a price of Rs. 50
               million (Rs. 5 crore or US$1.1 million) on his head, but evaded arrest for 20 years until 
              he was killed by police in 2004.[2]</p>

              There 2 versions of this movie, Tamil and Hindi, with slight different cast.watch the Tamil version , the title is Raavanan , it's much better , avoid the Hindi one , the title is Raavan
                  
                  The movie is by the well known director Maniratnam, who was won many awards both in india and internationally...Maniratnam has been around for more than 2 decades and has made quite a number of highly talked about films ,Ratnam is widely attributed with having revolutionised the Chennai film industry and altering the profile of Indian cinema.
                  
                  He is also well known as having introduced the award winning composer AR Rahman  in his 1992 movie Roja.
                  
                  Cinematography , music and a real life tale are trademarks of all his movies. He has an uncanny ability to  to weave a tale based on " somthing he sees  out of the window or reads on the newspaper " controversial themes such as politics ,war and history.
