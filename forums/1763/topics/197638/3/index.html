But Variety, the leading movie entertainment magazine in the U.S., has taken a note of KRRISH. In fact, at a time when the worldwide media is full of SUPERMAN RETURNS [which opens next week], it's heartening to note that the publication has devoted an entire article to KRRISH. Those interviewed on KRRISH are its creator Rakesh Roshan and IndiaFM's Taran Adarsh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Krrish proves that not all superheroes are made in America. India has one as well<br><br>By IndiaFM News Bureau<br><br><img src="http://in.yimg.com/i/in/promos/krishimages/still46.jpg"><br><br>Click to enlarge photo<br><br>If as the mentally challenged Rohit Mehra of Koi...Mil Gaya, he had you in tears, as the dashing and darling super hero Krrish, Hrithik will have you on the edge of your seats. And even as you're moved by his emotional vulnerability, you will cheer yourself hoarse for his dare devil actions. We at IndiaFM were invited for a private screening of the movie this week and here is a sneak peek into one of the most awaited movie of the year.<br><br>The movie starts with child Krishna and the reasons why Rekha takes him to the village and spreads her protective wings around her super gifted grandson. Hrithik's race with the horse in the initial reels sets the tempo for an adrenaline rush one is supposed to experience throughout the movie.<br><br>The first hour of the film is interspersed with comic scenes on how Krrish instills fear in Priya (Priyanka Chopra) and her group (while they are on a vacation in India) and later falls in love with her. Some scenes of Koi. Mil Gaya appear in a flashback to show the continuity between the two versions.<br><br>Some scenes deserve a mention here<br><br>- Krrish saving Priya in the initial reels.<br><br>- Krrish displaying his skills to collect money for the disabled girl.<br><br>- Priya asking Krrish to climb a pole faster than an Orang Utan called Maocv<br><br>- The motorcycle fight sequence<br><br>- The Circus Scene<br><br>There are only four songs in the movie - two before the intermission and two afterwards. However, only 'Dil Na Diya' is the impressive one for its superb choreography and picturization.<br><br>And there's a surprise element as well in the movie and we are not going to reveal it... It comes as a shock to the viewer and at the point where Hrithik is at the airport, all set to return back to his village from Singapore.<br><br>The movie belongs to Hrithik Roshan from start to end. Priyanka Chopra however disappoints big time.<br><br>Bollywood had heroes till now. But now we have a superhero in a true Bollywood sense. Krrish proves that not all superheroes (read Spiderman, Superman etc) are made in America. India has one as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Krrish is a sequel to the blockbuster Koi... Mil Gaya, also directed by Rakesh Roshan, but no worries if you haven't seen the first movie - you'll be brought up to speed in no time, and Krrish will also work if it stood alone. First off, it's a superhero movie combined with science fiction, so that was a plus point to have this movie reintroduce me to Bollywood once again. And it worked. With romance, action, and some comedy thrown into the mix, what can one ask for more for pure entertainment?<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/06/krrish.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who want to know more about the local landmarks used - Singapore Expo was used quite a bit, since it's large enough to be filmed at different areas passing off as different venues, even doubling up as Changi Airport's arrival hall entrance with smart editing. The Esplanade was another choice location as the HQ of a conglomerate run by Dr Arya, with National Library's Pod doubling as the penthouse office. There are many scenes with glass windows, which will clue you in on the location of the current setting. Other notable locations are the condos at Kallang, Shenton Way / Raffles Place, Lau Pa Sat (widely publicized during the shoot here), the Singapore River and our offshore islands.</div>
