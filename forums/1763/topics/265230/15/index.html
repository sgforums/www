            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by princeoffacades:</div><div class="quote_body">gee. it was so tempting i just had to watch it again.<br>This time at The Cathay. Bigger Screens &amp; Dolby Surround XD<br>best of all... same price.<br><br>Yeap, I just noticed in the movie that what Kensongs say is true. Jay actually did not lose his father... and this is because of his ability to "crush" the curse of the Secret but only on himself as only he is talented enough to play faster which allowed him to travel way back even before Xiao Yu found the Secret scores. (So Xiao Yu did not know him in the end) The fact that the curse is "crushed" by Jay was firstly that he was able to go BACK in time... which wasn't the actual use of Secret as it was only to go to the FUTURE and then go back to the current time.<br><br>So first Jay's talent allowed him to go BACK in time... which was subtle and i believe Jay did this subtlety because he wants his viewers to think.<br><br>And so being able to go back in time which... was not supposed to be... the "At First Sight Marks One's Destiny" curse did not apply to Jay because the fact that he turned the whole darn thing upside down due to his talent.<br><br>Being in a place MORE than 20 years behind, he can play the piano again to go back to the "current time" where the piano was not destroyed yet. There, he might be able to stop the construction vehicles from destroying it... then keep it for himself whatsoevernot. Being able to go back, he can meet his father! (all he has to do now most prolly is to redo the things that the Jay-who-did-not-time-travel did to equalize the future)<br><br>Then he has the whole piano to himself! can go back and fourth, back and fourth... meet his dad, meet xiao yu and guess whats the best part?<br><br>He can undo the accidental kissing scene with Sky! With that, Xiao Yu (who most likely STILL can only be seen by Jay or the first person who sees her) will be happy and won't get an asthma attack that kills her. and THAT Xiao Yu can also go back to the past! 2 person can now time travel. And how do we know she became happy? The Class Photograph! Remember she was SUPPOSED to die on graduation day? THat picture shows her smiling WITH the class and Jay (her hero) standing beside her ON the graduation photo! GRADUATION! so she made it alive. (thanks to Jay's undoing)<br><br>And Jay on the picture? well, where do u think he's talent might be from? I have a feeling because he actually graduated TWICE from the same school. YES, the very same Jay. He's present goes back to the past, attends the same school OVER again with Xiao Yu, and goes back and sits with his own "current" school (remember he hasn't graduated since he travelled way beyond 20 years?) therefore his "past" learning experience is brought forward into the "present" making him double talented.<br><br>and then u see the connection?<br>what made him ABLE to "crush" the Secret curse at first?<br>His TALENT! that no one else has! because no one graduates TWICE like him! ta daa! a circular motion stuff.<br><br>goes back to the past with a talent brought from the past that will happen in the future.XD<br>saves Xiao Yu by undoing the accidental kiss, stays with her in the past and grow with her as of the same age (because thats the only way as THE FACT IS SHE IS FROM THE PAST), returns to the present with the same "ageing"age (1 day older in the past means 1 day older TOO in the present) and goes back whenever he wants.<br><br>But the basis of all this comes from one single sentence in the story we might have greatly overlooked... which made it possible for ALL of this to happen.<br><br>and that is the tagline of the show:<br>"I will find you no matter what."<br><br>this tagline brought Jay to his undaunted willing to find her, smash through the window, play a freaking-fast time whirling score, re-do the history and maybe even restart a relationship that was supposed to be very strong already.<br><br>Realise how come the Xiao Yu loves Jay so much even when she just met him? Because deep inside her... she knew he was the one (that actually saved her and lived with her but she doesn't know THIS yet because it was a past that is to happen in the future)<br><br>and THAT is what Jay Chou wanted to bring out:<br>sometimes you love someone... you just don't know where that feeling comes from right? you start to have funny ideas how this feeling actually came about... like, you believe there's something in your past that in engraved deep in you that he/she is the one... very unexplainable.<br><br>and THAT is the beauty that lies therein;<br>LOVE.<br><br>And LOVE knows no Boundaries: He has a girlfriend from the Past. And he will do all those "I will find you no matter what" sh!t just to let the LOVE live. Like we should too. At least, none of us has a girlfriend from the past.<br>JayÂ’s gonna say Â“issit THAT hard to maintain YOUR relationship when I can do something like this to mine?Â”<br><br>... this Jay sonnafabich is GOOD.<br>he's  freakingly good XD<br><br>so good, that i'm gonna catch it the third time.<br></div></blockquote>WAH super complicated leh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Liddat Jay is Godlike liao. He can jolly well enjoy kissing with sky den go back time n undo again, like it never happen with Rain.</div>
