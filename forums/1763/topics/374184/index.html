I am inspired by everything around me, from the sound of trickling water on a mountain top to the design of chipping paint on the wall to the color of my coffee. What drew me to animation is the inter-disciplinary nature of the medium. With the combination of the power of storytelling, it presents itself as a limitless form of expression. I am excited about the possibilities.<br><br>Director’s Bio:<br>Su-An Ng recently graduated from the Emily Carr University of Art and Design.
