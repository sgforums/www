I would have thought it's because Spielberg, Lucas and Ford were racing against time to add some good money to their coffers before the latter got too old to don the fedora again, so they just greenlit this poor, poor imitation and parody of an "Indiana Jones" (deliberate quotes, mind you) movie, and slapped a Kingdom of Fictitious Skulls on it to make it sound like the worse title ever since Attack of the Clones or The Phantom Menace. If I had my way, this would be Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Mediocre Action Sequels with Weak Multi-Genre Plots.</span></p>

              <p>One thing that can be said about ‘Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’ is exactly Ford’s line from the movie: “Same old same old.” And if this is usually a bad thing about a film, the rule does not apply to this one. <br><br>The Indiana Jones saga is too much of a legend to allow people, even if they are its creators, to experiment. It is perfect just the way it is. Indy is basically one of the very few characters that can dodge bullets and escape from impossible situations without making any viewer say “Yeah, right…Like I’m supposed to believe it.” <br><br>Yes, scenes are not shot so beautifully like in ‘Schindler’s List,’ but this is exactly what makes people love the films. It is just a story, and the director and the whole staff do not want to make you think anything else. <br><br>It is most probable that both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had similar thoughts because they have managed to give the movie the series’ ’80s look. It seems that CGI was almost never used and Harrison Ford, though aged 65, has performed his own stunts just like in the good old days. Spielberg has even made the film’s director of photography, Janusz Kaminski, study the technique the cinematographer of the other movies in the saga, the now retired Douglas Slocombe, used. <br><br>But the big issue remains whether Indy will manage to get kids to come watch it, or will it be seen by older cinemagoers mostly. During the last years, kids have been the ones to decide a movie’s box-office success in its first days of screening. This is why the producers have led a strong marketing campaign focused on children, which consisted both in movie trailers on kids’ television, and actor appearances at kid shows. <br><br>If ‘Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’ will manage to both bring the kinds to watch it, and make them love it, the movie’s success will be complete: the producers will make a lot of money, and a new generation of Indy fans will emerge.</p>

              <p>It seems to suggest that all gawds, have a shelf life. They may be more powerful than human, just like we are more powerful than a rabbit, they will expire in time to come. Or at least their mortal bodies will erode leaving some crystalized magnetic skeletons. Hey, they sure looked like Aliens.</p>
              <p>As for the number 13..well , I have no idea...but i think it's better to use the happening number 12 than 13. Cos of the zodiac and horoscope. Guess the 13 suggest something beyound our constellation.</p>
              <p>I think it'll be cool to have a bit of their sticky head for some electrical components....i mean...the magnetic field can be so strong yet Indy can still pull coins off the numbskull....cool isn't it!</p>
              <p>I'm a bit confuse though, if the numbskull attracts only ferrous metals or anything metal...cos it seemed to attract coins which in today's standards are not made of ferrous metals (nicke, bronze, etc...) yet, it didn't suck in the vehicles or even the metal casing that it was enclosed in....cool magnets!</p>
              <p>oh, it's supposed to be crystal, but it looked so cheap and light i though it's some Design and Technology student's acrylic artefact! Hope Ikea can copy if and mass produce for their lighting catelogue!</p>

              <p>I feel pretty bad for Cate Blanchett. Good acting cannot save a bad story. She landed a part in a shitty piece of work.</p>
