The ones with the red cross on their tabards were Knight Templars or Knights of the Red Cross, and served as the militant arm of the Catholic Church and answered only to the Pope.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by HENG@:<br>i doubt if the Knight Templars actually answered to the Pope.</blockquote>By right, they are supposed to. By left, ...<br><br>The Order of the Knight Templars, formed during the Crusades in the 12th century, were actually deeply rooted in the code of honour and faith. They were initially warrior monks with humble beginnings, who fought only to extend the glory of God. Having renounced all the pleasures of life, they faced death with a proud indifference; they were the first to attack, the last to retreat, always docile to the voice of their leader, the discipline of the monk being added to the discipline of the soldier.<br><br>Such a reputation made them revered among the ecclesiastical and nobility in the Middle Ages. The popes protected them, and they were often regarded as above the law of the land, being accountable only to God. However, with such power given to them, corruption soon began to seep in as new members were recruited in secret initiation rites transparent to the authorities. Powerful enemies of the Order also started heaping accusations of secret crimes committed by the Templars during the Inquisition trials. By the time before their suppression, the Order had become so discredited that many members were either condemned and burned to death by the papal commission, or absorbed by a rising rival order -- the Knight Hospitallers (Knights of the White Cross) -- of which, in the movie Balian's good friend (played by David Thewlis) was a member.</div>
