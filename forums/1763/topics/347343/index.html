              <br> FIRST TAKE
              <br> 2 March 2009
              <br> The Substation Theatre
              <br> 8pm, FREE ADMISSION
              <br> <br> First Take, happening every 1st Monday of the month at The Substation,
              is a popular screening of new local short films and is followed by a
              Q&amp;A with the filmmakers. A platform for new filmmakers and anyone
              who is interested in filmmaking to meet, exchange ideas and show their
              work. See the future talents of Singapore film! <br> <br> 1. CONTEMPLATION / CLEMENT CHUA / 8 MIN / 2008 / G
              <br> CONTEMPLATION traces the journey a man embarks on as he walks around
              his neighborhood after realizing he's slowly losing his sight. Even as
              his vision weakens and deteriorates, he struggles to come to terms with
              it. Will he just lose his optical vision or will he lose his life's
              vision as well?
              <br> <br>Clement always endeavors to impact rather than impress in all his
              works. He has directed for television, films and stage plays and finds
              directing therapeutic for the soul and strongly believes in film as a
              viable and beautiful outlet for creative expression.
              <br> <br> 2. UNCLEBOY / JANNAH MONJIAT / 24 MIN / 2007 / 
              <br>Uncleboy is an unfortunate lover of alcohol. This is a documentary
              that shows his life as he had lived. Watch as he decides to change hi
              life for the better and leave his demons behind.
              <br> <br> Jannah Monjiat is a graduate from Republic Polytechnic with a love for music films &amp; the arts.
              <br> <br> 3. NO TEN DOLLARS RIDE / VIGNESWARAN RAJKUMAR / 8 MIN / 2008 / 
              <br>The documentary documents two trishaw riders and the tiring work of
              this backbreaking profession. In a series of short interviews, the film
              reveals a trishaw rider’s average earnings and some of the unpleasant
              experiences they often face at work. References are also made to the
              recent bullying incident where three foreigners picked on an old
              trishaw rider.
              <br> <br>Vignes is a fresh and avid filmmaker who likes to explore new ideas
              and concepts through the visual medium. He is actively involved in the
              local broadcast scene as an editor and producer. This is his first
              short documentary film.
              <br> <br> 4. PLATFORM 1932 / NAWWAR SYAHIRAH / 24 MIN / 2008 / PG
              <br>The once grand Tanjong Pagar Railway Station is fading away, but it
              remains significant to an atypical ‘community’ of diverse individuals,
              linked not only by the fact that their life stories would be incomplete
              without the existence of the Station, but also by their shared desire
              to preserve their own ways of life in a shared space between Singapore
              and Malaysia. <br> <br> Nawwar believes that in today’s world of saturated popular culture, the
              voice of lesser-known features of society will give audiences a
              refreshing perspective, and with this project, she hopes to create an
              insightful documentary on a slice of Singapore’s forgotten history. <br> <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
