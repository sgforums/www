For me, (this story) was important. And I guess being able to work with companies like MediaCorp Raintree, having co-productions between countries is a way of facilitating that, because it's pretty hard to tell their stories as it's a small marketplace. Films have to succeed internationally, so having an international component is very significant for us," said Ayres, director/writer of "The Home Song Stories".<br><br>The movie comes at a time when Singapore and Australia are due to sign a Film Co-production Agreement at the APEC Ministers Meeting in Sydney next month, paving the way for more cultural and creative exchange between the two countries.<br><br>Also in the film is Singapore star Qi Yu Wu, who plays Chen's lover.<br><br>Raintree said it's a film that's international while at the same time "Uniquely Singapore."<br><br>"It's a film with various languages. It has English, Shanghainese, Cantonese, Mandarin, good English, bad English, so it's very real life, Singapore. And I think it makes our collaboration with Australia that much more meaningful because you're looking at a country that uses English as a first language, but it's about the Chinese trying to make it in a predominantly English speaking country," said Daniel Yun, Executive Producer of "The Home Song Stories" and MD of MediaCorp Raintree Pictures.<br><br>"The Home Song Stories" opens on September 6.<br><br>It's also part of the official selection at the Berlin Film Festival. - CNA /ls</div>
