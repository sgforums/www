The following is from Showeast's site:<br><br>The inside of a ferry traveling from Yanji, China to Incheon in Korea, Chae-ryn's fluttering emotions slowly turn into fear. She puts on make-up and gets dressed up like an adult but something is not quite right. When the boat stops, Chae-ryn must become her older sister who had won the consecutively. Young-sae was once acclaimed as the greatest dancer. Getting a new partner has a special meaning for Young-sae. It means having hope after two years of giving up and making up his mind to forget Seh-young. Maybe he could make a comeback with his new partner at the Championships scheduled to be held in three months!<br><br>When it is discovered that Chae-ryn has come in place of her sister and Sang-doo, an acquaintance of Young-sae who had spent all his money bringing Chae-ryn in from China, sells her to a bar. Chae-ryn keeps her faith when she is told that she will be taught how to dance and that she will receive 2 million won. She vows to survive her ordeal, remembering the warmth of the few days that she spent with Young-sae and the beautiful dress and the shoes that she saw in the dance studio. But reality is too cruelÂ…<br><br>Young-sae had promised himself that he would not get involved but cannot help but take her with him. Chae-ryn is learning dance sports from Young-sae. Having learned that Young-sae's previous partner Seh-young used to dance the Grand Allegro, Chae-ryn wants to master it. Feelings stronger than trust develop between the two and their dancing starts to dazzle even strongerÂ…<br><br>Meanwhile, when Sang-doo who brought Chae-ryn into the country sees that she shows potential as a dancer, he goes in search of the rich Hyun-soo who happens to be Young-sae's old rivalÂ…<br><br>in cinemas 25 August 2005</div>
