            <div class='col-md body'>Promising young shoe-designer Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) quickly learns how failure feels when his innovative but foolish design for a winged sneaker becomes the humiliation of the footwear industry. Informed of the magnitude of his mistake, Drew applies his design skills to the task of suicide by duct-taping a knife to an exercise machine.<br><br>This melodramatic act is interrupted, however, when Drew receives a call from his sister, informing him that his father has died while on a trip to his home town of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. DrewÂ’s mother, Hollie (Susan Sarandon), elects him to go deal with the arrangements because he is the "responsible" and "successful" one. The only passenger on his flight, Drew meets Claire (Kirsten Dunst), a perky stewardess, who takes the opportunity to talk his ear off despite his apparent desire for some personal space. Supplying Drew with detailed hand-drawn maps, instructions for how not to get lost, and three phone numbers where she can be reached, Claire tenderly sends him off to confront a town full of relatives he has never met.<br><br>Once in Elizabethtown, Drew is subjected to relentless family wackiness from people who seem to have known his father better than he did. Meanwhile, he stumbles into a hesitant romance with neurotic but charming Claire, whose anal-retentive wisdom, lust for life, and good taste in music may help Drew come to terms with his newly diminished place in the world--and to see it as possibly a better one<br><br>trailer.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/elizabethtown/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/elizabethtown/</a><br><br>web.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.elizabethtown.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elizabethtown.com/home.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I begin, I confess that I am a Cameron Crowe fan, having seen most of his movies, which I enjoyed, and having met and spoken to him during his Vanilla Sky premiere in Singapore back in late 2001 (with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz in attendance as well). So you might think that this review is biased, that I'm gonna praise this movie sky high. Fact is, I will, only because it's an enjoyable film, with many fascinating facets to it, and one which made me ponder through the points presented throughout.<br><br>While most critics (pah! what do they know?) panned this movie,<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2006/01/elizabethtown.html</div>
