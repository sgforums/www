It would mean that they want to portray it as realistically as possible.<br><br>For the price of a ticket and if the writer/director is able to transport the audience back in time to catch a glimpse of what it was like... priceless.<br><br>It is a pity that in Singapore they cut away some parts. The writer and director must have felt that it was important for the audience to experience that reality.<br><br>Pity that Singapore, Singaporeans cannot handle reality and in my mind, unreality, delusion, inability to stare life at "full frontal nudity" and not look away is scarier.<br><br>I saw the GET REAL! Batam hooker segment and it was a laugh!<br><br>It was so politically correct and they have the cheek to call it GET REAL!.<br><br>The point they brought across was how the girl was forced by circumstances to be a hooker and how she would not want her daughter to go through what she went through.<br><br>You want GET REAL!? Try hookers partying every night getting drunk and having a wild and enjoyable night-life every night in a drunken state of booze and sex.<br><br>You want GET REAL!? Try Singapore men craving for a wild time of booze and sex with no commitments and sweet young Indonesian girls to keep them company.<br><br>You want GET REAL!? Try Singapore men that nobody wants finding themselves having hundreds of good looking young women to choose from.<br><br>I know too much to condemn or praise a person's lifestyle / the Singapore lifestyle. I know too much of the pain and the ecstasy to condemn / praise the hooker's lifstyle.<br><br>I do not praise or condemn, I pity people that have only one life and never lived it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Early in the movie, Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei) gets asked to act in a patriotic play, in a time when China was threatened by the Japanese Invasion during the late 30s/early 40s. Little does she know that she's got to carry on acting the rest of her life, together with her group of idealistic young dramatists, as stage feelings stirred up real emotions that calls for the sacrificial of self for the greater good, for the country. What they lack in experience, they make up with their youthful passion and exuberance. And their rawness shows in the way they clumsily set up their traps for the coming of the prey, and fumbling even with their first blood.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/lust-caution-se-jie.html</div>
