            <div class='col-md body'>Carina LauÂ’s Review Of Tang Wei &amp; Tony Leung Chiu Wai Sex Scene<br>Author: teropong 21<br><br>Oct<br><br>The question on everyoneÂ’s lips: What would actress Carina Lau make of the nude scenes featuring her long-time boyfriend Tony Leung Chiu Wai in the film Lust, Caution?<br><br>Leung has three scenes in which he bares all in the Ang Lee movie.<br><br>Lau, 41, was spotted looking unhappy after watching the film at a cinema.<br><br>A friend was reported as saying: Â“She knew those scenes are needed in the film but she didnÂ’t think they would be so daring.Â”<br><br>However, she has since changed her tune.<br><br>Last Monday, she gave Leung 100 marks for his screen performance, saying at a promotional event: Â“ItÂ’s not hard for an actor to go from zero to 90 marks.<br><br>But itÂ’s hard to break through to 100. He reached this point. ItÂ’s glory for Chinese people.Â”<br><br>On reports that the sex scenes between Leung and co-star Tang Wei were real, she said: Â“I have no suspicion. ItÂ’s a success if everybody thinks itÂ’s real. ItÂ’s acting. But with so many people around and having to film shot after shot, how could he enjoy it?Â”<br><br>Asked if she minded LeungÂ’s bold performance, she said: Â“No. I am immune to such things.Â”<br><br>As for his full nudity, she chose to describe his performance as a Â“breakthrough for Chinese cinema historyÂ”.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s not awkward. ItÂ’s realistic,Â” she said.<br><br>Leung, 45, plays an intelligence officer in the film whose graphic scenes of violent and abusive sex have earned it restrictive ratings.<br><br>He and Lau have been together for 18 years.

            <div class='col-md body'>Excellent movie.<br><br>Lee Hom's performance wasn't enough. Maybe he wasn't given enough scenes to perform. Given that he's more of a singer than actor.<br><br>Why this movie is excellent, is because if you watched it once. You try watching it again, but without volume. Just watch the scenes where there is Mr Yee and Mai Tai Tai. eg. The scene where Mai Tai Tai sung Tian Ya Ge Nu.<br><br>It shows you another world of language which some may not have noticed during the first watch. Apart from spoken language, you'll have to watch and observe the details.<br><br>'btw, scene on Tian Ya Ge Nu was known to be one of the best part/most mesmerising in the movie', how one percieve on the song selection is vastly debatable.<br><br>About the sex scenes, i thought it's fantastic!<br>Every part it shows the intensity and changes in both Mr Yee and Mai Tai Tai response to one another. At every start and end of the rendevous, the camera made delibrate close up on Mr Yee and Mai Tai Tai face to intentionally capture the changes they faced after every sex encounter. Their inner self revealed yet struggling to hide.<br>Love Tang Wei's performance in this, her expression is fantastic for a newbie. In this scenes, you can also see how Mr Yee peel off his mask and wanting Mai Tai Tai to accept his expression of love. Love Tony for that.<br><br>These scenes not necessary? Haiz...<br><br>Not particularly impressed with the cinematography and color management.<br>But for a movie of 1930s setting, maybe it's what the director wants to communicate.<br><br>The ending...Woohoo!!!!! Tony!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
