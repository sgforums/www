              <p>"I was born under unusual circumstances." And so begins "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," adapted from the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards: a man, like any of us, who is unable to stop time. We follow his story, set in New Orleans from the end of World War I in 1918, into the 21st century, following his journey that is as unusual as any man's life can be. Directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett with Taraji P. Henson, Tilda Swinton, Jason Flemyng, Elias Koteas and Julia Ormond, "Benjamin Button," is a grand tale of a not-so-ordinary man and the people and places he discovers along the way, the loves he finds, the joys of life and the sadness of death, and what lasts beyond time.</p>

              <p>When I was born my mom said I looked like an old man. Like everyone else, I turned out to be pretty normal, unlike The Curious Case of Benjamin Button where he's physically developing in the opposite, suffering from common aged ailments like cataracts, hearing, and arthritis first, but mentally developing in proper chronology. One can imagine the challenges of everyone thinking you'll die soon enough, before a miracle actually happens and you're like having drunk some elixir of life, probably a little too much too.</p>

              <p>It is interesting in the start but gets boring in the end.</p>
              <p>It is boring because it is just narrating an ordinary person's life except for the age regression. All I can say is that those that are able to relate can enjoy the show. And those who have a different school of thoughts may find the story boring.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is best to appreciate this as an art film.</p>

              <p>curious case of benjamin button traces youth and dreams, old age and the loss of hope. afterwards, aging backwards is everyone's attempt to defeat time.</p>

Like a person's entire life and journey being blasted out in film in a way that it can be learnt from. And only within 3 hours, successfully depicting his life through this story, it's just great. Ups to it!</p></div>

              <p>I watched this show because of the director David Fincher. I was expecting some kind of thriller but was disappointed considering the fact that Fincher was well known was his dark and gothic thriller movies. The story is about a man who invents a magical tower clock in the 1930s which moves backwards. When the clock commences operation , a baby boy is born but his body is that of a 80 year old and grows up, aging backards and eventually ends up as a baby again in the 2000s. This movie traces his life in those 80s years with all the happenings in history. Very emotional melodrama.</p>
              <p>I remember a quote said in the movie by benjamin's foster mother which will make u really ponder over it:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Benjamin Button: Momma? Momma? Some days, I feel different than the day before. <br>Queenie: Everyone feels different about themselves one way or another, but we all goin' the same way.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For those who  watched David  Fincher's movies before:</span></strong></p>
              <p>Not a bad show,  but not the dark noir classic Fincher.This stuff is different , , it has a kind of moody feeling or narcissistic tone like Forrest Gump. Do not expect serial killer or other mind twister stuff of earlier works of his.Watchable, if u just forget that this is directed by Fincher.But same old visual style is there, suspense and as usual the sets and backdrops of classic Fincher.Like his thriller movies, it does keeps u on your  toes and makes u wonder what will happen to benjamin who is biologically aging backwards while his love interest is biologically aging forward and the various times they  meet. The ending of this movie just like Fincher's past movie Seven comes as a surprise. Just like that movie, u cant predict the climax, even if u did, u would have thought of it the other way round.</p>
              <p>However one classic Fincher aspect of this movie is there,  that it messes around with your thoughts throughout and it lingers in your mind long after u watched it. * there is a significant moment in the climax when Cate says " he gave me a look like he remembered me..." which should be taken with a pinch of salt.. We will never know if he remembered her at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For those who havent watched any David Fincher's movies before:</span></strong></p>
              <p>U can watch it and will not be disappointed.   The romance scenes are on par , if not better than Titanic.The show willreally make u think about your own life.It's a speculative and enthralling fantasy about what it would be like to age in reverse.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button shows that whether we live life forwards or backwards, the outside is just a shell and it’s what we choose to do with life that sifts out the best parts from the worst.it has everywthing from romance, history, family values and a mild generic thriller. U can watch it with yr frens, family, or fiance/fiancee. Suits every every type of audience well.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><br> </em></span></p>

              <p>U should check out the ending of David Fincher's 1995 movie "Se7en". it was one of Hollywood's shocking climaxes ever.</p>
