Your wife has just lost her job. She wants to have a kid but you are three months behind your rent. Your boss gives you an ultimatum: make educational adult films for the Scandanavian market with your wife or you are sacked.<br>Welcome to the funny, sad but ultimately heart-warming workd of Torremolinos 73, the award-winning Spanish tragic-comedy by first time feature director Pablo Berger film about encyclopaedia salesman Alfredo Lopez and his wife Carmen's attempts to cope with their absurd yet tragic situation that has become a crowd pleaser at film festivals from the UK to the US.<br>In the process of making adult films Alfredo develops a passion for film-making and becomes obsessed with the great Swedish director Ingmar Bergman while Carmen becomes a sex symbol in Scandanavia. Alfredo however tires of making the same type of movies repeatedly and decided to make his debut feature with Carmen in the lead role. But if in the beginning of the film money is Alfredo and Carmen's main problem, its solution only brings up other darker trouble as the film progresses.<br><br>More than just being a witty farce, Torremolinos 73 with its cine-literate humour, clever montage and cine-8 style framing and Berger's masterful story telling provides interesting social commentary about love and family. At the 2004 Edinburgh International Film Festival, one critic called it "one of the best comedies at this year's festival."<br>12, 13, 19, 20, 26 &amp; 27 Nov, 7.30pm<br>18 &amp; 25 Nov, 9pm | 90 minutes | R21<br>Spanish with English subtitles<br><br>Venue: The Art House<br><a href="http://www.theartshouse.com.sg/event_details.php?id=132" rel="nofollow">http://www.theartshouse.com.sg/event_details.php?id=132</a><br><br>know of any others?<br><br>Spanish movies there were:<br>Maria full of grace<br>motorcycle diaries<br><br>Korean movies there were:<br>Everybody has secrets<br>Old Boy</div>
