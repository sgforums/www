Submission forms, rules and regulations are available on the AFFF website at www.asianfirstfilms.com. There is no entry fee and the final submission deadline is 31 August 2007.<br><br>Over 300 submissions were received last year from across the world. Hot on the heels of last yearÂ’s AFFF, that featured  films and documentaries, including sell-out shows for local production, Becoming Royston, which went on to be acquired by Singapore distributors, Cathay-Keris Films.  Teamwork Productions, the organizers of AFFF is kicking off their road show at the Cannes film festival this year.<br><br>In 2006 over 9 films and documentaries were received from Singapore and 2 productions were nominated for Best Documentary and Best Cinematographer, Best Script and Best Male Actor in the Documentary and the Film categories respectively. We hope to have an even better showing from Singapore in this third year of the Festival.<br><br>All entries are screened by a professionally-acclaimed selection committee from across the world who come together for one week to view films and nominate the best across the 9 award categories. These top nominated films will be announced in October and screened at the third Asian Festival of 1st Films in Singapore in December. A grand Jury comprising of world-renowned celebrity directors and actors will judge the nominated films and announce their decision at the glittering awards night on 5 December 2007.<br><br>Â“We are the launch pad to commercial success for first-time filmmakers. We believe there is incredible talent across Asia which needs to be recognized, awarded and their films distributed widely to the rest of the world,Â” says Sanjoy Roy, Festival Director for AFFF.<br><br>Roy adds, Â“The movie-making industry is always looking out for the next big thing. We believe AFFF is such a resource and this is why we are reaching out to larger number of distributors, studios and talent hunters in Cannes this year.Â”<br><br>The festival will recognize excellence in 9 categories that include:<br>Â•	Best Actor in a Leading Role<br>Â•	Best Actress in a Leading Role<br>Â•	Best Cinematographer<br>Â•	Best Director<br>Â•	Best Director (Documentary)<br>Â•	Best Documentary<br>Â•	Best Film<br>Â•	Best Producer<br>Â•	Best Script or Screenplay<br>For more information on the AFFF, please log on to www.asianfirstfilms.com  or visit the blog at www.afff2006.blogspot.com.<br><br>+++<br><br>For submission enquiries and clarification, please contact<br><br>Asian Festival of 1st Films<br>Teamwork Production<br>124A Telok Ayer Street<br>Singapore 068594<br><br>PHONE: 00 65 6225 4181<br>FAX: 00 65 6296 5667<br><br>EMAIL: kartik@teamworkprod.com<br>WEBSITE: www.asianfirstfilms.com<br><br></div>
