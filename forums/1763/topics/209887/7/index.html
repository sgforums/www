Contrary to some of the earlier reviews and reports, there IS a scene after the usual copyright and coincidental canned messages get their air time, and fanboys out there will cheer, as did I and at least 50 other folks in the hall who stayed behind. I'm not kidding and I'm putting the credibility of this entire site to say that it involves a certain Samuel L Jackson (yes, it's not cut from the print, and to those who cannot take even spoilers about this, skip the rest and proceed to the review proper from the link) <span style="color: #ffffff;">who introduced himself as a certain Mr Fury from S.H.I.E.L.D, and also a mention of The Avengers! </span>And you'd think you were only teased with a potential War Machine in the sequel if it happens.

              <p>ya man. i was telling my fren that the guy is from SHIELD and no one believes me. i told them to stay after the credits, definitely have something. i expected nick fury but not the avengers initiative. marvel is really letting a long line out to catch the big fish by mentioning that in the movie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the movie also paid homage to the original scene where tony stark was casting his armour in his 'factory'. rhodes scene where he saw the 'war machine' armour had half of the thearte i was in exclaiming 'part 2!'. i think marvel really did a good job for this movie.</p>

              <p>Just watched the movie on the opening day.</p>
              <p>Was relatively disappointed by the lack of much action - found it ended too quickly. For most parts, the movie details the making of the Iron Man suit.</p>
              <p>And why do superhero flicks always have some sort of last-minute miracle to bail our superheros out of harm?</p>
              <p>But overall, Iron Man is still a nice movie. Would give it a 4/5. Didn't find any problems with scene transitions and storyline inconsistencies as suggested by many newspaper reviews.</p>

              <p>Watched it yesterday too, found the front part a little boring and I fell asleep. LOL maybe because it was a 1am show.</p>
              <p>But after that the show becomes more interesting, not a bad show I'll say!</p>

              <p>since this is part 1, as with all superhero movies, the director need to explain the characters, his origins, how he get his power etc thus half the movie is devoted to that.</p>
              <p>so with all that origin story telling done. we can expect a even better, more action pack sequel like nick fury, war machine and of course the proton cannon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Yeah, perhaps that's why.</p>
              <p>I am looking forward to the sequel - which would be out in say, 2 - 3 years?</p>
              <p>Waiting for The Incredible Hulk (June) and The Dark Knight (July) now.  </p>
