            <div class='col-md body'>Episode III is actually quite well-made, compared to the first two Prequel episodes. It is more story-driven like Episode V and has the most action sequences among all six episodes.<br><br>The hype surrounding it may have resulted in some disappointment among perfectionist fans, but on its own merits, it is a worthy conclusion to the Prequel Trilogy. This time round, compared to Lucas' known penchant for special effects, the plot is king and thankfully there are no distractions like Jar Jar Binks, pod races, and frolicking-in-the-field-with-grazing-alien-cows scenes to put fans off. Acting wise, Ian McDiarmid was impeccable as the dreaded conniving Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious, and the other "Mc" Ewan McGregor gave a fabulous performance with the spot-on accent that made me believe Obi-wan would really age to become the character played by Sir Alec Guiness in the Original Trilogy.<br><br>My only gripe is perhaps the pivotal character of Anakin Skywalker could have been better played by some other more capable actor, though I must say I was rather impressed by Christensen's performance in another movie "Shattered Glass".</div>

But in Ranks, Yoda. Bcoz he xperience being a jedi for hundreds of years n masters his force skills. In lightsaber duel, Yoda consist speed style dat we couldn't imagine.
