Luke Skywalker's X-Wing Fighter plane had sunk or "downed" into the swamp waters when he crash-landed on Dagobath. As part of his training, Yoda wanted him to haul the plane up using the Force. Luke tried many times and failed, complaining bitterly that Yoda had given him an impossible task. So to prove him wrong, Yoda "closed his eyes" and demonstrated to the brash Luke how to lift the plane up from the swamp waters using the Force.</div>
