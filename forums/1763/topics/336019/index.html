              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>This is what I noticed, which is a pretty sad thing. When people watch movies, they tend to think that "Hollywood movies are worth watching" while movies made locally by locals or asian movies, they tend to think "Is this worth the money?" or "I'm not going to watch this movie because this is not a hollywood movies." Let me raise one example, godzilla. I seen a lot of these movies, but nobody give a damn because it is rubber suit and the buildings are props. When the american version comes out (which sucks big time), people watch it and think it is a good movie. Remember, the american version don't have any trademarks of godzilla's (Japanese ver), but people watch it just because it is made in hollywood. Similar movie, Jurrasic park, the dinosaur rampage is similar to godzilla's rampage in the city. People never complain.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Another example, the ultraman series produced in hollywood. This series is even condemned by the tsuburaya(the company that produce ultraman shows), but people apprecitate it because it is hollywood made. The action, story and props are all at the worst condition and people still accept it rather than the original made in Japan. Same goes to masked rider(kamen rider in Japan).</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>If just about sci-fi movies, of course might be a little not convincing. Action films. When movies like die hard or eagle eye or James bond, people think of it a good movie as "it is action packed", "it is very interesting". But when asain action movies such as "Flash point" or "SPL", people never give it a go. I rarely see full seat in those HK movies, why? In terms of action, I definitely go for the asian as a lot of mor hand-to-hand combat are involve, car chase and explosion scene. If we take a look, those actors actually did the action or at least uses a double. But in hollywood, we see CG images and blue screen effects, which is the worst thing ever to see on screen(look at money no enough 2, blows your mind away with CG images), which makes the scene looks unrealistic. Yet people prefer that way, just because it is Hollywood made.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Love story is also another one, I’ve seen a lot of touching love movies from Japan and some of other places such as Taiwan or korea. In Japanese movies such as “sky of love”, the story is very touching and people cry at the end of the movie, or at least tears or moved. But when compare with Hollywood, people prefer Hollywood because of the comedy or the music. Ma ma mia is one good example. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>There are a lot of more reason that why people prefer the Hollywood movies, but this could go on forever. Whatever movies are being made, whether it is Hollywood or not, what’s more important is the story and the character. Some Hollywood movies suck too, look at street fighter the movie or any video game based movie. Yes, including resident evil which all of them leave hanging endings even though extinction should be the end of the entire resident evil movie franchise. What I’m trying to say is that, movies are not easy to be made, don’t judge a movie by whether it is made by Hollywood or not, give it a go and you might get a very entertaining movie.</span></p>

              <p>don't watch movies that often so i'm quite picky</p>
              <p>and frankly speaking what i see on channel 8 can't even impress me so its unlikely i'll want to watch hk stuff in the movies.</p>
              <p>i do watch some movies like death note, flash point.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Bigger budget and better CGI equipments don't produce good movies. It's the story and character development we wished to see in the movies. Take indiana jones for example, the kingdom of crystal skull. That old man with bonk brain(forgot the name) appears close to the end or middle of the movie, so the development of this character aren't that much. The movie talks about him, yeah, but he didn't appear until later in the movie.</p></div>
