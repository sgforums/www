              <p>Threads of Destiny – This is a story about destiny between lovers.
                  According to certain beliefs, it is said that when a thread is tied
                  between 2 people, they are destined to be together, even if their love
                  has failed the first time and no matter what the trials, which speaks
                  of perseverance and fate if you truly believe in it and work towards
                  it. This movie tells the story of a young man Akkun, who met a girl
                  called Mai in school. Upon asking for her birthday, he realized that
                  she was the girl whom he bumped into at a cake shop, who showed an act
                  of kindness by offering him a chocolate to wish him happy birthday as
                  he was unsure if his birthday was going to be celebrated or not, it was
                  then that a thread was being tied between the two of them. <br><br>The
                  movie speaks of many key values of relationships, such as the
                  importance of knowing that love cannot be forced, not going after your
                  friend’s girlfriend, and of course other important elements of
                  friendship like not lying, being there for a friend when in need,
                  praising others and not condemning and fulfilling promises, which all
                  illustrates how to love people around you to build long and stable
                  relationships, between friends, lovers as well as families. One of the
                  phrases I really like in the movie is “Don’t talk about destiny if your
                  feelings change so fast” which really adds new light and direction into
                  a phrase we use so often, “are we destined to be together” , destined
                  comes with lots of other sacrifices, hardwork, perseverance and
                  emotions as well. <br><br>I would give this movie 3.5/5, the only
                  glitch is that it gets too dramatic at times, and there are too many
                  things happening at one time. But overall, the movie brings to light
                  many values in life and if you are a fan of Japanese culture and
                  society, you will surely like this as well as it shows some really
                  beautiful scenery in Japan, such as the falling sakura blossoms, the
                  night sky of the city and a traditional Japanese festival. Not to
                  mention the cast are great in their acting as well, effectively
                  bringing out emotions and character and not being overly expressive.
                  Last of which, after watching the show, which had chocolate as sort of
                  symbol between destiny, I felt like eating chocolate! <br><br>Oh yea, and at the end, there’s a little twist of expectancy !<br>This is the theme song, enjoy!</p>
