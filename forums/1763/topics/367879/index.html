He is now terrified that the same would happen to his family as well. Manohar now wants to know who is behind the making of this serial and what their intentions are.<br><br>As Manohar explores the mysterious happenings, he unravels a deep and unholy secret. The characters appearing on his TV are already dead 30 years ago and are looking for someone close to manohar's family.<br>The house they live in was the house where the whole family of eight were murdered way back in 1977. <br><br>It was the family of a TV News reader.........<br><br><br><br>Fetching best credits across the towns as a spellbinding thriller, it’s time for ‘Yaavarum Nalam’ to sway across Hollywood.
