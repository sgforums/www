              <p><strong>METAL GEAR SOLID (KONAMI/1998)<br>What is it about?</strong> One of the most recognisable third-person shooters in history, Metal Gear Solid tells the story of Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralise a terrorist threat from FOXHOUND, a renegade Special Forces unit. <br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> Metal Gear Solid has the making of an ultimate spy-action movie: the perfect setting, gun fights, big time explosions and with their trademark skin-crawling background score, it will definitely make the audience hold on to the edge of their seats.</p>

              <p><strong>ASSASSIN'S CREED (UBISOFT/2007)<br>What is it about?</strong> Desmond Miles, a bartender, was kidnapped by a secret megacorporation and was forced to relive the memories of his ancestors - who were all assassins, by the way - in order to recover valuable artefacts that will help them take over the human race. <br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> Let's put aside the fact that Assassin's Creed will make an excellent assassin movie with lots of flying across rooftops, sword fights and wall-clinging, the setting of medieval lands of Jerusalem and the science fiction-historical touch would definitely appeal to the crowd. Think 'Prince of Persia', but ten times cooler.</p>

              <p><strong>L.A. NOIRE (ROCKSTAR GAMES/2011)<br>What is it about?</strong> A crime-solving video game that pays homage to the 1940s film noir era, L.A. Noire centers on LAPD police officer Cole Phelps as he goes around solving murders and crime as he makes his way up the ranks. <br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> 'The Godfather' is one of the best mafia movies of all time. 'The Sopranos' was a huge commercial success. 'Public Enemies' grossed more than US$214 million worldwide. People love old school crime/mafia flicks, so we don't see any reason why L.A. Noire won't do well.</p>

              <p><strong>BIOSHOCK (2K GAMES/2007)<br>What is it about?</strong> Poor ol' Jack, a plane crash survivor, finds himself fending off mechanical drones and mutated beings in order to survive the city of Rapture - a dystopian town thousands of feet underwater!<br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> For one, the underwater city atmosphere is amazing, and we are sure Hollywood CGI wizards will be able to make it even more. The plot of the game is a little thin, to be honest, but if you put the movie into the hands of someone like Christopher Nolan (the director of 'The Dark Knight') or McG (he directed 'Terminator Salvation'), we have a strong feeling it'll become a major blockbuster.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I have friends who played Bioshock and tell me that it's creepy -___- I think it'll be a cool concept, purely an effect and CGI showoff movie... I agree the storyline is rather eh ... ... mudane...</p>

              <p><strong>RED FACTION: ARMAGEDDON (THQ/2011)<br>What is it about?</strong> The game takes place in the year 2170 on the planet Mars, and Darius Mason, the grandson of Martian Revolution heroes, was tricked into reopening a mysterious channel in an old temple, thus awakening a race of ferocious Martian creatures. The ensuing battle between the human race and the ugly aliens would cause Armageddon on Mars, if Darius can't find a way to stop the war.<br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> Did you not hear us? Armageddon on Mars, and an all-out human race-ugly aliens war. These factors alone would guarantee big bucks at the cinemas. Put Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson into the shoes of Darius, and there you go; one helluva action-adventure alien movie.</p>

              <p>Red Faction... It's gonna look like some AvP ripoff if ppl dunno wat is it... But it would make an excellent action film (provided they got enuff budget to blow everything<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png">)</p>

              <p><strong>HEAVY RAIN (SONY ENTERTAINMENT/2010)<br>What is it about?</strong> Heavy Rain is a chilling psychological thriller that revolves around a serial killer who calls himself the Origami Killer. The psychopath murderer would kidnap his victims and murder them after four days by drowning them in heavy rainfall, and then leave an origami as a call-card. On the other side of the ring, we have Ethan Mars; a doting father who is racing against time to save his kidnapped son before it's too late.<br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> Of all the games on the list so far, we think Heavy Rain would be the easiest to adapt to the big screen, and it will work very well too. The gripping storyline and the ticking time bomb factor would get one's heart racing, and if you like movies like 'Jigsaw' or 'Se7en', then what are you waiting for: go online and start a petition already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have never played or heard abt this game b4... It does seem to sport a great plot and storyline... There are quite a few of these "save-the-world/people-race-against-time" movie but as long as u got a solid storyline and unique/ingenius twist, it should fare well...</p>

              <p><strong>DEAD SPACE (ELECTRONIC ARTS/2008)<br>What is it about?</strong> One of the creepiest video games ever made, Dead Space takes place in the year 2508 and tells the story Isaac Clarke, an engineer who, with several others, crashed into a spaceship called the USG Ishimura on a rescue mission. As they look for an alternative way to get home, what appears to be an abandoned ship is, well, not really abandoned after all. <br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> Come on, why wouldn't it? We have tonnes of screeching aliens, high tech weaponry, the definite scare factor and more. Screeching. Aliens! If you loved 'Aliens', you will bow to the awesomeness that is Dead Space. That, we guarantee you.</p>

              <p><strong>GOD OF WAR (SONY ENTERTAINMENT/2005)<br>What is it about?</strong> This epic adventure game centers around Kratos, a fierce warrior in the service of the Greek Gods, who was given the task of destroying Ares, the God of War. Of course, along the way, he slays mythical creatures like Hydra and gigantic one-eyed Cyclopes' as he slowly becomes the new God of War.<br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> Again; why wouldn't it? God of War has the instant formula of a major blockbuster: mythical creatures, awesome prehistoric weapons, Greek Gods and one super fearless warrior against a backdrop of ancient mythology. Compared to God of War, 'Clash of the Titans' would look like a children's cartoon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clash of the titan is disappointing... the battle weren't tat epic... look at how hades fall in the end, sooooo easily &gt;___&gt; Kraken got stoned soooo easily...</p>
              <p>Now this would be good... Kratos facing mythical creatures... hmmm, absolutely fabulous...</p>
              <p>Actually Greek and norse mythology make good movies, but so far the movies on Greek and norse mythology are very disappointing -_______-</p>

              <p><strong>CRYSIS 2 (ELECTRONIC ARTS/2011)<br>What is it about?</strong> As New York City was left ravaged by scary-looking aliens in the year 2023 no thanks to a virus strain, it is up to a Force Recon Marine, Alcatraz, and his uber cool Nanosuit 2.0 to rid the Big Apple of them aliens. <br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> The same reasons why 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' was such a big success: total destruction of an entire city, super explosions, crazy aliens and one fine looking hero. Heck, we think 'Transformers' director Michael Bay should take the helm, since he's a master of blowing up cities and buildings.</p>

              <p><strong>HALO (MICROSOFT GAMES/2001)<br>What is it about?</strong> Arguably the biggest selling game for the Xbox and the best first person shooter on a console, Halo tells the story of how Master Chief John-117, a cybernetically-enhanced human super-soldier, and his army of soldiers try to fend off an attack by an alliance of aliens known as the Covenant.<br><strong>Why it will work?</strong> It's like asking why you need to wear pants to work; you just need to! It's Halo we are talking about here, come on.</p>

              <p>Ehhhh, how come I got this feeling that this one would end up something like Avatar???</p>

              <p>So wat else???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My personal view would be:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Fantasy Series.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Most series would be good.</p>
              <p>FF4. Cecil Harvey and Kain~~~ Excellent storyline but gets slightly draggy... This might be a good try~~~</p>
              <p>FF6 is epic. U have a huge cast, good storyline, good character background, and u got Kefka, who is rated one of the best evil villian ever. The actor for Kefka would be extremely crucial. Seriously, this would be EPIC... Really!!! Just imagine the scene for the Opera House, the floating island~~ EPIC~~~</p>
              <p>FF7 already has advent children.</p>
              <p>FF8. Ohhhh~ Rinoa and Squall with the song in the background "Eyes on Me"... Besides, Quistis is kinda cute, Laguna would be super coooooool~~~</p>
              <p>FF9. no comments...</p>
              <p>FFX and FFX2. Yuna, Rikku, Tidus, Auron... The world concept is nice, with the cultural everything well done... This would make a great hit, just rake in X2 for another sequel movie then it'll be great~~~</p>
              <p>FF12. I have mixed feelings about this. The plot is great, watching balthear(spelling?) would be fun, though guys will be there more to look at the veira (bunny girls &gt;__&gt;)... However, certain character lack development... Like Vaan, who is sadly the main character... &gt;____&gt;</p>
              <p>FF13 and FF13-2. I haven managed to play FF13 yet and FF13-2 is releasing soon.</p>
              <p>FF Tatics. Seriously my fav among the FF series (the other would be FF6). Excellent background and world setting, excellent setting for a movie... In the gameplay, the storyline is abit loose, but if u manage to fix up a good pace for the movie, then the storyline and plot would be epic~~ The CGI for the Zodiac would be interesting... Somemore with an asernal of characters... Wow~~ Simply Wow~~ Could be made into a series like LOTR...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fallout Series</span></strong></p>
              <p>Post apocolyspe setting... The world and background design is interesting, however it will require a solid storyline, which might be rather hard...</p>

              <p>Apart from MGS - Alot of the games that I use to play were either sports games or ones that already made into movie. That or some of them are un-doable e.g. battle city, circus charlie, exerion and other lup-sup games lol.</p>
              <p>As someone mentioned in another thread earlier, I'd like to see DBZ done as a movie properly and not the laoya hollywood one they've made. As crap as Street Fighter (the movie) was, I enjoyed that much more. The chinese version was funnier though....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>FF Tactics? As long as they don't move turn-by-turn then it's okay. (the game is great though!!) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Warcraft Series</span></strong></p>
              <p>From Arthas and Uthur LightBringer to Grom Hellscream and Deathwing, there's a whole army of cast... We can have 2 main character... One from Human, One from the Horde...</p>
              <p>However, as this is already an epic series, it might be extremely hard to pull it off since people will have CEILING HIGH expectation for this...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">StarCraft Series</span></strong></p>
              <p>Think Sara Kerrigan... Iconic enuff... Besides, with scifi background, epic large scale battle scene, small detailed battle between a zealot and a zerg or maybe kerrigan herself, this will be a winner... Epic Winner...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Command &amp; Conquer Series and Red Alert Series</span></strong></p>
              <p>Mixed feelings this two series... Unless u have a movie on Tanya or Kain, there's like nthing much to talk about. Though introducing some new characters might work...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>DBZ english one was a joke... Serious fail... I wish they make a proper one by japan...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Street Fighter. I've seen quite a few series... The chinese comedy one, where u got Vega = Andy Lau, Guile = Jacky Chueng... Still got a sun wu kong from DBZ inside the show <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>There's also a cartoon/anime version of the Street Fighter... Not sure if you seen it b4... It was not bad back in that time...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talking abt Street fighter and DBZ, they could also try Fatal Fury or KoF movies too~ Though I've missed Tekken (I know it's out but I didn't manage to watch it. The hollywood KoF movie which was out last year, despite they have maggie Q in it, was absolutely horrible... Mai's outfit look like Leona in the start &gt;_____&gt; I hope they make one properly by Japan...</p>

              <p>It'll be banned in everywhere <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> U got a man, driving around, wacking pple, crashing cars, banging girls, evading police...  It wouldn't work <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>This might be a great hit. Just take D2, all the class as a character and there~ u got a party to slay diablo... But it might be disappointing like tat DnD movie...</p>

              <p>I still remember last time when I was still playing Space Hulk on MS Dos...</p>
              <p>Long storyline and history... Tons of characters... I've always wondered why there aren't any movie for this series~~~ Could totally be made into a long series like LOTR... U could start with Horus or abbadon or other character, there's too much choice~ or u can do a short spinoff like maybe character from Tau or Chaos or Eldars... Heck, this woul be epic, even more epic then warcraft turned into a movie...</p>
              <p>U got socery, u got machines, u got big guns shooting everywhere... Ork's stupid sense of humor, Chaos cruel ways, mysterious eldars, iconic space marine...</p>
              <p>on screen pew pew pew and explosion~~~ oh wow~~~ one on one battle between space marine and a chaos marine, wow~~~ this is EPIC~~~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dune Series</span></strong></p>
              <p>They need to remake the old failure hollywood Dune movie into a new one... Seriously &gt;___&gt; It's injustice to make such a bad film abt a good series...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Ok got some ideas (though haven't really researched whether got movie already);</p>
              <p><strong>Kingdom Hearts </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoC5Q_AHkdhDkZ51SIyrdxbBtKTpcNn6VridrJL1WkpN-nnSGi" alt="" width="259" height="194"></p>
              <p>Storyline should be able to carry through for a movie. Though I can see that this might be hard/costly as it involved Disney rights etc.</p>
              <p>This concept can also be used to produce other company-wide, 'All-star' kind of movies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Xenosaga</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSn5gJ1cW05vzcgTjSg76My8jzciV4kOfXkk04t1zkeEhY5YoCj" alt="" width="162" height="157"></p>
              <p>Even though I lost interest in the game halfway through the second one, i think the concept and story also can carry into movie. Although this one maybe only an anime movie rather than hollywood/real life movie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yar, something like GTA hard to turn into movie because it'll just contain alot of thuggery..hehe!</p>
              <p><em>Abit of a tangent from the topic;</em></p>
              <p>However, maybe they can make something like Fast n Furious video game, where the concept is to walk around beating people up (like GTA), but have a car-racing focus in the game. Similar to NFS-series, except with a human life part to it too, so it's more 'everyday'.</p>
              <p>One more; Use a series like Slam Dunk and make it into an RPG type of game, where you have to walk around, buy things, sleep etc., but focus is around basketball matches which you can choose to play or simulate. Kinda like a mix between championship manager meets RPG.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Ok got some ideas (though haven't really researched whether got movie already);</p>
              <p><strong>Kingdom Hearts</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoC5Q_AHkdhDkZ51SIyrdxbBtKTpcNn6VridrJL1WkpN-nnSGi" alt="" width="259" height="194"></p>
              <p>Storyline should be able to carry through for a movie. Though I can see that this might be hard/costly as it involved Disney rights etc.</p>
              <p>This concept can also be used to produce other company-wide, 'All-star' kind of movies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Xenosaga</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSn5gJ1cW05vzcgTjSg76My8jzciV4kOfXkk04t1zkeEhY5YoCj" alt="" width="162" height="157"></p>
              <p>Even though I lost interest in the game halfway through the second one, i think the concept and story also can carry into movie. Although this one maybe only an anime movie rather than hollywood/real life movie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yar, something like GTA hard to turn into movie because it'll just contain alot of thuggery..hehe!</p>
              <p><em>Abit of a tangent from the topic;</em></p>
              <p>However, maybe they can make something like Fast n Furious video game, where the concept is to walk around beating people up (like GTA), but have a car-racing focus in the game. Similar to NFS-series, except with a human life part to it too, so it's more 'everyday'.</p>
              <p>One more; Use a series like Slam Dunk and make it into an RPG type of game, where you have to walk around, buy things, sleep etc., but focus is around basketball matches which you can choose to play or simulate. Kinda like a mix between championship manager meets RPG.</p>

              <p><br>CGI Kosmos... Hmmm... Might looks good...</p>
              <p>Then again, I would prefer Xenogear over Xenosaga, though Xenosaga is still quite good on it's own... I would watch it if they come out in movie :D</p>
              <p>Kingdom heart will be rather impossible unless disney is the one producing it, but knowing disney, I would prefer square enix to be producing it though &gt;___&gt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for ur slamdunk into RPG, ehhhh ... honestly, it sounds like some japanese dating sim ya...?</p>

              <p>funnily enough, i actually came across Xenosaga after playing Xenogear. Xenogear will be too much like Transformers leh.</p>
              <p>Slam Dunk, Prince of Tennis - build abit of involvement and ownership to the character, then the actual b'ball/tennis aspect of the game would have so much more drive behind it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was thinking DDR, but then remembered Aaron Kwok's song and ParaParaS.</p>

              <p>Duke nukem should be made into a badass action movie but they need to cut out the toilet humour first...</p>
              <p>Amnesia or the penumbra series from frictional games are great materials but pity they're indie games.</p>
              <p>And is there a live action robot movie from japan like transformers?? if not, the front mission series would be great for the japanese who love their big robots and big boobs. should definitely throw in a role for one of the av idols to be the japan megan fox..</p>
              <p>and for movie into games, the cube series would be great like the portal games</p>
