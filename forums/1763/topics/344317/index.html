              migrant artist’s interpretation of living as an outsider and an alien
              in a foreign land where conformity is seen as admirable and where the
              government takes pride in its systems of order, cooperation &amp;
              control. <br><br>This 2 min video is the result of 12 consecutive

              one of their games, they wait for time to pass.<br><br>FENCES details
              the story of two young men who shares a bond that goes beyond race and
              ethnicity. It is a quiet and contemplative film that examines the mood

              our hearts; a visual diary of a little corner in Singapore called
