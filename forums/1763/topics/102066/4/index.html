What drives someone in a perfectly good relationship to cheat and risk losing the one that they love and that loves them? Is it possible to love more than one person at the same time? How well does anyone really know the one that they love?<br><br>Directed by Mike Nichols (THE GRADUATE, BIRDCAGE, WORKING GIRL), CLOSER questions the nature of relationships and fidelity as it follows the tangled web created by Dan (Jude Law), Alice (Natalie Portman), Anna (Julia Roberts), and Larry (Clive Owen). Dan, a British writer of obituaries, and Alice, a young American stripper, meet in the film's opening scene when a London cab runs her down. Cut to a year later: Dan and Alice are now a couple, but he is suddenly smitten with Anna, a beautiful American photographer. In an ironic twist of fate, Anna meets Larry, a British doctor, and they are soon a couple, despite Dan's continuing obsession. But the entanglements don't end there, and ultimately, someone is sure to get hurt. The four players do justice to a script that is humorous, raw and disarmingly honest about adult relationships.<br><br><span style="color: orange;">dunno nice or not.... but got julia roberts... woo....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></div>

Along the way, they destroy such famous international landmarks as the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Sphinx in Egypt, and the Panama Canal. All the while they are developing close relationships that lead to love, jealousy, and betrayal. Their primary mission is to stop North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's peace conference, which is a ruse to allow him to attack the rest of the world with his weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>Team America must also take on F.A.G., the Film Actors Guild, which is supporting the peace conference, including such participants as Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn, George Clooney, and other actors who have spoken out against the war in Iraq (but did not agree to be spoofed in the film). Parker and Stone reserve a special message for FAHRENHEIT 9/11 director Michael Moore, and even former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix shows up. Among the very funny--and very dirty--songs in the film are "Everyone Has AIDS" (from the Broadway musical LEASE), "Only a Woman" (about homosexuality), and "I'm So Ronery" (Kim Jong Il's soaring solo). Despite having no actual humans in it, the movie earns its R rating with lots of blood, very adult language, and a steamy puppet sex scene.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">looks quite funny from the short clips.... hahaha</span></div>

These extraordinary recordings--captured by people all over the world, in their homes, with a simple tape or video recorder--seem to confirm what many of us have dared to believe: it is possible for the dead to communicate with us. And all we have to do is listen.<br><br>Now, from Universal Pictures and Gold Circle Films comes the suspense thriller that explores this very-real, other-worldly communication--White Noise. Tapping into our deepest fears and most profound longings, White Noise forces us to re-examine the world in which we live and, in the process, question our most basic notions about life and death.<br><br>Michael Keaton plays successful architect Jonathan Rivers, whose peaceful existence is shattered by the unexplained disappearance and death of his wife, Anna (Chandra West). Jonathan is eventually contacted by a man (Ian McNeice), who claims to be receiving messages from Anna through EVP. At first skeptical, Jonathan then becomes convinced of the messages' validity, and is soon obsessed with trying to contact her on his own. His further explorations into EVP and the accompanying supernatural messages unwittingly open a door to another world, allowing something uninvited into his life.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">another horror flick.... oh ho ho ho</span></div>

And never has a cast of this caliber -- encompassing no less than five OscarÂ® winners, as well as EmmyÂ® and TonyÂ® honorees -- been brought together for an animated feature. In the film you'll meet memorable 'bots Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor), a young genius inventor who dreams of making the world a better place; Cappy (Halle Berry), a beautiful executive 'bot with whom Rodney is instantly smitten; the nefarious corporate tyrant Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) who locks horns with Rodney; Bigweld (Mel Brooks), a master inventor who has lost his way; and a group of misfit 'bots known as the Rusties, led by Fender (Robin Williams) and Piper Pinwheeler (Amanda Bynes).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">FROM THE PRODUCERS OF ICE AGE!!! ahahaa..... shd be can watch from the short clips shown in the cinema....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></div>

The gangly little foal is rescued by horse farmer Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood), who takes him home to his young daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere). Once a champion thoroughbred trainer, Walsh has given up horse training for a quiet life with Channing on their modest Kentucky farm.<br><br>The little zebra, or "Stripes," as Channing calls him, is soon introduced to the farm's misfit troupe of barnyard residents, led by a cranky Shetland Pony named Tucker (voiced by Dustin Hoffman and Franny (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg), a wise old goat who keeps the family in line. The group is joined by Goose (voiced by Joe Pantoliano), a deranged big-city pelican who's hiding out in the sticks until the heat dies down in Jersey. The un-aptly named bloodhound Lightening (Snoop Dogg) keeps a lazy eye on goings-on at the farm Â– in between naps.<br><br>The Walsh farm borders the Turfway Racetrack, where highly skilled thoroughbreds compete for horse racing's top honor, the ultra-prestigious Kentucky Crown. From the first moment Stripes lays eyes on the track, he's hooked Â– he knows that if he could just get the chance, he could leave all those other horses in the dust. What he doesn't know isÂ…he's not exactly a horse. But with characteristic zeal, he devotes himself to training for the big time, with a little help from Tucker, who has coached a host of champion racehorses in the past.<br><br>Channing has a similar ambition Â– she longs to train as a jockey, but her protective father refuses to let her compete in the potentially dangerous sport. But Walsh can't ignore her enthusiasm (or her stubbornness) for long, and she convinces him to come out of retirement to train her and Stripes for the Kentucky Crown.<br><br>The neighboring Estate is run by the ruthless queen of the Kentucky racing circuit, the incredibly wealthy and exceptionally coldhearted Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick). Stripes constantly battles the ridicule of the Estate's thoroughbreds-in-training, led by spoiled bully Sir Trenton's Pride (voiced by Joshua Jackson), who taunts him relentlessly about his lack of breeding andÂ…unusual appearance. But the Estate is home to some kinder residents, particularly Sandy (voiced by Mandy Moore), a beautiful mare whose admiration and affection for Stripes further enrages his rival.<br><br>Stripes makes some friends down at the track as well, most notably the manic horsefly duo Buzz (Steve Harvey) and Scuzz (David Spade), whose love of song and dance is eclipsed only by their love of hot dogs and horse poop. As he thrusts himself into a world of elite athletes, intense competition and enormous stakes, Stripes must prove he's fast enough and tough enough to run with the big horses if he wants to land in the winner's circle at the legendary Kentucky Crown.<br><br>Some champions are born, not bred!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">been pondering on wanting to catch it or not.... the houseflies were damn funny.... hahahaha</span></div>

Disregarded as too young to partake in such a dangerous expedition, Roo opts to search on his own -- with far greater success than his friends. In meeting a young, playful Heffalump named Lumpy, Roo quickly learns an important lesson: Heffalumps are nothing like what he's been told, and he has much more to gain by befriending Lumpy than fearing him. Roo and Lumpy strike up a sweet friendship and work together to dispel the unfounded fears of their respective friends and families.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">winnie the pooh.... winnie the pooh.... the elephant has got a really cute voice.... haha</span></div>

Kay's stylish thriller, BOOGEYMAN, takes one of horror's mythical figures and transports him into the 21st century. Though Tim Jensen (Barry Watson) is a successful magazine editor with a beautiful girlfriend (Tory Mussett), his childhood continues to haunt him. When he was only eight years old, Tim watched his father get eaten by the Boogeyman, or at least that's how he remembers it. Of course, no one believed him then--not even his mother (Lucy Lawless), who has just recently passed away. Wracked with guilt for not having been there to say goodbye, Tim decides to spend the night in his childhood home and confront the Boogeyman once and for all. But before that happens, he reunites with his old friend Kate (Emily Deschanel) and meets a young girl (Skye McCole Bartusiak) who is holding onto a dark secret of her own.<br><br>Kay and cinematographer Bobby Bukowski pack BOOGEYMAN with enough tension for several films, finding terror in every doorknob and around every corner. Watson and Deschanel deliver grounded performances even as the supernatural insanity swirls around them. <span style="color: orange;">The result is a work that relies more on shocks and thrills than actual blood and guts in order to frighten its audience.</span><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

When three delinquent teenagers follow a family home intending to steal their car, they inadvertently pick the wrong house on the wrong day. The trio find themselves trapped in a multi-million dollar compound on the outskirts of town owned by an accountant. Panicked, the teenagers take the family hostage, placing Talley in exactly the kind of situation he never wanted to face again. Soon after, Talley readily hands authority of the hostage situation over to the Ventura County Sheriffs Department and leaves the scene. After it becomes clear that the Sheriff Department cannot handle the crisis, Talley is forced to resume the command he had abandoned where the stakes quickly evolve into a hostage situation far more volatile and terrifying than anything he could ever imagine.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">kipnap and good guy saves the day kinda show? hmmm</span></div>
