When cartoonist Tim Avery's (Jamie Kennedy) new son is born with the Mask's spectacular powers - to the dismay of the family's jealous dog - it turns the household upside down and launches a kid versus canine battle for control of the Mask. But unbeknownst to them all, Loki has come looking for his mask and is willing to do whatever it takes to get it back. Featuring incredible special effects work from the Academy Award-winning Industrial Light &amp; Magic team and Tippett Studio, Son of the Mask is directed by Lawrence Guterman (Cats &amp; Dogs). The film also features a talented ensemble cast that includes Alan Cumming, Bob Hoskins, and Traylor Howard.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">no jim carrey liao..... looks kinda lame from the shots... haha</span></div>

A hugely popular Nickelodeon show based on SpongeBob inspires THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE, which brings the oceanic cast of animated oddballs to the big screen.<br><br>The bubbly inhabitants of Bikini Bottom are in more trouble than a sinking ship at the start of the film. The evil Plankton (Doug Lawrence) has hatched a plan to send the Krusty Krab burger chain out of business. He steals the secret formula for the delicious Krabby Patty and then frames Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) for the theft of King Neptune's (Jeffrey Tambor) crown. With all eyes on Mr. Krabs, Plankton starts selling Krabby Patties at his own Chum Bucket restaurant. Just then, SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) steps in and, with his starfish pal Patrick (Rick Faggerbakke), sets out to find the crown and get Mr. Krabs out of hot water. What follows is an epic adventure in which the pair encounter some slippery villains, and a hero in the form of special guest star David Hasselhoff--who appears as himself in a bizarre fusion of animation and live action. SpongeBob and Patrick frantically race back to Bikini Bottom to stop megalomaniacal Plankton from taking over the world. All of this is played out before an eclectic soundtrack, which pairs indie rockers like The Flaming Lips and Wilco with teen-pop princess Avril Lavigne. Taking its first triumphant step into the feature film world, SPONGEBOB soaks up an enthusiastic crowd of children and adults alike.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">i know muimui will love this.... haha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></div>

When the Claskys hire the beautiful Flor (Paz Vega) to be their maid, their already rocky relationship faces some even bigger boulders.<br><br>Spanish-speaking Flor is a sincere, loving single mother whose daughter, Christina (Shelbie Bruce), receives lavish displays of affection from Deborah.

Eventually Deborah crosses a line when she betrays her husband with the real estate broker who is helping her search for a beach house.<br><br>Faced with this challenge, John and Flor, who share a clear attraction to one another, get the chance to explore their feelings.</div>

Not only is her younger, half-sister, Amy (Amy Adams), getting married before her, but to add insult to injury, the groom's (Jack Davenport) best man is Kat's ex-fiancÃ©e, Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield). Two years after being dumped, Kat is a single New Yorker and can't bear to attend the festivities at her parent's London home alone, so she does the next best thing: she hires an escort to play her boyfriend. Her rented date, Nick (Dermot Mulroney), fits the bill perfectly. He's handsome, intelligent, well spoken, intuitive, and a perfect gentleman--a virtual bargain at $6,000. The plan? Make Kat's ex sorry that he ever let her go.<br><br>But the plan takes a turn when Kat finds herself attracted to Nick, and the feeling seems to be mutual. But will their business arrangement stand in the way of a relationship? And just what is it that Kat's ex has been dying to tell her? Messing is endearing as Kat, who seems to be simultaneously bewildered and bemused by her situation. Mulroney, meanwhile, is at his most charming as Nick. Clare Kilner (HOW TO DEAL) directs this romantic comedy set in London and the English countryside, which also features Holland Taylor as KatÂ’s slightly overbearing mother and Peter Egan as her loving stepfather. Sarah Parish is a hoot as the sisters' bawdy British cousin.</div>

But while drop zones, demolitions and destroying enemy targets come naturally to Shane, he has no idea what tough really is until he pits his courage against diapering, den-mothering and driver's education. He's truly a SEAL out of water, and not it's up to this one-time lone warrior to take on the most important mission of his life: keeping a family together.</div>

Unable to find a taxi to take her to her next party Kate, heads for the London underground. She buys a ticket from a homeless girl and descends to the platform where she soon falls asleep. She wakes to find herself completely alone and locked in, with no signal on her cell phone, monumentality panicked until the last train pulls in. She boards, unnerved that sheÂ’d the only passenger, but relieved at last to be on her way. Halfway through the tunnel the train jerks to a violent halt. The lights shut off and the train is plunged into darkness.<br><br>A man with a torch appears in the adjoining car and moves swiftly towards her. As the figure approaches through the connecting doors, it becomes clear itÂ’s someone she knows from the party. But this momentary relief evaporates as he lunges for her and tries to force himself upon her. In a split second the carriage doors fly open and KateÂ’s assailant is pulled off her by a shadowy figure and hauled backwards out of the train.<br><br>Blood curling screams fill the tunnel, then silence. Kate bolts through the train, hides in the driverÂ’s carriage, and listens. There is nothing, then dull footsteps, then a rasping breathÂ… She jumps down onto the tracks and runs as fast and as far as she canÂ…<br><br>Â…but for Kate and the few people she meets along the way, the nightmare has only just begun.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">hmmm... abit creepy... might go catch it... hope it doesn't disappoint like the rest of the horror flicks...</span></div>

The night crew decides to cover up the incident, hiding the evidence deep in the bowels of the institution. Soon the hospital is visited by another person dying of some exceedingly unnatural symptoms; that death triggers a bizarre infection that only seems to affect those involved in the initial crime. As the infection spreads, so does the terror, as the staff is dying off one by one and no one knows what to do.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">another jap horror flick...</span></div>
