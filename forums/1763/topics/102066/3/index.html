Written and directed by David S. Goyer, Blade: Trinity also stars Jessica Biel as Abigail, the daughter of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who inherits the vampire-slaying duties that once belonged to Blade (Wesley Snipes); and Ryan Reynolds (National Lampoon's Van Wilder) as Hannibal King, one of the Nightstalkers.<br><br>opening - 9th Dec<br><img src="http://www.gv.com.sg/Booking/movies/images/detail_nationaltresure.jpg"><br>National Treasure features Nicolas Cage as a seeker of a cache of treasure supposedly left by the Founding Fathers.<br><br>opening - 16th Dec<br><img src="http://www.gv.com.sg/Booking/movies/images/detail_O12.gif"><br><br>opening - 23rd Dec<br><img src="http://www.gv.com.sg/Booking/movies/images/detail_survivingxmas.jpg"><br>Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is a wealthy marketing executive who is fed up with spending Christmas alone every year. But the Valco family--parents Tom (James Gandolfini) and Christine (Catherine O'Hara), and their two kids Brian (Josh Zuckerman) and Alicia (Christina Applegate)--who live in Drew's old family home, have each other.<br><br>When Drew's idea of spending Christmas in Fiji is turned down by his girlfriend, he decides to revisit his old neighborhood in an attempt to muster up some feelings of seasonal cheer. The Valco's life of suburban tranquility is rudely interrupted when Drew turns up on their doorstep and offers them $250,000 if they'll let him stay with them over the holiday period. A lawyer swiftly draws up a contract, with the main stipulation stating the family must provide Drew with a sense of "Yuletide glee." What could be easier than that? Well, quite a lot it seems, as the unenthusiastic group is dragged through the seasonal mire by the demanding Drew. Eventually the tension turns to laughter, however, and family matters take a turn for the better as director Mike Mitchell (DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGOLO) brings SURVIVING CHRISTMAS to a poignant close. With Tom and Christine patching up their marital problems by using Drew as a conduit for their troubles, and daughter Alicia developing a blossoming romance with the now-welcome house guest, Drew manages to inadvertently trigger the seasonal joy he'd been trying so hard to discover.<br><br>opening - 23rd Dec<br><img src="http://www.gv.com.sg/Booking/movies/images/detail_kungfuhustler.jpg"><br>Set in China, in the 1940s, 'KUNG FU HUSTLE' features a hapless wanna-be gangster, SING, who aspires to be a member of the notorious Axe Gang, a ruthless mob focused on gaining control over the one area in their territory that's remained out of reach: a street inhabited by FATTY FOUR, an obnoxious and obese landlady and her apparently frail husband GRANDUNCLE TWO, who along with her motley crew, all exhibit strange and sinister powers defending their turf.<br></div>

But that's before Pam's parents meet Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz Focker (Hoffman and Streisand). The hyper-relaxed Fockers and the tightly-wound Byrneses are woefully mismatched from the start, and no matter how hard Greg and Pam try, there is just no bringing their families together-which all adds up to a disastrously funny time of "getting to know you."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seed of chucky!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><img src="http://www.gv.com.sg/Booking/movies/images/detail_seedofchucky.jpg"><br>Everyone's favorite plastic slasher doll, Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif), returns for a fifth installment of this popular horror series. Apparently Chucky and his equally murderous bride, Tiffany (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) had a child, which has grown up in a cage as part of a heavy-metal ventriloquist act in England. Eventually it (one never learns its exact gender) escapes to Los Angeles to revive mom and pop, whose doll corpses are being used for a movie based on their previous killing spree. Jennifer Tilly shows up as herself, and she's great--hamming it up as a floozy actress so desperate for the part in rapper Red Man's latest film that she lures him home for a casting couch tryst, with hilarious (and fatal) results.<br><br>Meanwhile, the child of Chucky is horrified by the violent murders its parents are so fond of committing and, with a little help from a 12-step book, tries to help them kick the homicide habit. Of course it's hard when there are so many deserving targets around, including John Waters as a scuzzy paparazzi. In sum, this is one crazy sequel; it's got a refreshing lack of morals, a light heart, and a clever script with a lot of great insider jokes for buffs.</div>

The words and game take us back to an innocent, carefree time in our lives, where the simple goal was to find hiding playmates. Many children could even enjoy a spirited game with imaginary friends.<br><br>But then, imaginary friends can sometimes seem so real...<br><br>For young Emily Callaway, her games of Hide and Seek with an imaginary friend named Charlie have become anything but simple and innocent. Instead, she finds herself in the middle of a series of increasingly nightmarish acts that even her father David cannot stop. Who Â– or what Â– is Charlie? David wonders. How can an "imaginary" entity have this kind of hold on her? Maybe Charlie is not imaginary at all, but instead a flesh-and-blood, malevolent presence?<br><br>Academy AwardÂ® winner Robert De Niro stars as David Callaway, a troubled father and widower in the suspense-thriller HIDE AND SEEK, and Dakota Fanning portrays his young daughter Emily, who is hiding an incredible secret. As the story opens, Callaway's wife Alison (Amy Irving) dies suddenly, traumatizing Emily. Father and daughter move to Upstate New York to distance Emily from the memories of her life in Manhattan with her mother. Soon thereafter, Emily develops a friendship with Charlie. At first, David sees Charlie as a positive way for Emily to express herself, but a series of terrifying acts lead him to imagine the unimaginable: Charlie may actually be realÂ…and if so, he must be stopped.<br><br><span style="color: orange;">wooooo...... hide n seek horror flick..... thriller i like.... but wonder if really scary...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></div>

In FINDING NEVERLAND, director Marc Forster ("Monster's Ball") and an accomplished cast including Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie take a fictional look at the creation of "Peter Pan," the classic of children's literature that speaks directly to the child in all of us. FINDING NEVERLAND traverses both fantasy and everyday reality, melding the difficulties and heartbreak of adult life with the spellbinding allure and childlike innocence of the boy who never grows up.<br><br>It all begins as successful Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie (DEPP) watches his latest play open to a ho-hum reaction among the polite society of Edwardian England. A literary genius of his times but bored by the same old themes, Barrie is clearly in need of some serious inspiration. Unexpectedly, he finds it one day during his daily walk with his St. Bernard Porthos in London's Kensington Gardens. There, Barrie encounters the Llewelyn Davies family: four fatherless boys and their beautiful, recently widowed mother (WINSLET).<br><br>Despite the disapproval of the boys' steely grandmother Emma du Maurier (CHRISTIE) and the resentment of his own wife (RADHA MITCHELL), Barrie befriends the family, engaging the boys in tricks, disguises, games and sheer mischief, creating play-worlds of castles and kings, cowboys and Indians, pirates and castaways. He transforms hillsides into galleon ships, sticks into mighty swords, kites into enchanted fairies and the Llewelyn Davies boys into "The Lost Boys of Neverland."<br><br>From the sheer thrills and adventurousness of childhood will come Barrie's most daring and renowned masterwork, "Peter Pan." At first, his theatrical company is skeptical. While his loyal producer Charles Frohman (HOFFMAN) worries he'll lose his shirt on this children's fantasy, Barrie begins rehearsals only to shock his actors with such unprecedented requests as asking them to fly across the stage, talk to fairies made out of light and don dog and crocodile costumes.<br><br>Then, just as Barrie is ready to introduce the world to "Peter Pan," a tragic twist of fate will make the writer and those he loves most understand just what it means to really believe.<br><br><span style="color: orange;">fantasy romance.... peter pan..... then the johnny depp face.... funny.... or i forgot how he look like liao.... hmmm...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  </span></div>
