MILLIONS, the fantastical tale of two British brothers and the large sack of cash literally dropped onto them from the sky, is just that--a multi-layered, majestic feast for both the eyes and the mind. Young brothers Anthony and Damian Cunninham, whose initial response to their unexpected fortune is a Robin Hood-esque spree of charity, have only one week to spend their 265,000 British pounds before their nation switches over to the Euro. Though the premise may seem trite or predictable, unexpected details--including Damian's ability to see visions of saints and the recent death of the boys' beloved mother--add complexity to the story. As the 7- and 9-year-old Cunningham brothers, lead actors Alex Etel and Lewis McGibbon prove to be those exceptional child actors who are appealing without being precious and their understated, mature performances add gravity to a largely whimsical film.<br><br>Danny Boyle, the director best known for stylishly violent films TRAINSPOTTING and 28 DAYS LATER, might seem an odd man to helm this comparatively innocent movie. However, Boyle's visual and narrative gifts turn out to be perfectly suited to this modern day fable, adding much-needed flavor to a genre that is all too often ignored by cinematic talents.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">some fantasy film.... hmmm</span></div>

This time around, their sights are set on one of the horror genre's most popular subjects: werewolves. Set in an ultra-hip modern Los Angeles, the film tells the tale of siblings Ellie (Christina Ricci) and Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg), who have yet to fully come to terms with the loss of their parents. Ellie works at "The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn" and dates ladies' man Jake (Joshua Jackson), while Jimmy is a less-than-popular high school student with a crush on the prettiest girl in school (Kristina Anapau). But one night, after Ellie and Jimmy get into a car accident on Mulholland Drive, they are bitten by what appears to be a bona fide werewolf. Soon, both brother and sister are exhibiting behavior that can only mean one thing--that they, too, have been cursed.<br><br>A troubled production history notwithstanding, Craven's film remains a fast-paced, clever addition to the genre. Featuring a star-studded supporting cast (including Mya, Judy Greer, and Shannon Elizabeth), as well as an energetic modern rock soundtrack, CURSED takes viewers on a thrill-ride through the dark side of Los Angeles.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">another werewolves flick.... i fancied van helsing the other time round....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </span></div>

In the days that followed, Ronald Defeo eventually confessed to methodically killing his parents and four siblings with a rifle, saying "voices" in the house drove him to the massacre.

Stick out your thumb to join the most ordinary man in the world on an extraordinary adventure across the universe in the hilarious comedy, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." Earthman Arthur Dent is having a very bad day. His house is about to be bulldozed, he discovers that his best friend is an alien and to top things off, Planet Earth is about to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur's only chance for survival: hitch a ride on a passing spacecraft. For the novice space traveler, the greatest adventure in the universe begins when the world ends. Arthur sets out on a journey in which he finds that nothing is as it seems: he learns that a towel is just the most useful thing in the universe, finds the meaning of life, and discovers that everything he needs to know can be found in one book: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">some spacy thingie... looks good....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></div>

MILLIONS, the fantastical tale of two British brothers and the large sack of cash literally dropped onto them from the sky, is just that--a multi-layered, majestic feast for both the eyes and the mind. Young brothers Anthony and Damian Cunninham, whose initial response to their unexpected fortune is a Robin Hood-esque spree of charity, have only one week to spend their 265,000 British pounds before their nation switches over to the Euro. Though the premise may seem trite or predictable, unexpected details--including Damian's ability to see visions of saints and the recent death of the boys' beloved mother--add complexity to the story. As the 7- and 9-year-old Cunningham brothers, lead actors Alex Etel and Lewis McGibbon prove to be those exceptional child actors who are appealing without being precious and their understated, mature performances add gravity to a largely whimsical film.<br><br>Danny Boyle, the director best known for stylishly violent films TRAINSPOTTING and 28 DAYS LATER, might seem an odd man to helm this comparatively innocent movie. However, Boyle's visual and narrative gifts turn out to be perfectly suited to this modern day fable, adding much-needed flavor to a genre that is all too often ignored by cinematic talents.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">some fantasy film.... hmmm</span></div></blockquote>I've just watched this. Its pretty good imo. Obviously, since it is a family movie, it is less violent and less dark than his other movies. That said, I think this movie is beautifully and stylishly shot.<br><br>PS: My opinion might be skewed by the fact that i witnessed a heart warming incident before the movie started; a couple of snotty kids were removed from the cinema for making too much noise, being disruptive and generally being arse holes. Aaah - THAT is customer service. If i had my way, no one below 16 would be allowed into cinemas unaccompanied by an adult...</div>
