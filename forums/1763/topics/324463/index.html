              <p>This is an incredible movie that begins slowly. It leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama. Then, in the second half, there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scope.<br> Especially beginning with the second half, you will find this movie an amazing experience.Excellent work! Though the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such a work was never attempted on Indian Screen...and also take note of the powerful music throughout the film, its got an <strong><em>amazing soundtrack (see sample link).</em></strong></p>
