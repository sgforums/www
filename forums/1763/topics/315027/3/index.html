              <p>Last Sat, I tried to book Iron Man on GV site.  Mostly fully booked in all the big theatres.  Then I switched over to Dance of Dragon, it was shown in not that many theatres and they were usually the smaller ones.  Despite of that, there were still plenty of seats for Sat night slots.</p>
              <p>I thought Iron Man and DOD started showing on the same day (30 Apr or 1 May).  How come Iron Man so hot and DOD like not many ppl watch?</p>

              <p>Aiyo, u can't compare shan ye4 movie(iron man) with art movie(DOD) lah..</p>
              <p>Furthermore, DOD hardly have any ads on TV but even today iron man still have many ads on TV, so kia su hee..</p>
              <p>and the official release of dotd at GV cinemas are very weird there are only like 4 screening per day and the timing also weird 4.30pm or 9.30pm or 4.30pm or 6.30pm and that all. Weird</p>

              <p>Who say only Fann's fans watch DOD this movie? Look, some reviews here Not from Fann fans ;-)</p>
              <p>1 (I was plesently surprised when I saw this film last night. I was in the mood for something emotional instead of all the superhero stuff on at the cinemas at the moment. and this was exactly what I needed. Solid performances, nice visuals, great music, and emotionally very moving. The actors really are fantastic in this film. It is not a fast action film it is a really beautifully made film, which really works on many levels. Quite a simple story but told in a very interesting way, very original, this film is a must see. dont miss it!!)</p>
              <p>2 (I must admit I have never been a big fan of Fann Wong until now, she has really matured as an actress, and really pulled off an amazing performance with this film... she made me cry three times. This film is really a warm tale, starting with the Korean family scenes at the begining of the film... and the love story between Jason and Fann, really is quite heart breaking.. great artistic film loved it.)</p>
              <p>3 (With a film made in Singapore I never expect very much, but my girfriend took me to see this, because she loves Jang Hyuk. And I actually really enjoyed the film. Fann looks stunning. The film is extremely well made, hollywood style camera work. A very fresh approach to the love triangle story. I will watch this film again with my other friends who thought it may just be a chick flick... actually its a film for all ages.)</p>

              <p>The story is too boring... long winded.. fann wongs acting is abit fake.... scott lee forever a hero and a fighter.. no doubts of the korean... overall... this movie is a waste of time and money. i nearly fell asleep while watching this.... given a 2nd chance... pump in more energy and action... this movie should rename as "Dance with a NERD"</p>

              <p>Thought that Wong Li Lin was a better choice for the female lead, but they choose fann wong instead. Gave her a chance and went to watch, but guess my first choice would definitely be able to do a better job, at least in the dancing segment. Fann wong stiff dancing and posture makes her role as a dancing teacher in the movie a laughing stock.. Though the chemistry between the 3 leads are missing, but Jang Hyuk performance was up to standard. I have seen movies of the same genre, but none has make me sleepy and doze off like this. A word for the director: choose the best lead in your future project and not just for looks!</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>At the beginning, I thought it was "just the beginning" to always go slow for any movie....who knows after 45 mins, its even slower...My dear buddy next to me yawned and fell asleep...!! Fann's make-up appears really not suitable for her in the whole show. What you would see is just the dancers turning n turning with their arms up high..."lousy dance steps" which layman could do it as well..no head n tail of how we should understand the story should goes...(bad flow i would say). Think its a cheap production!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>This movie was incredibly boring. The pace of the movie was slow, and the acting was bad. Jang Hyuk acted well but Fann Wong was acting clueless as usual. And their lack of chemistry was the ultimate bore. The worst thing is, the director had to squeeze out some emotion from the emotionally flat scenes by amping up the soundtrack. i kid you not. In every scene, the classical soundtrack is just blasting away like nobody's business. Which was really annoying. And the whole story was so contrived! To give the script credit, it was at least something deep (holding on to one's dreams, pursuing one's dreams, etc etc etc) but the way it was fleshed out - it showed that the script writer had no idea, ABSOLUTELY NONE about Singapore, about Gongfu fighting, or South Korea. I do NOT understand how this film came to be made, really. Don't waste your time on this movie.</p>

              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> Good Acting by Jang Hyuk &amp; Jason Scott Lee but not Ms Fann</p>
              <p><strong>What I really hated:</strong> Had enough of Fann Wong</p>
              </div>
              <p>The movie can be rated 4 star or even 5 if Ms Fann was not lead actress. The producers of the film should select the lead actress carefully if they want to venture the film into foreign country. Rather than Fann Wong there are still many pretty TCS actress to choose from. Why keep on promoting the old chick!!</p>

              <p>All these weeks there's so many English and chinese movies, DOD without many TV ads yet can reach #6 already can consider good liao <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Two weeks already DOD still in Top 10 woohoo.</p>
              <p>Review</p>
              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> Jang Hyuk!!!!</p>
              <p>Jang Hyuk is my fav actor, he is so cute!!! in this film, I have seen this film 3 times now with my friends. I cant wait for the dvd. Loved the dancing with jang and fann, especially at the end, and I love the use of the hero song for their final dance, I cried at the end for Jason Lee. The young boy is also so cute, I think all the Korean actors are the best... maybe because I watch them all on the Korean dramas before, and loved seeing them on the big screen. this is a special film, take some time to see it.. really lovely picture!!!</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> Fann Wong</p>
              <p>Loved this film, I was looking for a film yesterday that I could really sit back and get involved with characters and this film really pulls it off, Finally a film that is character driven, instead of effects driven, I loved the scene with Jason scott lee getting bashed while Hyuk is dancing. Man how beautiful is Fann Wong in this film... I actually didnt realize she could look this good, So I am now a big fann. For a local Singaporean film.. felt like a big budget.. wide screen pictures and great music... check out this love story.. while it is still in cinemas.. great film!!!</p>
              <p>............................................................................................................................................</p>
              <p>don't really like Jang's father scene in the movie</p>
              <p>Seriously I don't think this is low budget production, it's a international/hollywood movie, how can it be low budget then? and there's Hollywood actor Jason &amp; Korea star Jang in it. international beautiful young looking star Fann Wong act well, dance well, I'm glad they chose her for this movie(can't really imagine if they chose other not so good in every way actress.) Btw Those music in it was nice too.. but I guess not many people they can understand this movie, prove me wrong. (Overall it's a beautiful movie)</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> Music</p>
              <p>With a film made in Singapore I never expect very much, but my girfriend took me to see this, because she loves Jang Hyuk. And I actually really enjoyed the film. Fann looks stunning. The film is extremely well made, hollywood style camera work. A very fresh approach to the love triangle story. I will watch this film again with my other friends who thought it may just be a chick flick... actually its a film for all ages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> Fann Wong</p>
              <p>I must admit I have never been a big fan of Fann Wong until now, she has really matured as an actress, and really pulled off an amazing performance with this film... she made me cry three times. This film is really a warm tale, starting with the Korean family scenes at the begining of the film... and the love story between Jason and Fann, really is quite heart breaking.. great artistic film loved it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> Dancing</p>
              <p>I was plesently surprised when I saw this film last night. I was in the mood for something emotional instead of all the superhero stuff on at the cinemas at the moment. and this was exactly what I needed. Solid performances, nice visuals, great music, and emotionally very moving. The actors really are fantastic in this film. It is not a fast action film it is a really beautifully made film, which really works on many levels. Quite a simple story but told in a very interesting way, very original, this film is a must see. dont miss it!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> The emotions involved.</p>
              <p><strong>What I really hated:</strong> Nothing</p>
              <p>I think that the movie was great, with Fann Wong and all, and we must take into consideration that these actors/actress have taken long hours and sacrifice to LEARN how to dance just for the filming of the show. They put in so much effort. We should try to understand that it is not easy to act, dance, memorise lines and remember what the director says all at once while filming, not only that, their facial expression and body language are also controlled by them while acting, so its a really tough job. I think that the movie was great. I intend to watch it again. In the beginning, i really thought that the 'Korean' setting was really in Korea. When I came home and did research on this movie, I found out that everything was filmed in Singapore. Best movie I've seen this year.</p>
              <p>............................................................................................................................................</p>
              <p>Have compared some of the review after I watched the movie. Not quite agreed with them. Yes the movie is slow &amp; there is very little dialogue but I still feel that the movie is very beautifully done. Look at every scene, the color is so beautiful &amp; so well shot. I believe the movie is meant to be shot is this matter just as they advertised that it is an international movie &amp; to show the world what different genre Singapore movie maker can produce. If you can watch the movie with an open mind, not compare &amp; appreciate the new level that the movie maker wanted to present. It is definitely worth yr effort to go watch it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> fann wong final dance</p>
              <p>First of all i like to say u dont expect this to be the same as the rest of the movies u have watched, like hollywood movies must have big powers, action, cracking porn jokes here n there. If u gonna put on the same glasses u will not enjoy this movie. Same as music there are many genres...pop, jazz, country, so u cannot judge this movie so shallowly like some local critics did. This is a decent movie n it moves abit slow. The 3 actors did fine for the whole movie but i like to commend on fann's part in her final dance as she outshine her counterparts, dance with grace, pride, confidence all showed in her eyes, look and body language. When she finished her dance and shedded to tears that was great acting as it moved me too. Fann did well in her last part and i enjoyed it so afterall it is still not bad and i will give them 3 out of 5 stars easily.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> Graceful dance moves</p>
              <p><strong>What I really hated:</strong> Poster written the name wrongly for Jang Hyuk and Jason Scott Lee</p>
              <p>I watch this movie yesterday at Cineleisure, was contemplating about this movie until my gf told me to try a shot. Was pretty impressed because its like a local production since mainly flim in Singapore. Different role and view of Fann, had to agree that she is versatile in her acting and can take hollywood projects. Jang Hyuk gave a different feel as my last watch drama of him was the Aids drama shown on CableTV, he can dance quite well too. Love the costumes Fann wore, sexy yet demure</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What I loved most:</strong> Great Emotional scenes</p>
              <p><strong>What I really hated:</strong> Little dialogue but expressions very good</p>
              <p>If you enjoy dancing and want to see a movie through expressions, this is the correct movie to go too. I think the role of Emi given to SG actress Fann was the best choice, elegant and classy dance instructor .. along with hearthrob Jang Hyuk .. this movie is going to be a big bang .. Showing in US, Korea, Singapore will bring lots of exposure to the both leading actors/actress .. I can see that Fann changes a very beautiful costume in every other scene, she can dance very well given only a month to train ... Critics should give Fann her due credit because she is the most exportable actress/artiste in Singapore</p>
