            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">AP - Wednesday, December 12</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By MIN LEE,AP Entertainment Writer</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AP Interview: Peter Chan says 'Warlords' grounded, realistic Chinese epic</span></strong><br><br>HONG KONG - Hong Kong director Peter Chan, known for his subtle, sensitive love stories, hopes to give Chinese epics a makeover with "The Warlords," a gritty film about three 19th century mercenaries, being released across Asia on Thursday.<br><br>Historical epics are the black sheep of Chinese cinema. Although top Chinese directors have had box office success with the genre, critics say they lack artistic value.<br><br>One of the major Chinese films of the year, "The Warlords" _ starring Jet Li, Andy Lau and Japanese-Taiwanese actor Takeshi Kaneshiro _ is about the breakdown in friendship between three mercenaries during civil unrest in 19th century China.<br><br>Chan said in an interview with The Associated Press late Tuesday that the US$40 million (�27.3 million) production, a remake of a 1973 Chinese film, is different from previous epics like Zhang Yimou's "Curse of the Golden Flower" (2006) or Chen Kaige's "The Promise" (2005) because there are no glittering gold costumes, no gravity-defying kung fu fights _ just the gritty, cruel reality of warfare.<br><br>"It's not romanticized. The characters don't fly around. It doesn't sugarcoat human nature. It just gives you raw and blunt reality," Chan said.<br><br>The 45-year-old director said he has a more grounded approach to Chinese epics.<br><br>"I did not set out to make a big movie," he said. "I set out to make a movie that is about something."<br><br>Indeed, Chan does not hesitate to show the brutality of warfare.<br><br>Li's character, Ma, is a pragmatist who advocates joining the imperial government so his soldiers have better resources. He slaughters hundreds of defeated enemies to conserve food supplies, to the outrage of Lau's character, Cao Erhu.<br><br>Still, Chan gives Ma a softer side by having him fall in love with Cao's beautiful wife.<br><br>Although the director successfully tackles the complexities of human nature _ Li delivers a surprising performance as the ruthless, yet emotional Ma _ the nuances are overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the two-hour film.<br><br>Chan said he had to lobby investors to keep key details in the film. He said Chinese investors frowned on the ragged clothes the mercenaries wore, while American investors wanted flying kung fu scenes.<br><br>In the end, the director said he prevailed _ even clearing a largely unchanged edit with Chinese censors. China doesn't have a ratings system, and all films must be appropriate for all ages.<br><br>Chan said creative interference was inevitable considering the film's large budget _ and hence large financial risk for investors.<br><br>The US$40 million (�27.3 million) budget is considered huge by Chinese standards. Only a major hit in China makes tens of millions of U.S. dollars (euros), in contrast to the hundreds of millions a Hollywood film can rake in domestically.<br><br>"The Warlords" has been sold throughout Asia, but Chan said he is still negotiating deals in the U.S. and Europe.<br><br>Chan has made a name for himself as a director of romantic movies. He made "Comrades, Almost a Love Story" (1996) about the relationship between two mainland Chinese immigrants living in Hong Kong, and the 1999 Hollywood film "The Love Letter," about a woman's quest to find the author of a mysterious love letter.<br><br>He said he decided to make "The Warlords" because he felt too confident making love stories.<br><br>"You're forced to become more creative when you're a little insecure, when you're tackling something you've never done before and you don't know how to do it," Chan said.<br><br>Chan said he hasn't decided on his next movie. He said he has bought the movie rights to Ha Jin's English-language novel "Waiting" _ about a Chinese army doctor seeking to end an arranged marriage _ but doesn't plan to make the film in the next few years.<br></div>

The plot revolves around three sworn brothers who were torn apart by their different ambitions.<br><br>The massive production looks set to be a smash hit at the box office.<br><br>Director Peter Chan the man behind the cameras of "The Warlords" has won many prestigious film awards, especially in Hong Kong.<br><br>In October, Chan turned down a nomination for the Foreign Film category at the Academy Awards as he is aiming for a bigger haul at the next Oscars when the film is released in the US later in December.<br><br>He said: "I donÂ’t see why we have to rush the film for this yearÂ’s instead of the next. When the film finally gets a US release next fall, which is the proposed date, the film should have other than a foreign film nomination their own individual category nomination.<br><br>"With enough people seeing it in the US, I believe there will be more nominations. If we had gone to the Oscars this year, we would not be eligible for next yearÂ’s individual category nomination."<br><br>Chan is especially proud of his stellar cast of Jet Li, Andy Lau, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Xu Jinglei.<br><br>He feels that these criticallyÂ—acclaimed actors have all been given equal exposure in "The Warlords".<br><br>"At the dayÂ’s end, the hardest part, I thought, would be to edit the movie down to a length that would be good for distribution and good for the pacing of the film for an audience that is used to a 2Â—hour maximum duration. But how do I pace the story in a way where all the actors will have equally important parts? I realised that I actually didnÂ’t cut any significant scenes out of any actors and their proportions came out almost very equal," Chan said.<br><br>Besides being released in the US and Singapore, the 40Â—millionÂ—dollar movie has premiered in mainland China.

            <div class='col-md body'>Two's a company and three's a crowd. In movieland, that is almost always true, with no black and white, but with shades of grey instead. Of late, period or martial chivalry movies either look aesthetically beautiful like Zhang Yimou's trilogy of Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower, or opt for the grittier, more down to earth look with plenty of dirt and grime like Battle of Wits. Director Peter Chan's The Warlords follows the latter with its strained colors and muck on everyone's face, in parallel of the grey that befalls everyone in this tale of a trio's struggles with the System, and amongst themselves.<br><br>Continues at http://anutshellreview.blogspot.com/2007/12/warlords-tau-ming-chong.html</div>
