            <div class='col-md body'><p>The Substation Moving Images presents<br> FIRST TAKE<br> 5 January 2009<br> The Substation Theatre<br> 8pm, FREE ADMISSION <br> <br> First Take, happening every 1st Monday of the month at The Substation,<br> is a popular screening of new local short films and is followed by a<br> Q&amp;A with the filmmakers. A platform for new filmmakers and anyone who<br> is interested in filmmaking to meet, exchange ideas and show their<br> work. See the future talents of Singapore film! <br> <br> 1. SCENES FROM A BREAK-UP / MARK KWAN / 7 MIN / PG <br> A story of a marriage that has broken down, told documentary-style,<br> from the contrasting points of view of the husband and the wife.<br> <br> Mark is a teacher and a film buff, he has directed a few short films<br> and was the recipient of two merit awards at the 2006 National<br> Scriptwriting Competition (Feature Film and Television Pilot). He is<br> presently working on a feature-length script, LIES, a contemporary<br> drama about the secret lives of two seemingly picture-perfect couples.<br> <br> 2. A SOFT PRAYER FOR THE ONE / CHUA JINGDU / 3 MIN / PG <br> A really short story about a guy takes a bus ride and decides to<br> perform a simple act of love in the purest way. <br> <br> Jingdu (JD) graduated from the School of Film and Media Studies, Ngee<br> Ann Polytechnic. He specializes in screenwriting and has directed a<br> few films and videos. JD loves and usually does drama thrillers;<br> PRAYER is his first work of a different genre.<br> <br> 3. OUR LAST DAY / KENNY TAN / 32 MIN / 2007 / PG<br> 17 year-old Midori Nakamura leaves suburban Yokohama (Japan) with her<br> family, and settles in to a new life in cosmopolitan Singapore. Shy<br> and reserved, she finds it daunting and difficult adjusting to<br> city-life in a foreign country, till she meets 15 year-old Reiko<br> Sakaguchi, a cheery, outspoken girl studying in the same college.<br> <br> OUR LAST DAY, my 2nd short film, was an exciting attempt to write and<br> direct a “local-foreign” film, with the notion of fusion and<br> cross-cultural interaction that has always interest me. This project<br> also seeks to transform and give Singapore’s stereotypical urban<br> landscape a fresh new perspective. OUR LAST DAY is my 3rd production<br> attempt and my 2nd short film after LORONG 27 (2003) and 12:17  (music<br> video) (2004).<br> <br> 4. URBAN INVASION / GRACE TENG / 5 MIN / 2008 / PG<br> What happens when forces conspire to prevent you from enjoying as<br> simple a pleasure as reading a book? This film is a short, quirky look<br> at the nature of urban interaction. <br> <br> Grace Teng is an amateur filmmaker currently without a paying job.<br> Previous films include MURPHY’S LAW (screened at First Take), IV<br> LEAGUE and SUFFERING FOR SUCCESS (part of the S-Express Programme at<br> the Asian Film Symposium). She is currently working on a stop-motion film.<br> <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> SUBMISSIONS ARE WELCOME ALL YEAR ROUND!
