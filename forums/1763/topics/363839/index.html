              <strong>ADANA - As the Golden Boll International Film Festival 
              continues apace in the southern city of Adana, the best films in each section 
              are coming to the forefront. One of the most anxiously awaited films among the 
              National Feature Films Competition is ’On the Way to School.’ An animated film 
              was also among the most liked films in the festival.</strong><br><br>The traditional 
              "Love Parade" wound its way through Adana on Wednesday, allowing famed names of 
              Turkish cinema and honored directors to salute the citizens of the host city for 
              the Golden Boll (AltÄ±n Koza) International Film Festival. <br><br>A convoy of 
              nearly 15 cars filled with celebrities started touring around the city, led by a 
              band, at 6 p.m. and drew great interest from the people of Adana. As the 
              festival continues full speed ahead with its film screenings and side events, 
              the most well regarded films in each section are gaining prominence.<br><br>One 
              of the most anxiously awaited films among the National Feature Films Competition 
              is "Ä°ki Dil Bir Bavul" (On the Way to School), in which a teacher starts working 
              in a faraway village in Turkey. <br><br>The film depicts the life of a teacher, 
              alone in a village as an authority of the state, and also alone in his 
              interaction with his students. Orhan Eskiköy wrote the screenplay for the film 
              and co-directed it with Özgür DoÄŸan. Kurdish children portray most of the 
              students in the movie, which may well be a true story of today’s situation in 
              Turkey.<br><br>In the World Cinema category, one film drew particular admiration 
              from film critics as well as the Adana audience: Directed, edited and produced 
              by Canadian Petr Lom, "Letters to the President" is an observation of the regime 
              of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. <br><br>The only foreigner given such 
              access, filmmaker Lom was allowed to travel on several of the president’s 
              populist trips to the countryside, and his movie shows a very different 
              Ahmadinejad than the one portrayed by the international media: less the 
              dangerous leader and more the ordinary, but charismatic, 
              politician.<br><br>During Lom’s trips, the president received many letters Äž the 
              government claims 10 million Äž from poor Iranians asking for help. The filmmaker 
              uses these letters as its narrative thread, and as a device to provide a glimpse 
              into a country that is largely closed to outsiders. While it finds no evidence 
              for the government’s claim that its charity solves the problems described in 
              most of letters, the film does show that these promises kindle the desperate 
              hopes of the poor.<br><br>"Letters to the President" was screened Wednesday for 
              the first time in Turkey with the participation of the director, who was roundly 
              applauded after the film.<br><br><br><strong>Animation by young Turkish 
              filmmaker<br><br></strong>Also among the most liked films screened during the 
              festival was an animation that drew the interest of many people. Although the 
              movie’s name, "Gemeinschaft," sounds German, it was made by a young Turkish 
              filmmaker, Adana local Özlem AkÄ±n. Born in the city in 1986, AkÄ±n grew up in <a class="keywords" href="http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/index/izmir/">Ä°zmir</a> and graduated from the film and television department of 
              <a class="keywords" href="http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/index/istanbul/">Istanbul</a>’s Bilgi University in 2008. She made her first film 
              in 2006 and has made seven movies since then while continuing her education at 
              the animation department of Film School Zlin in the Czech Republic, considered 
              one of the best schools in this field. "Gemeinschaft" is AkÄ±n’s latest animated 
              work and one well worth seeing.<br><br>The festival continues with many 
              premieres and screenings of internationally awarded films. On Friday, the head 
              of the National Feature Films Competition jury, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, will 
              participate in a question-and-answer program at the Metropol Municipality 
              Theater. The famous director will be joined by Ebru Ceylan, who worked as an 
              actor, art director and script writer on his films; Mehmet EryÄ±lmaz, who acted 
              in his 2006 film "Ä°klimler" (The Climates); Ercan Kesal, one of the script 
              writers and actors in "Üç Maymun" (Three Monkeys); and Hatice Aslan, another 
              actor in "Üç Maymun."
