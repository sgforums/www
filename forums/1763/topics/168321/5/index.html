His superhuman powers emerged in adolescence. At first, Rasputin was content simply to use these powers to aid the other people of the Collective.<br><br>However, Rasputin was contacted by Professor Charles Xavier, founder of the X-Men, when Xavier was organizing a new team of mutant X-Men to help him rescue the original X-Men from the sentient island Krakoa. Rasputin agreed to leave the farm community in which he was born and raised to go to America with Xavier.<br><br>Xavier gave Rasputin the code name "Colossus" and Rasputin aided Xavier's other new recruits in their battle against Krakoa. After the battle was won, Rasputin remained in the United States with the new X-Men while the rest of his family stayed on the farm.<br><br>Rasputin's family always remained in his thoughts. Shortly thereafter a woman known as Miss Locke kidnapped many of the X-Men's loved ones to use as hostages in order to force the X-Men to aid her in freeing her employer, Arcade, from captivity by one of <span style="color: red;">Doctor Doom's </span>robots. Among her captives was Colossus's younger sister Illyana, whom Locke had somehow kidnapped from the Siberian collective farm and transported to the United States.<br><br>The X-Men freed Illyana from captivity, and she went to live with her brother Piotr (known as Peter in America) at Xavier's mansion. Due to her later captivity in a dimension known as Limbo where she spent years while only mere moments elapsed on Earth, Illyana became the adolescent sorceress known as Magik.<br><br>After Illyana was returned to her true Earth age, Colossus thought it would be better for Illyana if she went back to live with their parents. Sadly, her parents were slain and she was kidnapped by a mutant known as the Soul Skinner who hoped to genetically evolve Illyana to the point where she would have the use of her powers again. Colossus, with the help of the X-Men, saved Illyana and brought her back to the mansion.<br><br>Later, Illyana became the first tragic victim to be infected with the Legacy Virus and die from it. The deaths of his immediate family caused Colossus to rethink his position with the X-Men and join Magneto and his Acolytes, who had offered him an alternative to the X-Men's way of fighting and living.<br><br>His stay with Magneto was not long once he realized that Avalon was not the place for him, either. He left in search of the only person he felt truly cared for him, his former love and teammate Kitty Pryde, now a member of Excalibur. Colossus traveled to England, where he found Kitty in the arms of her new love, Pete Wisdom. Colossus, enraged, attacked Wisdom, and although the battle was short-lived, they both sustained minor injuries.<br><br>Colossus accepted Kitty's new life and chose to become a member of Excalibur. Once the team dissolved, Kitty, Colossus and Nightcrawler returned to the States and became active members of the X-Men.<br><br>During this time he repaired his friendships with Wolverine and Storm, that were broken when he had joined the Acolytes. He also created a deep friendship with Marrow. Piotr again found his long thought-dead brother Mikhail, but unfortunately lost him again when Apocalypse collected the Twelve in his quest for power.<br><br>Beast, one of his X-Men teammates, claimed to have found the cure for the Legacy Virus. Not knowing weather or not it worked Colossus injected himself with the cure. Seemingly killing himself Colossus used his powers, and cured the Legacy Virus from anyone in the planet. The body was cremated, and Kitty Pryde spread the ashes in Russia.<br><br>However it was later brought to the attention of the X-Men, that an alien called Ord from the Breakworld had captured Piotr's body, left a duplicate and revived it. He had used Colossus in his program to find a "Cure" for mutants. During their investigation Shadowcat and the X-Men were united with Colossus. Together they stopped Ord, and captured the Cure.<br><br>Currently Colossus has returned to the X-Men and his long love Shadowcat.<br><br><strong>Strength Level:</strong> In his normal human form Peter Rasputin possesses the normal human strength of a man of his age, height, and build who engages in intensive regular exercise. As Colossus he can left (press) at least 70 tons under optimal conditions.<br><br><strong>Special Skills:</strong> Talented artist in drawing and painting<br><br><strong>Known Superhuman Powers:</strong> Colossus is a mutant with the superhuman ability to convert the tissue of his entire body into an organic steel-like substance, granting him superhuman strength and a high degree of resistance to bodily harm. This substance, resembling organic steel, is of unknown composition but appears to be analogous to osmium and to carbon steel.<br><br>He is able to transform into this armor-like state at will (the process is virtually instantaneous) and remain in that form for an as yet undetermined amount of time. (The longest time he has remained in armored form so far has been five days). Once in his armored form he remains so until he consciously wills himself back to normal. If he is rendered unconscious, however, he spontaneously reverts to his normal form. While in his armored state, Colossus possesses the same degree of mobility that he does in his normal form.<br><br>The process by which Colossus transforms himself to armored form and back (including his gain of additional mass from an unknown, perhaps extra-dimensional, force) remains unknown. Colossus cannot become partially or selectively armored; his body is either entirely converted or not. Even his eyes become steel-like; his eyeballs can withstand and deflect the impact of a .45 caliber bullet.<br><br>In his armored form Colossus is highly resistant to most forms of bodily harm. His armor is capable of withstanding ballistic penetration, including that of a 110 millimeter Howitzer shell. He could survive a collision with a loaded, one-ton flatbed truck at 100 miles per hour or an explosion of 450 pounds of TNT. He can survive extremes of temperature from 70 degrees above absolute zero (-390 degrees Fahrenheit) to approximately 9000 Fahrenheit. However, it is theorized that above the latter temperature, his armored form would begin to melt. Colossus's armored form cannot rust under normal Earth conditions.<br><br>Colossus is in unusually fine physical health, permitting the transition back and forth from his normal organic flesh state to his armored form to occur with minimal stress on his system. His normal lungs are capable of holding his breath for 3.6 minutes. In the past he has exhibited a minimal or nonexistent need to breathe while in his armored state. However, it is believed that he could not survive for long in a vacuum. His endurance and speed are somewhat greater in his armored form.[/b]</blockquote>he look powerful!!!<br><br>Doc doom??<br><br>U mean do doom from fanstic 4?? are they in X-men too?</div>
