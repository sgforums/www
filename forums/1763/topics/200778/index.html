            <div class='col-md body'>I thought there's this sort of thread before but nil results in the searches..so here goes.<br><br>25. That in period pieces, vintage cars are always freshly polished, painted, and clean. They never have scratches, dents or any signs of use.<br><br>24. Every time weÂ’re introduced to a police precinct house, one or more colourfully dressed prostitutes are being brought in while bickering with their arresting officer.<br><br>23. Chinese food takeout in a movie always comes in those little white boxes, which I have never, in my life, seen chinese food arrive at my door in. I desperately want it to, but it never does.<br><br>22. If a bar or clubhouse has a pinball machine, itÂ’s gonna get fcuking trashed during a fight scene. (IÂ’ve ALWAYS wanted my own pinball machine, so this one makes me wince)<br><br>21. That itÂ’s only after the detective has been suspended (and obligatorily forced to place his badge and gun on the lieutenantÂ’s desk) that he can properly crack the case.<br><br>20. That in war, only the enemy (usually the Viet Cong) were ever low-down enough to stoop to using booby traps.<br><br>19. People being chased by a car who run top speed down the middle of the street instead of simply ducking somewhere where a car canÂ’t follow, which happens to be pretty much anywhere except the middle of the street.<br><br>18. Young gorgeous women constantly falling in love with men much, much older than they are. In other words: Fuck you Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood.<br><br>17. Chess players are always always brilliant, charming, upper class people, while card players are always sneaky, foul mouthed, and prone to cheating.<br><br>16. When an innocent cough is always a symptom of terminal illness.<br><br>15. Women that never have enough sense to keep running while being chased by an enemy unless a guy is pulling her along by her hand or wrist Â— despite the fact that this takes them far below the speed either one could go on their own.<br><br>14. That somehow singing in a moving vehicle always makes something terrible happen.<br><br>13. If someone dies with their eyes open, someone will close them by effortlessly moving their hand over the deceased face Â— and they will remain tightly shut.<br><br>12. If our protagonist goes to a sporting event, no matter who he is, his face will always end up on the fucking jumbotron.<br><br>11. Women that donÂ’t sweat during sex.<br><br>10. That every helicopter shutting down emits the chirp-chirp-chirp sound, in spite of the fact that only the Bell 47G (the chopper on MASH) actually makes this noise.<br><br>9. If a hero is divorced (and most are), that heÂ’ll have some contact with his ex-wife who will still have strong feelings for him even if sheÂ’s remarried.<br><br>8. All computer keyboards or control panels have thousands of volts just underneath their surface, and their malfunctions are indicated by a puff of smoke and a cartoonish shower of sparks.<br><br>7. That Native Americans invariably have mystical knowledge that can obtusely predict the future, or have a fundamental understanding of all things in nature .<br><br>6. That when a phone line is broken unexpectedly, someone will always frantically press the phone cradle button and yell Â“Hello? HELLO!?Â” with an emphasis on the second hello.<br><br>5. A splash of cold water in face will render the most inebriated person stone cold sober in a faction of a second. IÂ’ve tried it. It doesnÂ’t work.<br><br>4. When someone yells Â“You never backed away from everything in your life, now fight!!Â” while giving someone CPR or working to resuscitate a stopped heart.<br><br>3. Girls are always instantly attractive to every male if they take off their glasses and/or let down their hair, never mind that they were totally gorgeous actresses failing to physically portray a nerd in the first place.<br><br>2. Children or retards that are wise beyond their years/capabilities and that humble the adults around them.<br><br>aaaand: (Drumroll)<br><br>1. Dogs who always know who is evil, and bark at them.<br><br>Hmmm... they could have squeezed in Arnold's "I'll be back!".</div>

Oooh, I left my wallet in the car! I absolutely must go alone without company or a personal weapon to my car which I parked within an obscure, unlighted, creepy part of the house where the killer confirm chop will be hiding nearby. And none of my 7 or 8 friends think its a stupid or dangerous idea.<br><br>Also, when the group encounters something dangerous or scary, ONE of them will ALWAYS scream or run away. And a chosen someone else WILL run after that guy. Then the group will later find their bodies killed in various ways.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in cops films, if the hero desperately needs a car to pursue a criminal, he will just snatch any car on the streets by showing his badge to the driver. in most cases the car will end up smashed badly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
