Or because you dun go church one (means you never read about Jesus lah, Mary lah etc lah)?  Dunno which article say non Christian should be able to understand.<br><br>But my non Christian friend came out of cinema still asking me "So what is a holy grail".<br><br>The movie half the time in English, half in French.  No wonder there are English subtitles throughout.  But no use lah.  Some of the terms they use French in the Eng subtitles.<br><br>Lucky last time spent a few years learning French language.  Good movie to do some revisions.  heheh.  Managed to understand all the dialogue.  But that doesn't make me like the movie.<br><br>Sigh.</div>

And those that knelt before the Grail will be blah blah...etc.......As on why he did or did not or will or will not show to the whole world is no longer important lah....the gist of the story/movie is in finding it, not whether he will tell it to the world or not.....<br><br>This is same as many movies...we must know the theme of what the movie wants to tell....e.g. many chinese movies, english movies also have supposed unfinished endings....but as what it says, its not the ending that matters, its the process.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>indeed, if you study foreshadowing in movies, you will have noticed that certain parts of the movie have been played in the earlier parts, and then played again in the later parts of the movie,<br>for example, the one where sophie neveau is running into the fields.<br><br>also, when langdon pricked himself while shaving, you will have noticed that the blood seems to form an excalibur. this is also foreshadowing that he is a knight that is worthy of finding the grail.<br><br>another part of foreshadowing is when sophie neveau had a scar on her neck, on the left side, there is a patch of blood that so perfectly forms a triangle, why? because the triangle represents trinity, god the father, the son, and the holy spirit, although i still dont understand why.</div>
