              <p><span style="font-size: larger;"><strong>The Fighter <br> </strong></span><strong>Opens Jan 6<br> </strong>Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale get the year off to a start 
              with a stirring boxing biopic that will uppercut your heart. The Fighter
               is the true story of “Irish” Micky Ward (Wahlberg) and his half brother
               Dicky Eklund (Bale). Eklund, the elder of the two was a working class 
              hero until a crushing defeat at the hands of Sugar Ray Leonard. After 
              spiraling into a word of addiction and vice, Eklund finds redemption as 
              Ward’s trainer. Nominated for Best Motion Picture—Drama, Best Actor in a
               Motion Picture—Drama and Best Supporting Actor in a Motion 
              Picture—Drama at the Golden Globe Awards.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: larger;"><strong>Love &amp; Other Drugs<br> </strong></span><strong>Opens Jan 6<br> </strong>Fans of Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal won’t want to miss 
              this one. After their last stint together in Brokeback Mountain where 
              they shared a quickie sex scene on the backseat of a truck, the duo have
               a go at it again pretty much everywhere in this daring romantic comedy.
               Hathway plays a free-spirited artist who meets her match in a Viagra 
              salesman (Gyllenhaal) as they journey in and out (pun intended) of love.
               Nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress in a Motion Picture—Musical 
              or Comedy at the Golden Globe Awards.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: larger;"><strong>Burlesque <br> </strong></span><strong>Opens Jan 13<br> </strong>Ali (Christina Aguilera) is a small-town girl who wants to make
               it big in Los Angeles. Joining up with a flagging burlesque club with 
              the help of her mentor Tess (Cher), she just might make it. So what if 
              the film has been receiving negative reviews? For better or for worse, 
              we want to see Cher in all her botoxed, nipped and tucked glory act as a
               role model for Christina Aguilera as she “WHOAAHOOAHOAHs” her way to 
              glory. Nominated for Best Motion Picture­­—Musical or Comedy at the 
              Golden Globe Awards.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: larger;"><strong>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives <br> </strong></span><strong>Opens Jan 17<br> </strong>After clinching the Palme d’Or at the 2010 Cannes Film 
              Festival, we’ll finally get a chance to experience Apichatpong 
              Weerasethakul’s far-out masterpiece. As the title character Uncle 
              Boonmee nears the end of his life, he begins to revisit his past lives 
              in search of the reason for his illness. In his presence are his loved 
              ones, including the ghost of his wife and a monkey version of his lost 
              son. Bold, bizarre and breathtaking.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: larger;"><strong>127 Hours <br> </strong></span><strong>Opens Jan 23<br> </strong>After making the world swoon for everything Indian with Slumdog

              book it’s based on). Aron Ralston (James Franco) is hiking in Utah one 
              day in 2003 when he gets trapped under a falling boulder. For five days,
               Ralston is stuck, and he begins to reflect on his life, before making 
              an extremely difficult (and excruciating) decision. Nominated for Best

               1968 novel of the same name. A teenage girl, Mattie Ross (Hailee

               Portman) and Lily (Mila Kunis), strike a twisted friendship. Swan Lake 
              is a production which requires a graceful White Swan and a sensual Black
               Swan; roles which fit Nina and Lily respectively. As the season 
              progresses, Nina embraces her dark side, and loses sight of reality.
