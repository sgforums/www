            <div class='col-md body'><p>SPOILER ALERT!!! Here is my review of the movie. I know quite heavy critic but please dont flame hor.<br><br>"Mummy: Tomb of the dragon emperor" is a movie whereby the content highly contradicts with its title. As a matter of fact, there are no mummies in it at all; unless you consider ancient Chinese soldiers as one.<br>And apart from the distinct contradiction, the plot is filled with flaws, lots of unnecessary sequence, both the English and Chinese spoke pathetic mandarin, female lead was replaced by a totally unsexy woman, the supposedly jokes are totally unprovoking of my laughing bone and fuck ... too much for me to possibly rant.<br><br>The casting of Asian Hollywood stars did not save the show from becoming a classic horror, the Jet Li martial arts package should be long dead by now, Michelle Yeoh is just a milf that should lay home all day and get laid by her multi billionaire Fiancée, as for Isabella Leong I guess she's pretty cute, but again that did not save the show, perhaps Asami Tani will depending on her dress code.<br><br>If I were to ignore the preposterous plot on mummies being substituted by the ancient chinese, perhaps things started just fine with the O'Connell's playing the game of happy family, and Alex, his son, abandoning education and digging up the &lt;insert title here&gt;. All the chasing and shooting in shanghai was quite a rollercoaster ride too.<br>But at the moment when the yetis came out from nowhere and allied with the O'Connell in defeating the Chinese soldiers, I knew something was not right. Not too long later, things completely blew(&lt;i&gt;In a bad way&lt;/i&gt;) when Jet Li drowned himself into the shrine of immortality and suddenly turned into a three headed dragon toasting bricks like nobody's business.<br>I can't believe that the screenwriters had decided to add mythical creatures into the franchise. I mean how RIGHT is it to see abdominal snowmans, yeties, chinese dragon and some two horned mammal I can't name casted in a mummy show? Entirely not, the first two movies worked out well without those, and I am sure it will without screenwriters like Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, fuck them.<br><br>Apart from the above, the clashing war between the undead peasant and undead soilders was a total mess. <br>Charge and strike, starting with hoes and swords, later with guns and more swords, then planes and more fucking swords. In the end planes was eventually taken down by the two horned mammal which Jet Li transformed into. <br>I am strongly suspecting that the scriptwriters were doing his job half drunk and high on drugs, it's like a anything goes festival. Seriously, if a movie is unable to handle it's acme with care, it's better off dead.<br><br>And just to make things flow in a ludicrous manner, the ending was just as bad, if not, worse.<br>On one corner of the ring we have multi-classing Jet Li, a master in all forms of Chinese martial arts, a magician that's able to manipulate wind,water,fire,wood and metal at his own will, at the same time having the completely WTF ability to transform into just "anything"(&lt;i&gt;as quoted from the show&lt;/i&gt;) and that includes the option of changing into a 30foot tall three headed dragon that's flies and breaths fire.<br>On the another corner of the ring, we have the manly gentlemens from the O'Connell family that possess nothing but guns which proved to be useless against Jet Li, and a cursed hand-held dagger barely 40cm long that's capable of killing the emperor when stabbed in his heart. <br>And in less than 10mins of screen time, the O'Connell won! With childish tempting followed by a backstab into the heart.<br>This strongly reminds me of the final scene in X-Man 3, with wolverine(having the mere ability to ejaculate claws from kuncles and spontaneous recovery) killing dark phoenix(having the ability to realise whatever she imagines) by stabbing her.<br><br>Well to sum my lengthy rant up.<br>"Mummy: Tomb of the dragon emperor" is a sequel that's desperately dug up from the depths of hell when it has ended for good and peace. <br>If by any chance the show receives a passing grade from the consensus, Brendan Fraser deserves all the credits.<br><br>Grade 1.5/5.<br><br>Html code all wrong i know, intended to post in blog tomorrow and my blog coding different from sgforums.</p></div>

The answer is simple, and I will not deny that I sort of enjoyed the free-wheeling, breezy summer action-adventure-comedy with a generous dose of special effects thrown in, which the Mummy and The Mummy Returns offered, together with the great chemistry between Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and John Hannah. But this installment of Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, came hot on the heels of the Hollywood bandwagon of raiding their own franchises in order to rake in millions around the world, and therefore fell short on many counts.</span></p>
