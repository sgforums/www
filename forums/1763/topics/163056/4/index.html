            <div class='col-md body'>there's some questions i have about the movie.<br>1) how the natives build the fortress? those huge rocks<br>2) how the natives build the huge drawbridge? the bridge seems almost impossible to build. if u know about pioneering, u'll know y.<br>3) the part when the natives jump over the sea with a long spar and rope, how he did it?<br>4) how did they get kong back to NY with their damaged ship?<br>5) towards the end, ann was following the army to king kong. i was wondering how did ann got to king kong when king kong was chasing jack all over NY. also, how come ann reach kong before the army does and the army was later than ann like 10mins?</div>
