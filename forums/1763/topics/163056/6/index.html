            <div class='col-md body'>It really depends on how you view the movie Kong.<br><br>Personally, I loved it and have watched it twice.<br><br>other than being the realistic and many great scenes. The first part was necessary in revealing each character to us. Carl's aggressive, never say die, inconsiderate, etc character, Jack's passive character, Naomi's strength in her seemingly vulnerability etc.<br><br>As for the natives, we do not know if they were a bunch of people stranded there. People have landed there before, we won't know exactly who built the fortress and why they're stuck there. As for the bridge, it may seem impossible but then again, humans are such adaptable creatures, honestly we won't know our potential to do something till circumstances force us to do so.<br><br>Peter Jackson has shown us : the passiveness of Jack's love and the expressiveness of Kong's love; both for Naomi Watts. Of course Kong's bestiality is shown...in his fights and the way he defends himself when attacked. But then the whole point is that even that part of Kong has mellowed because of Naomi.<br><br>She manages to find him before others does? It could be because she sensed him? Or because she was running all around and trying to track him based on the damges and screams. The army needs time to assemble? The planes need time to re-align and I think they need to navigate in order to shoot Kong. They need to assess the situation before shooting. And those are very old planes right since it's in the 1930s.<br><br>Jackson has shown emotions doesn't need to come with words.<br></div>

Can you quote the exact phrase please?<br><br>Also, this was what Jonny Depp's character said in Pirates of the Carribean:<br>'Looks like you've never been to Singapore.'<br><br>The scene was how Depp's character manages to save Keira Knightley's character from drowning, and a British soldier couldn't figure out how to get her breathing again. Depp's character sliced off her corset, and said that phrase in response. How on earth is that insulting to Singapore?<br><br>For goodness' sake, don't read so much into it..... it's just like how people complain that Visa advertisements on TV are condescending to Asians.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really love the show. I watch it 1 week ago with a female fren and she cried... i also had to hold back tears not becos I am a sissy lah but i feel that alot of us may have felt what King Kong felt at some point of our lives...<br><br>I think King Kong was just like a lonely person, very misunderstood.  All he wants was for someone to spend his time with, have fun with but most people that he met (i.e those tribal people on skull island) were more afraid of him. Therefore, when he met Darrow..the girl who did not fear him... immediately, he felt a strong affection for her, not love but a very strong bond of friendship, so strong that he would die for her.  I think in our real lives, sometimes we felt that way also, just needing someone to understand us and not reject us based on what they see on the outside... and when we really do find that friend or friends... treasure them lilke what King Kong did to Darrow.</div>

Singapore was only this thriving maybe just 50 years ago.... so if the setting is in the early 1900s... i think it is right to say Singapore is still pretty ancient compare to the then US and Europe....</div>
