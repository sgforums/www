              <br> THE BEST OF FIRST TAKE
              <br> 1 December 2008
              <br> The Substation Theatre
              <br> 8pm, FREE ADMISSION

              favourites of each month, and a final vote is cast for the Top
              Favourite of First Take 2008! Come watch the most popular First Take
              films of each month and cast your vote to support your favorite film!
              <br> <br> Top Favourite of First Take 2008:
              <br> 1. FLYER / HELMI YUSOF / 19 MIN / PG
              <br>Walking down a busy street, a reporter is handed a flyer that
              reads: “Would you like to die? Visit us at Block 108, Kallang Way.” He
              goes to the address to investigate but gets sucked into a bizarre world
              of shadows and enigma. His colleagues try to rescue him, but they too
              become ensnared…
              <br> <br> 2. THE MITRE SPELL / TONY KERN / 15 MIN / PG
              <br>THE MITRE SPELL began as a curious query more than anything. Coming
              from the States, I was fascinated with Singapore's slight obsession
              with the supernatural and began location scouting spooky places for
              inspiration. I was soon directed to the now defunct Mitre Hotel, which
              still has a few tenants and operates as a bar... sort of. What started
              off as a one night visit and a few questions, soon became a fledgling
              documentary project. At the Mitre, there was an endless supply of
              quirky answers that inevitably gave rise to more questions. We started
              recording interviews on tape and were given permission to roam the
              premise for a time. Soon it would seem, I too came under the Mitre
              spell and became fascinated with the old place. This is part of the
              story.
              <br> <br> 3. WHITE / TAN WEI KEONG / 2 MIN / 2006 / G
              <br>A man, dissatisfied with a white cube for a head, decides to give
              it up immediately for a fanciful one in the name of self-improvement.
              <br> <br> 4. COMMA / EZZAM RAHMAN / 3 MIN / 2008 / PG
              <br> “Life is similar to a cup of tea, once the cup is broken, the tea remains as tea.”
              <br> Anonymous
              <br> <br> 5. DI MANAKAN KU CARI GANTI (WHERE CAN I FIND A REPLACEMENT) / SHAFIQ ISKANDAR / 16MIN / 2007 / PG
              <br>A subjective video in the style of a documentary about P. Ramlee
              and the fall of Malay Film Industries during the 70s, of how they have
              been forgotten by the people today and to bring back memories of what
              it is to be called the golden era of film at that time. Could we have
              another P. Ramlee today?
              <br> <br> 6. SHUT IN / PAMELA PANG / 23MIN / 2008 / PG
              <br>Shut In explores the dysfunctional world of Jason, a young urban
              hermit whose solitary lifestyle is disrupted when Janice, a vivacious
              young woman turns up unexpectedly at his front door. A beautiful
              chemistry develops. Janice brings life and vitality to Jason, something
              that was lost to him when he shut himself in. But it seems that Janice
              has a little secret and as with all secrets, it eventually unravels.
              <br> <br> [Intermission]
              <br> <br> 7. ELECTRONIC, I LOVE YOU / SEAN LI-WEN CHEONG / 20 MIN / 2008 / PG
              <br>A portrait of the accidental dissolution of human relationships,
              set against the backdrop of hollow, superficial and volatile electronic
              communication. Peggy (Neo Swee Lin), a lonely retiree hooked on
              American soap operas, has an introverted son, who suffers from social
              anxiety disorder. They live in the same house but exit in completely
              different realities that never converge.
              <br> <br> 8. IN OUR OWN WORDS / MELINDA TAN / 17 MIN / 2008 / PG
              <br>What is the definition of normality? Two young kidney patients go
              on a quest to challenge society’s perception of them. In the process,
              they discover their own ability to redefine what being normal is all
              about.
              <br> <br> 9. TAK DONG CHENG / SUFFIAN ZAINUDDIN / 36 MIN / 2008 / PG
              <br>Best Friends Jas and Farid are interested in learning lion dance.
              However, they face many obstacles and challenges while learning a
              different culture. In a multi-cultural country such as Singapore, will
              they be able to realize their dreams?

              <p>It's very near Funan. It's at 45 Armenian Street S(179936).</p>
              <p>There's a map on our website.</p>
              <p><br>More specifically, the place is near the OLD National Library (there's a stupid road tunnel there now) and near the National Museum.</p>
