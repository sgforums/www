"I used to be a happy girl", Mrs. Chan contemplates, while her daughter swallows audibly when her parents become emotional about their frustrations and feelings. Painful moments are alternated by disarming humour, both from the director and her parents.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (The Netherlands, 2008)<br>- De Balie Amsterdam (The Netherlands, 2007)<br><br>2) Health. Peace. Happiness. / Singapore / 2008 / 24 mins / Cecilia Lee / PG<br><br>Mdm. Tan and Mdm. Soon have something in common: both are suffering from a relapse of cancer and they have around 3 months to live. But their similarities end there. Despite having intertwining lives, they cope with different issues. Soon struggles with her inner turmoil of suffering from a terminal illness and her impending death while Tan fears her family cannot cope when she dies. This documentary explores the story of these two friends and how they spend their last days in a hospice.<br><br>3) Downstairs / Singapore / 2008 / 18 mins / Diya Tan / PG<br><br>"Downstairs" is a colloquial and affectionate term used by many when referring to the areas below their public housing blocks. Unfolding over a 24hr period, the documentary marries colourful visuals with an audio collage to tell the personal stories of its users. With random and diverse profiles as supporting cast to the protagonist - the film shares anecdotes of community, love, dreams and memories, featuring heartwarming and candid displays of human interaction, sometimes tinged with innocent humour, showing how a space is not just a space but something that is full of life. With 80% of the Singaporean population living in public housing flats, "Downstairs" is a peek into the nation's culture and identity.</p>

Over the course of 66 days and nights, the film follows the girls in one of the IDF’s most rigorous combat courses and looks at the relationships that develop between girls in an environment subject to strict military code. The film reveals the mechanism that enables the transformation of 18-year-old girls from daddy's little girls into fierce disciplined soldiers. Through the intimate relationship that develops between the director and one of the characters, questions about identity, sexuality and the discovery of femininity surface.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- Les Rencontres internationales du documentaire de Montréal (Canada, 2008 - Doctape Award and Special Jury Mention)<br>- International Women's Film Festival Dortmund (Germany, 2008 - Official Selection)<br>- The 20th Anniversary New York LGBT Film Festival (USA, 2008 - In Competition)<br><br><strong>Seeds of Summer - Trailer<br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y8BUK6VYy4<br></strong><br>Supported by the Embassy of Israel<br><br> <br><br><strong>SPECIAL SCREENING</strong><br><br>For this special screening, The Substation will donate 50% of the proceeds to the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations' (SCWO) initiative, The Star Shelter.<br><br>3:30pm to 5pm / The Substation Theatre / 89 mins total / $35 (50% of proceeds will go to The Star Shelter /<br><br><strong>1) We Want Roses Too / Italy / 2007 / 89 mins / Alina Marazzi / R21 (Nudity and Sexual References)</strong><br><br>“Vogliamo Anche Le Rose” (We Want Roses Too) is an award-winning film that portrays the revolutionary changes brought on by the sexual revolution and the feminist movement in Italy during the 1960s and 1970s. It is an amazing technicolor spectacle that documents the shared feelings of the feminist movement: that women could no longer support a society based on the patriarchal family, on the power of "husbands" and on the supremacy of males, which requires women to be efficient mothers, obedient wives and virtuous daughters. It is a celebration of advancement and progress in the area of women’s rights and the feminist movement.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- 60th Locarno Film Festival (Switzerland)<br>- International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (The Netherlands, 2007)<br>- 25th Torino Film Festival (Italy)<br><strong><br>We Want Roses Too - Trailer<br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03PBkOyVcig</strong><br><br>About SCWO:<br>The Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO) is the national coordinating body of women's organisations in Singapore and is represented on various Government and inter-ministry committees, contributing views in the areas of family, women and on children's issues.

Largely structured around Murakami’s enigmatic absence, the film dramatises Murakami’s impact on his readers and takes the camera into the hinterland to determine what is “Murakamian” in the Japanese landscape. The resulting film has a beautiful sense of discovery about it, of going where it will and sharing its surprises with us; and at the same time (making a superb example of the genre) this openness and curiosity on the part of the filmmaker is shown to be not incompatible with a vigorous sense of form and poetic structure.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- Copenhagen International Documentary Festival (Denmark, 2007)<br>- Doku.Arts (Germany, 2008)<br><br><strong>Dinner with Murakami - Trailer<br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foX09vleMZU</strong></p>

              <p><strong>SATURDAY 14 MARCH : China Indie Doc Focus</strong><br><br>China is rising into world power and is developing at an unprecedented pace in a bid to catch up with the rest of the developed nations. The giant People's Republic of China is changing, from closed-door communism to an open embrace of economic capitalism. Teething problems abound and the disharmonious undercurrents of social change on the ground are hardly the topics of choice to be put up for discussion by the ruling government.<br><br>Let these indie docs shed some light and show what the man on the street in China is facing as national development intrudes into their lives.<br><br>Curated by Paul Pickowicz.<br><br><strong>SESSION 1<br><br>1:30pm to 3:30pm / The Substation Theatre / 122 mins total / $7 &amp; $5 (conc.)<br></strong><br><strong>1) Who Killed Our Children? / China / 2008 / 92 mins / Pan Jianlin &amp; Zhang Lei / NC16 (Some Coarse Language)</strong><br><br>The 2008 Sichuan earthquake was one of the deadliest earthquakes China has ever experienced. Measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale, the earthquake caused massive devastation in the rural communities and toppled mostly school buildings. A terrible body count thought to be caused by the natural disaster turned out to be largely influenced by man-made factors. "Who Killed Our Children" brings us into the epicentre of the Muyu District in Qingchuan County, the site of one of the disaster's biggest tragedies, to look at the details of the collapse of the Muyu Middle School dormitory.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- Pusan International Film Festival (South Korea, 2008)<br>- Beijing International Film Festival (China, 2008)<br><br> <br><br><strong>SESSION 2<br><br>4pm to 6:30pm / The Substation Theatre / 138 mins total / $7 &amp; $5 (conc.)<br></strong><br><strong>1) Care and Love / China / 2008 / 108 mins / Ai Xiaoming / PG (some disturbing scenes)<br></strong><br>Care and Love draws its inspiration from 'Investigation of AIDS in Xingtai', an article by Wang Keqin, senior China Economic Times journalist. The documentary tells the story of Liu Xianhong, a villager who contracted HIV through a blood transfusion during childbirth, and how she publicized her story, filed a lawsuit with her 8-year-old son against the hospital, and eventually received compensation. The bitter experiences of several families, and the collective effort by people living with HIV to defend their rights, resulted in the 'Care Group'.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- 5th Verzio International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival (Hungary, 2008)<br><br><strong>SESSION 3<br><br>7:15pm to 9:45pm / The Substation Theatre/ 144 mins total / $7 &amp; $5 (conc.)</strong><br><br><strong>1)Readymade / China / 2008 / 81 mins / Zhang Bingjian / Chinese with English subtitles / PG<br></strong><br>Mao Zedong, the major founder and leader of the People's Republic and Communist Party of China, died 32 years ago. This is a documentary about two ordinary individuals who have a physical likeness to Mao and choose to be his impersonators. As a result, their life and destiny have changed ever since…<br><br>The first individual is a farmer named Peng Tian who came from the same hometown as Mao Zedong. His dream is to impersonate Mao on the big screen. Wearing Mao's suit, he decides to study acting in Beijing Film Academy with the support of his family…<br><br>The second individual is a housewife, Chen Yan, who was born in Mian Yang of Sichuan Province. Twenty years ago, her mother discovered her similarity. Being a woman, it was considered a taboo to play Mao who was viewed as a God in the past. But would she be happy if she gave it a try in this new millennium?<br><br><strong>2) Starkers, the Naked Life of Qin Yongjian / China / 2007 / 33 mins / Gu Tao / R21 (Nudity)</strong><br><br>Qin Yongjian's dream is to one day be an actor. However, he has yet to make any inroads in the industry. Instead, he works as a male nude model in Beijing. A man obsessed with the body, Yongjian spends his days being painted and photographed. In this way he is able to not only perform, but receive the attention he craves. But being a male nude model in traditional China is not an easy task. Fang Min, a female nude model and friend, helps to steer Yongjian out of trouble. As Yongjian's behaviour becomes more excessive, those around him begin to wonder whether he has lost his mind.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- Southern Appalachian International Film Festival (USA, 2008)<br><br><strong>Starkers, the Naked Life of Qin Yongjian - Trailer <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdXZC_-J68U<br></strong><br><br><strong>SUNDAY 15 MARCH : Underneath the Radar</strong><br><br>Underneath the Radar (UTR) presents a collection of hope, dreams and observations of our globalized reality. This segment curated for the Singapore Indie Doc Fest, trains its eye on the process of our interconnected world. The documentaries range from micro to macro phenomenon; the factory worker, the strawberry exporter, a community seeking clean water and the promise of a global healthcare system. Their tales unravel in 7 well-traveled documentaries set to make their debut here, together with a selection of local shorts.<br><br><strong>SESSION 1<br><br>11:30am to 1pm / The Substation Theatre / 86 mins total / $7 &amp; $5 (conc.)<br></strong><br>With a pre-show screening of Reel Rev shorts<br><br><strong>1) China Blue / USA &amp; China / 2005 / 86 mins / Micha Peled<br></strong><br>A poignant journey inside a blue-jeans factory, where the working conditions that Jasmine and her teenage friends must endure are harsh beyond imagination. They are also unlawful by international standards, and tensions in the factory are running high. So when the factory owner strikes a deal with a Western client and demands around-the-clock production to meet the deadline, a confrontation becomes inevitable. Shot clandestinely in China under difficult conditions, this is a deep-access account of what both China and the international retail companies don’t want us to see — how the clothes we buy are actually made.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (The Netherlands, 2005 Amnesty Human Rights Award)<br>- Toronto International Film Festival (Canada, 2005 - Official Selection)<br>- San Francisco International Asiam American Film Festival (USA, 2006)<br><br><strong>China Blue - Trailer<br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0yfNOkBClI&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=7CC8561AFABB77F7&amp;playnext=1&amp;index=13<br></strong><br><strong>SESSION 2<br><br>2:30pm to 3:30pm / The Substation Theatre / 60 mins total / $7 &amp; $5 (conc.)<br></strong><br>With a pre-show screening of Reel Rev shorts<br><br><strong>1) Strawberry Fields / Israel / 2004 / 60 mins / Ayelet Heller<br></strong><br>A story about hope, frustration, occupation, globalisation and politics, and at its centre is a small red fruit. The film trains the camera on the strawberries and those who are charged with nurturing the seedlings in the Gaza Strip until they go through Israel, en route to their destination in European markets. In this fateful year in Gaza, the film crew documented the agricultural cycle of the fruit as well as the political events that directly affected the lives of the farmers who cultivate it. From the strawberry fields of Beit Lahiya, we witness the Disengagement, the withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza and its re-entry after two months; the Hamas victory in the Palestinian elections and the closure that followed.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- Rehovot Women's Film Festival (Israel, 2006)<br>- Hot Docs Film Festival (Canada, 2007)<br>- Edinburgh International Film Festival (UK, 2007)<br><br> <br><br><strong>SESSION 3<br><br>5pm to 6:30pm / The Substation Theatre / 60 mins total / $7 &amp; $5 (conc.)<br></strong><br>With a pre-show screening of Reel Rev shorts<br><br><strong>1) 1000 Days and a Dream / India / 2006 / 77 mins / P. Baburaj &amp; C. Saratchandran / PG<br></strong><br>After opening to great acclaim for bringing jobs and development to rural Kerala, local community members began to see a darker side of the neighboring Coca-Cola bottling plant as their water supply began to show signs of contamination and depletion. Despite ridicule and dismissive attitudes, local citizens fought to bring their message to the outside world as they went up against politicians, state police and corporations to protect their lands and children from the dangers brought by the plant. Touching on issues of environmentalism, globalization and grassroots activism, this film is a testament to the perseverance of dedicated individuals attempting to effect change in their community.</p>

Filmed in The Gambia, rural South Africa, coastal villages of Honduras and river settlements in the Amazon, ¡Salud! reveals the human dimension of the worldwide health crisis, and the central role of international co-operation in addressing glaring inequalities. Examining the curious case of Cuba, a cash-strapped country with what the BBC calls ‘one of the world’s best health systems.’ ¡Salud! invites us to explore new paths to making health a global birthright, wiping out the diseases of poverty.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- Los Angeles Pan African Film and Arts Festival (USA, 2007 - Audience Choice Award)<br>- 40th WorldFest - Houston International Film &amp; Video Festival (USA, 2007 - Bronze Remi Award)<br>- Tricontinental Film Festival (South Africa, 2007)<br><br> <br><br>Pre-show screening of Reel Rev shorts<br><br>Reel Revolution is a programme presented by The Substation that aims to nurture and instill greater involvement of youths in civil society through a series of 4 min long video essays or documentaries.<br><br>A series of selected works from the 2007 and 2008 Reel Revolution entries will be screened before each film.<br><br><strong>1) Trouncing Terrorism: A Guide to Saving Yourself and the Nation (2008) made by Daryl John Ho, Miki Sim, Melvin Chen &amp; Mak Mei See</strong><br><br>As a result of the spectacular escape of terrorist mastermind Mas Selamat bin Kastari, the atmosphere in Singapore was filled with a dialectical force of comedy and fear. It was in such an environment that Trouncing Terrorism was conceived. Filled with tongue-in-cheek humor, the filmmakers sought to promote an active citizenship that would not only critically evaluate our nation’s “instructional video” way of public policy, but also have the courage to stand up to threats such as terrorism.<br><br><strong>2) Asean Silence (2007) made by Rachel Chan &amp; Alvin Lim Lian Hao</strong><br><br>On 19 June, 2007, Aung San Suu Kyi spent her 62nd birthday in detention. In July this year, she will have spent a total of 20 years in detention since her arrest back in July, 1989. Despite economic progress across ASEAN nations, human rights violations such as Aung San Suu Kyi's case remained out of sight and unaddressed.<br><strong><br>3) Abstinence (2007) made by Seelan Palay, Zianti Ismail, Gabrielle-Anne Seet and Jason Lee</strong><br><br>A dialogue exploring human rights and Asian values.<br><br><strong>4) My Singapore, My Home (2008) made by Loke Shen Fai &amp; Ron Nguyen</strong><br><br>We know that there are many homeless people in our world. Through movies, television and books, we know they exist from the streets of New York to the slums of India and from tales such as Oliver Twist. However, most Singaporeans take for granted that the homeless no longer exist anymore on our modern shores. In essence, “My Singapore, My Home” leads us to be aware of those still left behind in the wake of Singapore’s economic progress. This is all the more poignant now as we are presently in the midst of Singapore’s economic recession.<br><br><strong>5) Pay/Repay (2008) made by Tan Shin Yee, Tan Shin Yin, Eva Wong, Tan Min Yen<br></strong><br>"In Pay/Repay, we want to tackle global issues* that are going on right now mainly due to humans' ignorance and distorted mindset. (*Issues such as food crisis, global warming, extinction… etc.) Most issues are not something new. They have been around for decades. But are we doing the right things to help? Have we neglected the small little things that we do daily that have a massive impact on the environment? We want to show the importance of individuals to start "doing" or "not-doing" something that can make a difference."<br><br> <br><br>About Underneath The Radar:<br><br>Underneath the Radar (UTR), debuted in 2006, as a series of screenings featuring independent documentaries on contemporary social injustices faced by people around the world.

What is racial consciousness and how, as individuals, can we define our ethnic identity? "Identity" can only be recognized where there is a difference. How do we define who does and who does not belong to a nation? Are we competent to racially identify others or is our racial identity something that we can define by ourselves?

As a soldier in the Israeli army reserves, Alpha Company, Berman had unparalleled access and filmed the soldiers as they went about their military service day and night. Crossing over the Palestinian border, the camera captured the soldiers every movement from the frenetic night-time house arrests to the quiet moments of self reflection and despair. Capturing the humiliation of both the Palestinians who are subject to the house arrests as well as the Israeli soldiers who had to carry them out, this documentary is the unique story of those who have to drop their normal lives and spend 30 days every year, under the guise of the olive green uniform, to perform the toughest, most unsettling tasks, in the heart of an urban warzone.<br><br>Screenings and Awards:<br>- Zagreb Film Festival (Croatia, 2007 - Best Documentary)<br>- Entre Vues, Belfort International Film Festival (France, 2007)<br>- DocPoint Documentary Film Festival (Finland, 2008)<br><strong><br>The Alpha Diaries - Trailer <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaFGfWskLPE</strong></p>
