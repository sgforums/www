              <p><span style="color: #666699;">The Great Singapore Sale (GSS) is upon us again, and who better than our very 
              own style icons to let us in on the best deals on the hottest threads this 
              season. Here, five style icons show us their picks from the hottest boutiques 
              and high street stores that are participating in this year’s GSS. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">The Shoo-In</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br></span><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Who: Marie 
              Choo</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br></span><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Where: River Island</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"> (#02-24/25/26 Raffles City 
              Shopping Centre, 252 North Bridge Rd., 6336-8722). 50 percent discount 
              storewide.<br>“Fashion and shopping are my forte,” says Marie Choo, Director of 
              consultancy firm Alchemy Consultancy. The spunky looker is one of the people 
              responsible for the highly touted Belvedere Beat series of parties that was held 
              here last month. She’s also a favorite with magazine editors who occasionally 
              feature her in their stories for her bold sense of style. “Beauty is in the 
              details, and it’s worth spending to achieve that, especially on accessories like 
              shoes and bags,” she tell us. “If you buy from high-street labels like River 
              Island, make that outfit truly yours by accessorizing it so that you stand out 
              from the crowd and not be afraid of bumping into someone wearing that same dress 
              or top.” </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Marie’s GSS Picks: </span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br></span><strong><span style="color: #666699;">1. “I love little details 
              like this brooch that comes with this dress. And the clothes here are full of 
              little surprises.”</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Turquoise block dress with flower detail brooch, 
              $50 (after 50 percent discount)</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">2. “Doesn’t this look something from Dolce &amp; Gabbana? Just pair 
              it with some accessories and you’re good to go.”</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Leopard print 
              chiffon dress, $75 (after 50 percent discount)</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">3. “Although I’m a designer footwear type of girl, details like these

              (after 50 percent discount)</span></p>

              crop, Henne Mercer, Marketing Director of Toni &amp; Guy, certainly stands out 
              from the crowd. With her finger on the pulse on what’s hot on the hairstyle 
              front, the fashionably dressed Henne is a regular fixture on the front rows of 
              fashion shows here. “I think you should always browse around first to view 
              what’s available and think about what you need so that if something really 
              catches your eye, then you can buy it and not regret later,” Henne shares her 
              shopping tip with us. “Invest in great accessories—you can dress up any outfit 
              with them. You should also look out for more vintage pieces and you can mix them 
              up with modern items. Just be creative!” </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Henne’s GSS Picks: <br>1. “This is a great classic piece which you 
              can wear to work. Just add different accessories to create different looks from

              This former head honcho of marketing communications company Style Asia has since 
              struck out on his own after a one and a half year sabbatical in Japan; and is 
              currently consulting for Eric Khoo’s Zhao Wei Films and Puma. “Sale period is 
              great to buy things that you wouldn’t normally buy or wear,” he says. “As prices 
              are marked down, it’s a good opportunity to experiment with new looks and 
              colours.” </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Hideki's GSS Picks: <br>1. “Knitwear is definitely in this season and 
              you should invest in good quality ones. Look out for vest and cardigans in light 
              fabrics. You wouldn’t want to work out a sweat wearing heavy knit ones 
              here.”</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Daniele Fiesoli polo T-shirt and vest, $169 and $186

              Tjin Lee, managing director of Mercury Marketing &amp; Communications, a 
              boutique events management and public relations agency, is the force who puts 
              together countless fashion events, like the recently concluded Audi Fashion 
              Festival, which saw a stellar line-up of international designers like Gareth 
              Pugh and Vivienne Westwood. Lee says: “Invest in classic items that never date. 
              Seriously—last season’s Ray Bans look like next season’s Ray Bans. I have a 
              black dress from Donna Karan that is as current today as when I bought it 10 
              years ago!”  </span></p>

              and worn by many celebrities such as Zoe Tay, Junita Simon and singer Stefanie 
              Sun. <br>Png says of shopping during the sale period: “Singaporeans roughly know 
              when a sale like GSS is going to happen; and to beat the queues, try what you 
              like beforehand so that when it’s sale time, you can just ask for your size and 
              pay without all the hassle.” </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Keith’s GSS Picks: <br>1. “The number of details on this shirt alone 
              justifies the price. And the cut is perfect for Asian 
              men.”</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Long-sleeved shirt by Junk De Luxe, $139 (after 30 percent

              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">2. “This jacket is good for an all summer place like Singapore 
              because of the half-lining inside. As for the T-shirt, I’m just obsessed with 
              polka dots!”</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Filippa K navy sport jacket and polka dot T-shirt, $510

              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Shop Savvy</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Here are some tips to make your outings a 
              success and probably save you a pretty penny.<br></span><strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>1) Do Your 
              Research</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Doing your research on your favourite stores can help you 
              save that bit while still keeping in line with the latest trends. Do familiarize 
              yourself with the sales period for the different stores. <br>—Being a VIP member 
              for certain stores lets you be the first to know when sales start. Club 21 has 
              regular fashion news and sales preview mailer, simply sign up to be the first to 
              be in the know. <br>—Keep your eye out for newspaper advertisements for sales 
              from the bigger stores. <br>—It is always wise to check for credit card 
              privileges before going on a shopping spree.<br></span><strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>2) Set a Shopping 
              Budget</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Before hitting town, create a realistic shopping budget. Know 
              how much you can splurge after factoring out your bills. Decide how much you 
              want to set aside and always stick to what you need rather than what you want. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">3) Go for Classics</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Always remember the rule of thumb: 
              Fads fade, but class is eternal. Choose colours that would never go out of 
              season. Creams and dark shades are classic choices, but for that extra edge, 
              inject one or two pieces with bold prints or electric colours. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">4) Get the Right Fit</span></strong><span style="color: #666699;"><br>Select cuts that would flatter you. 
              Opt for pieces that highlight your silhouette. An embellished belt would help 
              define your waistline while giving a kick to an otherwise drab tunic top.—Andrea
