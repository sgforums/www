              <p><strong>Japan picks "schoolgirl" among cute ambassadors</strong></p>
              <p>By Isabel Reynolds</p>
              <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Ever seen an ambassador dressed from head to foot in pastel frills? How about a diplomatic envoy in a mini-skirted school uniform?</p>
              <img src="http://sg.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090314/20090314_020306_1.jpg" alt="">
              <p><br><br>In a bid to raise its international profile, Tokyo has appointed three young women as cultural envoys because they represent Japan's long-running craze for all things cute.</p>
              <p>Inspired by the characters in Japan's distinctive "anime" animated films and "manga" cartoon books, one of the new ambassadors dresses as a schoolgirl, another as a Victorian doll in voluminous frilly skirts.</p>
              <p>The third of the women, presented at a news conference on Thursday, was a singer dressed in a polka dot shirt with a bunny print, offset by bouffant back-combed hair, a look that has made her a fashion leader in Tokyo teens' favourite haunt, Harajuku.</p>
              <p>Japan wants to exploit the popularity of the "kawaii" (cute) culture, which has influenced young people in Asia and Europe.</p>
              <p>"It's all about mutual understanding," said Tsutomu Nakagawa, the head of the cultural affairs division at the Foreign Ministry, after presenting the three envoys to the foreign media.</p>
              <p>"We want people abroad to know these kind of people exist in Japan and to feel close to them."</p>
              <p>Faced with the prospect of being overtaken in both economic and military might by giant neighbour China, Japan has been making concerted efforts to boost its "soft power," a strategy that analysts see as important.</p>
              <p>"You get people to love your culture and use that as a way of gaining power around the world," said Phil Deans, professor of international relations at Temple University's Tokyo campus.</p>
              <p>"America has a lot of soft power, because people like American culture."</p>
              <p>But these ambassadors, whose role will be to speak at cultural events such as a Japan Expo to be held in Paris in July, may have narrower appeal than Hollywood movie stars.</p>
              <p>The envoys, chosen for the clothes they choose to wear in their everyday lives, said they believed their styles would last.</p>
              <p>"Every female from small girls to grandmothers loves pretty clothes," said nurse and part-time model Misako Aoki, now ambassador for the doll-like "Gothic Lolita" style.</p>
              <p>"I think I can continue to dress like this all my life. Age has nothing to do with it."</p>
              <p>Actress Shizuka Fujioka, 19, wears a school uniform even though she's graduated because she felt she missed out by going to a school with an ugly uniform.</p>
              <p>The appointment of the three envoys comes a year after Doraemon, a rotund blue cartoon cat with no ears, was named a special ambassador.</p>
              <p>While serving as foreign minister, manga fan Prime Minister Taro Aso also launched an international prize for the genre.</p>
              <p>"Whether this is a strategy on which the world's second largest economy can base its diplomacy, I have yet to be convinced," said Temple University's Deans.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Three female ‘‘pop culture addressers’’ popularly called ‘‘Kawaii (pretty) 
              ambassadors’’ appointed by the Foreign Ministry have started traveling abroad to 
              introduce Japanese pop culture to young people in other 
              countries.<br><br>Shizuka Fujioka, an entertainer called a ‘‘magician clothing 
              coordinator’’ because of her high school uniform-like fashion, took part in an 
              event in Thailand in March, and two other girls will go to Paris in 
              July.<br><br>Fujioka, clad in a school uniform, appeared in the ‘‘Japan 
              Festival’’ held in Bangkok and advised local girls on dressing. A young Thai 
              woman who visited the festival told her, ‘‘You look very pretty in the uniform. 
              I would like to go to Japan.’’<br><br>In Thailand, school uniforms are in vogue 
              thanks to a Japanese animated cartoon about a school campus. In front of the 
              festival site, photographers sat on front seats, showing the mass media’s strong 
              interest.<br><br>Misako Aoki, a Lolita-affiliated fashion model emphasizing 
              tastes of a little girl, and vocalist Yu Kimura, known as a dresser of several 
              layers of old clothing, will be sent to Paris to promote the ‘‘Japan Expo’’ from 
              July 2 to 5.<br><br>In France, many young people are fascinated with Japanese 
              animated cartoons and dress-up. Visitors to the event are expected to top last 
              year’s total of more than 100,000.<br><br>To help familiarize foreigners with 
              Japan, the Foreign Ministry has been promoting exchange projects through 
              traditional Japanese culture and art such as kabuki and noh plays.<br><br>The 
              ministry has also focused its attention on the fact that Japanese pop culture, 
              such as comics and animated cartoons, are catching the fancy of people across 
              the world. It thought it important to target young people and chose the three 
              women as ‘‘flag people’’ in February.<br><br>When Prime Minister Taro Aso, a 
              self-styled ‘‘cartoon freak,’’ was foreign minister, he promoted ‘‘pop culture 
              diplomacy’’ by creating an international cartoon prize.<br><br>But some people 
              are raising eyebrows over the new attempt using ‘‘kawaii’’ as a test word. Kaori 
              Maruya, a New Komeito party member of the House of Representatives, said at a 
              meeting of the house’s Foreign Affairs Committee on April 24, ‘‘I’d like you to 
              be careful about unwarranted criticism against overseas tours by ‘pretty 
              ambassadors’ wearing very short skirts.’’<br><br>Kenjiro Monji, head of the 
              Public Diplomacy Department at the Foreign Ministry, replied, ‘‘It’s important 
              to be accepted by host countries. We’ll try to effectively carry out the project 
              by taking the local situations into account.’’<br><br>Fujioka said, ‘‘I think it 
              will be in Japan’s national interest if there is at least one person in the host 
              country who thinks I’m pretty.’’</span></p>
