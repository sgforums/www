              <p>Gone are the days of the bowl cut and assimilating to other ethnic <a href="http://www.askmen.com/fashion/keywords/mens-hairstyles.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">men's hairstyles</span></span></a>. When it comes to great hair, Asian men have some of the most versatile sets of locks around. Thanks in large part to its characteristically thick, ultra-straight texture, Asian hair lends itself to today’s most stylish haircuts, even setting the trend in some cases. <br><br>If you’re of Asian descent, you should know that your hair is very porous, so it can absorb more moisture and hold different styles. If you’re not happy with your hair, then you’re not tapping into its full potential. So, to put you on the fast track to a new modern look that suits who you are, here’s a list of six super-sharp haircuts that will really play to your advantage.</p>
              <h3><img class="right" title="Mark Dacascos - Credit: Images.Scrippsweb.com" src="http://images.askmen.com/fashion/fashiontip_300/322c_fashion_advice.jpg" border="0" alt="Mark Dacascos - Credit: Images.Scrippsweb.com" width="150" height="150">The total shave</h3>
              <p>Asian guys (or any guys, really) with a bald head make a bold statement. Whether you need to do it or not, taking it all off the top shows you’re a man of true grit and determination; you exude <a href="http://sgforums.com/money/body_and_mind_60/77_better_living.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">confidence</span></span></a> and class. Being bald looks so tough, Mark Dacascos dons it for his role as the Chairman on<em> Iron Chef America</em>; it allows him to be both smooth as steel and tough as nails. If you want to set that tone, then make the decision to go bald; it’s the perfect look for the take-charge guy who wants to come across as sharp, confident and sophisticated. Bald-headed men command respect and a style all their own. What makes this look even better is the fact that a lot of chicks dig it.<br><br><strong>What it says about you: </strong>You’re on top of your game, you know who you are and you’re not afraid to show it.</p>
              <h3><img class="right" title="Daniel Dae Kim - Credit: IMDB.com" src="http://images.askmen.com/fashion/fashiontip_300/322d_fashion_advice.jpg" border="0" alt="Daniel Dae Kim - Credit: IMDB.com" width="150" height="150">Textured short</h3>
              <p>Traditionally, short hair can be a bore, but adding texture makes it classically cool. Due to their simplicity, textured short haircuts are spot-on for guys who like to walk one step beyond conservative. Sporting this ‘do makes it abundantly clear that you have a crisp, <a href="http://sgforums.com/fashion/fashiontip_250/256_fashion_advice.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">professional image</span></span></a> to maintain. You know what it means to be in style without going overboard. Textured short hair looks timeless and sophisticated. No one proves this point more than <em>Lost</em>’s Daniel Dae Kim; his well-maintained coif affirms his cosmopolitan, erudite disposition toward style. Kim’s not trying to push the envelope anymore than he has to because he doesn’t <em>need</em> to; his stylish, grown-up haircut says it all for him. And for the consummate professional, you should let this haircut do the same for you.<br><br><strong>What it says about you: </strong>Steeped in traditional, classic style, you have a mature approach to fashion that translates into an air of confidence, class and simplicity.</p>
              <h3><img class="right" title="Jason Tobin - Credit: IMDB.com" src="http://images.askmen.com/fashion/fashiontip_300/322e_fashion_advice.jpg" border="0" alt="Jason Tobin - Credit: IMDB.com" width="150" height="150">Razored shag</h3>
              <p>We do learn from the past, and the razored shag proves it. Though no one’s had one in years, consider this hairstyle a modern twist on the outdated bowl cut. But just because it’s based on an old-school style, doesn’t mean it’s lame. Actually, this haircut speaks irreverence. Just look at Jason Tobin. He carries the uneven edges and tapered-down crop like a true badass. Inherent in the razored shag is cool demeanor and edgy sophistication; it’s urban, daring and borderline defiant. While the cut’s definitely a suave look for younger guys, it also works for more audacious professionals who maintain a dapper wardrobe.<br><br><strong>What it says about you: </strong>Self-assured and somewhat defiant, you know what it means to push the envelope, yet you stay slightly grounded in tradition.</p>
              <h3><img class="right" title="Aaron Yoo - Credit: IMDB.com" src="http://images.askmen.com/fashion/fashiontip_300/322f_fashion_advice.jpg" border="0" alt="Aaron Yoo - Credit: IMDB.com" width="150" height="150">Messy faux hawk</h3>
              <p>Want to walk on the cutting edge of fashion? Then work your hair up into a messy faux hawk. This look screams “style icon.” Worn mostly by younger guys who play by no one’s rules but their own, this hairstyle evokes big-city influence; it embodies downtown style and total attitude. Aaron Yoo, who stars in <em>Disturbia</em>, rocks the messy faux hawk like a true star. Meticulously disheveled, Yoo’s hairstyle proves he’s not afraid to be an individual; he’s free from the confines of tradition. With its over-the-top statement, the messy faux hawk makes a fast, fashion-forward claim by those sporting it.<br><br><strong>What it says about you:</strong> You're not afraid to defy conventional <a href="http://sgforums.com/fashion/fashiontip_200/218_fashion_advice.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">style</span></span></a> and to stand out in a crowd. You pride yourself on your unique style that keeps you on the outer edge of urban fashion.</p>
              <h3><img class="right" title="John Cho - Credit: IMDB.com" src="http://images.askmen.com/fashion/fashiontip_300/322g_fashion_advice.jpg" border="0" alt="John Cho - Credit: IMDB.com" width="150" height="150">Textured medium length</h3>
              <p><a href="http://sgforums.com/fashion/trends/21_fashion_men.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Casual</span></span></a> enough for everyday wear and smart enough for professional attire, this versatile look works for just about anyone. A textured medium-length haircut like John Cho’s demonstrates subtle sophistication -- tastefully understated is another way to put it. Ideal for today’s modest <a href="http://sgforums.com/daily/austin_150/160_fashion_style.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">modern man</span></span></a>, this haircut shows you’ve put thought into your style, yet it’s quietly refined so that you appear unassuming. The textured medium-length hairstyle transcends style boundaries, working well for the professional who wants to come across as a regular guy, an intelligent man and a charming individual all at once.<br><br><strong>What it says about you: </strong>You have an intricately simple approach to style; you like to be in vogue, but moderately so.</p>
              <h3><img class="right" title="Sung Kang - Credit: IMDB.com" src="http://images.askmen.com/fashion/fashiontip_300/322h_fashion_advice.jpg" border="0" alt="Sung Kang - Credit: IMDB.com" width="150" height="150">Layered shoulder length</h3>
              <p>For those who like a mainstream, preppy look, ask the barber to cut layers into your shoulder-length hair: You’ll look polished and put-together. Classically contemporary, this haircut indicates a playful, youthful zeal toward fashion. Take a look at Sung Kang, for example: He pulls this look off with perfection, proving that longer haircuts can be chic and masculine. When trying to achieve this look, use Kang as your guide. His well-groomed locks affirm his attentiveness to style, but the rigid edges make it clear that he’s not 100% “pretty boy.” That’s exactly the statement you want to make. Layered shoulder-length hair not only seems sharp and urbane, but also appears smooth and worldly. A style conveying a sophisticated paradox that works beautifully with a trendy, finished, up-to-the-minute wardrobe.<br><br><strong>What it says about you: </strong>You’re not afraid to make an investment in your style; you approach the world around you with a classic, up-tempo regard.</p>
