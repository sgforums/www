I wasn’t clear whether she meant my taste was low or she was complementing me. So I said ambiguously that I do not care much about the brand actually, and if my handbag’s too expensive it would make me feel uncomfortable. Ya Jun replied casually that a woman like me should have a designer handbag, and I noticed at that time she was carrying a Bally dermis handbag.<br><br>A woman like me? A brief summary would be: with some education, have gained some experiences, is making some money, but why should I have a designer handbag then? Regretted very much that I had not asked Ya Jun at that time what she meant exactly.<br><br>The Hong Kong beauty writer Shen Xue has told a story about designer handbag. Ellen, a 20 something urban single girl whose job is a cosmetics sales girl in a department store, saves most of her meager wages to buy designer handbags, “on average one designer handbag every two months”. Ellen is a very earthy girl and feels at ease under all circumstances except for her little designer handbag hobby. Designer handbag is her only “dignity dream”, and this pursuit of upper class life once led her out of the metropolis common people's world.<br><br>My female friends and colleagues either marries a good husband or getting high salary, some of them even get both the two, but very few of them would spend hundreds even thousands of dollars to buy a designer handbag for herself. This probably may own to China’s traditional virtue that one should manages a household with diligence and thrift; or maybe because they grows in the time before China’s economy soaring, thus they don’t have the expense desire; or because they have a happy family and succeed in their career pursuit and as a result do not need an expensive designer handbag to show off. In order to be a “high class” woman who is “tasteful and could afford designer handbags”, Shen Xue’s Ellen has to save every of her pennies so that she could buy 6 designer handbags in one year. However, my friends/colleagues who have received good education and have high salary probably would buy not one designer handbag in six years.<br><br>It’s a woman’s bounden duty to support the family with the money she earn, but if she has surplus budget, shall she buy a designer handbag such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Prada, Gucci, Hermes and so on? The following is several reasons I thought of.<br><br>First, life is short, in spare time of struggles, it is necessary to enjoy oneself. Take a stroll to the various brand chain-stores in Beverly Hills’ Rodeo Avenue, leisurely study this year’s latest popular designs, experience the fine work of famous brand goods and their designers’ creative ideas and taste, take your time, leisurely, casually, feeling the time and money flow quietly like river water from your hand, no matter how the neatly and immaculately dressed experienced and tactful sales person is busy serving around you and watching your every mood to guess whether you are going to buy or not, you just remain your composure, intend to enjoy the pleasure of high-end consumption.<br><br>Second, be properly kitsch in proper times. A designer handbag from a reputed brand can speak for you in many circles, especially in business circle and entertainment industry. A scholar tend to be aloof from worldly affairs, disdains to be a companion with the worldlings, and does not care about minor things like to carry which brand’s handbag; BUT a scholar has to join the worldlings to make a living, so it is necessary “to do in Rome as Rome does”, observe and learn the rules in the bustling human game, just take it out of politeness.<br><br>Third, a test of the relationship. The man who loves you will at least entice you to pick up something you like in a store and never say a word about the price although he doesn’t know which type of handbag suits you best. Never choose and marry a man who stops you from buying a handbag (and of course never choose and marry a woman who will buy a designer handbag at all costs.)<br><br>Fourth, diversified investment. Fashion magazine said, a designer handbag is a collector’s item, and if you choose the right one, it will rise in value just like a genuine antique and pieces of jewelry do. It is said that a 1972 Hermes alligator handbag in Hollywood's upscale second-hand clothes shops sells at least 2500 dollars. Besides real estates and stocks, designer handbag is women's patent investment item.<br><br>Fifth, once in a while you have to meet with friends like Ya Jun who is able to tell the brand at a casual glance and lay bare the truth and secret.<br>But in the final analysis, it is no fault that a woman invests own beauty, builds own style and buys a designer handbag she admires by her own ability.

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Can't decide which handbag to buy? Rent it first</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">SINGAPORE (AFP) - A Louis Vuitton bag, diamond-inlaid guitar, Gucci shades and a dog. Total cost? Less than 1,000 Singapore dollars (654 US). The catch is, you're only renting.</span> </p>
              <p> <img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090218/LV41.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Model from the new "Panama Flight Bag" collection by </em></span><a class="tag" href="/forums/2293/news/search.php?id_word=286"><em><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Louis Vuitton</span></em></a></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">As consumers scrimp to survive the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, Singaporeans are increasingly turning to Internet-based rental outlets to at least maintain their sense of style, business operators say. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Just like how local coffee shops can expect better business than restaurants in times of economic turmoil, I believe a guitar rental service would be much appreciated in these times," said Elaine Khoo, owner of Rent-A-Guitar.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Her online company offers electric and classical guitars of various makes as well as amplifiers and guitar accessories for just one dollar per item a day -- with a deposit, of course.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Although not yet able to provide figures, Khoo said she has been "pleasantly surprised" by the response to her service, and said the economic crisis partly inspired her to set up her business in February.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I see the economic gloom as an opportunity for me to promote a service in which customers pay a smaller amount to rent the guitar rather than buy," Khoo said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Another rental company that says it is doing well despite the gloomy economy is thatbagiwant.com, which allows trendy customers to rent luxury handbags and sunglasses at prices vastly lower than their retail cost.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Because of the recession, business has gotten better," said owner Tan Ho Ching, adding that fashion-conscious customers unsure about buying costly bags are now embracing his service to save money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The customer base for thatbagiwant.com more than doubled in the three months after Singapore, in October, became the first Asian economy to enter recession.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"People who were sitting on the fence are now trying it out, preserving their capital," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Dog-sharing service Easy Dogz has also seen more customers in recent weeks, according to owner Herbert Lim.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The service allows clients to take home breeds including golden retrievers and Jack Russells after paying rent of 30-50 dollars a day on top of a 100-dollar membership fee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The company has not been adversely affected by the economic downturn, said Lim, and have even received a boost after running ads in a local newspaper.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">More conventional rental services also say business continues to be brisk.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">DVD rental firm Homepal Private Limited said more people were signing up, with chief executive officer Eric Tham estimating a 10 percent rise in membership over the six months to February.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Homepal allows customers to rent DVDs over the Internet and delivers the movies to their homes by post. Members pay a monthly subscription fee and are allowed to keep the DVDs for as long as they want.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"There's more people staying at home. This is a form of entertainment that is affordable," said Tham.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Games rental company Red Sands Gamers Club also said it membership was up by more than 50 percent since Christmas, and owner Jeffire Yang said this was due to customers' cost-cutting measures during the holiday period.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I spoke to my customers. They said that they bought (games) consoles instead of travelling overseas (to save money)" which led to increased membership for Red Sand's games rental services, Yang said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Membership allows members to enjoy discounts on goods and services offered at Red Sands.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Even one of the major players in the local telecommunications market has rolled out a mobile phone plan that is similar to a rental scheme.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">MobileOne's Take3 programme allows customers to own new mobile phones at significantly lower prices after subscribing to any of its service plans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Customers have the option of swapping their phone for another after nine months for a fee, or do the swap at no cost after 20 months.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Under the programme, an LG KF900 Prada II phone would cost 201 Singapore dollars per month, against a purchase price of 1,288 dollars.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"They get to enjoy the use of the latest handsets without paying upfront cost. it is likely to be especially welcome in the current economic crisis," said Geraldine Lai, a spokeswoman for MobileOne.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It's different for Singaporeans with such deep pockets they can still rent an entire island -- and keep it all to themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Indonesian island resort Pulau Pangkil Kecil, accessible by boat from Singapore, can be rented for varying rates depending on the season -- from 2,600 Singapore dollars per night for one to ten people on a normal weekday to 4,500 dollars on selected public holidays when bookings are tight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The cost covers all meals and use of the island's facilities, which include nine luxury accommodations, a bar, swimming pool, speedboats and more than 20 staff, according to the island's website.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"It's the same as last year, which was one of our busiest years -- people still see us as very good value for money," said a company spokesman.by Philip Lim</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Nina Ricci launches its first line of bags</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">New ideas and new products are bursting out of the Nina Ricci fashion house. After the announcement that Peter Copping would be in charge of artistic direction, the Ricci house will be launching its first ever line of bags in May. Christened “Ondine” they will, for the moment, be available in four models. </span></p>
              <img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090428/nina-ricci-image.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><span style="color: #999999;"><em>A </em></span><em><span style="color: #808080;">Nina Ricci</span></em><em><span style="color: #999999;"> bag</span></em>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">“The label is subtly complementing the wardrobe of the Nina Ricci woman and is laying the foundations for a line that should expand in future seasons”, explained the label. From the incontrovertible shopping bag, to the hobo look, through to purses and evening bags, this line of leather goods picks up on the themes of a house with a long history, it being founded in 1932; for example, the twisted material which is reminiscent of the golden thread around a bottle of the ‘L’air du temps’ perfume. <br><br>Available in lambskin, calf-skin, alligator and bull skin as well as in a variety of colours, these four models will be available in Nina Ricci boutiques from the beginning of next month. <br><br>Prices start at €1000-1500 for some models but expect to pay between €6000 and €20,000 for alligator models. <br><br><em>By Jonathan Fulwell (Source: Sarah Ahssen)</em></span></p>
