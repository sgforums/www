              <div class="content">
              <p>Singapore’s most stylish people in the service industry show us the way to looking good. By <strong>Zaki Jufri</strong> and <strong>Terry Ong</strong>. Photography by <strong>Mark Lim</strong></p>
              <p>You’ve seen them around town—in stores, restaurants, salons and even hawker centers. They’ve most likely styled your hair, recommended you a rare record or that one-of-a-kind dress; and you probably wonder why most of them are so chic. There are the more than a handful of service staff who have their own unique and quirky sense of style. I-S susses out these X-factor dressers who simply look too cool for school.</p>

              <p>He wears shirt by Acne Jeans, jacket by Merci Beaucoup, self-made Lego bowtie, jeans by DSquared2, jeans accessory by Raf by Raf Simons and shoes from Journal Standard.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Describe your style</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div>
              <p>Two words—simple and fun.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Where do you get your fashion inspiration?</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>I’m always inspired by different cultures especially when I’m abroad. And the way people dress from all walks of life. </p>
              <p><strong>Is having style important in your line of work?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes—because customers tend to ask for our advice on current fashion trends, want tips and may even want us to dress them up. If the customer like the way you dress, they tend to turn to you for advice more frequently. And we represent a stylish boutique and the organization behind us.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think you care too much about your own style?</strong></p>
              <p>Of course I am about concerned how I look, but I’m definitely not dressing up just to get attention.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Style tip? </strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>There is no easy way out. Try out new things or colors that you don’t normally will. You never know what might break your boundaries.</p>

              <p>She wears shirt from Uniqlo, pants by Walter Van Beirendonck, belt from Cortefiel, vintage glasses and shoes by Dr. Martens.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Describe your style</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>I don’t have a specific style but I do come up with a daily fashion theme.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Where do you get your fashion inspiration?</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>From movies mostly. Like today, my theme is a pimp from the movie Taxi Driver. I actually wanted to wear suspenders with this outfit to complete the whole ’60s Detroit pimp look but my suspenders were too loose.</p>
              <p><strong>Is having style important in your line of work?</strong></p>
              <p>It’s not so much about having style. It’s just fun to dress up and come up with interesting outfits everyday. It’s all about celebrating one’s individuality and not following any trend.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think you care too much about your own style?</strong></p>
              <p>I don’t think so, but it depends on my mood. I could go out in torn jeans and bare feet for all I care.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Style tip? </strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>Just be yourself. Take a risk and discover new possibilities in what you can wear. Fashion is all about having fun.</p>

              <p><strong>Describe your style</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>Style? What style? Style is out of a fashion magazine.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Where do you get your fashion inspiration?</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>I don’t really care about fashion. I just wear what I want to wear.</p>
              <p><strong>Is having style important in your line of work?</strong></p>
              <p>Honestly, I don’t really bother about dressing up. Style only affects people who are superficial.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think you care too much about your own style? </strong></p>
              <p>I won’t say that I don’t care about how I look. I mean one has to look decent when he steps out of the house. As long as I think I look all right, that’s fine. Who cares about what other people think?</p>

              <p><strong>Style tip?</strong></p>

              <h3>Daryl Chan, 24, store manager, Know It Nothing</h3>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: middle; border: 0;" src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/450/marklim_stylishstaff03.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="450" height="692" align="middle"></p>
              <p>Amanda wears striped top and beaded necklace from TopShop, harem pants from a flea market, hat from Camden Market and brandless flip-flops. Daryl wears shirt by Nakkna, pants by Julian Red, belt by A Tail We Could Wag and shoes by Fred Perry.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Describe your style</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div>
              <p>Amanda: Colorful, quirky and easy.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Daryl: My style is an extension of who I am—I like to keep things simple and not too dramatic. It’s all about subtlety and the details.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Where do you get your fashion inspiration?</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>A: When I was a lot younger, I got my inspiration from Archie Comics. I used to try to dress up like Betty and Veronica but now it’s mostly fashion magazines like Nylon and Dazed &amp; Confused.</p>
              <p>D: My inspiration comes from anything and everything: From the movies I watch, the music I listen to and the things I see everyday. But the music I listen to when I’m getting dressed plays a big part as it sets the mood for what I’m going to wear for the day.</p>
              <p><strong>Is having style important in your line of work?</strong></p>
              <p>A: Definitely, because it sort of shows whether you’re an individual or a conformist. Being stylish and dressing well is a form of expression.</p>
              <p>D: It says a lot about who you are. Especially in a shop like this you need a certain style so that you look and play the part. I don’t want customers to think that I’m unreliable because I look too shabby.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think you care too much about your own style? </strong></p>
              <p>A: I think it’s all right to care about personal style but not to a point of being obsessive.</p>
              <p>D: It all depends on what day it is and what kind of mood I’m in. On weekdays, I’m dressed like this for work; Saturdays I’m slightly dressier; and it’s the casual dressed-down look for Sundays.</p>

              </div>

              <p>A: Tights are not pants.</p>
              </div>
              <p>D: Just be yourself but also know what type of look or outfit that you can carry off.</p>

              <p><strong>Where do you get your fashion inspiration?</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>From fashion magazine and websites. It’s all about the clothes that fit me and what I’m comfortable in. And it has to look good, of course.</p>
              <p><strong>Is having style important in your line of work?</strong></p>
              <p>Of course. I guess as a hairstylist, if I don’t look good it’s hard to convince people that I can make them look good.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think you care too much about your own style? </strong></p>
              <p>Yes I do. I’m very conscious of how I look.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Style tip? </strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>You have to be practical especially in Singapore. Overdressing kills, in particular when you wear things like scarves and neck warmers in a place like this.</p>

              </div>
              <p>My style is sexy, glamorous with lots of feathers and fishnets. It’s also a little bit couture. I design my own costumes which is couture in a way.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Where do you get your fashion inspiration?</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>I don’t really look at fashion magazines for ideas but rather through all the things we see around me—from shop windows to hardware stores.</p>
              <p><strong>Is having style important in your line of work?</strong></p>
              <p>If I don’t have style, I would look like some old hag or like some old wrench that someone dragged out of the Singapore River.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think you care too much about your own style?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes I do but I want to care about my own style much more. What I wish for is my own dressmaker or someone who can help me with my costumes because I have all these fabulous ideas.</p>

              <p><strong>Is having style important in your line of work?</strong></p>
              <p>No, I work in a hawker center. But I need to reflect the person that I am.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think you care too much about your own style?</strong></p>

              <p>Being in the fashion line, one is expected to dress well, and it reflects on your job. No one would take me seriously if I were not stylish.</p>

              <p>The trick is to accessorize, accessorize and accessorize. You can spruce up even a plain or dull looking jacket with a chunky necklace or interesting pants or leggings.</p>
