              <p>Two homegrown fashion maestros fuse fashion and technology for this 
              year’s Audi Fashion Festival. By <strong>Zaki Jufri </strong></p>
              <p>The bright runway lights, the oh-so-hot leggy models, the fabulous fashion 
              set all dressed to the nines—the fashion world will bring on its glitz and 
              glamour this month as the Lion City braces itself up for the <strong>Audi 
              Fashion Festival </strong>come Apr 28. Although you can expect a string of big 
              names from the likes of Roberto Cavalli, Dsquared2 and KTZ whose sartorial 
              threads will grace the catwalk, our own fashion heroes Ben Wu and Desmond Yang 
              have something up their sleeves as well. The pair has teamed up with Samsung to 
              create the Samsung Wave AFF ’10 Fashion Collection—a fashion collection of six 
              design creations, that complements the festival’s official phone. We caught up 
              with the two designers to find out more about their creations.</p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/506/Haute-Tech-Ben-Wu.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Can you elaborate on your creations? </strong><br><strong>Ben 
              Wu</strong>: My “Archetype” series was modeled after the diamond shapes that can 
              be found on the back and front of the Samsung Wave smart phone. In today’s 
              context, if we observe anyone who isn’t carrying a bag, purse or carrier in 
              their hand, it is very likely that they’re carrying a mobile phone. Hence, I 
              wanted my creation to be an amplified work of art that is stylish, practical, 
              meaningful and most importantly, original. <br><strong>Desmond Yang</strong>: My 
              key inspiration for “Wings—Take Flight” was taken from the concept of birds 
              flying, and of how birds spread their wings to take flight and soar to greater 
              heights.</p>
              <p><strong>Are you guys tech junkies? What’s one gadget you can’t live 
              without?</strong><br><strong>BW</strong>: Yes, I have always been a keen early 
              adopter, whether it is a mobile handheld or any device. Ever since owning the 
              first generation PDA phone, I have never looked back since and have moved on to 
              using smart phones. <br><strong>DY</strong>: Definitely the mobile phone, 
              because these days, I cannot imagine getting by without one. All my contacts of 
              everyone I know are stored in it, and I will be so lost without it.</p>
              <p><strong>How did you begin this project: Fusing fashion and technology? What 
              kind of research did you do?</strong><br><strong>BW</strong>: As I wanted my 
              designs to center on human behavior, I did quite a bit of investigation of 
              mobile users’ actions. Furthermore, my research is meant to focus beyond the 
              mobile user’s needs. As 3D HDTV is essentially a home entertainment device, I 
              designed a 3D eyewear that is not just a fashion statement but one that rocks 
              everyone in the family. The result is “Baby Boomer”—a retro-inspired frame, 
              updated with modern contemporary materials that houses all the mechanics 
              required for its function. <br><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/506/Desmond-Yang-6659.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">DY</strong>: Today, more than ever, fashion has become part of our 
              daily life. And this is why I designed Wave-inspired accessories that will make 
              fashion statements and yet remain useful and functional. I had based my research 
              on the word “wave,” as inspired by Samsung Wave, and utilized the concept of 
              wings for my designs.</p>
              <p><strong>What are some of the challenges you 
              encountered?</strong><br><strong>BW</strong>: I had difficulties searching for 
              the materials needed for the creations. In the end, I had to source for the 
              fabrics from overseas. Also, I spent quite some time to produce the sketch for 
              the 3D eyewear as I had to use the 3D modeling software to do so. 
              <br><strong>DY</strong>: The challenges were mostly deadline issues, because we 
              were only given one month to execute the design and production of the prototypes 
              for the “Wings—Take Flight” series. All the pieces are painstakingly 
              hand-crafted and that is why the production takes a longer time as well.</p>
