              <h1>Bra fitting guide</h1>
              <p>Finding the right size bra is often a trouble for many women; estimates are that about 80% of women wear the wrong size bra. This is not healthy for your breasts - especially if breasts are in too tight a bra.</p>
              <p>Let your breasts have free time from bras daily - it's best to have spend more than 12 hours of your day bra-free. This will help the lymph flow inside your breasts. And when choosing a bra, try get yourself fitted by a professional.</p>
              <p>A part of these bra fitting tips below have been submitted to us by a professional bra fitter.</p>
              <h2>What to know about getting a bra fitting:</h2>
              <ol>
              <li>The band size (or chest size) is the number part of your bra size. The cup size is the letter part. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">EX:</span> if you are in a 36 B, then 36 is the band and B is the cup. </li>
              <li>You are not going to get as good of a measurement as someone else would by measuring yourself. Let someone else measure you. </li>
              <li>A measurement CAN be done over the bra you are wearing AND over your T-shirt. If you plan on getting fitted, don't wear a thick shirt like a sweatshirt or sweater. </li>
              <li>If you have large and/or sagging breasts, then when the person is taking your band measurement, you should pull up on your bra's shoulder straps so that she can get the measuring tape under your breast for an accurate measurement.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EX:</span> I had 2 different sale ladies "fit" me a year ago. One did not have me pull up on my straps and told me I was a 44DD. The size seemed to work but I was messing with my bra all day long and the wire kept poking me. I went back and a second lady "fitted" me and had me pull up on my straps and came out with a 40 DDD, which turned out to be my "true" size. The wire stopped hurting me and I stopped messing with my bra while I wore it. </li>
              <li>If you wear a bra with padding or stuff your bra, then you are not going to get an accurate measurement. If you plan on getting fitted, wear a bra without padding. </li>
              <li>Not all fittings will tell you the "right" size, but will give you a good place to start at usually. </li>
              <li>Try on different styles of bras. Every style fits and feels different and can "shape" your breast differently. </li>
              <li>Don't rush trying on bras. Really pay attention to how they fit and feel. Go bra shopping when you know you have the TIME for it. Many women have had to take up to an hour or more trying on several different sizes and styles to find the bra that gave them the fit and feel they wanted. </li>
              <li><strong>If your bra fits correctly, it should NOT be painful or uncomfortable to wear.</strong> </li>
              </ol>
              <h2>Finding the band size</h2>
              <p>There is NO consensus in these measurement methods (unfortunately). Different opinions exist. So no matter what measuring system you use, you still need to try the garment on to be sure it actually fits.</p>
              <p>Have someone measure around your chest with a tape measure, just under your breasts, and around the back. Make sure the tape measure rests flat on the skin and goes straight across your back. The most common advice is to add 5 inches to this measurement - and then that is your <strong>band size</strong> (also called chest size).</p>
              <p>BUT adding only 2-3 inches (instead of 5) can work better for many women - if you need the support to come more from below, rather than hanging off the shoulders. The above breast chest measure can also be a guide.</p>
              <p>If you end up with an odd number, go up to the next even number, since bras usually only come in even-numbered band sizes.</p>
              <h2>Finding the cup size</h2>
              <p>Measuring the cup size is trickier; even with a measurement it is better to try on different bras and find out experimentally which one fits.</p>
              <p>Have someone measure you again, this time the measuring tape goes on top of the fullest part of your breasts. If you already own a well-fitting non-padded bra, you can wear it while taking this measurement as long as it doesn't 'flatten' your breasts (which would make an illusion of a smaller cup size). Record this number, and find the difference between that, and the band-size number. The difference tells you the correct cup size as follows:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference:</span></strong> (inches)  negative</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cup size: </span></strong>AAAA or AAA</p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference: (inches)</span></strong>  &lt; 1</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cup size: </span></strong>AA</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference:</span></strong> (inches)  1"</p>
              <p><strong>Cup size: </strong>A</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference:</span></strong> (inches) 2"</p>
              <p><strong>Cup size: </strong>B</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference:</span></strong> (inches) 3"</p>
              <p><strong>Cup size: </strong>C</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference:</span></strong> (inches) 4"</p>
              <p><strong>Cup size: </strong>D</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference:</span></strong> (inches) 5"</p>
              <p><strong>Cup size: </strong>DD or E</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference:</span></strong> (inches) 6"</p>
              <p><strong>Cup size: </strong>DDD or F</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference:</span></strong> (inches) 7"</p>
              <p><strong>Cup size: </strong>DDDD or G</p>
              <p>Remember again, bra measuring is not exact science. And how could it be when women's breasts come in so many different shapes and sizes? Usually one breast is bigger than the other, they might sag, etc. So the fitting room tells you the truth; not the tape measure. You have to try the bra on. If it fits right, that's your bra size even if the tape measure told you different.</p>
              <h2>How to tell if your bra fits correctly.</h2>
              <ol>
              <li>It should fit snugly around. You ought to be able to fit one or two fingers under the band comfortably. If you are pulling down the back strap or pulling up on the shoulder straps throughout the day, then the band size (the # part of your bra size) is too big. <ol type="a">
              <li>Can you fit 1 or 2 fingers comfortably? If yes, then the band is right size. </li>
              <li>If you're having a hard time putting one finger under the band, then move the hooks to the loosest fitting eyes. If it is still tight on the loosest fitting, then try on one in the next up band size. </li>
              <li>If the band can easily be pulled away from your body, or if the band rises up your back, then go down one in the band size. </li>
              </ol></li>
              <li>If you are wearing an underwire bra, the wire that comes up between the breasts should lay flat (or as close as possible) to your breast bone. If you are wearing a bra with no underwire, you should have two separate breasts, not just a "one big boob". </li>
              <li>If the bra is a soft cup bra, you shouldn't have any extra, gapping fabric. If the bra is a molded cup you shouldn't have any extra room in the cup. Your breast should completely fill the cup. If it is gapping and the band feels fine, then go down in the cup size. </li>
              <li>You don't want to be spilling out of the cup - not from the top, bottom or sides. If the band feels fine then go up a cup size. </li>
              <li>If you raise your arms up (do this a few times), the bra should stay against your body, not lifting up or off. If this happens try a few things; <ol type="a">
              <li>adjust the shoulder straps by loosing them </li>
              <li>Pay attention to the band. Is it too tight? Or too loose? Or just right? </li>
              <li>If the band is just right, and adjusting the shoulder straps didn't work, then go up a cup size. </li>
              </ol></li>
              <li>If you have a small frame or are petite, and you find a bra that fits the band, and you don't quite fill the cup and you have already tried the next cup size down and it's still not quite right - OR if the you have the "right" size, the band fits and you fill the cup, but the wire is poking your underarms, then try a Demi bra. A Demi style bra is different from a full coverage bra. The Demi has less wire, by about an inch or more. </li>
              <li>Try on different styles of bras. Every style fits and fills different and can "shape" your breast differently. </li>
              <li><strong>If your bra fits correctly, it should NOT be painful or uncomfortable to wear.</strong> </li>
              </ol>
              <h2>For the dads out there helping their girls to shop for a bra:</h2>
              <ol>
              <li>Just like boxers and briefs and jockstraps are all very different in fit and comfort for you, for her every bra is different and there are hundreds of bra styles to choose from. </li>
              <li>Don't rush her. Let her try on as many bras as she needs too to find what is right for her. </li>
              </ol>
