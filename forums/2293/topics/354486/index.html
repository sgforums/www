              <p><strong>Origins’ recycling initiative</strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Nothing wasted, everything can be reused. The idea isn’t new, but Origins are now allying it with their own ambitions. <br><br>The brand - part of the Estée Lauder group - will be launching a vast recycling project in the USA, starting with the empty cosmetics containers brought in by their clients. <br><br>John Delfausse, vice president responsible for packaging across all the group’s American brands, explained, “the majority of recycling companies only collect the most obvious items, such as soda or water bottles . Cosmetic products and toiletries’ tubes, pots and bottles are often left out and rarely recycled.” <br><br>With the “Return to Origins” recycling program the brand will be taking empty containers from all cosmetic products, whatever the brand. <br><br>From March 29 the 450 Origins boutiques in American as well concessions in department stores, except Nordstrom, will be collecting empty containers to send to a recycling site to be sorted. What can be recycled will be reintroduced into the production cycle and the rest converted into energy. This is an ambitious project which could well spread to other countries. <br><br><em>By Jonathan Fulwell (Source: Emilie-Alice Fabrizi)</em></span></p>

              <p>Remember, ecological packaging was, not so long ago, only a minor genre in the design world, or worse an uncreative area where only talking of recycling had currency. These prejudices should by and large be put to rest from now on after the exposition ‘Eco’Pack Attitude’ organised by the Designpack gallery in Paris: a playful voyage to the heart of eco-design attacking our prejudices head on.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090330/ecodesign41.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Exhibits from the exposition Eco'Pack attitude</em></span></p>
              <p>The life-cycle of materials is highlighted in their innovative use in hand-made items and works of art, the more “eco-sensible” can even be made at home. Eco’Pack Attitude is showcasing a wide-view of the issues. Metals, plastics, glass and other everyday materials are on the menu, from their origin to their recycling. This will be a huge building-site of creation for designers who are betting on ecodesign taking off. <br><br>The exposition is has also been designed to apply the brakes to a large number of our supposed priorities; all the more important for a modern consumer society with near saturation of packaging. Discover the uncensored show from 9-24 May on the Rue de Richelieu in Paris. <br><br><em>By Jonathan Fulwell (Source: Emilie-Alice Fabrizi)</em></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Can't decide which handbag to buy? Rent it first</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">SINGAPORE (AFP) - A Louis Vuitton bag, diamond-inlaid guitar, Gucci shades and a dog. Total cost? Less than 1,000 Singapore dollars (654 US). The catch is, you're only renting.</span> </p>
              <p> <img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090218/LV41.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Model from the new "Panama Flight Bag" collection by </em></span><a class="tag" href="/forums/2293/news/search.php?id_word=286"><em><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Louis Vuitton</span></em></a></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">As consumers scrimp to survive the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, Singaporeans are increasingly turning to Internet-based rental outlets to at least maintain their sense of style, business operators say. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Just like how local coffee shops can expect better business than restaurants in times of economic turmoil, I believe a guitar rental service would be much appreciated in these times," said Elaine Khoo, owner of Rent-A-Guitar.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Her online company offers electric and classical guitars of various makes as well as amplifiers and guitar accessories for just one dollar per item a day -- with a deposit, of course.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Although not yet able to provide figures, Khoo said she has been "pleasantly surprised" by the response to her service, and said the economic crisis partly inspired her to set up her business in February.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I see the economic gloom as an opportunity for me to promote a service in which customers pay a smaller amount to rent the guitar rather than buy," Khoo said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Another rental company that says it is doing well despite the gloomy economy is thatbagiwant.com, which allows trendy customers to rent luxury handbags and sunglasses at prices vastly lower than their retail cost.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Because of the recession, business has gotten better," said owner Tan Ho Ching, adding that fashion-conscious customers unsure about buying costly bags are now embracing his service to save money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The customer base for thatbagiwant.com more than doubled in the three months after Singapore, in October, became the first Asian economy to enter recession.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"People who were sitting on the fence are now trying it out, preserving their capital," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Dog-sharing service Easy Dogz has also seen more customers in recent weeks, according to owner Herbert Lim.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The service allows clients to take home breeds including golden retrievers and Jack Russells after paying rent of 30-50 dollars a day on top of a 100-dollar membership fee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The company has not been adversely affected by the economic downturn, said Lim, and have even received a boost after running ads in a local newspaper.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">More conventional rental services also say business continues to be brisk.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">DVD rental firm Homepal Private Limited said more people were signing up, with chief executive officer Eric Tham estimating a 10 percent rise in membership over the six months to February.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Homepal allows customers to rent DVDs over the Internet and delivers the movies to their homes by post. Members pay a monthly subscription fee and are allowed to keep the DVDs for as long as they want.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"There's more people staying at home. This is a form of entertainment that is affordable," said Tham.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Games rental company Red Sands Gamers Club also said it membership was up by more than 50 percent since Christmas, and owner Jeffire Yang said this was due to customers' cost-cutting measures during the holiday period.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I spoke to my customers. They said that they bought (games) consoles instead of travelling overseas (to save money)" which led to increased membership for Red Sand's games rental services, Yang said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Membership allows members to enjoy discounts on goods and services offered at Red Sands.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Even one of the major players in the local telecommunications market has rolled out a mobile phone plan that is similar to a rental scheme.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">MobileOne's Take3 programme allows customers to own new mobile phones at significantly lower prices after subscribing to any of its service plans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Customers have the option of swapping their phone for another after nine months for a fee, or do the swap at no cost after 20 months.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Under the programme, an LG KF900 Prada II phone would cost 201 Singapore dollars per month, against a purchase price of 1,288 dollars.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"They get to enjoy the use of the latest handsets without paying upfront cost. it is likely to be especially welcome in the current economic crisis," said Geraldine Lai, a spokeswoman for MobileOne.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It's different for Singaporeans with such deep pockets they can still rent an entire island -- and keep it all to themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Indonesian island resort Pulau Pangkil Kecil, accessible by boat from Singapore, can be rented for varying rates depending on the season -- from 2,600 Singapore dollars per night for one to ten people on a normal weekday to 4,500 dollars on selected public holidays when bookings are tight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The cost covers all meals and use of the island's facilities, which include nine luxury accommodations, a bar, swimming pool, speedboats and more than 20 staff, according to the island's website.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"It's the same as last year, which was one of our busiest years -- people still see us as very good value for money," said a company spokesman.by Philip Lim</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">After her clothing line the Canadian is getting ready to launch her first fragrance. The perfume, christened Black Star, is the result of a partnership with the marketing giant Procter &amp; Gamble and comes complete with a low price tag to help win over Avril’s fans and the younger members of the public in general. </span></p>
              <img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090320/avril-lavigne-image.jpg" border="0" alt="">
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">“Young consumers love her, she has a very special relationship with the public,” explained Heike Hindenlang, director of global marketing for prestige products and womenswear at Procter &amp; Gamble. He added, “adolescents like to try new things, they like to buy smaller bottles of perfume rather than large ones”. <br><br>That is why the smallest version of Black Star will be sold in 15ml bottles at €16, but it will also be available in 30, 50 and 100ml at €24, €33 an €49 respectively. <br><br>In pink and black packaging (the favourite colours of the singer) the “fresh, young and edgy” Black Star presents itself as an olfactory representation of Avril Lavigne. The perfume will be released in Europe in July and will be followed by body lotion, deodorant and shower gel. <br><br><em>By Jonathan Fulwell</em></span></p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">Presented on Thursday March 26 in Switzerland at the watch and jewellery exhibition “Baselworld 2009”, this exclusive item – designed to recognise 35 years for the world famous pink kitten – was made in collaboration with the Austrian frim Swarovski, a crystal and precious stone specialist. <br><br>The statuette (10.5cm tall and weighing 569g), called “Super Hello Kitty Jewel Doll”, is adorned with 1 diamond, 1,939 white topazes, 403 pink sapphires and 1 citrine (a type of yellow quartz). <br><br>How, where and when this curiosity will be sold has not yet been established, confirmed Sanrio in a press release. <br><br>Amongst the innumerable fans of “Kitty-chan” some, rich or fascinated, won’t hesitate to pay a small fortune for this luxurious representation of the cute kitten, a symbol of sweetness and peace adored by many generations of young girls. <br><br>A Japanese buyer has previously paid ¥10million (€80,000 at the time) for another “Hello Kitty” jeweled piece a few years ago. <br><br>The blank-faced animal was born in 1974, and since then Kitty has become the cash-cow of Sanrio. Its image decorates thousands of different items (clothes, fashion accessories, electronic equipment, nick-nacks etc) and is sold in around 70 countries. <br><br>Kitty is also, like Mickey for Disney, the figurehead of a larger group of acolytes and the star of two theme parks in Japan. <br><br>She was officially named “Ambassador for the Japanese Ministry of Tourism” in 2008 to tour China in a bid to attract visitors to Japan.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>I-S </em>explores film’s fashion moments. By <strong>Zaki Jufri</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">From the day James Dean popularized the t-shirt in A Rebel Without a Cause to Diane Keaton’s androgynous Annie Hall, movies have always inspired fashion and style. How many times have you walked out of the cinema thinking: “I want to look like that!”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">While glossy fashion magazines have always been the source of choice for fashionistas, it is on the silver screen that identities are shaped and imitated. It is not just the clothes that people covet but the whole package itself. “Fashion and film have always had a symbiotic relationship with each other,” says fashion stylist Furqan Saini. “Designers (and people like us, for that matter) on the hunt for the new or old and rarefied have always turned to the celluloid closet for inspiration,” he adds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">In the now famous scene from American Gigolo, for instance, the suave and debonair Julian Kay (played by the equally suave Richard Gere) throws one jacket, shirt and tie after another on to his bed as he mulls over the most stylish combo. Look a little closer and you will see Kay’s wardrobe full of creations by the Italian fashion maven Giorgio Armani, and it has become fashion history that Armani’s career is inextricably linked to this ‘80s film noir classic. Kay’s overt display of vanity together with Armani’s elegant threads sparked a new trend of masculinity that had never been experienced before—a precursor to today’s metrosexual.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">So what’s your favorite film for fashion inspiration? What film changed the way you dress? We suss out some classic looks, and how can you adopt them.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Step aside Carrie Fisher, here comes Rebecca. This latest fashion romp has critics dubbing it the new Sex &amp; The City. But of course! SATC’s costumier Patricia Field was roped in to style Confessions. The movie’s titular character Rebecca Bloomwood’s style, according to Field is a mix of “bold, colorful, energetic, voluminous and eclectic.” And this is very much exemplified by the use of bold print prints and loud colors with vintage-inspired pieces thrown in for variety.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">When Jennifer Beals put on her torn t-shirt and leg warmers in Flashdance (1983), she launched a fashion revolution. The title song, “What a Feeling,” remains one of the best-loved pop songs of all time spawning fans who secretly long to whip out their tights and slide across a shiny audition room floor. Flashdance helped bring dancewear into mainstream fashion, in particular leg-warmers, leggings and oversized tops, and was a precursor to the ‘80s revival. The movie’s biggest sole contribution to fashion will be the baggy off-shoulder top which has inspired brands like adidas Originals and Stella McCartney.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">This 1997 cult classic ushered in a new wave of pop culture hysteria in the UK. Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and the rest of the gang showed the world how to dress like a rock star in “heroin chic” as it was termed back then. And so, this became the IT look in the mid ‘90s, with fashion magazines like i-D and The Face running editorials featuring gaunt and skinny models in equally skinny clothes. Judging by all the gaunt indie rockers and kids out there, this look is still very much in vogue. And who could forget the runway shows of designer Hedi Slimane?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">BERLIN, April 3, 2009 (AFP) - British supermodel Naomi Campbell lashed out Friday April 3 at what she sees as latent racism in the fashion industry, which she said gives preference to "blond, blue-eyed models" over black women.</span></p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">"You know, the American president may be black, but as a black woman, I am still an exception in this business. I always have to work harder to be treated equally," she said in a Glamour interview appearing Monday April 6 in Germany. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">She added: "In the past, there were more opportunities for black models but the trend towards blond women has again become extreme. In magazines, on the catwalk, I see blond, blue-eyed models everywhere."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">In 2007, the London-born Campbell, along with fellow models Liya Kebede and Tyson Beckford, launched a campaign against what they said was discrimination in the fashion world.</span> </p>

              <p><strong>SKorea recalls cosmetics contaminated with asbestos</strong></p>
              <p>SEOUL, April 7, 2009 (AFP) - A South Korean safety watchdog said Tuesday 7 April it has banned a local cosmetics company from selling five products which used raw materials contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos.</p>

              <p><br>The products from <span style="color: #0066cc;">L'Ocean</span> cosmetics company including face powder and make-up base were being taken off the shelves, the Korea Food and Drug Administration said.</p>
              <p>The products were made using talcum powder imported from China, which was found to have been contaminated with asbestos, it said in a statement.</p>
              <p>The agency last Thursday announced that it had found asbestos in baby powder made by eight manufacturers. It banned their sale and ordered a recall.</p>
              <p>Asbestos can cause lung cancer when inhaled.</p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The lowdown: </strong>Whoever said that local fashion is uninspiring has probably not heard of Sabrina Goh. A graduate of Singapore’s LASALLE-SIA College of the Arts and a finalist in the Singapore Young Designer Contest in 2006 and 2007, the Singapore-based Malaysian designer worked for local fashion brands and SINO London before striking out on her own with ELOHIM, which is—interestingly—Hebrew for “God of Creativity.” Goh describes her own style as “androgynous, architectural and artistic,” and designs for strong, confident individuals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>What’s in store: </strong>Get nostalgic with its standout Spring/Summer ‘09 collection. Derived from the designer’s affinity with Lego creator Ole Kirk Christiansen’s philosophy of “I put together,” this collection consists of well-structured and minimal-inspired pieces that involve interlocking Lego blocks with different configurations of felt to form abstract graphics and embellishments on skirts and mini dresses. Cool graphic tops are also paired with leggings to create looks of edgy nonchalance.        </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Who it’s for:</strong> Cool fashion mavens who like a strong conceptual approach to their clothes. Available from Black Market and Hide and Seek.</span></p>

This Californian creator of couture sportswear recently opened a store here and launched its Spring/Summer ‘09 collection. Known for their definitive take on relaxed Californian glamour, the design duo of Gela Nash-Taylor and Pamela Skaist-Levy has created a series of playful, feminine looks for the hot months ahead. Inspired by quintessential summer locales such as the Capri and Malibu, the collection is colorful and exuberant. Think postcard views and ice cream in picturesque cafés while you zip through cobble-stoned streets on a Vespa.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>What’s in store:</strong> Look out for embroidered peasant blouses and floral-print dresses paired with trenches in zesty brights for carefree elegance. Worn with gladiator flats, they add an edgy touch. There is also a hint of girly mischief in the Lolita-esque polka dots and cherry prints that are reminiscent of screen sirens Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren. And who could forget its signature tracksuit? All done up in the season’s hottest colors with a glamorous twist with crystal embellishments and tongue-in-cheek slogans like “Live For Sugar.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Who it’s for:</strong> Fashionistas looking to add some boho breeziness to their summer looks and arty types who want to stand out from the crowd with a hint of luxe. Available from Juicy Couture.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The lowdown: </strong>With a shared love for the arts, cooking, indie music and vintage eyewear, the founders of homegrown label Mystic Vintage trawled the world to put together their one-of-a-kind collection of bold and stylish glasses for fellow fans. The brand’s cerebral-cool factor is evident in the trio’s quirky references—the Mystic Vintage photo shoot was inspired by Philip K. Dick’s sci-fi novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? What’s more, with whimsical names such as “Gentle Giant,” “Slow Dance” and “Laura Femme,” you’ll add an extra dose of character to your look with these frames.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Who it’s for: </strong>Soulful nerds who aspire towards the studied cool of pop icons such as Andy Warhol, John Lennon and Jarvis Cocker, and glamour pusses looking for a dash of kooky charm.

Unlike its flashier neighbor Australia which has produced cult brands like Ksubi, Sass &amp; Bide and Chronicles of Never, New Zealand is known more for mainstream fashion. The brainchild of Margarita Robertson, NOM*D’s Summer ‘09 collection is nothing short of irreverent. Aptly called “Insiders,” it is made up of unique materials and vintage finds reworked into new designs.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>What’s in store: </strong>Pieces that look original and fresh just as they make a tongue-in-cheek reference to history and established classics. Key looks include bold stripes and houndstooth linings paired with dresses that have been chopped, seamed, upended and zipped together from matronly nylon petticoats to create a slouchy and thoroughly modern silhouette. The signature print on dresses this season features a pattern derived from a vintage men’s scarf. Similarly, traditional gentlemen’s jackets are cropped and shorn, and waistcoats are doubled over and attached to shirts with zips on show. Who knew that old classics could be so versatile?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Who it’s for: </strong>Savvy dressers with a wry sense of humour and a penchant for daring and edgy design won’t be disappointed.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The lowdown:</strong> Since his days as a costumer for advertising campaigns and music videos before studying fashion at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna, Bulgarian designer Petar Petrov has been intrigued by cultural differences. He is also drawn to simplicity of form rather than ideological concepts. Focused on the play of contrasts, his latest collection is a reflection of this aesthetic with its striking hi-lo combination of understated elegance mixed with street influences.                                           </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>What’s in store: </strong>Having launched his first womenswear collection in 2007 following the success of his menswear, Petrov is a relative newcomer on the womenswear scene. However, Petrov has managed to create a collection that exudes purity of form and stylish sophistication without appearing overly polished. Look out for highly wearable and modern styles created from a simple color palette, such as loose-fitting dresses with clean lines paired with skinny jeans for effortless cool, and also bolder looks such as an unexpectedly sexy playsuit.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The clothes that cool kids wear. By Zaki Jufri</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;"><img style="vertical-align: middle; border: 0;" src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/449/14-Style-Featrure.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="450" height="250" align="middle"></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Today’s fashion-conscious moms and pops think of their kids as extensions of themselves and so want their kids to look cool like them. Like us adults, kids want (or so we think) something much cooler than the staple kiddie print tees and pink flowery dresses. We give you a lowdown on what’s hot for tots this spring.</span></p>
              <div>
              <h3><span style="color: #333333;">Du Pareil Au Même (DPAM)</span></h3>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">One of the more recent additions to the new wave of chic French wear for tots, Du Pareil Au Même has been making creative French designs for kids since 1986. Each season, DPAM produces a timeless and classic collection (usually 850 styles in all) with fabrics that are a mix of straight design, cute and humorous prints, lovely details and functional, comfortable cuts. DPAM recently launched its Spring/Summer 2009 Collection—look out for nature inspired prints, ethnic embroidery and rock-star inspired denim that will surely make your kid stand out from the crowd.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Like its adult counterpart, the spring collection for GapKids looks set to be a bright one. In classic Gap fashion, the casual “Americana” concept is translated into its children’s apparel but with a contemporary twist—swathes of colours in bright and fresh hues with hints of spring’s vibrant optimism. For the boys, it’s all sporty—wide and bright stripes with lots of rugby details. As far as the girl’s collection goes, it looks to us as if it’s going to be blooming with nonchalantly cool florals, kooky prints, flowing skirts and wide leg bottoms. Details are aplenty—floral embroidery on light tunics and A-line dresses; big bold rugby stripes on jerseys and polos—while bottoms are kept hemmed and cuffed to complete the look.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Although it is known more for its oh-so-sexy jeans and flirtatious tops for ladies, its trendsetting Guess Kids line have made it a hot ticket item for soccer moms everywhere. For its current collection, Paul Marciano (Guess’ creative director) went back to the Summer of Love for inspiration. Bohemian-inspired patio dresses and loose fitting tunics in bright colors set the stage for a whimsical wardrobe, while dresses, skirts and jeans are patchwork and floral embroidered denim pieces. The boy’s collection has a clean palette with pops of bright yellow and orange as well as the incorporation of all shades of blue. T-shirts with vintage graphic prints and peace sign insignias are seen throughout the assortment of burnout tees. The denim collection features heavy stitching, high contrast blasting, leather trim and detailed embroidery.</span></p>

Meaning “Little Boat” in French, the brand caters to kids, from babies to tweens, and has loungers for adults.

Mummies can deck out their girls in comfortable cotton jerseys and skirts, colourful polka-dot blouses, cute nautical style dresses, tops and tights, while the boys will look adorable in dungarees, fun printed tees and casual pants or denims.</span></p>

These masters of Parisian cool have whipped out their incredible shrinking machine and zapped some really cool threads for wee hipsters.

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">South Korea bans sale of medical goods containing asbestos</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">SEOUL, April 9, 2009 (AFP) - South Korea's drug safety agency Thursday banned the sale of 1,122 medical goods which contain talcum powder contaminated with asbestos, and ordered their recall from stores.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090409/SK77.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em><span style="color: #999999;">An ambulance in Seoul (Photo: AFP/File/Str)</span></em></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">The government separately banned imports of talcum powder containing asbestos, a toxic mineral that can cause serious illnesses such as malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Talcum power is widely used in items ranging from surgical gloves to drug capsules and cosmetic products. The European Union since 2005 has ordered manufacturers to refine the powder thoroughly to remove asbestos.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The Korea Food and Drug Administration said it had banned the sale of 1,122 medical products suspected to be contaminated with asbestos.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It said 1,111 products would be immediately removed from the market and 11 others a month later.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The administration has come in for criticism for failing to protect public safety after announcing last week it had detected the harmful material in 11 brands of baby powder and cosmetic products.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I sincerely apologise for causing public anxiety," its chief Yoon Yeo-Pyo said, adding his office would also screen all cosmetic products.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The prime minister's office said the government placed an import ban on talcum powder containing asbestos. It promised to conduct asbestos screening for rubber, paper and other industrial products using talcum powder.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The JoongAng Daily has urged the government to work out safety standards on asbestos.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"There are now fears that medicines and household goods might also be affected," it said in an editorial Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"We're now in a situation where we don't know which household goods we use every day are contaminated by this dangerous material," it said.</span></p>

              <h2><span style="color: #333333;">Scene Stealer--Ooh La La, Lacroix</span></h2>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Famed fashion designer Chrsitan Lacroix pays tribute to theater and stage in his exhibition Christian Lacroix the Costumier.</span></p>
              <div><span style="color: #333333;"> <img style="vertical-align: middle; border: 0;" src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/454/13-20-IS-SS-ART.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="450" height="250" align="middle"></span></div>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Christian Lacroix epitomizes 1980s high fashion flash and extravagance, and is most renowned for his flamboyant catwalk couture. His true passion, however, has always been theater. Testament to this love is his exhibition Christian Lacroix the Costumier, in which he showcases 80 of his most breathtaking costumes and 60 inspiring sketches from the Centre National du Costume de Scène museum in France. Each piece has been carefully selected from a body of work covering two decades and 25 stage productions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Lacroix draws you into his world with his use of signature colors red and black—the colors of fashion, love and death—in a theater setting. As you move from each shop-window style display, Lacroix transports you to the stage, allowing you to see textures and colors up close, to experience history and culture and to feel the life and emotion of each costume. The gypsy frocks from Carmen (his first opera), with their boleros, kitchy prints and wiring sewn in for movement, take you to an impromptu dance at a plaza in 19th century Spain. Move to the next display, Phedre (considered Lacroix’s masterpiece) and find yourself in the 16th century, with long, wide Renaissance coats, heavy capes and armor. Accompanying each production display are Lacroix’s original sketches, which give viewers a sense of the process of costume design.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">At the center of the exhibition is the circular display room—Lacroix’s ode to theater and fashion. Heavy, white drapery becomes a film screen for an old dance movie reel. Twirling from the ceiling are Lacroix’s beloved, bright tutus. At eye level, he introduces some of his more recent works, such as the costumes from L’as-tu revue and Othello (think Charles Dickens on a motorbike).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">In times such as these, it is not unusual for thoughts to turn to pocketbooks and falling stocks rather than to the arts. But the turn out for this exhibition has been good, and perhaps Lacroix’s high drama is proving to be a panacea as well as fabulous art. After all, the show, as they say, must go on.—<strong>Theresa Tarpey</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Catch Christian Lacroix the Costumier through Jun 7. National Museum of Singapore, 93 Stamford Rd., 6332-5642. $10 (adult); $5 (children and senior citizens).</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Japan's skincare guru says wrinkles are beautiful too</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">By Elaine Lies</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">TOKYO (Reuters Life!) - Wear a shower cap over your face. Think about sexy men. And don't stress about those inevitable wrinkles. </span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090416/reuterswrinkles77.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #999999;">Photo: REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao</span></em></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">All are part of Japanese beauty expert Chizu Saeki's "Skincare Revolution," her compilation of sometimes unorthodox facial care that has made her a household name in Japan. Her tips were even taken up in a video game several years ago. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Yet she also says flawless skin isn't everything.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"As you age, it's okay to have wrinkles, it's okay to have age spots, it's okay to sag," the 66-year-old Saeki told Reuters after the publication of "The Japanese Skincare Revolution," her first book to come out in English.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Growing older -- that's just the way it is, it means you've lived. Anything else is a lie. You should live naturally."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">This reassuring message has no doubt contributed to her success in Japan, one of the world's fastest aging nations, with visitors to her salon in the fashionable Ginza district of Tokyo ranging up into their 80s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">And the core of her methods -- getting women to use things they already have -- resonates even more as Japan's economy is hit by recession and consumers tighten purse strings still more.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Becoming beautiful isn't cosmetics, it's your way of thinking, your hands," she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"This is something you can do at home, with what you have around you. I thought if I could spread the word on this, age won't matter, money won't matter."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Saeki is a good advertisement for her methods. Though her short hair is white, her face is firm and unlined.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">But anybody expecting exotic treatments such as seaweed wraps or rice bran potions may be disappointed, with Saeki basing her methods on the often simple care Japanese women have lavished on their skin for centuries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Japanese women were always spoken of for their pale, beautiful skin and their dark hair. But now they get tanned like foreigners and use makeup from their teens," she lamented.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"There was a very strong trend among Japanese women for branded things, for expensive things. And even if they still had cosmetics products left over, they'd go off and buy even more," she said. "I felt this was a real waste."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">THE ELIXIR OF IMAGINATION</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Following a 40-year career as a beautician, a good part of it with foreign firms such as </span><a class="tag" href="/forums/2293/news/search.php?id_word=209"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #333333;">Dior</span></span></a><span style="color: #333333;"> and </span><a class="tag" href="/forums/2293/news/search.php?id_word=357"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #333333;">Guerlain</span></span></a><span style="color: #333333;">, Saeki set up her own salon in 2003, at the age of 60.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">She advocates simplicity, whether using already bought cosmetics or things such as honey, recommended for chapped lips.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">To increase the effectiveness of lotions, she suggests wearing a shower cap over the face as an instant "steam sauna." Of course, cut out breathing holes first.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">And then there's the "elixir of imagination" -- fantasizing. She recommends thinking about attractive men, which she says promotes the secretion of hormones beneficial to the skin.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I like to capitalize on everything our bodies have to offer, from our hands and our fingers to the warmth of touch," she writes in her book. "A bit of heart-throbbing excitement makes a great supplement for healthy skin."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Three million copies of her books are in print in Japan, and she is often on television. Treatments at her salon, which run from 31,000 yen to 48,300 yen ($313-$487), are fully booked months in advance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"The face is proof of the heart, a chart of your health, a signboard of your life," she said. "When I look at a person's face, I know everything about them."</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Soccer governing body FIFA to launch fashion ranges</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - FIFA, soccer's world governing body, is branching into fashion, announcing plans on Sunday 19 April to sell branded clothes and merchandise from this summer through new FIFA stores and retail partners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090419/fifa77.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), which groups 208 soccer associations from around the world, said it would initially launch five collections, ranging from the preppy 1904 (the year in which FIFA was founded), through the edgier, youth-focused Code to upmarket Trophy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It will also introduce an Event range for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">FIFA said it had signed a license agreement with brand management and licensing company Global Brands Group, which is working with designers and signing up distributors. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Agreements have so far been reached in five markets -- with Cooper Sports in Australia, the East India Trading Company in India, Young Turks in Turkey, Fireblade in the UK and Total Apparel Group in the United States.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Deals in a further three markets are pending and six more have been identified, FIFA said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The distributors may also be responsible for creating FIFA Official Stores, the first of which opened at Singapore's new T3 terminal at Changi airport in January 2008. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">A second will open at Paris's Orly airport on Sept. 1 and others are being developed in London, Tokyo and Los Angeles, as well as in emerging markets like Latin America, China and India.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The collections, which will be for both men and women and also include Essentials for basics like tee-shirts and Editions, which will carry logos of previous World Cup tournaments, will be sold via concessions in other retailers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">A spokesman said Global Brands was in talks with department stores group John Lewis [JLP.UL] and fashion chain Next (NXT.L) in Britain, rather than sportswear groups like JJB (JJB.L).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The collections will be shown at trade shows over the coming months and go on sale from August. (Reporting by Mark Potter; editing by Simon Jessop)</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Retail gloom passes North Korea by as women shop for dresses</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">LONDON (Reuters) - Fashion stores in high streets around the world may be suffering from the global financial crisis, but in communist North Korea women have gone on a dress-buying spree.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090419/northkoreadress77.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Korean dress shops in Pyongyang are bustling with customers in the current spring season," the state news agency KCNA reported on Friday.</span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Workers had their hands full dealing with a deluge of orders, it said</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">KCNA quoted a worker in the Ryonghung Korean Dress Shop as saying: "All of them gasp their admiration for the graceful and fascinating costumes on show in the sample room."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The economy of reclusive North Korea is firmly in state hands and foreign analysts say it faces chronic problems, including food shortages.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The channeling of resources to military spending, including a missile program that has alarmed the West, has contributed to a dearth of consumer goods, they say.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">KCNA, however, routinely lauds economic progress and extolls leader Kim Jong-il for his inspirational leadership in all areas of society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Unusually, he was not mentioned in the dress-buying report but KCNA noted: "The streets of Pyongyang, seething with a new revolutionary upsurge, look bright with beautiful women in chima jogori (Korean woman's skirt and coat) which give off national lyricism and aroma in spring."</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">'Beauty' injections can turn ugly</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">NEW YORK, April 17, 2009 (AFP) - New Yorkers looking for a quick beauty fix risk death from unlicensed practitioners offering oil injections to enhance prized body parts, health authorities warned Friday 17 April.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Pedestrians walk by a fashion display in a window along 5th Avenue in March 2009 in New York City. New Yorkers looking for a quick beauty fix risk death from unlicensed practitioners offering oil injections to enhance prized body parts, health authorities warned. (AFP/Getty Images/File/Spencer Platt)</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The city health department said silicone, petroleum jelly, castor oil, mineral oil or cod liver oil were among substances injected by unscrupulous practitioners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"People who undergo these unsafe procedures hope to enhance their appearance, but the reality can be lifelong deformity and even death," said Doctor Nathan Graber, director of the city's environmental and occupational disease program.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The health department said in a statement that side effects include "serious infections, nerve damage, respiratory and kidney failure, irreversible disabilities, disfigurement and death."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The department said it was aware of five cases in the last two years in which oil injections had been given to the hips, thighs, breasts and buttocks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The department warned New Yorkers to avoid treatments done at home, in hotels or anywhere other than a licensed clinic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"The use of oils to enhance body parts is risky under any circumstances," the department advised.</span></p>

Prevage purports to smooth skin tone and soften skin with anti-aging ingredient Soy Ferulate-C which works by controlling the production of melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color but also gives rise to age spots and freckles. And with so many brightening, whitening and lightening products out there, you might be confused over what on earth the difference is between the three. Well, whitening and lightening are about the same thing—it means making your skin paler; while brightening, as we’ve just described, evens out your coloration without making it paler. <br>    And when you’re done brightening up, splash on some Pretty perfume. With mandarin orange, peach, jasmine, amber and a scientifically manufactured scent, petalia, Pretty is that kind of perfume that makes you feel flirty and fun. It creator was inspired by watching his wife get dressed to go out, so maybe save this for a weekend night or keep some in your office drawer to dab on after work to shake off the day and put yourself in the mood for a night out. Takashimaya, 1/F, Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Rd., 6735-7605 and other outlets.<br>    <br><strong><img style="float: right; border: 0;" src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/452/9_OTP2.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">Cheek to Cheek</strong><br>The next time you feel the need to sweat it out, try this treatment at <strong>Spa Esprit at House</strong> (8D Dempsey Rd., 6479-0070). Called Cheeky Chai, this treatment softens you up with a wonderful de-stressing massage and then coats you in dead-sea mud and paraffin wax that draws out perspiration and other toxins. The massage is quite firm and deep—excellent for knots and stiff muscles—and is intended to relax you for the mud/wax. A good thing too because the wax is hot, even slightly scalding to the touch. Fun if it’s your loved one dripping it on you on a bear-skin rug, but with a well trained therapist it takes on a rather serious dimension. Thankfully the wax cools in seconds, and when you’re mummified in it, it becomes like a warm cocoon. When they peel it off, you’ll see small pools of perspiration on the wax flaps and should feel like you just stepped out of a steam bath.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong><img style="float: left; border: 0;" src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/452/9_OTP1.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Sensorial Treat</strong><br>Three-month old spa <strong>The Sensory Suite</strong> (14 Gemmill Lane, 6222-7377) has been pampering stressed out executives in the city with their massages, facials and body treatments. While quick pick-me-ups are available, treat yourself to their Lava Stone Facial ($280) or Rice Body Spa ($320) if you have time. Two-hours long each, these treatments use wonderful special ingredients to refresh and relax you. In the Lava Stone Facial, volcanic stones from the famous Mount Etna in Sicily are used to apply creams to your face and, in the process, supposedly transmit their curative energy to you. For many who have tried this, the first application of the stones tingles, which is a sign that they are “tuning in” to your body. Judging by the verdant vineyards and orchards that thrive on the fertile slopes of Mount Etna, that can only be a good thing. <br>    In the Rice Body Spa, a series of rice scrubs, packs and balls are applied on the whole body while you lie on a massage bed. Sweet and fragrant, the rice feels soft and nourishing, and by the time the therapist starts rubbing the warm rice balls (rice wrapped in muslin pouches and steamed) on you, you are melting away. Following that is a rice bran oil massage that will ensure you completely bliss out.  </span><span style="color: #333333;">i-s mag</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">When Ciara Princess Harris dropped her first single, the catchy 'Goodies' in 2004, everyone thought she was just another fly-by-night pretty girl from the South who could dance her butt off. The tomboyish "Queen of Crunk" wore belly-baring midriff tops with baggy pants, which inspired constant comparisons to the late Aaliyah. <br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">Since then, Cici's style has evolved (the title of her 2006 sophomore album was 'Ciara: The Evolution'). She consistently surprised on the red carpet in the best designer dresses, from Gucci, Versace, YSL and more, with a sultry pose to match. To promote her upcoming album, 'Fantasy Ride,' dropping May 5, Ciara recently appeared on the cover of WWD, the world's leading fashion industry newspaper, and in a photo spread for the January issue of Elle. She also made a guest appearance on 'America's Next Top Model.' <br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">Fashion is clearly one of her passions, so Style Spotter had to ask her what goodies she's digging right now. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Who is your fashion icon?</strong><br>Hmm, that's a hard one! I would say <strong>Madonna </strong>as she always stands out and you never know what look she's doing next. <br></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Gap goes to the seaside</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The sun has started to peek out and Gap has responded by launching its first full beachwear range. Created by Mireille Gindrey, recently named director of Gapbody, the line combines styles: romantic or graphic and colourful, soft and subtle or overt.</span></p>
              <img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090421/gap11%24.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><span style="color: #0066cc;"><em>Gap</em></span><em><span style="color: #999999;"> Beachwear Summer 2009</span></em>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">This is a range big enough to make anyone dizzy. Especially as there are banded, full, triangular and half-cup bikini tops to choose from and mix and match as you like with as many possibilities for the lower half, “classic, lightly pleated or tied at the hip”, noted a spokesperson for Gap. As for the price, expect to pay between €22 and €39 per piece.</span></p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">Mireille Gindrey (ex-Calvin Klein) has added a line of swim shorts for men and women designed for loafing around on the beach as well items like breathable cotton dresses, roll-up shorts, kaftans for the beach and even lightweight jumpers in faded out colours. Pretty much everything is on offer in this new range of beachwear. <br><br><em>By Jonathan Fulwell (Source: Julie Mangaud) </em></span></p>

              <div><br><span style="color: #333333;"><img src="http://grazia.ninemsn.com.au/img/blogs/celebtracker/CelebTracker_KristyHinze_Jan12.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><strong>Kristy Hinze talks to us about those wedding plans, Obama and her fabulous jetset life </strong><br></span></div>
              <div><br><span style="color: #333333;">Even a wealthy, gorgeous model about to marry the love of her life has her down days. Kristy Hinze, 29, is finding it hard to come to terms with the reaction to her pending marriage to the much older, ultra-rich American, 64-year-old Jim Clark. (Google the couple and headlines like “Jim’s new wife puts ‘sex’ back into sexagenarian,” scream out.)<br><br>“My family worry about me,” she admits. “They say, ‘How do you deal with it?’ I manage. It’s not a problem – sometimes you just have to laugh!” <br>      Just hours before our interview, she opened a paper to read she and Jim, who made his billions founding Netscape, are about to buy a $15 million harbourside mansion.<br>      “So untrue!” she insists. “I’m interested in buying a property in Australia yes, but an apartment.” The stories about her and Jim, she adds, can be “absolute hogwash”.<br>In tight jeans and a red silk blouse, with radiant skin and a smile that could light a gas stove, Kristy looks every inch the cover-girl-turned TV host success story she’s become.<br>      Away from work, she insists, “I’m a very normal person, who likes doing ordinary things. If people only saw me at home with the family for Christmas, wandering around in old thongs.” <br>      The difference, of course, is Kristy can tap into a super glam world whenever she wants. She rubs shoulders with movie stars and captains of industry (and yes, she’s already met Obama), travelling the globe in luxury. And that enviable life is about to propel her into a whole new stratosphere when the couple marry at a ceremony in Florida in March.<br>      “I’m very excited,” she says. “Jim is wonderful; an incredible man.”<br>      The wedding, she reveals, will be “pretty low-key.” It will go on for a couple of days. “But that’s really because people are going to make such a pilgrimage from Australia to get there.” She’s not saying too much about the ceremony. “We’re trying to keep it private,” she apologises. “But it’s going to be a beautiful wedding!”<br>      Kristy has asked long-term friend and fellow Project Runway judge Jayson Brunsdon to design the bridesmaids’ dresses. “He was jumping out of his skin with excitement,” says Kristy. <br>      “We have become quite close. He went through his cancer and thankfully he’s got the all-clear now.” Meanwhile she’s keeping quiet on who will design the dress.<br>      Will she and Jim be writing their own vows? She pauses a second. “I haven’t really thought that far – maybe. We’re not very traditional. I think it will be more like, ‘Let’s get this over with so we can all party!’”<br>      After the wedding it will be back to work and her ongoing commitments to Project Runway and Sportscraft.<br>      Kristy has relished taking on more responsibility with the fashion brand; co-designing the Kristy Knit Collection (which she’s modelling on these pages). “I wanted to give people the sense of luxury, but without the price tag,” she says. “We worked on a blend of Australian merino and silk so it would be light and airy, suitable for our climate.”<br>      She adds: “I designed the kind of simple, classic pieces I enjoy wearing, and I’m so happy with the results.”<br>      Kristy admits she was thrilled when the handbag she designed for Sportscraft sold out within two days. “I’m a handbag and shoes gal from way back.”<br>      One of the benefits of working with Sportscraft, she says, “is they fly me home to Australia four or five times a year. I hope to keep working for them for many years to come.”<br><br>As for the TV work? “I’d love more opportunities there in time, as well. Maybe a chat show? I always want to keep working, but there has to be balance. I don’t want to be so flat out I don’t have enough time with my husband.” Maybe babies? She shakes her head. “Who knows – too busy at the moment!” she says.<br></span></div>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Franck Boclet</span> is inspired by “the ancient tradions of master tailors”. The artistic director for men’s collections at the fashion house <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ungaro</span> since 2007 has leapt back into the past with an exceptional shirt that is custom-made. <br><br>Designed by Italian designers, the shirt sports high quality materials, “from double twisted cotton to Sea Island cotton, without forgetting 100% silk and Egyptian combed cotton/linen”, explained the fashion house. <br><br>Buttonholes, buttons, collar and cuffs, English fashioned sleeves… <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Franck Boclet</span> hasn’t skimped on the details, everything is done by hand. As for the price, one of these shirts is available from €350. <br><br>The icing on the cake, it’s even possible to order the shirt of your dreams at the label’s boutiques in Paris and New York. <br><br>A range of a hundred and ten materials combined with “multiple personalisations” such as “embroidered initials and ties and pocket squares in the same material” amongst others will allow gentlemen to be as demanding as they can be and, at the same times, as stylish as possible. <br><br>By Jonathan Fulwell (Source: Julie Mangaud)</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Hyères 2009 won over by Latvian pair</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><img src="http://sg.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090427/hyeres0.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The years pass by and bring with them a wide variety of events. The only constant in the world of fashion is creativity, and this year men’s collections have seen more creativity than usual. At the 24th ‘Festival International’ of fashion and photography at Hyères (from 24 to 27 April 2009), it was Marite Mastina and Rolands Peterkops from Latvia who walked off with three awards, including the coveted Grand Prix Mode.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090427/hyeres1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em><span style="color: #999999;">Creations of Marite Mastina and Rolands Peterkops, Grand Prix Mode 2009</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Their mixed collection “Private Detective” was inspired by the clothes seen in film noir. Models took up the most overused stereotypical symbols of the genre: the detective’s raincoat, the sexy dress of the heroine, the spy’s coat… Like an exaggerated drawing, certain proportions of the clothes had been distorted and accentuated and each of the outfits came with a large wig. Between role playing, black humour and cartoons, the feel of the collection was one of surrealism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It was very much appreciated, the collection by Marite Mastina and Rolands Peterkops also won the Grand Prix Mode L’Oréal Professionnel and the Prix1.2.3. The reward for each, a grant of €15,000, but also help with make-up and hair-styling for their future catwalk from the cosmetics giant which gives its name to one of the prizes. Furthermore, the pair will receive help with the production of a ready-to-wear clothing line.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">As for Simon-Pierre Toussaint (from Belgium), he won both the Prix du Public and the Prix Crystallized Swarovski Elements, sharing the latter with Harald Lunde Helgesen (from Norway); both designers had developed men’s outfits.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Finally, fashion photography is not slacking with a similar remarkable level of creativity on display. From the ten shortlisted photographers it was Linus Bill (from Switzerland) who received the Grand Prix de la Photographie.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">A compulsive photographer, Bill photographs everything, all the time. Family and friends, strangers, interiors, exteriors, real life, still life, spontaneous, planned out… No theme or criteria preside over his shooting. Recent photos join older ones in his archives, we he draws from to create a group for an exposition or publication. Each of the images are reproduced on a large silk screen, giving his photos a painting like quality which is unique to each of them. <br></span><em><br><span style="color: #333333;">By Jonathan Fulwell (Source: Céline Vautard)</span></em></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Swarovski moves into horology</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Swarovski is expanding into the horological sector. Presented at an advance preview in Bale, the first collection is no half measure, consisting of forty-five models in various shapes and innovative designs. The range proves once again that Swarovski is not lacking in daring.</span></p>
              <img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090417/Swaro43.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em><span style="color: #999999;">Octea Line</span></em>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">Round, rectangular or square, inlaid with Swarovski crystal or more simple, engraved faces or in the chronometer style, men’s and women’s, sporting or casual, wristband in steel or leather, some covered in crystals… It can be seen, the collection is so vast as to be able to appeal to a large audience drawn from men and women of all ages.</span></p>
              <img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090417/Swaro42.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em><span style="color: #999999;">Baguette Line</span></em>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">Grouped into five families, including the Baguette will be released in a limited edition and numbered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, Piazza or OCTE, itself split into OCTE Sport, Mini or Lady, all models have a quartz movement "Swiss Made" and a sapphire crystal. A necessity for the brand. Because if some watches have already crossed over into the the world of jewellery it is with this first collection that Swarovski will make its entry into watchmaking. Stamping ”Swiss Made” onto its models allows </span><a class="tag" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2293/news/search.php?id_word=400"><span style="color: #333333;">Swarovski</span></a><span style="color: #333333;"> to assure customers of its legitimacy, and that they push all the boundaries of their expertise. <br><br>The highlight of this collaboration: "D Light", is a watch which goes completely against typical Swiss models. Goodbye designs from grandpa’s era, Swarovski transports us to the end of the twenty-first century. Dynamic and futuristic, it also offers new and graphic perspectives on what can be used to dress your wrists.</span></p>
              <img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090417/Swaro41.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><span style="color: #999999;"><em>D Light de </em></span><em><span style="color: #808080;">Swarovski</span></em>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">Made from quality steel, gold or silver, the is much more than a bracelet with machine which tells you the time. From first sight one is captivated by its rectangular screen covered in 171 Swarovski crystals which, at the touch of a button, light up; the crystals sparkle and, by turning red, gives the time. No moving hands then, nor an indication of date but a simple indication of the time. A feat of design which doesn’t hide new technology; Swarovski has been studying the mechanisms for several years now. <br><br>As for the price, the collection has been planned for every budget, though you’ll need between €400 and €1400 for the D-Light. The watched will be available in Swarovski boutiques, department stores and, a novelty, the crystal manufacturer has invited several top of the range timepiece retailers to distribute its collections as well. <br><br><em>By Jonathan Fulwell (Source: Emilie-Alice Fabrizi)</em></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Hermès considers sales on mobile phones</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">At the same time as the deployment of online shopping, Hermès is considering necessary technology adaptations to sell on internet capable “smart phones”. “The technology is developing very quickly. We must take advantage. Demonstrating items on mobile telephones needs, for example, the enlargement of the format of the photos”, explained Charles Henri Leroy, director of client relations who oversees marketing, services offered in stores and personal services.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090422/hermesshoes77.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br><span style="color: #999999;"><em><span style="color: #808080;">Hermès</span> Sandals available on <span style="color: #808080;">Hermes</span>.com</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The epitome of French luxury and defendant of artisanal know-how, Hermès has nonetheless been pioneering, selling ties, handkerchiefs and perfumes on the Internet since 2002 in the USA. It was not until March 2008 that the fashion house opened its institution’s own site though. A “reverse path” compared to other luxury brands, observed Charles Henri Leroy, “adhering to the strategy of Jean-Louis Dumas and his son Pierre Alexis, who, from the start, saw the Net as a means of supplying a supplementary service to clients and a tool to recruit new ones who, without which, would not have access to the products, the brand not being present in their country”. <br><br>As for the institutional site, Hermès has waited until technology permitted, through the quality of photos and videos, to show all the facets of the label and its history. After America, sales sites have been opened in the principal countries of Europe, Switzerland and since last year in Australia and Japan. The price is based on current market prices and available products that are sold has been gradually enlarged, with differences by country: the American site is the richest in leather products and offers watches, whereas the French sells jewellery. <br><br>Coming soon, ready-to-wear men’s wear and, why not, ladies’ fashion. “We have no taboos. It’s like in our real boutiques, each director has his own selection”, though always with “multi-channel continuity” between what is available on the web and in stores.</span></p>
