              <p>Miss Maya Puan Yuling knew wthat studying for the Graduate Diploma in Systems Analysis programme would be tough.</p>
              <p>   After all, Miss Puan - who has a Bachelor of Science (second class honours) degre in Applied Mathematics from the National University of Singapore - was doing a graduate-level information technology (IT) programme when she had no IT background.</p>
              <p>   But she toughed it out in the 13-month full-time study because she wanted to learn everything from C# programming language to coding application development - skills which she now taps as an analyst in application development at Avanade Asia, a company that provides business solutions using Microsoft technologies.</p>
              <p>   "My only goal was to learn as much as possible so I would be ready to work in the IT industry. I didn't expect to be awarded any prizes," says Miss Puan, who did win the IBM Gold Medal and Book Prize.</p>
              <p>   The Graduate Diploma in Systems Analysis (GDipSA) is offered by the National University of Singapore's Institute of Systems Science (NUS-ISS).</p>
              <p>   Established in 1981, NUS-ISS provides graduate education and aims to develop infocomm leaders, among other things.</p>
              <p>   For Miss Puan, the GDipSA programme, which she attended from August 2013 to September 2014, was like swimming in the deep end from the get-go.</p>
              <p>   She spent six to seven months boning up on the basics, a month in an application development project, and five months interning at the Inland Revenue of Singapore (Iras).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Tight deadlines</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just as in the working world, project timelines were compacted.</p>
              <p>   "Completing every project was a challenge," she recalls.</p>
              <p>   The shortest was three days for a programming project and the longest, a one-month application development exercise.</p>
              <p>   The latter involved students creating a stationery management system (SMS) for a university. A web application, it allows people to request for stationery and for back-end users to manage the stock.</p>
              <p>   She experienced the application development life cycle from requirement gathering to user acceptance tests.</p>
              <p>   But the rigours put her in good stead for her five-month internship at lras, where she was involved in two application development projects.</p>
              <p>   Choosing the GDipSA was not by a mere process of elimination.</p>
              <p>   She says: "I decided to join the IT industry because I didn't wish to be just a user. I wanted to be a programmer and come up with new applications that are secure and easy to use and navigate."</p>
              <p>   Those who do not have the knowledge or skills should not be put off from joining the industry, says Miss Puan.</p>
              <p>   Dr Esther Tan, chief of the GDipSA study, says: "The programme transforms someone without IT knowledge into an IT professional in a very short time.</p>
              <p>   "In fact, people who feel they have lost touch with their IT knowledge can also take the programme as a refresher course and update themselves with the latest IT knowledge."</p>
              <p>   More than 2,000 students have graduated from the programme since it was introduced in 1981.</p>
