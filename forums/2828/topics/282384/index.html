            <div class='col-md body'>Ok guys, seems that there is really peer pressure. Maybe its positive? Maybe negative? Haha, but I feel that since I always shuttle around the bus forums, I should get a new bus rego nick, and dump away this nick I am using now (actually I forgot how I come about with this nick already).<br>Hence, my new nick is <strong>TIB1224Y</strong>, a SMRT Mercedes Benz 0405G Habit bodied bus('s) rego number. Been chasing this bus since its days on service 188, then last year when it came to service 189 and settled down as it's split shift duty vehicle. Voith gearbox and loud engine sounds make this bus apart from the other ZF vehicles in the fleet of perm buses on service 189.<br>Does that make me like this bus so much? Yes, definitely. It does not restrict only on the bus captain who drives it, but also the specialty of the rego number (its sisterships 1223A and 1225U are in Ang Mo Kio and Woodlands Depot respectively, and this 'lucky' guy is alone in Kranji, talk about how consecutive rego buses are distributed!), the loud solid sound of a Voith gearbox vehicle (not that ZF is not loud, maybe less in decibels?) and the seemingly unlucky number of '4' in the rego, actually, 2 plus 2 is 4, and another crazy maths question...<br>I will start using the new nickname when my current account post hits 1450.</div>

I also like TIB 1224Y <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> , but too bad I haven't taken it. I really wanted to take this bus and/or take a nice photo of this bus. If it cameos on Service 67, 180 or 190, can someone send me a SMS? Request for my handphone number by sending a PM to me.<br><br>For mine, I have a various list of names to choose from.
