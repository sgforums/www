            <div class='col-md body'>Ever since IÂ’ve heard of the word Â‘circumcisionÂ’ at the age of 10 years old, IÂ’m starting to wonder what the hell is that when the boys were talking about it. My Malay friend told me that it was just a cut of your penis foreskin for their culture but not so common for the Chinese. I remembered my foreskin was a bit long which covered my whole glans but able to pull back without pain.<br><br>As I live in a conservative family background, circumcision will never been discussed. Therefore, this circumcision thing has slipped out of my mind as time gone by.<br><br>At about the age of 24, IÂ’m still serving NS then where you are spoon fed, nothing to do, etc. Â‘Circumcision came back to my mind when I was looking at my penis while bathing. My glans was half way exposed during an erection. I went to Internet to do some researches about it and give it a thought. Finally, I decided to do it, as I wanted to have a new smooth, tight foreskin and expose glans, which I feel so erotic when IÂ’m imagined it.<br><br>At about early Oct 2000, I went to SGH Urological Department to have my very first consultation through my medical officer recommendation. Initially, the male doctor told me that my foreskin is normal but I told him I insisted to have circumcision done. He then reply ok and will fix a date for me. I also told him I want to have tight foreskin and have my frenulum removed so that it wonÂ’t pull my glans after circumcision.<br><br>Actual day on mid of Oct 2004, I have my penis circumcised. It was a half day surgery (under local anesthesia). It was subsidized although it cost $400 plus. I was lying on a bed with my lower part of my body naked. I looked down and saw my penis was bandaged.<br><br>It took 14 days to heal. 1st 7 days will be quite painful unless you wear loose shorts. My glans was swollen which worry me that I thought I got an infection. So I went to Polyclinic to have my penis a check up. Fortunately, the doctor said itÂ’s normal and sent me to a nurse for some dressing to be done.<br><br>ItÂ’s my 1st time for my penis totally exposed to a female. I tried my best to look at the ceiling, trying to distract myself. But I failed to do so when the nurse touch my penis when changing my dressing.<br><br>To all guys out there to have an erection in the morning considerably normal but not me. I still have the sutures around the cut-scar. I can feel for the first time that my foreskin was pulling away from my glans without using my hands. I felt so eroctic except the pressure around the cut-scar.<br><br>All the sutures had dissolved after 14 daysÂ…..for the first time IÂ’m able to take a good look at my new penis. My foreskin feel so smooth and less sensitive cos most of my inner foreskin was cut off. IÂ’m very proud of my exposed glans. My penis measured 6.5 inches long and 1.5 inches thick.<br><br>My girlfriend love my penis especially my exposed glans which she canÂ’t resist to blow my tool. She has described my penis smooth to touch and clean at all time.<br><br>For those who had read my data, feel free to ask Q? I have photos for your viewing if you want to.<br><br></div>
