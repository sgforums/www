            <div class='col-md body'>casino main point is gambling. gambling needs $$. gambling is addictive. i have seen many results of hardcore gambling. not a good sight. gambling can cause the richest man to be a pauper withing days. watched the gambling show made in sg. a young guy around 20 years old, have enough $$ to retire at that age, but due to gambling, he lost it all. they say gambling out of 10 times win 1 time only. not true. as u will win lesser than that. when u gamble, even if u have no $$, u will find money to gamble. and they always have the mentality that they can win, which will cause them to lose more. so i say, if casino is build in sg, sg will see the increase of rich men turn poor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not about 'should' or 'should not'... You think they care about what ya say....?<br><br>Yesterday in the news, I heard one of the ministers(?) say.. "Don't care about who's earning more $ and who's earning less $ now... We should be more FOCUSED on building Singapore's future... Think about who's leading you now....." (or something like that) I ALMOST LAUGHED MY HEAD OFF....<br><br>SAME OLD THING as what they said during the ELECTION... We wanna be more FOCUSED with helping people find their jobs... Which in the end, they just told people it's their own job to upgrade themselves and find job... How convenient?</div>
