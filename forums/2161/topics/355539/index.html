              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Check out these far-flung dining destinations away from the crowds. By <strong>Belinda Wan </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/449/6-11-feature1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;">According to various studies, Singapore is one of the most crowded cities to live in, alongside other cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong. That’s a fact of life here; but when dining out, no one wants shoals of people coming into the restaurant every few minutes; waiting long periods for their food due to the restaurant’s bursting capacity, or loads of noise from truckloads of diners that makes conversation impossible—common things you experience at popular restaurants. <br>  Which explains why far-out dining destinations are fast springing up and burgeoning in popularity (remember the impact of Dempsey and Rochester Park when they first burst onto the scene?). These places often boast interesting ambiances; and are sometimes more affordable than restaurants in prime areas. Here’s<em> I-S</em>’ pick of the best, off-the-beaten-track restaurants to visit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>To Water, To Water</strong><br>Most of us are unable to resist the allure of dining by water. After all, what better way to forget the big, bad world than with an intimate wind-down dinner by the sea or harbor? These restaurants are a great bet for big fans of waterside dining. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Braise </strong><br><em>60 Palawan Beach Walk, Sentosa, 6271-1929.</em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>A fine dining European restaurant in Sentosa. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Expect a romantic and intimate ambiance at this glass-paneled restaurant close to the beach. But bring a shawl—it can get really cold indoors. <strong>The food:</strong> Loads of meat. Try the beef carpaccio with capers, onion and tuna sauce ($26); capellini with seared Hokkaido scallops, parmesan veloute ($26); and Pork Three Ways ($42).<br><strong>How to get there:</strong> Nearest MRT is HarbourFront. From MRT, take a bus or monorail to the Beach Station. Walk 10 minutes to reach Amara Sanctuary Resort.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Mana Mana Beach Club</strong><br><em>1212 East Coast Parkway, Area E, 6339-8878. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>A watersports club, Mana Mana Beach Club has a good feel about it.<br><strong>The vibe: </strong>A relaxing one that you can totally chill out to (Note: Even though this is a club you don’t have to be a member). The Italian and Western food is also unbelievably cheap, and the sea breeze blowing through your hair will ensure that you look (and feel) chic as well.<br><strong>The food: </strong>Unpretentious and hearty. Try the herb-crusted salmon ($16), baby back ribs ($16), Mana Mana burger ($10), chicken roulade ($15) and warm lava cake ($10.50). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Nearest MRT is Bedok. Take bus 196 or 197, alight at Eastern Lagoon Condominium and use the underpass to ECP. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Prive</strong><br><em>Marina at Keppel Bay, 2 Keppel Bay Vista, 6776-0777. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>Set up by Michel Lu and Oeij Yuan Siang, the 88-seater Prive (it means “privacy” in French) is a cool mix of a bar, bakery and gastrobar. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>What’s really charming about Prive is of course, the view—cross a bridge that is gorgeously lit at night; gaze at yachts in the harbor and take in a lovely night view of the condos opposite. The bar outdoors has large lounge sofas and huge potted plants, and the fine dining restaurant is all New York minimalist chic indoors. <br><strong>The food: </strong>Dig into Continental offerings like the poached Hokkaido scallop lasagne ($38), roast boneless quail with foie gras and spinach ($38); and the molten center chocolate souffle ($18). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Nearest MRT is HarbourFront. From the MRT, take a taxi or walk 20 minutes. Or take buses 10, 30, 97, 131, 145, 166, 143, 100, 57 to Telok Blangah Road and alight at bus stop after Seah Im Road. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Silk Road of the Sea</strong><br><em>60 Palawan Beach Walk, Sentosa, 6377-4248. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>Silk Road of the Sea is the seafood-oriented cousin of the established Silk Road Restaurant.<br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Very laidback and resort-like. Located right by Palawan Beach, Silk Road of the Sea has an idyllic vibe, and a lovely view of the blue sea and skies. Sit indoors for air-conditioned comfort, or go alfresco to soak in more of the beach feel. <br><strong>The food: </strong>Tracing the South China/Mediterranean journey of Marco Polo, there are loads of seafood offerings here, and Szechuan, Liaoning, Shaanxi and Beijing cuisines (plus Mediterranean, Indonesian and Thai influences) that replicate his historic route. Must-tries are the crab in Sichuan dried chili and peppercorn ($3.80 per 100 grams); garoupa in Sichuan hot and spicy beancurd ($7.50 per 100 grams) and stir-fried prawns in wasabi sauce coated with shredded potato ($21). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Nearest MRT is HarbourFront. From MRT, take a bus or monorail to the Beach Station. Walk 10 minutes to reach Amara Sanctuary Resort.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Offbeat Offerings</strong><br>Sometimes, you cherish a place for the particular feel it has—especially a random, off-kilter, slightly elusive feeling that makes you feel you’re not really in busy Singapore, but somewhere exciting and off-the-radar. These restaurants (all in Bukit Timah) have an indie feeling about them, for diners who want to escape without going too far. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Don Quijote Spanish Restaurant (NEW)</strong><br><em>#01-09, 17 Lor. Kilat, 6465-1811. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>Don Quijote is one of the latest and best places for tapas, and is tucked away off the beaten track. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Quiet and tranquil. Located just off the Upper Bukit Timah Road, Don Quijote is comfortably far from everything.<br><strong>The food: </strong>Expect a wide range of Spanish tapas and paella. Tapas comprise usual suspects like Spanish meatballs, sauteed mushrooms and garlic prawns. Don’t miss the tabla de Don Quijote (mixed platter of ham, sausages and cheese, $30); almejas a la marinera (clams in garlic, onion and white wine “Quijote” sauce, $19), rabo de toro (oxtail stew, $28) and paella Don Quijote special ($36-80). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Nearest MRT is Clementi. Take bus 171 and alight at bus stop at Jalan Jurong Kechil. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Firestation Hillside Gastrobar (NEW)</strong><br><em>274 Upper Bukit Timah Rd., 6465-0600. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>Located in a disused part of an old firestation, Firestation Hillside gastrobar is a novel dining experience. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>After you’ve finally found the place (a bit of a challenge as it’s quite hidden), you’ll love the respite you get from the concrete jungle. Most of the space here is alfresco—diners sit on the large wooden patio out front and the charming little back garden is perfect for a spot of chilling with a beer. <br><strong>The food: </strong>No fancy fare here—the menu consists of tapas, pizzas, salads, soups, pastas, main courses and desserts. The ambiance, not the grub, is more the hook here. However, the Hoegaarden beer battered fish and chips ($18), smoked duck pizza ($22), Firestation gourmet burger ($24) and grilled tenderloin ($30) are good to try. <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>From town, take buses 67, 75, 170, 184, 852, 961, 171 or 173, and alight at the bus stop opposite the old firestation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Raw Kitchen Bar (NEW)</strong><br><em>276 Bukit Timah Rd., 6467-3987. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>A fusion restaurant hidden in Bukit Timah, and situated right next to Firestation. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Adorned with paintings, raw concrete walls and quirky mismatched furniture, the place feels like someone’s zany home. The warm, cozy service plays a part too. Co-owner Javier is a personable kind of guy, so don’t be surprised if he starts chatting to you. Both indoor and alfresco options are available.  <br><strong>The food: </strong>A funky mix of Japanese, Thai and Italian. Have a go at the seared tuna ($14), salt and pepper squid ($8), crispy duck ($24) and the tenderloin ($32).<br><strong>How to get there: </strong>From town, take buses 67, 75, 170, 184, 852, 961, 171 or 173, and alight at the bus stop just opposite the fire station.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Pastoral Paradise </strong><br>Stop bemoaning the fact that Singapore is a cold jungle of steel and glass—there are nice eateries nestled in far-flung locations with a tranquil pastoral vibe. You have to travel a little bit to get to these restaurants, but fortunately in Singapore nothing is really very far away. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Cicada</strong><br><em>7 Portsdown Rd., 6472-2100. </em><br><strong>In brief:</strong> Another Michel Lu venture, Cicada is located in the leafy confines of Portsdown Road, and serves a cool mix of Californian and French cuisine.<br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Imbued with a cozy, private feel, this is the place to carry out your secret dates—it’s pretty much removed away from the crazy hustle-and-bustle of Orchard Road. Check out the patio that comes with a retractable awning—plus a lawn that takes up a staggering 6,000 square meters of garden space. <br><strong>The food: </strong>We recommend the crab Caesar salad ($15.60), tuna salad ($15.90), The Infamous Cicada Burger ($28.90), slipper lobster capellini ($27) and the peanut butter chocolate brownie crunch cake ($13). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Nearest MRTs are Commonwealth and Buona Vista. It’s advisable to hop into a cab from there. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Mimolette Restaurant &amp; Bar </strong><br><em>55 Fairways Dr., 6467-7748. </em><br><strong>In brief:</strong> Serving up American cuisine, Mimolette is a hidden gem in Fairways Drive. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>This small, intimate setup is great for those who are a little old-world and romantic at heart. Mimolette is infused with a rustic tranquility and a distinct pastoral feel that reminds one of Dempsey but without the crowds. It almost feels like countryside here, and it’s a fab idea to go alfresco to max out your experience.<br><strong>The food: </strong>The pan-fried foie gras ($28), pan-seared Angus tenderloin ($40), slow cooked roasted rack of lamb ($38) and benoffi pie ($16) are recommended. Quick tip: Mimolette is popular for brunch, and is open till midnight on Tue-Sat for drinks. <br><strong>How to get there:</strong> Take a cab. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Ristorante Pietrasanta </strong><br><em>#10-03, 5B Portsdown Rd., 6479-9521. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>Also a Portsdown Road resident, this restaurant dishes out good, authentic Tuscan chow and is relatively new in the dining scene. <br><strong>The vibe:</strong> Rustic and cozy—think pottery, and wooden tables and chairs. The ambiance is unpretentious but absolutely delightful. <br><strong>The food: </strong>Check out the Angus T-bone steak (less than $150 for 1.1 kilograms), pan-fried snails ($13.90), squid-ink tagliolini with tomato sauce and crab meat ($24.90) and bistecca Fiorentina ($54). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Nearest MRTs are Commonwealth and Buona Vista. Hop into a cab from there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Go Green </strong><br>Singapore prides itself on being a garden city and a “tropical paradise,” but it’s surprisingly hard it is to find an outdoor restaurant in the city that has lots of greenery. They do exist, however, at these places. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Casa Verde (NEW)</strong><br><em>Singapore Botanic Gardens, Visitors Centre, 1 Cluny Rd., 6467-7326. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>The newish Casa Verde is a collaboration between Les Amis Group; and Oscar and Tracy Pasinato, the couple behind the ever-popular Buko Nero.<br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Casa Verde has won half the battle with its beautiful park location. But if you’re a stickler for privacy, do note that this place is packed most of the time, especially during weekends when families and pooches descend. That’s when the service somewhat struggles to keep up. <br><strong>The food: </strong>The straightforward menu comprises salads, pastas, pizzas, mains and Asian dishes. We like the delicious bacon burger ($15) and the spaghetti carbonara ($15). At night the menu changes into a trattoria one, with wood-fired oven pizzas being the highlight. <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>From Holland Road, take buses 7, 105, 123, 174, 75, 77 and 106; from Bukit Timah Road, take buses 66, 151, 153, 154, 67 and 171. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Halia Restaurant </strong><br><em>Ginger Garden, Singapore Botanic Gardens, 1 Cluny Rd., 6476-6711.</em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>Also in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Halia serves Continental and Asian cuisine. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Halia is worth visiting for its good food and getaway-from-the-city feel. Blessed with a gorgeous location, this is an excellent place for a leisurely meal amid loads of greenery on the shaded deck (or you can also head for the air-conditioned indoors). Villa Halia, its extension, houses a wine bar, an alfresco courtyard and a gallery room. <br><strong>The food: </strong>Continental and Asian touches crossover nicely in dishes like the crisp black pepper soft shell crab with wasabi aioli (lunch $14, dinner $18), pepper-crusted tuna tataki (lunch $15, dinner $24), shrimp satay (lunch $17, dinner $20) and “teh tarik halia” sorbet (dinner only, $11). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>From Holland Road, take buses 7, 105, 123, 174, 75, 77 and 106; from Bukit Timah Road, take buses 66, 151, 153, 154, 67 and 171.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>KHA </strong><br><em>#02-02, 33 Hyderabad Rd., 6476-9000. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>KHA is a modern Thai restaurant located in the lovely HortPark.<br><strong>The vibe: </strong>It doesn’t get greener than the lush and very pretty HortPark. KHA certainly scores for effort: There’s nice greenery, and a pretty alfresco area. Try to go alfresco—there is a stunning view that you can’t really see from the minimalist interior. <br><strong>The food: </strong>It’s all traditional Thai food executed with a modern twist. Check out the spicy grilled salmon soufflÈ on lemongrass ($16), Thai crab and prawn cakes ($16) and roasted duck red curry ($27). <br>How to get there: Take buses 166, 100, 97, 61 and 51. KHA is a five-minute walk from the main road.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>La Villa (NEW)</strong><br><em>341 River Valley Rd., 6836-5286.</em> <br><strong>In brief: </strong>This is the addition to the Senso Group, located in the old River Valley Primary School. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>The interior is tranquil-overlooking a small garden and field, with tables outside where you can dine alfresco. It’s really pretty hip, and with the luxury watch and jewelry companies that have taken up residence here, elegant too. Parking here is plentiful—a wonderful bonus. <br><strong>The food: </strong>Great bets include the La Villa salad ($18), homemade pappardelle with Italian pulled pork ($18) and the La Villa pizza ($18). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Take the MRT to City Hall (Orchard station is closer but harder to get to the restaurant from). At City Hall, take Exit B and take buses 32 or 195.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Olive Ristorante</strong><br><em>Labrador Park, 30 Labrador Villa Rd., 6479-2989. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>Serving up European and Italian food, Olive Ristorante is in the lovely confines of Labrador Park. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Getting here involves some effort if you’re not in a car—you have to huff and puff up the steep and winding Labrador Villa Road. But Olive Ristorante at the top is lovely; exuding romantic, escapist rustic charm with its simple wood furnishings and lush surroundings. <br><strong>The food:</strong> Not too bad—try the rack of lamb ($37), tenderloin ($35) and duck leg confit ($32). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Nearest MRT is HarbourFront. From there, take buses 10, 51 and 143. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Suburbia </strong><br><em>30 Allanbrooke Rd., Sentosa., 6376-5938. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>Run by the guys behind Wine Network in Dempsey, Suburbia is a chic restaurant in the old two-storey Ficus Station (a stop on Sentosa’s monorail). <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Housed in a glass-paneled building, Suburbia is flanked on both sides by tons of greenery. The vibe here is soothing and intimate—yet smart and stylish. <br><strong>The food: </strong>The soft shell crab linguine ($22), filo pastry escargots ($16), Australian lamb rack ($34) and chocolate mille feuille ($12) are signatures. <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Take the Sentosa monorail from VivoCity and alight at Imbiah station. Take the bus (yellow-line) to Ficus Tree bus stop.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Verve Bar &amp; Bistro (NEW)</strong><br><em>Blk. 7, Lock Rd., Gillman Village, 6473-3655. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>The erstwhile Turquoise Room has now morphed into this restaurant that serves European cuisine. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Turquoise Room’s garish hues have been replaced with a more subtle look—stucco white walls and black trimmings contrasting nicely with the abundant greenery. <br><strong>The food: </strong>Some of Verve’s specialties are the calamari ($16), confit of duck fettucine ($28), fillet steak ($38) and pork rack with parma ham and asparagus ($36). <br><strong>How to get there:</strong> Take buses 57, 61, 100, 97 and 166. Verve is a five-minute walk from the main road.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The White Rabbit </strong><br><em>39c Harding Rd., 6473-9965.</em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>The new darling of Dempsey, The White Rabbit is opened by the cool folks behind Loof and OverEasy. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>The White Rabbit is housed in a restored Ebenezer chapel with stained glass windows, a high ceiling replete with a slightly old-world, rustic—but hip—feel. We like the alfresco space that overlooks a small grassy area—perfect for Sunday brunch. <br><strong>The food: </strong>Their thing is everyday food made extradordinary: Try signature offerings like The White Rabbit mac and cheese ($28), chicken and duck liver parfait ($19) and Tournedos Rossini ($45). Although this restaurant is most popular for dinner, if you come for lunch, you get a daily set for great value.<br><strong>How to get there: </strong>From town, take buses 7, 77 and 106.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Food with a View</strong><br>In any dense urban center, top views are prized and sought after. It’s no different with restaurants, and here are some set in beautiful locations that come with stunning vistas. Check these out.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The Cliff </strong><br><em>The Sentosa Resort &amp; Spa, Sentosa, 2 Bukit Manis Rd., 6371-1425. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>The Sentosa Resort &amp; Spa’s most famous restaurant, The Cliff is well-known for its jaw-dropping views and top notch cuisine by its Chef de Cuisine sand firmament Shawn Armstrong. <br><strong>The vibe:</strong> Romantic, elegant and endowed with a sweeping view of the sea, this dimly-lit, fine dining restaurant is where you go to celebrate a special occasion. The balcony booths and the bar have the best view.<br><strong>The food:</strong> Armstrong is still going strong with signature dishes that you should not miss like the shelled mangrove crab ($29), roasted “true” cod ($72) and the souffle ($18). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Take the bus or train (alight at HarbourFront) to Sentosa and take the monorail. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Empress Jade (NEW)</strong><br><em>The Jewel Box, 109 Mount Faber Rd., 6377-9689.</em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>Perched atop The Jewel Box, Empress Jade specializes in old school Chinese cooking with a touch of contemporary class.<br><strong>The vibe: </strong>With a full-glass enclosure, generous use of expensive Japanese wood, and a stunning view of the sea, cable cars in the distance and the entire HarbourFront precinct, this one’s a must-visit. If you don’t drive, it can be hard to get to, but the splendid view justifies it. <br><strong>The food: </strong>Conceptualized by renowned Consultant Chef Jereme Leung and inspired by traditional Singapore Chinese cuisine, the menu features timeless favorites like the paper wrapped salt-baked chicken ($24 per portion), fried king prawns “har lok” ($28 per portion) and the pork liver with spring onions and ginger in claypot ($16 per portion). <br><strong>How to get there: </strong>Take the MRT to HarbourFront. Then take a quick cab ride. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Far Out</strong><br>If you feel like really getting away, these really out-of-the-way places should do the trick. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Admiral Bar &amp; Grill </strong><br><em>#01-02 Admiral Hill, 345A Old Nelson Rd., 6257-1184. </em><br><strong>In brief: </strong>A steak and grills joint located in Sembawang. <br><strong>The vibe:</strong> Located near the MRT station and resting on Admiral Hill, Admiral has a comfy vibe and nice alfresco area with much greenery.
