              <p><em>This Eastern enclave has much, much more to offer than sex and food. By 
              Ramesh William and Arman Shah</em></p>
              <p>Geylang has been hijacked. For far too long. For most of you, it’s a 
              veritable hellhole of quick-buck hookers on social-visit passes, sneaky 
              ruffian-like pimps with equally suspicious hairdos, hand-holding same-sex 
              jaywalkers, backlane-hogging drug peddlers and fight-itchy gangsters with 
              tattoos the size of a bus. But not only is that the view from the outside 
              looking in, it’s merely a small slice of Geylang. <br>For Geylang is not just 
              about the pink-lit even-numbered lorongs, it’s also about the colorful, cultural 
              scenes at Geylang Serai; the charms of bygone-era shopping malls like City Plaza 
              and Tanjong Katong Complex; the solidly middle-class enclave of Geylang East 
              with its condos; and Geylang Bahru, a sleepy little HDB estate whose 
              ordinariness (being ordinary can be awesome) is the complete antithesis of the 
              mainstream notion of Geylang. And with the newly baptized Circle Line offering 
              easier access from the city to Paya Lebar MRT station, getting under the skin of 
              the real Geylang has just gotten a lot easier.</p>
              <h3><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/508/F1-Geylang-Serai-Hawker.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Geylang Serai</h3>
              <p>A short hop, skip and a dance away from Paya Lebar MRT station, this has 
              traditionally been a buzzing Malay enclave. First populated when Malay fishermen 
              began settling at the mouth of the Geylang River nearby, Geylang Serai’s 
              importance grew when mills and factories began sprouting in the area in the 
              second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is commonly accepted that the word 
              “Geylang” is derived from the Malay word “kilang,” which means factory. <br><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/508/F1---Geylang-Serai.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">Although Geylang Serai had a tumultuous history in the 
              years leading up to Singapore’s independence—with bombs going off as part of 
              Indonesian President Sukarno’s Confrontasi campaign and communal riots—it has 
              since evolved into a culturally vibrant enclave in Singapore. Aside from the 
              landmark Geylang Serai Market, it is perhaps most famous for its Hari Raya night 
              markets and street light-ups during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.</p>

              <p>At the Geylang Serai Market, we found dressmaker <strong>Esah binte 
              Hashim</strong>, who runs Manis Collection (#02-24), a clothes-cum-tailor 
              shop—making everything from Haj wear to male and female baju kurungs—in the 
              market. She says, “I’ve been here 18 years and I like Geylang Serai because it 
              has everything I want.”</p>
              <p><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/508/F1-Geylang-Serai-kebab.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">Stall-owner <strong>Syed Ali</strong>, a Singaporean of 
              Yemeni descent, has had a stall—Fhoul Madinah Istimewa (#02-114)—here since the 
              1950s selling local Malay and Middle Eastern fare. “It’s nice to see old faces 
              and friends here,” he said. “It may be a brand new building but nothing beats 
              the nostalgia of the place.”</p>

              harrumphed when we asked him—fella’s been here 30 years—what the draw of Geylang 
              Serai was. “That’s why I’m here!”</p>

              (#02-169) stall. <br><strong>2</strong> Digest some historical nuggets at 
              information boards on the market’s second floor.<br><strong>3</strong> Sip on 
              some seriously delicious cendol at Cendol Geylang Serai (#02-107).

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Did You know?</strong> From 1910-1927, Geylang Serai was the eastern 
              terminal for Singapore’s first tramline service.</p>
              <h3>City Plaza/Tanjong Katong Complex</h3>
              <p>Everyone loves a good relic. And boy oh boy, do we have some absolute 
              dinosaurs on our hands here. Stepping into either of these shopping venues will 
              take you back in time to the early 1980s when these two places were as 
              cutting-edge as ION Orchard is today. In fact, the whole area was a thriving 
              commercial hub right from the 1970s, especially when Emporium department store 
              was on the corner of Haig Road and Geylang Road. <br>Tanjong Katong Complex was 
              best known for having Singapore’s first 24-hour supermarket, the Japanese chain 
              outlet Yokoso. Situated at Shop n’ Save’s present location, this bit the dust 
              after a short while; well in an era where 24/7 grocery shopping was as 
              ridiculous as a dude in a skirt, this probably wasn’t a surprise. Today it 
              houses an array of small stores selling everything from home furnishings, to 
              jewelry and vintage CDs. <br>Like its neighbor City Plaza across the street, its 
              humdrum existence is turned on its head every Sunday when thousands of 
              Indonesian migrant workers throng its corridors, giving the place a vibrant, 
              almost electric atmosphere; there are even outdoor impromptu open-mic singing 
              sessions for those who are up for it (usually in Bahasa Indonesia). <br>City 
              Plaza has a niche to it—ladies’ wear. From tops to dresses, bags and shoes, 
              there’s no shortage of bargains to be had here from small, independent 
              boutiques. Plus you can haggle over the price if you find it a bit on the high 
              side. <br>If you like crowds then weekends are the best time to visit, as the 
              place buzzes with all sorts of bargain hunters, foodies and people exchanging 
              currency at its numerous money changers.</p>
              <h3><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/508/F!---Rachmat.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Word on the Street</h3>
              <p><strong>Rachmat Suswantho</strong>, who does traditional Malay calligraphy 
              from his Sufia’s Gallery (#02-33 Tanjong Katong Complex), says he is one of the 
              last practitioners of the art around. Rachmat has been writing calligraphy on 
              framed mirrors (some pieces can fetch as high as a few thousand dollars) for 
              seven years after 25 years as a loadmaster at Singapore Airlines. “Since my 
              teacher passed away, there are only six or seven of us left in Singapore,” he 
              says. “I thrive on word-of-mouth; people around the world who want this know 
              that there’s only one shop here doing it and that’s mine.”</p>

              <p><strong>Did You know?</strong> First Lady at Tanjong Katong Complex was 
              created by the owners of Second Chance to replace the latter. Second Chance, as 
              many of you may recall, was a popular kids and menswear chain in the 1980s which 
              folded in 1992.</p>

              <p>You could call this an exclave of Geylang; it’s closer to Little India than 
              it is to the other Geylangs. Some ask, “But is it really Geylang?” Of course, it 
              is. It says so in its name, for goodness sake! Formerly a kampong area, Geylang 
              Bahru was developed in the early 1970s into a residential-cum-industrial area, a 
              bit like Jurong. That legacy continues on through today with its heartland vibe 
              and cookie-cutter HDB blocks. It may look like it has all the trappings of a 
              non-descript neighborhood but scratch the surface and you’ll find a charming 
              estate full of (mostly older) characters, pawnshops, medicine halls, wonderful 
              bakeries (the waft of pandan cakes is everywhere), coffeeshops and a slew (in 
              every sense of the word) of massage and acupuncture outlets. It’s a quiet, 
              unassuming place where the old fogeys will stare at you before breaking into a 
              smile and wave.</p>

              here because of that, and also because it’s walking distance from my in-laws. I

              <p>The fact that Geylang has a neighborhood like this may come as a bit of an 
              eye opener to most. It’s relatively quiet; the condos and maisonettes reflect a 
              middle class area that minds its own business. There is a popular public 
              library, a polyclinic, a wet market and the Singapore Basketball Association 
              (SBA) has its headquarters—along with playing courts—here. It has a 
              non-threatening suburban feel and even has two temples, the Buddhist monastery 
              Foo Hai Ch’an and the Hindu Sri Sivan temple. <br><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/508/F1-Geylang-East-prayer.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">The Singapore Disability Sports Council recently 
              organized a power soccer (a variation of soccer played by the severely disabled 
              in wheelchairs) clinic, featuring both local and overseas players at the SBA’s 
              premises. “It’s nice to get out here to Geylang and play power soccer with some 
              of the best international players in the world,” says Law Yean Cheng, a player 
              on the Singapore team who has spinal muscular atrophy.</p>

              <p>Shopkeeper <strong>Mr. Tan</strong>, owner of Hoe Leong Minimart (Blk 134 
              Geylang East Ave 1) has been here since 1986, when it was a brand new estate. “I 
              moved here after my old shop (we were there since 1952) on Still Road was 
              demolished to make way for new developments,” says the 77-year-old. “After 
              renting it for a few years, I bought it from the HDB for around $50,000.” Mr. 
              Tan, whose father was also a shop owner, naturally reminisces about the good old 
              days when business was better.</p>

              One of them puts it succinctly, “He knows what I want and the way I want it.”

              other barbers and relocated here from Circuit Road in 1997. He chose Geylang 
              East because it’s “central” and says Geylang is both heaven and hell: “Heaven, 
              because there are so many temples in the area and hell because there are just so 
              many prostitutes all over the place.”</p>

              <p><strong>Did You know?</strong> The nearby Geylang Fire Station was built in

              <p>OK, we saved the worst for last. This is what gives Geylang its rep, its 
              street cred. It’s noisy, seductive, dirty (in many ways), hostile and quite fun. 
              The food is great, the sex shops are underwhelming and Bangladeshi fruit and veg 
              stores do a roaring trade. Every night its lorongs (streets) throng with 
              freelance hookers and all kinds of hangers-on, from bodyguards to ice-cream 
              vendors.<br>The area is also chockfull of hourly rated hotels (names 
              unnecessary) where occupants, it can be safely said, don’t spend their one hour 
              playing Boggle. It’s a tourist must-see and yet you won’t find it in any 
              visitors’ brochure. But take it from us: You don’t know the real Singapore until 
              you visit this part of Geylang.</p>
              <h3><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/508/F1-Geylang-Lorong-sex.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Word on the Street</h3>
              <p>Our pimp backed out. We were scheduled to interview him, but he got cold feet 
              and thought we were the police. Us? So we had to move on and tried to interview 
              and photograph a streetwalker, but we almost got beaten up and had to hurriedly 
              scratch up an “Oh, we’re tourists from Malaysia” excuse. It was duly bought and 
              we beat a hasty retreat. Moral of the story: Don’t take photographs openly here 
              and don’t just poke your nose anywhere … the place is full of lookouts, pimps 
              and gangsters.</p>
              <h3>The Hi-5</h3>
              <p><strong>1</strong> The beef noodles at Geylang Lorong 9 (237 Geylang Lor 
              9).<br><strong>2</strong> The dim sum at Mongkok (214 Geylang Rd.). 
              <br><strong>3</strong> Watch a football game at Geylang Field (Lorong 
              10).<br><strong>4 </strong>Go prawning at Geylang Prawn Fishing (#01-13 former 
              Singapore Badminton Hall, 100 Guillemard Rd., 9182-7217). <br><strong>5 </strong>Well, get laid—and then have some durians.</p>
              <p><strong>Did You know?</strong> Even-numbered lorongs in Geylang are where the 
              brothels are located. The brothels have a larger-than-usual number sign in the 
              front, indicating that it is a house of pleasure.</p>
              <h3>Around the Corner</h3>
              <p><strong>While you’re there, check out what’s just a quick hop 
              away.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tanjong Katong Road</strong><br><strong>Circle Line MRT: Dakota; 
              10-min walk. </strong><br>There’s an old-world charm about this historic road 
              (it’s been in existence since the 1820s, and during the Japanese Occupation a 
              stretch of shophouses were used as comfort houses) which we absolutely love. 
              There are quaint bookshops, pet stores, yoga places and loads of good food to be 
              found here. Here are some definite must-try chows.</p>
              <p><strong>Punggol Nasi Lemak Centre</strong><br>Take the bustling Tanjong 
              Katong Road often enough and you’re bound to notice the perpetually long queue 
              snaking from Punggol Nasi Lemak Centre. Don’t be misled by the grandiosity of 
              its name; it’s just a nondescript stall without any air-conditioning, selling 
              arguably the best nasi lemak in the east. â€¯â€¯<br><strong>Where</strong>: 238 
              Tanjong Katong Rd., 6348-3303. Open Fri–Wed 5:30pm–2:30am.</p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/508/bombay-cafe.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">Bombay Café</strong><br>Vegetarians and lovers of Indian cuisine will 
              find this garish pink-fronted restaurant a delight. True to its name, it has 
              authentic Bombay street fare like gol gappa, or crunchy puffed semolina pastry 
              shells served with fillings and sauces. <br>Where: 334 Tanjong Katong Rd., 
              6345-0070. Open daily 11am–2:45pm, 6pm–10:15pm.</p>
              <p><strong>Madeleine’s Original Portuguese Egg Tart and 
              Puff</strong><br>Residents of Tanjong Katong swear by this. The delectable 
              Portuguese egg tarts are the bomb, with its filling full of rich custardy 
              goodness. <br><strong>Where</strong>: 198 Tanjong Katong Rd., 6247-9363. Open 
              daily 8am-5:30pm.</p>
              <p><strong>Kallang Leisure Park</strong><br><strong>Circle Line MRT: Stadium; 
              2-min walk. </strong><br>A stone’s throw from the red-light district of Geylang 
              is the latest hotspot in the city. The opening of Stadium Station on the newly 
              inaugurated Circle Line has given a fillip to this once sleepy nook. <br>With 
              easy accessibility, a state-of-the-art bowling alley in Kallang Bowl (#02-22, 5 
              Stadium Walk, 6345-0545), Kallang Ice World (#03-08, 5 Stadium Walk, 6348-1123), 
              the biggest ice-skating rink that tropical Singapore has ever seen, and 
              FilmGarde (#03-10/#03-15, 5 Stadium Walk, 6344-5997), this place is all set to 
              thrive.</p>
