              <p><span style="color: #003300;">Madrid is fast becoming one of the world’s coolest cities. </span><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Jill 
              Sara</span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"> returns from a recent visit with news on the hippest places to 
              shop, dine and stay.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/458/12-Travel.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;">Fall in love with Madrid all over again. This alluring, seductive and 
              flamboyant city has been described by Lonely Planet as “a rebellious ex-convent 
              schoolgirl who grew up, got sophisticated but never forgot how to have a good 
              time.” Come have a great time with her in the myriad of trendy shops, 
              restaurants, clubs and bars that bubble with imagination and creativity, and 
              whose free spiritedness and passion will cast a spell on you. Here’s more than a 
              peek at what to do in the 21st century capital of the Kingdom of Spain.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Boutiques<br>Alma Aguilar<br>Jorge Juan 12, Salamanca; 
              +34-91-5776-698. </span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><br>One of the more influential names in the fashion 
              world, Spanish designer Alma Aguilar has always epitomized fashion. With 
              brilliant and creative parents—her father was a jazz artist and her mum, a 
              painter—it is no surprise that she’s now a much sought-after designer. In 1999, 
              Aguilar opened her namesake boutique, and later her atelier, at Jorge Juan Alley 
              in the Salamanca district of Madrid. The décor is very feminine, glowing with a 
              soft pink hue. Comfortable chaise squares in the middle of the compact dressing 
              room are perfect for lounging and sipping champagne all afternoon while trying 
              on whatever you like from the racks.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">CH Carolina Herrera<br>16 Calle De Serrano, Salamanca; 
              +34-91-7814-380. </span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><br>It was only the most natural thing to do—open a 
              “home concept” boutique in Madrid’s gilded shopping district, Salamanca. The 
              double-story wood interior is decked with CH monogramed bags in a dozen colors, 
              the latest collection of dresses and wearable separates, and a custom-made horse 
              saddle in the girly section. The lower floor is a treasure trove for men. 
              Equipped with a pool table, champagne bar and rows of impeccably tailored shirts 
              and pants, it is simply unfathomable that any respectable hot-blooded male could 
              walk out of here empty-handed.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Stradivarius<br>C.C. Principe Pio, Paso de la Florida; 
              +34-91-5420-728. </span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><br>From the same style-makers who gave us Zara, Pull 
              &amp; Bear and Massimo Dutti, is homegrown label Stradivarius. Since 1994, the 
              youthful charisma of the Spanish brand has grown from strength to strength with 
              outposts in over 30 countries including Oman, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Ireland and 
              Jordan. Seasonal items are tagged at €39.95 for a trench coat, €79.95 for an 
              everyday leather jacket, calf-length and knee-high boots from €49.95-79.95, 
              handbags from €19.95 and accessories at less than €15. Clearly, the price for 
              looking good comes very affordable these days.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">H&amp;M<br>Calle Goya 81, Salamanca; +34-90-1120-084. </span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><br>Always fashion-forward and dabbling in the creative virtuoso of 
              celebrated British designer Matthew Williamson, H&amp;M presents the fashion 
              genius’ capsule collection for Summer 2009. Key details to look out for this 
              season are modern, Brit high-street and colorful prints. Not all 1,200 
              square-feet is dedicated to this one designer though; there are men’s and kids’ 
              sections, an accessories trove and shelves of accoutrements for ample 
              variety.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Restaurants<br>Arola Madrid Restaurant<br>National Museum Reina 
              Sof’a, Calle Argumosa 42; +34-91-4670-202. </span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><br>Opened in 2005 at a cool 
              €1 million, Arola Madrid Restaurant at Sofia Reina Museum exudes sexy overtones 
              of scarlet red in its ceiling and illuminated walls made of zinc and concrete. 
              The 150-seater is packed during lunch and brunch by hungry diners who come here 
              for the modern creations of Sergi Arola, who also happens to be one of the more 
              successful protégés of Ferran Adria of El Bulli fame and who was recently in 
              Singapore to cook at the World Gourmet Summit.</span></p>
              <div><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Pandelujo RestauranteJorge Juan 20, Salamanca; 
              +34-91-4361-100.</span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"> </span>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong></strong>Opened in 2006, this restaurant has since been dishing up 
              award-winning Chef Alberto Chicote’s Spanish food cooked traditional-style over 
              a charcoal fire, such as his fideuá (noodle paella) and Andalusian tuna. Tasty 
              fusion treats like curry-flavored chicken wings and herbed sushi-grade fish are 
              also served at this Salamanca joint where the fashion-savvy and corporate types 
              congregate for meals.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Tapas Bars<br>La Cruzada<br>Calle de la Amnist’a 8; +34-91-5480-131. </span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><br>Claimed to be the oldest tapas bar in Madrid, La Cruzada is known 
              far and wide for its generous selection of fine wines and visually stimulating 
              tapas. Croquettas, or small, fried and breaded potato pancakes, are the 
              must-order here. And it’s very friendly and laidback. Feel free to sit at the 
              bar and talk for hours with strangers, a skinny ciggie in one hand and a 
              swirling wine glass in the other. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Según Emma<br>Conde de Miranda 4; +34-91-5590-897.</span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><br>Once 
              the clock strikes nine in the evening, a buzzing social crowd gets underway in 
              Según Emma. This rustic, woody outfit holds captive to individuals in their mid 
              20s to older folks in their 50s. Besides Spanish wine, which is usually a few 
              Euros a glass and accompanied by complimentary tapas, the salmorejo wins over 
              the locals. This tomato-puree soup is flavored with garlic, vinegar and olive 
              oil and is served chilled, with bread. Not to be mistaken for gazpacho, this 
              soup the color of a sunset also contains Serrano ham and hard-boiled eggs. After 
              slurping up a coveted bowl, soak in the infectious atmosphere which goes on late 
              into the evening. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Casa Lucas<br>Calle Cava Baja 30; +34-91-3650-804. </span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><br>This 
              is a place where you can probably find very cute boys behind the bar. And more 
              than that—there’s tapas, pinchos (or pintxos) and raciones prepared in the 
              kitchen. Pinchos, meaning “spike” in Spanish, are presented with a toothpick, 
              while raciones on the other hand is generally double or triple the size of 
              tapas. Acknowledging that one size does not fit all, Casa Lucas displays a menu 
              written daily on a chalkboard, with items starting from €5.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Museo del Jamón<br>Carrere de San Jeronimo 6; +34-91-5210-346. </span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"><br>The reason why tapas-crawling Madrileños love this place is because 
              its extensive menu is value-for-money. With legs of preserved pork legs dangling 
              from the ceiling, one may be enticed to sink one’s teeth into bocadillos, which 
              are six-inch long baguettes stuffed with Spanish sausages and tomatoes. The full 
              menu can go on for quite a bit, and the serving portions range from hand-held to 
              whole platters of paella or jamón. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">How to get there: Singapore Airlines</span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"> flies to Barcelona 
              daily for about S$1,800 return, from where there are many air, road and rail 
              links to Madrid. Alternatively, you can fly Air France or KLM Royal Dutch 
              Airlines to Madrid, via Paris and Amsterdam, respectively, for about the same 
              price.<br></span><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Where to stay: De Las Letras Hotel,</span></strong><span style="color: #003300;"> Gran V’a 11; 
              +34-91-5237-980; </span><a title="www.hoteldelasletras.com" href="http://www.hoteldelasletras.com/"><span style="color: #003300;">www.hoteldelasletras.com</span></a><span style="color: #003300;">. <br>Hotel 
              De La Letras is a decadent boutique hotel with a literary profile. Lines of 
              literature are imprinted on bedroom walls, and the rest of the well-preserved 
              building is eclectically decorated in a rich, southern European style. 
              Oh-so-close to the shopping pulse of Gran Via and just a hop, skip and jump to 
              Stradivarius, Mango, Zara and a whole lot more fashionable high-street shops. 
              Online reservations are recommended as room rates can go as low as €180 per 
              night for basic room.<br></span><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Currency: </span></strong><span style="color: #003300;">Euros. 1€ = S$2. <br>For
