              <p id="paragrah">The historic Chinzan-so garden in Mejiro, Tokyo, has celebrated 
              fireflies as a gift of summer since 1954. To coincide with the firefly season, 
              from late May to late July, The Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Chinzan-so is 
              holding a variety of culinary fairs.</p>

              <p id="paragrah">Japanese restaurant Miyuki is offering a "Firefly Kaiseki" course 
              through June 30 that uses ingredients in season at the same time as fireflies 
              start to be seen in the garden — including sweet fish, Japan's premium summer 
              delicacy, pike eel and summer vegetables. The <em>kaiseki</em> course is ¥16,000 
              per person and is served from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. (last orders).</p>
              <p id="paragrah">A "Twilight Fantasy" set of champagne, chef's special plate, 
              choice of dessert and tea can be enjoyed at the Le Jardin lobby lounge for 
              ¥4,800 while twilight settles on the garden outside. The fantasy is available 
              through July 20, from 5 p.m. to midnight.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The banquet room is serving a "Weekend Buffet" (Fri., Sat., Sun.) 
              through July 19. The Japanese and Western buffet, with unlimited drinks, is 
              ¥10,920 on Fridays, and ¥11,970 on Saturdays and Sundays for adults, ¥6,300 for 
              elementary school children and ¥2,100 for children aged 2 and above. The buffet 
              is available from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. (from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on June 13, 27 and 
              July 11).</p>
              <p id="paragrah">And the main bar, Le Marquis, will be shaking — or stirring — 
              into life five refreshing champagne-based cocktails (created in the image of the 
              fascinating light of fireflies) for ¥1,800 each, through July 20. The bar is 
              open between 6 p.m. and midnight. The cocktails are also available at Le 
              Jardin.</p>

              <div id="subhead">Tempura, bubbly at Royal Park</div>
              <p id="paragrah">The Royal Park Hotel in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, is combining 
              traditional Japanese tempura with champagne for a special dinner on June 26 and 
              27.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">At the hotel's Japanese restaurant, Genjiko, a seven-dish 
              traditional Japanese course dinner, with seasonal seafood tempura, will be 
              paired with four different kinds of champagne. The hotel's sommelier, suitably 
              attired in a kimono, will be on hand to explain the varieties.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="paragrah">In addition, before the dinner, you can enjoy the Japanese art of 
              <em>kodo.</em> Kodo, meaning the "way of incense," is a relatively little-known 
              classical art compared to <em>sado</em> (tea ceremony) or <em>kado</em> (flower 
              arranging). A kodo master will demonstrate how to enjoy the art form with a game 
              of <em>Genji-ko,</em> which involves guessing the variety of incense by its 
              fragrance.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The dinner starts at 6:30 p.m. on June 26 and 6 p.m. on June 27 
              and costs ¥20,000 per person.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><em>The Royal Park Hotel is a five-minute walk from Ningyo-cho

              <p id="paragrah">Some major events in Kyoto during the campaign period include:
