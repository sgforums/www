Told me this car sure no problem all these what the car scare is over heat lor. Then after renting the car, hrs later, car broke down at expressway and the hood even got a lot of smoke coming out and engine just died like that. When open up the hood, inside the hood, here rusty there rusty still got hole in the rust and can see they use things to mend the rusty hole like silicon. anyway call that bastard, he told me to wait for the tow truck. 3 hrs later, finally the tow truck came and tow the car to the workshop. When i reach the workshop, i called that bastard again and he say why people drive the car no problem then you drive got problem. Then i shouted at him for making customer wait so long and he farking rude. after a long argument with him, finally he agreed to change another car but he says he wants to charge more as the car more ex. I mean what the fark is this your car spoilt and you made me wait and waste my time then still wanna charge me more. anyway got into another car and couldn't give a fark abt him.<br><br>Tomorrow is when i going to return the car so I pay his men extra $15 to pick the car up from my house. Then his men come and check the car and everything was ok so he return me my deposit and went home. After I reach home, his men called me say why i nevber tell him that henry that bastard help me call for tow truck and he needs me to pay him $70 for the tow truck service why I tell him " go and die " then later he find another fault again say my fuel take out is half tank why return him only less than half tank. Trust me bro b4 i return the car, i go pump it more than half tank liao. I think it's because he cannot get the $70 for the tow truck he bui song.<br><br>Guys, is you wanna rent a car, stay far far away from this one before you kena carrot. lucky i fierce enough or else they carrot me even futher. BTW, i took a pic of what is underneath the hood and show my friend who repair car and he says they never maintain their car so I guess they rent it out hoping you spolit it and have to pay.<br><br>REMEMBER STAY AWAY FROM:<br><br>Payless Car Rental ( A car rental company that will spolit your day )<br><br>Address :  50 East Coast Rd #02-69 Roxy Sq Singapore 428769<br>Telephone :  6348 0500<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
