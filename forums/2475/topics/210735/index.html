Note that I said 'trying' - because the fugging pizza never fuggin arrived. This is the story (This is the LOOONG version. Short version below):<br><br>1835: Called Canadian Pizza - redirected to 6th avenue outlet.<br><br>1835 - 1838: Told the female on the line that I wanted delivery. Gave her my order, telephone number and my address. I asked 'do you want my post code?' 'No', she answered.<br><br>-- at this point, alarm bells were ringing in my mind. What sort of incompetent buffoon would NOT want a post code? Would not a post code aid in delivery when, you know, things go wrong, like when you need to confirm an address maybe not now but in future? There is absolutely no harm in recording a postcode, absolutely no disadvantages that I can think of. But these ppl said 'no' -- Anyway, back to the story...<br><br>1835 - 1838: "Ok, your pizza will be with you in about 1hr to 90mins".<br><br>1938: - no sign of anyone -<br><br>2008: - no sign of anyone -<br><br>2038: I called canadian pizza to find out what is wrong. "Can I have your phone number?" said the voice on the other end. I gave her my number. "errrrm can I have your address?" I stated my address. Now here's the relevent part, "I AM SORRY SIR BUT I DO NOT HAVE YOUR ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER HERE IN MY SYSTEM - AND NO RECORD OF YOUR ORDER"<br><br>I was pissed now. Really really pissed. Let's face it. This is taking orders. Not terribly complicated. Still, I am not one without emphaty. So I listened on.<br><br>"If you give me your order we can dispatch it for you - IT WILL TAKE ABOUT 45 MINS"<br><br>- Fuc king Hell! 45 further minutes of my time?!?! Fu cking HELL! YOU WANT ME TO WAIT ANOTHER 45 MINUTES FOR YOU PIZZA SCUMBAG?!?! YOU F CUKED UP AND INSTEAD OF OFFERING TO DISPATCH THE ORDER WITH ALL THE SPEED YOU CAN MUSTER. YOU TELL ME TO WAIT?!!?! - that was me talking to myself in my head.  In reality, I simply told her that I wanted to cancel the order and asked her to find out who it was that took my order.<br><br>This is her reply "DUN THINK CAN BECAUSE THERE ARE 3 OPERATORS here you know -<br><br>- FUCKIN G MUTHER CUN TING CO CK - As I said, incompetent. WOWEEE - 3 - THREE operators. And you dun offer to make an effort? Here's the clue: call at 1835 - 1838, a 3 min window. Female. Likely Malay. And she dares to tell me that it cannot be done? You do not even make an effort to try?- As i said, incomeptent.<br><br>[b]Short Version</strong>: Canadian Pizza 6th Avenue Outlet = staffed by incompetent buffoons. Failed to despatch my pizza + inadequate response to error on their part. [/b]</blockquote></div>
