            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : One of the maids accused of killing her employer, Esther Ang, took to the stand on Monday and testified that she had endured months of abuse.<br><br>Her lawyer said Juminem was suffering from "reactive depression", and that the maid finally snapped because she was provoked and lost her self-control.<br><br>Called to the stand by the defence, Juminem said that the abuse began soon after she started work on 2 September 2003.<br><br>She said her employer, Esther Ang, scolded her daily and would fine her S$10 for every mistake she made.<br><br>Juminem recorded her unhappiness in her diaries, excerpts of which were read out in court.<br><br>She was also working at three homes -- at Esther Ang's home, Ang's sister Irene's place, and Ang's ex-husband's place.<br><br>In seven months, the maid's weight went down from 50 kg to 46.4 kg.<br><br>When asked why she had lost weight, Juminem replied that it was because she had no appetite as she was always too tired, had too much work and was stressed.<br><br>The defence argued that all these resulted in Juminem suffering from "reactive depression", which led to diminished responsibility for her actions.<br><br>The defence painted Esther Ang as a "fastidious woman", whose abusive and degrading treatment throughout Juminem's employment was like "water wearing down a rock".<br><br>Over the next few days, the defence will call their witnesses, including a psychiatrist to attest to Juminem's condition.<br><br>Juminem was calm as she gave her testimony.<br><br>Her voice was steady as she answered questions posed by her defence lawyer.<br><br>But unlike Esther Ang's immediate family members, who turned up in full force, Juminem and Siti Aminah, the other accused, had only two relatives at the hearing.<br><br>The trial continues on Tuesday. - CNA</div>
