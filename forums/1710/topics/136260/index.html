            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore's third most popular tourism icon, the Cable Car, is set for a major revamp.<br><br>It is all part of the redevelopment of the area comprising Sentosa, Harbourfront and Mount Faber to boost tourism in Singapore.<br><br>Singapore Cable Car, now renamed Mount Faber Leisure Group, also explained why it was taking so long for the cable car service to be resumed, after it was halted last week following a routine maintenance check.<br><br>The cable car service may be down, but that did not dampen spirits for their "Jewel Box" plans, a revamped version of the current cable car station.<br><br>The S$4 million iconic gem atop Mount Faber will be completed in October, but it won't stand alone.<br><br>Said Community Development, Youth &amp; Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, "We are repackaging Sentosa, Harbourfront, Mount Faber into a single precinct that will play an important role in supporting our Tourism 2015 vision. These three areas have many natural linkages and complement one another. If we develop this precinct synergistically, it will offer a compelling range of experiences for all visitors."<br><br>The area's natural surroundings will also be preserved.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said, "WeÂ’ve got to make sure that we don't lose connection with the past so when we come here, we walk here, we feel yes, this is the Mt Faber that I knew where I took romantic walks and so on."<br><br>Mount Faber also hopes to attract business travellers by providing meeting facilities, and a foreign group has signed up as its first client.<br><br>And the good old cable car isn't be forgotten either.<br><br>Those of you who are more adventurous and think the cable car ride is not exciting enough, you can look forward to a new concept ride which is similar to a ski ride.<br><br>It allows you to dangle your feet 90 metres above ground and will be ready by the end of this year.<br><br>Some 3,000 people ride the cable car each day but the company is not resuming service just yet, despite a go-ahead from its French consultants.<br><br>Service was halted after a routine check showed inconsistencies in the metal ropes.<br><br>Said Soo Kok Leng, chairman of the Mount Faber Leisure Group, "It's very important for us to get a second opinion, if you'd like to call it, from our own supplier of the cable so that we are sure the cable is indeed safe. Although they have told us it is safe, we want to be doubly sure before we carry on. You can also be assured because our staff ride on the cable car -- they too will want to be safe."<br><br>It hopes to resume service as soon as possible and expects the area to be thriving, especially in December, when the precinct will be spectacularly lit for the year-end holiday season.
