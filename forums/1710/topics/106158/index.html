            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore's white collar crime buster, the Commercial Affairs Department, has arrested China Aviation Oil's beleaguered chief executive, Chen Jiulin.<br><br>Chen returned to Singapore from China on Wednesday morning.<br><br>In a statement, the CAD said Chen has been placed under arrest and is currently assisting in investigations under the Securities and Futures Act.<br><br>When contacted, CAD would not say if any charges have been filed, except that "investigations are still ongoing".<br><br>China Aviation Oil stunned financial markets on November 30 by revealing that it had lost more than S$900 million from trading oil derivatives.<br><br>It has applied for court protection from creditors, while the CAD has started a probe into problems at the company.<br><br>Analysts say one aspect that the CAD could be probing is whether there had been insider trading at China Aviation Oil.<br><br>The key question is whether CAO knowingly misled investors by predicting record full-year profits when it unveiled its third quarter results in November, even as it chalked up massive losses from oil trades.<br><br>Another aspect is how the losses were allowed to balloon to crisis proportions without being disclosed or reflected in the company's accounts.<br><br>Court documents filed on behalf of suspended CEO Chen last week showed that CAO's Beijing-backed parent had sold a 15 percent stake in CAO on November 20.<br><br>This was 10 days after being told of the unit's financial losses.<br><br>Under the Securities and Futures Act, a listed company must not "intentionally" fail to disclose information required by the stock exchange.<br><br>Legal experts say an offence under this section could result in a fine of S$250,000 or a jail term of up to seven years, or both. - CNA<br><br></div>
