              <p>Hundreds stood anxiously outside the Ministry of Manpower at
              Havelock Road today as they witnessed a man perched precariously on the
              rooftop of the eight-storey building.</p>
              <p>It's believed the China national was attempting suicide.</p>
              <p>But Police coaxed him to safety one hour after he was first spotted.</p>
              <p>He was later arrested.</p>
              <p><em>Shaffiq Alkhatib</em> reports.<br> <br> It was a sight that caused many to break out in nervous sweat.</p>
              <p>The man was dangling his legs over the edge of the building -
              seemingly oblivious to the rescue effort that was taking place some 30
              metres below.</p>
              <p>SCDF officers inflated a large yellow lifepack the size of a small
              HDB bedroom directly beneath him to cushion his fall should he slip off
              the building.</p>
              <p>An eyewitness who called 938LIVE said, she saw the man on the rooftop at around 3pm.</p>
              <p>"I noticed that the police were erecting a cordon and all the people
              seem to be looking up so I looked up at the top of the building and so,
              what appeared to be a man sitting on the top of the building. So that's
              as much as what I saw as we drove past."</p>
              <p>Another eyewitness said he was outside nearby People's Park Centre when he spotted the man.</p>
              <p>"The guy was actually on the phone, on the rooftop the guy was on
              the phone. Then I informed the Police and Civil Defence after that."</p>
              <p>SCDF said it received a call about the case shortly before 3pm.</p>
              <p>It dispatched two support vehicles, two fire engines and an ambulance to the scene.</p>
              <p>The Manpower Ministry said, the man had approached it on five occasions on Monday on various employment issues</p>
              <p>MOM added, its officers had advised him accordingly on all his concerns.</p>
              <p>Investigations are still ongoing.</p>
