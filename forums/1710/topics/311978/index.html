              <h1>Raging seas, gales, and snow ... it must be a bank holiday weekend</h1>
              <p>In theory, spring has already sprung.</p>
              <p>But in reality, winter still has much of Britain in its icy grip  -  and it's going to get even tighter.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, high winds lashed many parts of the country while
              temperatures plummeted. It was a bitter prelude to what forecasters
              warn will be the worst Easter weather for a quarter of a century.</p>

              <p>Snowstorms are expected in to hit large swathes of eastern England and
              Scotland today and tomorrow, with up to six inches likely to settle.</p>
              <p>The cold conditions are due to continue into next week, threatening
              more travel chaos for the return home on Monday after many endured a
              nightmare Good Friday getaway.</p>
              <p>However, it was a mixed picture yesterday, with many parts of southern England enjoying bursts of glorious sunshine.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix//2008/03_03/snowTRAILL2103_468x331.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix//2008/03_03/snowTRAILL2103_468x331.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>White Easter: Snow hits Glenshee, Braemar and Cairngorms in Scotland yesterday</em></p>
              <p>Looking ahead, Paul Fox-Hughes from the Met Office said freezing
              northerly winds would bring snow in Scotland and the North-East and the
              eastern parts of England today.</p>
              <p>"Some of it will melt later in the day, but it will return again overnight so there will be a lot of snow on Easter Sunday.</p>
              <p>"In lowlying areas it is likely to be two inches, rising to up to six inches on higher ground."</p>
              <p>London is also expected see some snow, although it is unlikely to settle in the capital, he said.</p>

              <p>The South is expected to have wintry showers and be cooler than normal
              for this time of year, but escape lightly compared with other areas of
              the country.</p>
              <p>The last white Easter Sunday was in 1995, but this year is expected to see the heaviest snowfall since 1983.</p>
              <p>And the forecaster warned that, although less severe, the snowstorms
              and bad weather would continue after Sunday, causing more mayhem on the
              roads on Monday and for the return to work on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Yesterday there were dramatic scenes in the North-East with fierce winds whipping up a sandstorm on Tynemouth beach.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix//2008/03_03/tynemouthPA_468x253.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix//2008/03_03/tynemouthPA_468x253.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>Sand storm: Walkers get caught in freak conditions at Tynemouth beach, Tyne and Wear</em></p>

              <p>Meanwhile 50ft waves towered over the 33ft high Seaham lighthouse at the storm-lashed harbour in Seaham, Co Durham.</p>
              <p>On the Windsor racecourse in Berkshire, two circus spectators were
              injured when part of the big top collapsed as it was hit by a massive
              gust of wind.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of people were watching clowns and trapeze artists at Billy Smart's Circus when wind whipped through the tent.</p>
              <p>The performance came to an abrupt halt and more than 200 circus-goers were led to safety by the emergency services.</p>

              <p>The injured spectators were taken to hospital.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: "One side of the tent collapsed at 5pm during one of the performances.</p>
              <p>"Luckily no one was trapped in the tent and we already had officers at the scene."</p>
              <p>In London the Thames Barrier was closed and flood watches were put in
              force across the capital and Oxfordshire amid concerns about a deluge
              rushing inland from the North Sea.</p>
              <p>In Bournemouth, a few hardy souls wrapped up warm to take a stroll
              along the seven mile promenade despite temperatures dipping to 7C
              (45f).</p>

              <p>The scenes were a far cry from last Easter when thousands of people
              sunbathed on the sandy beach amid temperatures of 20C (68f).</p>
              <p>Supermarkets recorded a surge in demand for "winter warming fare" yesterday as shoppers settled in for the cold snap.</p>
              <p>Sales of casseroles, shepherd's pie, bangers and mash and soup were up
              by a fifth while traditional hot puddings rose by a quarter, according
              to Tesco. Whisky sales also shot up by 39 per cent.</p>
              <p>But there was little comfort for the millions heading off for the start
              of the long weekend yesterday with hellish conditions on the roads and
              railways.</p>

              <p>Heavy rain caused an eight car pile-up leading to delays lasting
              several hours on the M3 near Basingstoke while other crashes blocked
              the M27 and the A34 in Hampshire.</p>
              <p>Further problems were caused by roadworks on the M1 between junctions
              six and ten between St Albans and Luton, the M1 between junctions 26
              and 27 in Nottingham, the M4 from junctions 30 to 32 near Cardiff and
              the A74 at the Scottish border.</p>
              <p>Parts of the rail network were also crippled as a massive engineering work programme got under way.</p>
              <p>Timetables on some of the country's busiest routes were slashed to one
              train per hour or fewer as operators ran weekend services to make way
              for major tracklaying and bridge repair jobs.</p>
              <p>Around 6,000 staff are expected to work 300,000 man-hours, laying new
              track, repairing bridges and updating signalling systems over the
              weekend.</p>
              <p>But Network Rail insisted that, this time, the works would finish on time.</p>
              <p>Deputy chief executive Iain Coucher said the group had "learnt our
              lesson" and would do "absolutely everything" to ensure there was no
              repeat of the New Year overruns, which saw the company fined a record
              £14million.</p>
              <p>Airports were also packed yesterday as two million Britons headed
              abroad to escape the wintry weather, with 187,000 passengers passing
              through Heathrow alone.</p>
