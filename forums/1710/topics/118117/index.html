            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore and Australia have moved one step closer to an open skies agreement.<br><br>In what he called "a significant move," Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong says both sides have agreed to hammer out a roadmap to start on this by mid-year.<br><br>The agreement came during Mr Yeo's talks with his counterpart in Canberra, John Anderson.<br><br>A full open skies agreement is something Singapore has been looking at with Australia since they signed an expanded air services agreement in 2003.<br><br>Full open skies mean Singapore Airlines gets access to the lucrative trans-Pacific route, picking up passengers from Australia and flying them on to the US.<br><br>Currently, Australian passengers to the US fly either United Airlines or Qantas, which, at 75 percent, has the lion's share of the market.<br><br>So lucrative is the route that 15 percent of Qantas' profits come from it.<br><br>And Singapore Airlines wants a piece of the pie.<br><br>Analysts say a lot hinges on whether Australia can also get more business elsewhere, notably greater access to markets in Europe.<br><br>Australia's Transport Minister Anderson goes to Europe this weekend for talks and says he will contact Mr Yeo when he returns.<br><br>But Mr Yeo stressed the two issues should not be linked.<br><br>Said Mr Yeo, "I've stressed to him there is no linkage between what he can get from the Europeans and us getting fifth freedom rights."<br><br>Another possible obstacle is that SIA gets delivery of its A-380 jumbos six months before Qantas, enabling it to pick up more passengers.<br><br>Mr Yeo said the timing of this could be negotiated.<br><br>And while he has asked for SIA's first trans-Pacific flight to take place within 12 months, he says negotiations for a full open skies agreement will take time.<br><br>But progress has been made.<br><br>Mr Yeo said, "I think it is very significant. This is the first time that we have agreed to a deadline for coming with this well-defined map. At least we managed to get what we want, which is to get the process going."<br><br>He added, "In terms of when that end point will be, in terms of when the OSA will be completed -- two years or three years? That will be part of the road map that the two sides will agree upon."<br><br>As for concerns that Qantas will lose out, Mr Yeo said experience has shown competition will only grow the market for all. - CNA</div>
