I think it's been special because he's in the first year of Secondary."<br><br>This is the largest scale operation the school has ever done.<br><br>Some of the boys have never worn make-up before, but looking pretty for national day is something they are proud to do.<br><br>What also makes this performance special are the foreign students taking part in the parade for the very first time.<br><br>Like 14-year-old He Qiaodan, who's been studying in Singapore for 5 years.<br><br>"I really love Singapore and I really enjoy this celebration with all my friends. I feel proud and excited. There was once when I was involved in the national day celebrations in China. Both celebrations were just as great. The love for the country is all there," said He Qiaodan, a Chua Chu Kang Secondary School student.<br><br>Another foreign student Syed Nafe Mokammel said: "Even though I was borned in Bangladesh, I think I feel more of a sense of belonging to Singapore.
