And that airline protection by governments ultimately robbed consumers of choices and the tourism industry of growth.<br><br>- CNA /ls</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Australia seeks talks with S'pore over trans-Pacific flights </strong><br><br>SYDNEY : Australia will seek talks with Singapore after the city state took the unusual step of publicly rebuking Canberra for maintaining a trans-Pacific ban on Singapore Airlines.<br><br>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said on Wednesday his government wanted to explain the decision to deny such flights to the Singapore carrier.<br><br>"We look forward to sitting down with the Singapore government at the officials level fairly soon to talk about this issue," Downer told reporters.<br><br>"There are things they want from Australia, there are things we want from Singapore and we'll sit down and have a good talk about those things in an appropriate and a private setting."<br><br>His comments came after Singapore went public with its displeasure at Tuesday's decision to maintain a ban on SIA flying the lucrative Australia-US route dominated by Qantas, the latest twist in talks stretching back more than a decade.<br><br>In an unusually blunt statement, Singapore accused Australia of taking its generosity and warmth in bilateral relations for granted.<br><br>"Singapore has also been more than generous in facilitating the growth of Australian carriers to and beyond Singapore. It is disheartening to see that they have taken this and the warmth in our bilateral relationship for granted," Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said.<br><br>Yeo's department said Singapore "has more than fulfilled its commitment to Australia" with a liberal aviation policy that allowed Qantas to grow its operations in the city-state to a size second only to the airline's home base.<br><br>But in remarks unlikely to ease tensions between Canberra and Singapore, Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon said many objections to Canberra's decision were "ill-founded".<br><br>Dixon described Qantas as "the least protected airline in the world," saying it had been prevented from expanding services to destinations such as Britain and France because of the government decisions that dominate the industry.<br><br>"We live in a bilateral world, this is not just pure economic rationalism in the airline industry, all of this is played by the rules," he said.<br><br>Qantas earns as much as 20 percent of its profits from its Sydney-Los Angeles services, with US-based United Airlines the only other carrier flying the route.<br><br>It has long argued it would be disadvantaged if state-backed airlines such as SIA were allowed in while Transport Minister Warren Truss said access would only be granted if it was in the national interest.<br><br>"If access is negotiated in the future, it'll be limited and it'll be phased and we certainly wouldn't expect Singapore Airlines to be operating on the route for some years," Truss said Tuesday when announcing the decision.<br><br>Singapore said the decision was inconsistent with the many signals from Australian leaders in past rounds of discussions that the issue would be resolved within a reasonable timeframe.<br><br>"I have always held Australia in high regard as a close bilateral partner. Thus, I am naturally very disappointed with this decision, especially after more than 10 years of protracted discussions," Minister Yeo said.<br><br>Apparently heading off another possible line of attack, Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said the decision was totally unconnected to Singapore's hanging in December of convicted Australian drug trafficker Nguyen Van Truong.<br><br>"We do not link the death policy to aviation policy," he told reporters.<br><br>Costello said the decision was aimed at allowing Australian discount carrier Virgin Blue onto the route and if the airline failed to take up the option within the next few years, then it would be reviewed. - AFP/ch<br><br>*We should not be nice to them, we made FTA with them yet they are unwilling to give limited access to the transpacific rts</div>
