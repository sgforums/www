            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore is studying controls on the sale of pre-paid phonecards to step up its fight against terrorism.<br><br>The issue was raised in Parliament recently when studies showed terrorists like the Jemaah Islamiyah and Tamil Tigers have been using such cards extensively because of the anonymity they offer.<br><br>One shop at Serangoon Road sells more than 10,000 pre-paid phone cards a week.<br><br>Its customers are mostly foreign workers.<br><br>Ms Doris Ong, Shopowner of World of Phonecards Centre, said: "It is difficult because there is a lot of customers for us and then some of the customers, they do not like to register and this is just a pre-paid card. It is not every monthly bill, so they hope that they do not need to register."<br><br>But now registration may be necessary to prevent terrorists from using such cards.<br><br>Industry players are for stricter controls to assist the government in the fight against terrorism.<br><br>Their main concern, however, is who will absorb the cost that will result from these stricter controls?<br><br>One company which operates more than 20 shops in the Serangoon area feels their feedback is important when considering stricter regulations.<br><br>Mr Sng Kim Hock, President and CEO of Telcom United, said: "The government must ensure that it does not add up to our cost, our efforts and in submitting those papers to the authorities. It had to make it easier for us but whatever it is, who is going to absorb all these costs? As an SME, the margin is already thin enough."<br><br>Customers say they do not mind absorbing part of the costs.<br><br>"This policy is good. It keeps Singapore safe and as a customer, I don't mind registering because there is this tracking and I know that all the users are registered and everybody can be tracked."<br><br>"It's okay with me because it can help the Singapore country to deal with all those terorists and also all the neighbouring countries can also help and if the other countries can implement that, it will be better."<br><br>Singapore telcos have already been getting customers to register for pre-paid phonecards.<br><br>For smaller players, they say details need to be ironed out, but agree that it is a step in the right direction to keep Singapore safe. - CNA</div>
