            <div class='col-md body'>A dispute about the gates between two condominiums in Marine Parade remained unresolved.<br><br>Following three months of disagreement between Laguna Park and Lagoon View, which are separated by two gates, residents were to have been able to commute freely once more between the two sides on Sunday.<br><br>Residents had expected both gates to be thrown wide open once more after almost 4 months of inconvenience as a result of the dispute.<br><br>In fact, a resident had even called the MediaCorp News hotline informing journalists that a ceremony to mark the opening of the gates was to have been held in the presence of MP for the area, Mr Chan Soo Sen in the afternoon.<br><br>But sadly, at the last minute, it was not to be.<br><br>The gates remain closed and locked on both sides because an informal meeting held between the managements of the two condominiums the night before could not resolve the issue of security once the gates were opened.<br><br>Ambrose Miranda, Resident, Laguna Park, said: "If we open the gate, what's going to happen are those common concerns, mutual concerns on vandalism and trespassing will still carry on. So we go back to opening the gate, but having the same problem. What we want rather is a long term solution where we look and try and get a solution - a little bit difficult, a little bit more time, but one where maybe both of us can have some representation and a more secure environment."<br><br>What was also missing was a letter of agreement that neither side produced.<br><br>Lawrence Bong, Resident, Lagoon View, said: "The main issue I'm referring to here and how it could be resolved is basically that a simple letter of a deal and an agreement that could come out from it, from both ends to try and iron out these problems."<br><br>The episode started in January following a rise in petty crime at Lagoon View.<br><br>That was when the condo decided to close the gate on residents of Laguna Park.<br><br>Laguna Park's management refused so Lagoon View built another gate on its side, accessible only by their own residents.<br><br>In response, Laguna Park locked the original gate.<br><br>Mr Chan Soo Sen, MP for Joo Chiat, has been called in to help mediate the situation.<br><br>He said, after talking to both sides, the solution lies in communication.<br><br>Mr Chan said: "I think this is the crucial piece that is missing. Both sides want the issue to be resolved amicably. This is my hope too. And this is also the hope of the residents of the two estates. And I hope that with the sincere wish to communicate with each other, and with an open-mindedness, we can resolve the problem."<br><br>Mr Chan has invited both sides to meet soon to settle the issue. - CNA</div>
