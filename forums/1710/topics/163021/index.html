            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Operationally Ready National Servicemen can look forward to more cash incentives in the future, if a proposal by the committee set up to recognise the contributions of NSmen gets the nod.<br><br>Manpower Minister and Second Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, who also chairs the committee, says this suggestion will be firmed up in January 2006.<br><br>Chemical defence equipment for Singapore's National Servicemen would have been unthinkable 15 years ago; today it is standard training for all NSmen.<br><br>During a visit, some 50 civilian employers said they were impressed by the high training standard in the SAF and most felt it was now more prepared than ever before.<br><br>But transforming SAF into the third generation also means heavier demands on soldiers.<br><br>Said Dr Ng, "You need leaders who can explain to the men and help them use the tech, so it requires change in leadership thinking and management style; more is expected from them. Each soldier will be asked to deliver more, so we will look into more financial incentives for this group."<br><br>And that is not all.<br><br>De Ng said, "The 40th anniversary of SAF is coming. We ought to use that occasion, next time we do a surplus sharing, to give more to those who built up the SAF, to recognise their contribution."<br><br>During its dialogue with the committee, most employers wanted to learn even more about the SAF.<br><br>The committee will now expand its community outreach programmes to include more civilian visits for spouses, families and the general public.<br><br>Said Ricky Sim, chief operating officer, Suntec Investment, "I came here 30 years ago as a trainee.There's a tremendous change. This place is so different from when I was here, especially 'Peng Kang' hill. I hope more employers can come and see for themselves, to see what their NSmen are doing. Otherwise we thought they are just wasting their time, and wasting the company's time."<br><br>Another recommendation is to have a historical record of a changing SAF, which means a museum could be set up to give a fresh perspective to a younger generation of how far the SAF has come. - CNA /ct</div>
