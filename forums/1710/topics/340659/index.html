              <p><strong>S'pore and Gulf states sign FTA, recognise MUIS Halal certification</strong></p>
              <p><span>DOHA, Qatar: The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has signed its first free trade agreement (FTA) with Singapore.
              <br> <br> A key component of the FTA could see Singapore exporting more Halal food to the grouping's members.
              <br> <br> What originally started out as an FTA between Singapore and Qatar was
              widened during Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's visit to the Middle
              East in November 2006.
              <br> <br>After four rounds of discussions, the leaders from Singapore and
              the GCC countries put their signatures to this milestone agreement,
              which PM Lee said is significant in these difficult times.
              <br> <br>"It signals our intention to develop free trade and continue to
              expand our international relations economically, at a time of
              considerable economic uncertainty in the world, at a time of financial
              turbulence and crisis in the global financial markets," said PM Lee. <br> <br> The FTA will grant tariff-free access to about 99 per cent of
              Singapore's domestic exports worth about S$3.1 billion. All GCC goods
              entering Singapore will also enjoy tariff-free access.
              <br> <br>"Singapore could be the hub for GCC for Asian trade. There is a
              good history for Singapore in finance and trade, and it is (respected)
              by everybody in the world. Also GCC has the same respect, and for that
              reason, both of us can be strong partners in many important projects as
              well as further relations on the economic side," said Qatar's PM Sheikh
              Hamad Jassim Al-Thani. <br> <br> Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry said the FTA is a
              comprehensive pact covering trade in goods and services, investments,
              rules of origin, customs procedures, electronic commerce and economic
              cooperation. <br> <br> A key feature is a greater recognition of Singapore's Muslim-compliant food products.
              <br> <br> Three countries under the GCC - namely Qatar, Kuwait and the United
              Arab Emirates - have agreed to recognise the MUIS (Islamic Religious
              Council of Singapore) Halal Certification and Halal Mark as equivalent
              to those in their countries. <br> <br> MUIS said the recognition of its Halal Certification and Mark augurs
              well for Singapore's position as a vital food hub. It will help further
              boost trade between Singapore and the GCC countries, and also
              contribute towards the harmonisation of international Halal standards. <br> <br> MUIS added that the recognition will also attract more Muslim visitors
              and tourists from Asia, Middle East and beyond to Singapore. <br> <br> Aside from the three GCC countries who are immediately recognising
              Singapore's Halal certification, the remaining three - Oman, Saudi
              Arabia and Bahrain - are in the process of discussions. <br> <br> The GCC countries are Singapore's seventh largest trading partner. 
              <br> <br> Bilateral trade reached a record S$42.4 billion last year, a 127 per cent increase from 2002.
              <br> <br> PM Lee said: "Bilateral trade is significant. Many of our companies
              have invested in GCC countries - significant projects in
              infrastructure, for example by companies like Keppel, like Hyflux, PSA,
              Capital Land... There are many projects from GCC countries which are
              invested in Singapore too, and we also have joint projects between
              Singapore and GCC countries in (other) countries. For example, Qatar
              has taken a stake in the Singapore eco-city project in Tianjin in
              China."
              <br> <br>Mr Lee hopes that once the new FTA takes effect, it will further
              stimulate the links between Singapore and the Gulf states. - CNA /ls</span></p>
