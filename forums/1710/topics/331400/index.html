              <p><strong>Upgrading of six schools delayed due to rising costs</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education has put its schools upgrading scheme on hold, citing rising construction costs.
              <br> <br> Six schools have had their plans deferred for a year and no new projects have been announced for 2008.
              <br> <br> When asked if there were plans for 2009, a Ministry spokesman said it was too premature to decide.
              <br> <br> Water-logged walls and cramped classrooms are just some of the problems at CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School.
              <br> <br> The buildings are 20 years old.
              <br> <br> Massive renovation works had been scheduled for next year under the
              Education Ministry's upgrading scheme, but this has been pushed back
              till 2010. <br> <br> Chan Wan Siong, Principal of CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School, said: "Our
              original proposal was to have a big part of the school torn down, and
              to rebuild the school. However with this new costing, we are now
              re-looking at the plans to see what alternatives we can find for the
              school."
              <br> <br>A government-aided school like St Nicholas Girls' would have to pay
              for 5 percent of standard items, and bear the full cost of non-standard
              items. In comparison, government schools enjoy full subsidies on
              essential upgrading works.
              <br> <br>The government-aided school has to raise S$5 million, but its
              alumni association says it has had difficulty meeting its original
              fund-raising deadline, given the economic woes of recent months.
              <br> <br>Under the original schedule, they would have had to raise $4
              million by this September. But it has so far raised less than half the
              amount - about $1.96 million, and needs to come up with another $2
              million by next August. If it does not, then only the essential items,
              like enlarging the size of classrooms, will be given the green light.
              <br> <br> So an extra year would come in handy.
              <br> <br>Dazhong Primary, another school which had its upgrading works
              postponed, says the delay is not a big issue as the additional
              classrooms are not urgently required.
              <br> <br>Some like Chung Cheng High say the additional year will allow for
              better planning and this may result in a shorter renovation period.
              <br> <br>Other schools are - CHIJ St Theresa's Secondary, Jurongville
              Secondary, and Juying Secondary. They were among 16 schools slated for
              upgrading in 2007. <br> <br> Aside from schools, the government also announced in July this year
              that it would postpone certain public sector projects, due to rising
              construction costs. <br> <br> Another programme that has been put on hold is the building of indoor
              sports halls in every school. When announced in 2006, it was expected
              to cost the Education Ministry S$690 million over seven years. But with
              cost pressures on the rise, this means that 25 schools won't be getting
              the go-ahead this year. - CNA/de</span></p>
