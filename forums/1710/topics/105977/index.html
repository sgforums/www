            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Three people caught in a high society drug bust in October have escaped the death penalty.<br><br>Tests showed the amount of cocaine they are alleged to have been trafficking was less than 30 grammes in purity.<br><br>Anything above that amount carries a mandatory death penalty.<br><br>Tunisian Guiga Laroussi, Singaporean Marx Oh and Laroussi's girlfriend Mariana Abdullah were arrested in October in a cocaine bust.<br><br>The operation marked the start of a series of high profile arrests of personalities for alleged trafficking and consumption.<br><br>They included former Singapore Tatler editor Nigel Simmonds and Dinesh Bhatia - son of former Nominated MP Kanwaljit Soin and former High Court judge Amarjeet Singh.<br><br>The rest will be making separate court appearances in the following weeks.<br><br>On Monday, the trafficking charges of Laroussi, Oh and Mariana were reduced after laboratory tests showed the drug purity to be below the capital offence level of 30 grammes.<br><br>If convicted, all three now face between 20 and 30 years' jail, and 15 strokes of the cane for the men.<br><br>A key issue was the purity of the drug. Cocaine is often mixed with other items like baking soda, sugars and even cement.<br><br>But a person is charged only on the pure amount of the drug, after impurities are removed.<br><br>In the case of the three, it made the difference between life and death.<br><br>After analysis, the amount of cocaine for the Tunisian Laroussi was reduced from 61.2 grammes to 25.32 grammes, while Oh's case was reduced from 49.02 grammes to 21.67 grammes.<br><br>But their lawyer hopes to bring it down even further.<br><br>Mr Subhas Anandan, lawyer, said: "We will apply to CNB and the scientific office here to give us their working sheets, how they arrived at this conclusion and let experts overseas - United States and Europe - look at it and see if it is conformed or not.<br><br>"Hoping for results that will make quantity even lower and then may not even face the minimum of 20 years."<br><br>Both men are now expected to be out on bail - $250,000 for Laroussi and $200,000 for Oh, and their case will be mentioned again on December 20. - CNA<br></div>
