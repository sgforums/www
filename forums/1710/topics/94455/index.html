            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Allow children more time to play and mix around, and go easy on homework for pre-schoolers, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong advised parents who attended the PCF Day at Ang Mo Kio GRC on Sunday.<br><br>It was a perfect day out for families at the PCF Carnival Day cum Walk-a-Jog.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Children were all over the amphitheatre at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, colouring.<br><br>Some loaded up on the carnival food and games, while the more nimble showed off their gymnastic and artistic talents.<br><br>There were no textbooks and no worksheets, just plain good fun on a Sunday.<br><br>The Prime Minister says it is good many parents are serious about giving their children a headstart in education.<br><br>But he noted that some parents who send their kids to PCF pre-schools actually complain when they are not given enough homework.<br><br>"I know there are some parents who would like their kids in the PCF to study more and they ask us to give more homework, let us have some work sheets, sometimes even go home and have remedial class in the evenings," Mr Lee said.<br><br>"But I think we should not overdo this, take it easy, let the children enjoy themselves, play, make friends. And in the process they can learn and by the time they go to school, they're not only academically ready but also socially ready and I think they will grow up better students and better citizens."<br><br>Mr Lee's call comes after his National Day Rally speech, in which he called on schools to teach less so that our children could learn more.<br><br>But not every parent agrees that children should be given less homework.<br><br>"I prefer them to do more homework, if not they have nothing to do at home," said one parent.<br><br>"The amount of work they bring home adds stress to the children. I think more free time, play would be good for the kids," another said.<br><br>"Not too much homework and not too much play. It's equal. Equal for study, equal for playtime," said a third parent.<br><br>And as in most things, the trick is in balancing work with play. - CNA<br><br></div>
