            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: MediaCorp welcomed 189 new employees on Monday, a result of the merger between the mass market TV operations of MediaCorp and SPH.<br><br>From competitors over the last four years, MediaCorp and SPH now join hands.<br><br>And, recent disasters have helped put things in perspective, says MediaCorp's Group Chief Executive Ernest Wong.<br><br>He said: "Much has happened over the last four years and the last three months, particularly. We have competed very vigorously, sometimes ethically, sometimes not so ethically. We fought for awards, we fought for profits, we were running down each other, we were in deep conflict. And then we have our merger in last 3-4 months. I think we thought that all these were very important to us until the tsunami of 26th December. I think we should be thankful to the Almighty that we are all here and alive."<br><br>And in unison, staff - former competitors but now colleagues - observed a moment of silence.<br><br>After that, they were given an understanding of MediaCorp's organisational structure and its core businesses.<br><br>After the official welcome, it was time to chat and renew old friendships.<br><br>"I've worked here for many years, so it's good to be back, working with friends," said MediaCorp News cameraman Kemburaju Thangarajan.<br><br>"I felt very welcome. I met lots of ex-collegues and friends and they gave me very warm welcome back here, it's very heartening to see that," said MediaCorp artiste Ix Shen.<br><br>"More of TV here, so more opportunities. That sounds good. I didn't realise they did so much until I saw the presentation," said MediaCorp News producer Margaret Perry.<br><br>Although there were some first-day jitters, there was also excitement.<br><br>"Pretty excited but also a little scared because it is a brand new family. I have to get used to everything again," said MediaCorp Studios artiste Ben Yeo.<br><br>"It's fun, it's pretty exciting, it's the first day, there is quite a bustle. Everybody's really excited to be here, and I think we are going to find our way around," said MediaCorp Studios artiste Celest Chong.<br><br>To ease in the staff, much of the first day was spent learning about the new workplace, chatting with colleagues over meals and going on tours to get to know their new home. - CNA</div>
