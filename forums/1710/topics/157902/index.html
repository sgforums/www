            <div class='col-md body'>BEIJING : China's second manned space mission returned safely to Earth on Monday after a successful five-day flight, in the latest chapter in China's ambitious drive to become a global space power.<br><br>Astronauts Fei Junlong and Nie Haisheng were given a clean bill of health after the re-entry capsule of their Shenzhou VI spacecraft glided to Earth on a parachute, ending up in Inner Mongolia, Xinhua news agency said.<br><br>"Our journey in space was very smooth, the living and working conditions inside the cabin were very good, our health is okay, thanks," Fei said on state television, with a radiant smile.<br><br>Emerging from the module, television pictures showed the two take a few seconds to adjust to the Earth's gravity, before being presented with bouquets of flowers and waving to assembled recovery teams and ground control staff.<br><br>Mission control declared the 115-hour space flight a success, Xinhua reported.<br><br>China's top legislator Wu Bangguo, who watched the return of Shenzhou VI from the Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Centre, called the completed mission a "milestone," according to the People's Daily website.<br><br>"It is of great significance in elevating China's prestige in the world and promoting China's economic, scientific and national defence capabilities, and its national cohesiveness," Wu was quoted as saying.<br><br>A member of one of the recovery teams reported that the capsule landed upright after touching down at 4:32 am (2032 GMT Sunday), just one kilometre from the intended landing site, it added.<br><br>Fei and Nie were taken by helicopter from their remote landing site and given chocolate and herbal tea.<br><br>"I can feel that lots of people are thinking about us, we're very grateful for all the love and concern from our motherland and its people," Nie said on television.<br><br>In Nie's home town, in Zaoyang county of northern Hebei province, hundreds of proud residents hit the streets from before sunrise to mark the return of Shenzhou VI.<br><br>State television showed footage of the town celebrating its most famous native with firecrackers and dragon dances.<br><br>The flight was China's second-ever manned space mission following the historic Shenzhou V, which in October 2003 made China the third nation after the former Soviet Union and the United States to put a man into space.<br><br>Shenzhou VI had been carrying enough food, water and oxygen for a seven-day mission, although planners had expected it to spend just five days in orbit.<br><br>The spacecraft blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on Inner Mongolia's border with Gansu province on Wednesday.<br><br>During his 21-hour maiden flight in 2003, lone astronaut Yang Liwei never left his seat in the re-entry capsule nor take off his space suit.<br><br>In contrast, Fei and Nie's flight saw them leave the re-entry capsule and enter the orbital capsule, shedding their bulky suits and donning ordinary work clothes so they could move around easily.<br><br>During their time in space, the astronauts successfully fired rockets to adjust the craft's altitude, ensuring it remained in its pre-planned orbit - which was crucial for its return to Earth, a mission control spokesman said.<br><br>Premier Wen Jiabao hailed the historic second mission as a success after watching from the launch pad on Wednesday.<br><br>The launch captivated the nation, with millions of Chinese watching it on television.<br><br>Dispelling concerns that China could use space for military purposes, Wen said the purpose of the mission was to conduct experiments "entirely for peaceful purposes."<br><br>The Chinese government also hopes to use the manned space program to invigorate patriotism and instil a curiosity in science and technology amongst China's largely agrarian population.<br><br>Spending on the Shenzhou series of launches has reached roughly 19 billion yuan (US$2.3 billion), less than 10 percent of the US annual spending on space programmes, Xinhua quoted a space science researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences saying last week. - AFP/dt/de</div>
