Rather, the urgency is in stopping the spread of AIDS.<br><br>Gays are considered to be at a higher risk of contracting HIV in most countries.<br><br>And going for HIV testing is an important part of the fight to stop it from spreading.<br><br>More than half of the 1,500 men that activist group Action for AIDS has surveyed do far, have gone for the test.<br><br>And the rate of increase in infection seems to have slowed.<br><br>In the first half of 2004, 22 out of 498 men who have sex with men or MSM, tested positive at the Kelantan Road Anonymous HIV testing clinic.<br><br>In the first six months of this year, 21 out of 820 men tested positive here.<br><br>Women's groups are also joining the fight against AIDS.<br><br>Braema Mathi, President of AWARE, said: "By raising awareness and bringing it on the table by Dr Balaji and his team, it has been good in that sense.<br><br>"All of us are now coming together in a tighter community to see how we can leverage on each other, how we can push out better programmes."<br><br>AWARE, which is hosting an AIDS forum on Saturday, has also set up a fund to help women go for free HIV testing. - CNA/de</div>
