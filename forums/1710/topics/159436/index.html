            <div class='col-md body'>CrimsonLogic CEO among those accused of offering bribe of $35,000<br><br>By Selina Lum<br>Oct 26, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br><br>THE chief executive of CrimsonLogic, a government-linked IT company, was charged with corruption yesterday along with two of his senior managers and a former legal counsel.<br><br>The four are accused of agreeing to give a bribe of $35,000 to the former head of Carrefour Singapore's IT department in exchange for recommending that the hypermarket award an IT project to CrimsonLogic .<br><br>Chief executive Velusamy Mathivanan, 50, was charged along with Tan Geok Hoon, 47, vice-president of the trade and logistic business unit, financial controller Thiagayson Sundram Pillai, 52, and former legal counsel Alvin Lim Keng Hong, 41, who has since left the company.<br><br>The appearance of the four in court marked the end of a year-long probe by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).<br><br>The bureau had received a complaint in September last year that the head of Carrefour's IT department, Mr Matthias Tan Eng Haur, 35, had received a bribe from a vendor in return for awarding it an IT project worth $400,000.<br><br>Investigations revealed that Mr Tan first went to software company Gridnode, saying he would recommend to his management that it be awarded the project.<br><br>He also wanted a bribe of $60,000 but Gridnode refused to pay him, the bureau said in a statement.<br><br>Mr Tan then sought a $35,000 bribe from Mr Pang Kang Ming, the business development manager of CrimsonLogic, for recommending that the project be awarded to CrimsonLogic.<br><br>It is alleged Mr Pang sought the approval of Mathivanan, Tan, Pillai and Lim, who agreed to give the money to Mr Tan through a third party, Actinium Corporation.<br><br>It is understood that CrimsonLogic eventually clinched the project. But no money changed hands.<br><br>However, Mr Tan was fined $25,000 after he pleaded guilty in February to attempting to obtain a bribe from CrimsonLogic. A second charge of attempting to obtain a bribe from Gridnode was taken into consideration.<br><br>No plea was taken from the four accused yesterday. Mr Pang is named in the charges as an accomplice, but he was not charged.<br><br>Mathivanan, Tan and Pillai are represented by Mr Wendell Wong while Lim's lawyer is Mr Wee Pan Lee.<br><br>Each of them was granted bail of $35,000 and the case was fixed for a pre-trial conference on Nov 8.<br><br>In a press statement, CrimsonLogic said that measures have been taken to ensure business continuity so that customer service is not affected.<br><br>Mr Leong Peng Kiong, who is on the company's board of directors, has been appointed acting CEO.<br><br>Mathivanan, Tan and Pillai also issued a statement stating that they have offered their 'fullest cooperation' to the authorities. 'We will be patient and let due process take its course,' they said.<br><br>CrimsonLogic, formerly known as Singapore Network Services, was set up in 1988 by IE Singapore, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, PSA Corporation and SingTel.<br><br>The company counts among its partners government bodies including IE Singapore, the Supreme Court, the Land Transport Authority, and technology companies like Sun Microsystems and Cisco Systems.<br><br>Among the IT solutions it has implemented are the electronic data systems TradeNet, Biznet, HDB ResaleNet and the Electronic Filing System in the courts.<br><br></div>
