He is serving out the rest of his jail term from home, has to wear an electronic tag and observe a curfew.</span><br><br>FORMER National Kidney Foundation (NKF) chairman Richard Yong Kun Da, now serving a 15-month jail term, has been released from prison and is on the Home Detention scheme.<br><br>This means he does not need to serve out his term in prison but will wear an electronic tag and will have to observe a strict curfew.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that he has been on this scheme since Jan 10 this year, after doing time in prison for nearly five months.<br><br>Yong is now working at a Chinese restaurant in town and is living with his sister. Apart from wearing the tag, he must be home by 6 pm.<br><br>When contacted, a Prisons Department spokesman declined comment, saying that it was inappropriate to divulge details of an inmate.<br><br>Yong, 66, was jailed for 15 months last September for illegally transferring nearly $4 million into his wife's overseas bank account, and for two counts under the Bankruptcy Act.<br><br>The term was backdated to Aug 4 last year, the date when he was first remanded following his extradition here from Hong Kong. He had left Singapore barely hours after he was declared a bankrupt without the approval of the Official Assignee, which administers the affairs of bankrupts.<br><br>Lawyers who spoke to The Straits Times said they were not surprised that Yong is now out of prison and dismissed any suggestion that he was given preferential treatment.<br><br>Given his 15-month jail term, he could be out in 10 months for good behaviour.<br><br>A criminal lawyer said: 'He would probably have to serve half of that 10 months in prison before he could be released for home detention, so he is eligible now.'<br><br>There are no 'hard and fast rules' and assessment is on a case-by-case basis, he added.<br><br>Under the law, inmates face stringent conditions in order to qualify for the scheme. For example, violent and sexual offenders are ineligible.<br><br>Eligible inmates have to observe a strict curfew and are expected to be home usually by 6pm to 8 pm, and are sometimes required to report to prison authorities.<br><br>They also have to be employed and have family support so that they can re-integrate into society.<br><br>Currently, an inmate has to be sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment and above to be eligible. The maximum placement period on the scheme is a year.<br><br>In addition, an inmate has to be assessed by the prison authorities through a series of interviews to see his progress and response to rehabilitation.<br><br>The scheme was introduced in 2000 as an avenue for early release of prisoners found suitable for rehabilitation.<br><br>Copyright, 2008, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
