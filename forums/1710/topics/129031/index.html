            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Malaysia's dispute over Singapore's land reclamation in and around the Straits of Johor has been fully resolved and brought to a close.<br><br>The Malaysian and Singapore governments signed a Settlement Agreement at the Singapore Foreign Affairs Ministry on Tuesday morning.<br><br>The agreement was inked by their two agents - Ambassador-at-Large Professor Tommy Koh from Singapore and Mr Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak, Secretary General of the Malaysian Foreign Ministry.<br><br>The event was witnessed by their foreign affairs ministers, Mr George Yeo and Mr Syed Hamid Albar.<br><br>With the agreement signed, the two countries said they would apply to the arbitration tribunal for its terms to constitute the final award in the matter.<br><br>At the height of the dispute in July 2003, Malaysia claimed that the reclamation off Tuas violated its territorial waters, while the work off Pulau Tekong was damaging Malaysia's beaches and harming its fisheries.<br><br>So, Malaysia asked for a stop work order and for the matter to go before arbitration.<br><br>When both sides appeared before the International Tribunal of the Law of the Seas, the tribunal declared on 8th October 2003 that Singapore could continue its reclamation works at Tuas and Pulau Tekong.<br><br>Both countries said on Tuesday the settlement agreement represented a full and final resolution of the bilateral dispute over Singapore's reclamation works around Tuas and Pulau Tekong.<br><br>The two governments have approved the agreement, describing it as a fair and balanced outcome reached amicably through a series of negotiations.<br><br>The Settlement Agreement comes into effect on Tuesday.<br><br>Speaking at the signing ceremony, Singapore's Foreign Minister George Yeo said, "The civil and civilised manner in which we have been able to settle this dispute gives us confidence that our bilateral disputes can be settled in the same way. As neighbours, it is inevitable that bilateral disputes should arise from time to time."<br><br>"We have demonstrated in this case and in the Pedra Branca case that where there is an impasse, rather than let our bilateral relations be held hostage to the dispute, we are prepared to have the matter referred to third party adjudication or arbitration. As good neighbours, we can overcome such disputes on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect."<br><br>Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said: "I consider this as a milestone in Malaysia-Singapore relations. It shows very clearly that our collaboration over more than a year to bring a satisfactory conclusion to an issue of great importance to our two countries."<br><br>"Despite our initial differences over the reclamation activities around the Straits of Johor, now we have found that there is nothing impossible if we put our hearts and minds together to find a resolution."<br><br>Among the key decisions reached:<br><br>A lump sum of 374,000 Malaysian ringgit will be paid by Singapore to Malaysia as compensation for the fishermen who face losses as a result of the reclamation works. This means each fisherman will receive 5,200 Malaysian ringgit.<br><br>Singapore has reassured Malaysia that the safe and smooth passage of ships will not be adversely affected through Kuala Johor and Calder Harbour after the Pulau Tekong reclamation.<br><br>Singapore will also modify the final design of the shoreline of its reclamation at the Pulau Tekong area. - CNA /ch</div>
