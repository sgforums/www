            <div class='col-md body'>TOKYO : Wal-Mart said it was sending in a US executive to shake up Japan's Seiyu, which the US behemoth will soon control, as the firm's losses almost doubled in the nine months to September.<br><br>Seiyu said its sales remained sluggish as the net loss reached 17.53 billion yen (150 million dollars) in the period. The company said its net loss would be 13.5 billion yen for the full year, worse than the earlier projected 7.5 billion yen.<br><br>Wal-Mart, seeking a foothold in the world's second largest economy, said in September it would take a majority stake in loss-making Seiyu.<br><br>The move raises the prospect that Wal-Mart will try to bring its style of low-cost megastores to Japan, whose brand-conscious consumers prefer smaller shops.<br><br>"Seiyu's performance in the third quarter has been disappointing but we remain confident in the company's long-term future," Mike Duke, vice chairman of Wal-Mart International, said in a statement.<br><br>The US giant, which is trying to counter image problems at home over how it treats its workers, will send in one of its top executives to the Japanese firm.<br><br>Seiyu said its board approved Ed Kolodzieski, currently chief operating officer of Wal-Mart International and a Seiyu board member, to become president and chief executive officer as of December 15.<br><br>He will work with Seiyu chairman Noriyuki Watanabe, who has been serving as chief executive officer since Masao Kiuchi stepped down earlier this year to take responsibility for a continued slump.<br><br>"We believe that Ed's operational and international experience combined with the seasoned management of Noriyuki Watanabe will provide strong leadership for Seiyu," Duke said.<br><br>Wal-Mart will take 53.56 percent of Seiyu's voting rights in December, up from the current 42.48 percent, Seiyu said.<br><br>Seiyu-name sales in the July-September quarter fell 1.4 percent, better than a 2.0 percent drop in April-June and 7.1 percent decline in January-March, as the group improved management and reduced product shortages.<br><br>But the profit margin "came in under plan due to a high level of promotions and markdowns in a highly competitive environment," Seiyu said.<br><br>- AFP /ct<br><br></div>
