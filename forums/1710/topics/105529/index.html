            <div class='col-md body'><strong>URA exhibition showcases the shaping of Singapore through urban planning </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : Even though urban planning has been successful in transforming Singapore's landscape in the past 30 years, more challenges lie ahead, says Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>He said Singapore may be clean, green and efficient, but that is not good enough to make it a truly vibrant, global city.<br><br>And to give Singaporeans a glimpse of the future and a look at the past, he launched the Urban Redevelopment Authority exhibition "Shaping Singapore" and reopened the "City Gallery".<br><br>How Singapore became what it is today is carefully documented in a first-ever comprehensive exhibition on urban planning and conservation.<br><br>Exhibits in the newly-reopened city gallery make it easy to get a bird's eye view of the bustling modern metropolis that Singapore has become after 30 years of urban planning.<br><br>But given our tight space constraints, what is on the horizon for Singapore's urban landscape in the next 30 years?<br><br>Mr Lee said: "Every government, every city knows that in the era of globalisation, being clean, functional and efficient is not good enough if you aspire to be a global city.<br><br>"Moving forward, what should distinguish our city is boldness, experimentation, setting new standards and pushing new frontiers.<br><br>"Sometimes this could be at the expense of efficiency and like all bold measures, will involve taking some risks. But it is the only way to catch the attention of the world, and stand a chance of acquiring the x-factor."<br><br>Mr Lee said he wanted vibrancy and optimism in the air - something that will bring pride to Singaporeans and excite visitors.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "Ultimately what determines a great city is that extra x-factor. You cannot quite explain it, but you know it when you arrive in a city that has it. It is the quality that brings pride to the people living there and at the same time excites visitors.<br><br>"The outlook is globalised and cosmopolitan. You immediately feel the vibrancy and excitement, the opportunity and optimism. You want to work and play all day and night, because there is too much to see and do and the city never sleeps."<br><br>So the government's prepared to review and relax building rules, give bigger plots of land to private developers to tap on their creativity, and invest in bolder, ambitious concepts.<br><br>The Shaping Singapore exhibition showcases some of these plans, like the expansion of the Central Business District at Marina Bay.<br><br>The URA is also injecting $3 million to start a programme promoting architecture and urban design excellence with the private sector.<br><br>It will set up a Architecture and Urban Design Promotion Programme to foster the development of design professionals and to generate public interest and awareness in architecture and urban design issues.<br><br>All this to give Singapore that much needed x-factor.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "Shaping Singapore is a long process. We will develop our city progressively and gradually.<br><br>"It is like a garden which takes many years of patient planting, shaping and settling before it matures and displays its full richness and diversity.<br><br>"If we guide our city to grow organically, it will bear the charm and cultural imprints of many generations of Singaporeans."<br><br>The exhibition will run for four months at the URA building.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PM LEE HSIEN LOONG UNVEILS TWO EXHIBITIONS TO<br>MARK 30 YEARS OF URBAN PLANNING</strong><br><br>Shaping Singapore: Achievements (1974 Â– 2004) &amp; Aspirations (2004 -2034) is an exhibition showcasing how Singapore is shaped through past 30 years of urban planning, and the exciting next 30 years to come. Together with the exhibition launch, the newly refurbished, Singapore City Gallery, is officially reopened to the public.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong officially opens the two exhibitions on Friday, 3 December, 11 am at The URA Centre.<br><br>URA CEO Mrs Cheong Koon Hean said, Â“Singapore has undergone tremendous physical change in the last 30 years. Today, Singapore is well known internationally as a modern and efficient metropolis with a clean and green cityscape, and a unique blend of old and new buildings. The development of the island into a lively and thriving city is a result of careful, detailed planning and partnership between private and public sectors in realising the plan.Â”<br><br>Commenting on URAÂ’s future challenges ahead, Mrs Cheong Koon Hean said, Â“URA has the vital mission of exciting and inspiring Singaporeans about their future living environment. This is an enormous challenge. It means offering Singaporeans more choices in their living, working and recreational environment. It also means we hold out to Singaporeans, especially the next generation, the hope of a better and higher quality of life in the future.Â”<br><br><strong>Shaping Singapore through 30 years of urban planning</strong><br><br>The 30 years of urban planning have contributed to the successful transformation of SingaporeÂ’s physical landscape. To mark this key milestone, URA has organised an exhibition, Shaping Singapore: Achievements (1974 Â– 2004) &amp; Aspirations (2004 Â– 2034), in collaboration with Singapore Press Holdings.<br><br>The first part entitled Â“AchievementsÂ” showcases the Singapore of 2004, as seen through the eyes of 19 photojournalists.  The second part on Â“AspirationsÂ” gives visitors a glimpse of SingaporeÂ’s exciting opportunities for good life, fun and businesses in the next 30 years. Please refer to Annex 1 for an overview of the exhibition.<br><br><strong>Come see people's favourite places </strong><br><br>Pictures of peopleÂ’s favourite places in the city will also be exhibited . The photographs are entries from the Â“My CityÂ” photo competition. It was organised in September 2004 to get members of the public to share their significant and memorable places through their camera lens.<br><br><strong>Photo catalogue on Â“Shaping SingaporeÂ” </strong><br><br>In conjunction with the exhibition, URA has produced a catalogue featuring the images exhibited. Designed as a photo catalogue, it is hoped that the images will anchor our memories of life in Singapore in 2004 and serve as a milestone to gauge the progress of our cityÂ’s development. The public can purchase the catalogue at The URA Centre atrium. It is also available at all major local bookstores at S$24.90 from 4 December 2004.<br><br><strong>Buy a charity calendar </strong><br><br>Visitors to the exhibition can buy a charity calendar 2005 which captures the 18 winning entries of the Â“My CityÂ” photo competition. It is priced at $8, and all profits from the sale of the calendars will be donated to URAÂ’s adopted charity, Help Every Lone Parent (HELP).<br><br><strong>Exhibition details </strong><br><br>Shaping Singapore: Achievements (1974 Â– 2004) &amp; Aspirations (2004 Â– 2034) will be exhibited over four months, starting from 3 December 2004 till 26 March 2005.

Admission is free.<br><br><strong>Have fun learning about planning at the Singapore City Gallery</strong><br><br>Visitors to the newly refurbished Singapore City Gallery can look forward to a fun and exciting journey on the story of how Singapore is planned and how the city has evolved through the decades. Previously known as URA Gallery, it attracts 65,000 visitors yearly, including school children, professionals, tourists, and overseas delegations.<br><br>This permanent 1,600 square-metres gallery aims to educate the audiences on SingaporeÂ’s evolution as a city, the conservation of our built heritage, and the challenges of planning for a city state.  This is done through five main thematic areas Â– orientation, history, conservation &amp; heritage, planning and city centre Â– using interactive exhibits and multi-media programmes.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>About the Urban Redevelopment Authority</strong><br><br>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is SingaporeÂ’s national land use planning authority.  URAÂ’s mission is Â“to make Singapore a great city to live, work and playÂ”.  We carry out our mission by planning and facilitating the physical development of Singapore, in partnership with the community, to create a vibrant, sustainable and cosmopolitan city of distinction.<br><br>Formed in April 1974, URA first focused on the redevelopment of SingaporeÂ’s city centre, transforming it from overcrowded slums into a thriving business and financial hub. In September 1989, the URA amalgamated with the former Planning Department to form the new URA.   URA later moved on to take charge of planning and facilitating the physical development of the whole of Singapore.<br><br>URA is the main land sales agent for the State and the sale of sites is an essential part of land use planning.  Through land sales, Government attracts and channels private capital investment and market expertise to the development of sites for meeting SingaporeÂ’s land use planning needs.  Transforming plans to reality involves close coordination upfront between URA and the technical agencies to prepare land for development.  It also requires giving investors confidence in the continuous partnership and support provided by our land use planners who will see the plans to completion.The sale of sites programme, which began in 1967, has been instrumental in shaping the physical development of Singapore.  In the process, it has also transformed raw land into valuable real estate.<br><br>Singapore is a nation state with needs for economic growth, defence, housing, recreation and basic conveniences. Given SingaporeÂ’s land area of only 697 square km, URAÂ’s challenge is to provide a planning blueprint that optimises our land resource to meet our current needs, safeguards land for future development, while maintaining our quality of life.</div>
