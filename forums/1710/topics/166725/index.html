            <div class='col-md body'>Television stars from across the region descended on Singapore on Thursday night for the 10th Asian Television Awards.<br><br>The stars dazzled fans as they walked up the red carpet, with some looking completely different from their on-screen roles.<br><br>"Because right now I'm also doing a lot of variety shows for Channel 8 and they like me to not be an auntie anymore. So in the new programmes I'm doing, you get to see a lot more images that I have," said Irene Ang, who was nominated for Best Comedy Performance by an Actress.<br><br>The competition was tough, with 1,450 entries received from nearly 130 companies in 14 countries, all vying for 33 awards.<br><br>Some winners couldn't conceal their delight as they went up to collect their awards.<br><br>One surprise was that there were two winners for the Best Comedy Performance by an Actress.<br><br>Singapore star Selena Tan won for her role in "Daddy's Girls" but was unable to attend the ceremony.<br><br>And compatriot Kym Ng won for her role in "Durian King".<br><br>Kym Ng said: "Being nominated, I was already very excited but I kept telling myself 'don't stress yourself'. It's very difficult because the rest of the nominees were very strong and very experienced actresses, so winning this is the greatest surprise of all."<br><br>"Daddy's Girls" also picked up Best Comedy Programme, beating long-time favourites "Living with Lydia" and "Phua Chu Kang."<br><br>Daisy Irani, managing executive producer and director of "Daddy's Girls", said: "It doesn't necessarily have to be slapstick anymore. Phua Chu Kang and Lydia, they did sometimes veer to that kind of comedy whereas Daddy's Girls is all heart, there's just simplicity, you know, so I'm thrilled."<br><br>GMA Network Channel 7 from the Philippines was the biggest winner of the night, notching up five awards including Best Terrestrial Channel. - CNA/ir<br><br></div>
