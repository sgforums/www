            <div class='col-md body'>BANGKOK : Thailand's military chief General Sonthi Boonyaratglin said Wednesday he would hand power to an appointed prime minister within two weeks, and that democracy would be restored in a year.<br><br>At his first press briefing since seizing power from Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra late Tuesday, Sonthi also said the country's revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej had nothing to do with the coup.<br><br>"An interim constitution will be drafted within two weeks, and during that time a new national assembly will be appointed, and a new prime minister will be appointed," Sonthi told reporters.<br><br>"I will resign as interim prime minister within two weeks, and now we are looking for the person who will become the new prime minister," he said.<br><br>"The potential candidates are politically neutral, and love democracy with the king as head of state," he said.<br><br>Sonthi said the government to be appointed by the military would be tasked with drafting a new constitution that would provide the framework for new general elections.<br><br>"By early next month, the interim constitution will be ready, which will allow the start of writing a new, permanent constitution. That process should take about one year," he said.<br><br>"The next general election will hopefully take place in October next year," he added.<br><br>Sonthi denied that the king was behind the coup.<br><br>"Nobody was behind us. We decided on our own, and we took care of it on our own. We decided within the last two days to stage a coup, because the people have called for it and also because of the mismanagement of the government," he said.<br><br>"The military has acted in line with the wishes of the people," he said. - AFP /dt</div>
