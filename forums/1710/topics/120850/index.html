            <div class='col-md body'>cause they are thinking that by going this way, they actually have a fighting chance against PAP coz in a yahoo poll, it shows that more singaporean disagree to the idea of having a casino. yea this idea is plain stupid. the control of singapore isn't child's play nor is it a gamble. the elections and casino should be treated as seperate issues, but i must admit no matter whats the outcome of the casino, PAP is gonna lose some support so i reckon the elections won't be held so soon.</div>
