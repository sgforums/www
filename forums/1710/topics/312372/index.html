              <h1>The tiny Chihuahua who thinks he's a Buddhist monk</h1>
              <p>He is admired for his impeccable zen and ability to radiate a sense of inner peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And while other Buddhists may have to wait years to reach
              enlightenment, this devotee seems to have attained Nirvana in just two.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, appearances can be deceptive, especially when the "monk" in question is a Chihuahua named Conan.</p>
              <p>The tiny dog actually launches into "prayer" when he wants treats - and is richly rewarded by impressed visitors.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/conanAP_468x399.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/conanAP_468x399.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>Zen-like: Practice makes perfect for Conan whose prayers are answered (usually very quickly) with treats</em></p>
              <p>Conan, a two-year-old male with black hair and soulful eyes, begins his
              routine by standing beside a priest before the altar and staring
              intently at a statue of a Buddhist deity.</p>
              <p>When the priest begins to chant and raises his clasped hands,
              the little dog also lifts his paws and joins them at the tip of his
              nose</p>
              <p>He is now the top attraction at his Japanese temple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He started to pose in prayer like us whenever he wanted treats," said priest Joei Yoshikuni.</p>
              <p>"Clasping hands is a basic action of Buddhist prayer to show appreciation. He may be showing his thanks for treats and walks."</p>
              <p>"It's so funny that he does it," said Kazuko Oshiro, 71, who has
              been going to Jigenin temple on the southern island of Okinawa for more
              than 25 years.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/conanG_468x385.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/conanG_468x385.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>It's a dog's life: Conan's prayer pose is perfect</em></p>
              <p>"He gets angry when somebody else sits on his favourite spot. He must be thinking that it's his special place."</p>
              <p>Conan may not be as devout as first appearances indicate but he does seem to have brought his temple home good luck.</p>
              <p>Visitor numbers have swelled by 30 per cent since his arrival and he a particular attraction for younger people.</p>
              <p>"I'm glad that people feel more comfortable visiting the temple because of Conan," Yoshikuni added.</p>
