              <p>Public transport fares are tentatively set to increase by an average of three per cent.</p>
              <p>The new fare system, approved by the Public Transport Council, PTC, is expected to kick in in October.</p>
              <p>Bus and MRT commuters can expect to pay more in about three months' time.</p>
              <p>But the exact increase will only be known after the public transport operators submit their proposals to the PTC next month.</p>
              <p>Despite this hike, some commuters will actually have to fork out less.</p>
              <p>This is because Ministry of Transport is introducing a new system
              under which commuters pay on the basis of the distance traveled.</p>
              <p>Known as the distance-based through fares system, people who make
              transfers between buses, buses and MRT or LRT and MRT, will benefit.</p>
              <p>Mr Gerard Ee, PTC's chairman.</p>
              <p>"Going into a through fare system means that the commuters all the
              commuters will benefit from it in the sense that they don't have to
              worry about how many changes they make. The cost to them will basically
              be on distance based and it really doesn't matter whether it's
              bus-train, train-bus. And they can plan their journey to be as direct
              as they choose to be."</p>
              <p>Currently four in ten commuters make such transfer journeys.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Transport says it may raise the current transfer rebate of 25 cents.</p>
              <p>This means commuters who make more transfers will not have to spend as much as they do now.</p>
              <p>Mr Ee said the move to a distance-based fare is inevitable.</p>
              <p>"I think that you have to remember that the network of the transport
              system is changing, circle line is coming on again, as the network gets
              more integrated and extensive, transfers will become inevitable."</p>
              <p>However, under the new fare system, those who take direct bus or
              train services may end up paying more than a three per cent hike.</p>
              <p>"Now that has to be worked out to be shared between operators and
              commuters. PTC will apply in such a way that maximum amount of
              commuters will benefit from it. But like all things, however you
              adjust, there will be some elements of commuters that may find that
              they have to pay a bit more. But our object is to minimise that." -938Live</p>

              <p>seriously wth are they talking about. say one side we'll save, and another on the increase. eh, everyone will definitely take direct or transfer rides depending on where they want to go what. so overall whats the increase for.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">PTC tweaks formula for adjusting public transport fares</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Another round of public transport fare hikes is likely this
              year, but commuters can expect the rise to be cushioned by a new fare
              structure formula.</p>
              <p>One group of commuters who stands to benefit are those who make multiple transfer journeys.</p>
              <p>Currently,
              a commuter incurs what is called a transfer penalty every time he
              boards a new bus. To offset this, the commuter is given a 25—cent
              rebate each time he switches from bus to bus, or bus to train.</p>
              <p>But
              this rebate does not fully offset the jump in fares. To address this, a
              distance—based through fare system will be introduced by 2009.</p>
              <p>But for now, Singapore’s Public Transport Council (PTC) will look into increasing the transfer rebate to close the gap.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s Transport Ministry says about four in ten commuters currently make transfer journeys on a weekday.</p>
              <p>With
              the new through fare structure, commuters can take as many buses and
              trains to their destination without being penalised with a higher fare.</p>
              <p>Changes
              will also be made to the fare adjustment formula, which will see the
              public transport operators share their productivity gains with
              commuters.</p>
              <p>This means the maximum annual fare adjustment will be
              capped at 3 per cent instead of the higher 4.2 per cent under the old
              formula.</p>
              <p>The formula is pegged to macroeconomic factors — namely
              changes in the Consumer Price Index and average monthly earnings. The
              formula has been in place since 2005 and valid for three years.</p>
              <p>The
              revised formula will be applicable for five years, instead of three, to
              give commuters and operators more certainty in fares.</p>
              <p>The PTC was
              quick to point out, though, that the maximum annual fare cap of 3 per
              cent does not determine the actual fare adjustment.</p>
              <p>Whether a
              commuter’s bus fare will go up by more than 3 per cent or less, or
              whether a commuter actually stands to save money, will depend on the
              distance travelled and the number of transfers made in a journey.</p>
              <p>Simply
              put, if a commuter takes long bus and train journeys with many
              transfers, he will see a net reduction. But he will probably end up
              paying more for short trips.</p>
              <p>Public transport operators are expected to submit their applications for a fare review in August.</p>
              <p>The PTC will decide on the actual adjustment in September and new fares will kick in in October. — CNA/ir</p>

              well, think of it this way,they divert the bus to cover 1 more road, presently they already scam the other passengers by making them pay for the extra bus stops in that road when the bus does not need to go there. But at least tey don't pay for 1 way roads and circles. With the new scheme, they will have to pay.
              
              <p></p>
              add in the problem of having to pay mroe for a straight bus. so either you pay more for the straight bus and probably arrive faster or trnasfer and have to waste time waiting for the infrequent buses.

              <p>eventually it's going to be multiple bus ride, 1 fare</p>
              <p>say currently take Bus A for 4 fare stages, transfer to bus B for another 8 fare stages, it would be $0.67 + $1.09 - $0.25 = $1.51</p>
              <p>Eventually it would be 12 fare stages fare i.e. $1.19</p>
              <p>wat do you mean by more or less? those who take transfer end up pay much lesser which eats into bus operators turnover and eventually profits alrdy... you think running SBS is tat profitable w/ your 60c bus fare? 40% of their profit comes from ads alone</p>
