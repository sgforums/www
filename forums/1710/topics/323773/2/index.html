              <p>eventually it's going to be multiple bus ride, 1 fare</p>
              <p>say currently take Bus A for 4 fare stages, transfer to bus B for another 8 fare stages, it would be $0.67 + $1.09 - $0.25 = $1.51</p>
              <p>Eventually it would be 12 fare stages fare i.e. $1.19</p>
              <p>wat do you mean by more or less? those who take transfer end up pay much lesser which eats into bus operators turnover and eventually profits alrdy... you think running SBS is tat profitable w/ your 60c bus fare? 40% of their profit comes from ads alone</p>

              <p>don't keep focusing on multiple bus ride.</p>
              <p>you are right to say those who make transfers will end up paying much lesser. what i'm trying to say is increasing direct rides will in the end cover up the 'losses' which you claim the operators will be bearing because of paying lesser during transfers.</p>
              <p>and i actually don't care how many % of the profit comes from ads alone. seriously they should use these what you said 40% to help cushion fares yet we still see crazy profits.</p>

              <p>this shows that you didn't get the main gist of the discussion</p>
              <p>The main gist is that more of whether public transport companies should be earning huge profits, because they are serving the public, i.e., public services, and in the case of Singapore, they are the monopoly, and demand is extremely inelastic. Even if they doubled or tripled the price, you still have to take public transport if you travel far to work everyday</p>
