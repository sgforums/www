            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Groups of foreign workers have been spotted coming in and out of dense foliage just across the road from Methodist Girls' School in Bukit Timah (Blackmore Drive).<br><br>And, residents living in the area have voiced their concerns.<br><br>"It's quite scary, they could be dangerous," said a girl.<br><br>Female joggers in the area have also voiced their concerns.<br><br>"It's quite scary, because out of the blue, they just pop up. So, we try to speed up a bit," said jogger Sarah Chong.<br><br>"Usually, we can sense they are looking at us from head to toe and as we pass them, their eyes will be following us until we disappear round the other corner," said Hannie Hay, another jogger.<br><br>When contacted, MGS said it had not heard of this community near the school until now.<br><br>It has since referred the matter to the Police.<br><br>So, just who are these people and where are they from?<br><br>Channel NewsAsia's Ken Teh investigates and found a small community of foreign workers living in two rows of decrepit terraced houses.<br><br>They cook, wash and sleep in small rooms which they rent for about S$100 a month.<br><br>It looks like they have all the necessary amenities there - running water, electricity and even an old but functional sewage system.<br><br>According to the workers, about 30 of them are living here - Indians, Bangladeshis and also some Malaysians.<br><br>The workers Ken Teh spoke to said they had legal work permits.<br><br>"I do maintenance service, grass cutting," said one.<br><br>Checks with the Police and KTM - the Malaysian railway company - showed the houses and land belong to KTM and were used as staff quarters previously.<br><br>These are now rented out to subcontractors to house their workers.<br><br>The Police and KTM say they conduct regular checks around the area and so far, no illegal workers have been found.<br><br>But a resident suspects some of the men seen in the area are relatives of the workers.<br><br>Asked about this, a KTM source told Ken Teh that there might be some squatters.<br><br>But this may not be a problem for long because KTM has plans to demolish the houses, according to the source.<br><br>One worker living there stresses that he and his neighbours are not a threat to anyone.<br><br>"We're legal workers.......We know there's a girl's school, lot's of girls, don't disturb, morning we go out, finish work we come back home," he said in broken English.<br><br>So, perhaps, those living nearby needn't worry too much about the foreign workers.<br><br>Still, they should take necessary precautions when alone in a quiet or deserted area. - CNA/ir</div>
