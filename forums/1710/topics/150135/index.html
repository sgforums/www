            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong has called for a mindset change in the construction industry towards safety.<br><br>He says the Government can put the necessary legislative framework in place, but developers and contractors must play their part in ensuring that their organisations accord the highest priority and commitment to building a safety culture at all levels.<br><br>A mindset change is most difficult but necessary as changes to processes and procedures will not be effective without it.<br><br>Mr Yeo feels it is time to change the perception of the construction industry from one that prioritises the cost and timely delivery of projects, to one that places safety as a top priority by integrating safety into the overall project planning and management framework.<br><br>But to bring about this mindset change, everyone -- including the Government, regulators, developers, contractors, as well as staff and workers -- must work together to bring about a quantum leap in occupational safety and health in Singapore.<br><br>Mr Yeo was speaking at the Land Transport Authority's Safety Award convention on Monday.<br><br>The annual event is to recognise outstanding contractors for their commitment to high safety standards.<br><br>Nine contractors received awards for their good track record in safety management, with 16 others receiving certificates of participation.<br><br>In his speech, Mr Yeo also outlined areas the Land Transport Authority is looking into to provide incentives for contractors to give top priority to safety.<br><br>It is considering expanding its safety performance scheme for new civil works contracts to include existing projects and for larger contracts.<br><br>It is also enhancing its tender evaluation process by adopting the Price-Quality Method.<br><br>The price and quality criteria would be assessed separately, with the safety component comprising at least 10 percent of the quality criterion.<br><br>The LTA has issued a checklist to its staff so they are clear when a stop work order should be issued.<br><br>It will also set up a system to allow anyone working on site, or associated with site work, to alert its Safety Department of unsafe practices or potentially dangerous situations. - CNA /ct<br><br>Change the bidding system! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
