            <div class='col-md body'>LONDON : British police are keeping tight-lipped about an alleged plot by fathers' rights extremists to kidnap Prime Minister Tony Blair's five-year-old son Leo.<br><br>The Wednesday edition of the Sun mass-circulation newspaper first disclosed details of the alleged plot that was apparently in its early stages, and the BBC reported later that a police source had confirmed its existence.<br><br>However, the BBC's source said police were not convinced that those involved in the plot had the ability to carry it out.<br><br>The Sun said the plot was hatched by "extremist sympathisers" of the Fathers 4 Justice group, which mounts high-profile campaigns for fathers' rights to their children following custody battles.<br><br>Britain's biggest-selling daily said "vigilante dads" aimed to snatch Leo Blair and hold him hostage for a short period to "highlight the plight of fathers denied access to their kids".<br><br>Both London's Metropolitan Police and Blair's Downing Street office were refusing to confirm or deny the story.<br><br>A Met Police spokeswoman told AFP: "We're not commenting on this at all. We don't discuss matters of security. We're not prepared to discuss this in any way, shape or form."<br><br>The Sun cited an unnamed security source as the basis for its dispatch. Blair and his wife Cherie were said to have been told and were "concerned", it added.<br><br>Detectives from the Met's Special Branch -- which has amongst its functions investigating extremism and terrorism -- has been monitoring the "lunatic fringe" of Fathers 4 Justice, The Sun said.<br><br>The group's founder Matt O'Connor said its operations had been suspended pending investigations and vowed he would not let the group be "hijacked" by extremists.<br><br>"There's evidence to support the fact that there was something going on, because SO13 officers (the Met's anti-terrorist unit) had visited some ex-members of the organisation over the Christmas period," he said.<br><br>"That had set alarm bells ringing."<br><br>O'Connor said police contacts had said SO13 "were threatening to shoot people if they did anything in the region of Downing Street".<br><br>He added: "I have three young boys myself and couldn't think of anything more traumatic for Mr Blair, his family and his son.<br><br>"If our position is constantly undermined by extremists, we will shut down the Fathers 4 Justice campaign.<br><br>"I will not let this organisation be hijacked by militants.<br><br>"We do peaceful direct action with a dash of humour. We're in the business of uniting dads with their kids, not separating them," he said.<br><br>Graham Dudman, The Sun's managing editor, told the BBC: "The police took this very seriously because, of course, Fathers 4 Justice have been involved in some pretty spectacular stunts."<br><br>Fathers 4 Justice has staged a number of high-profile stunts around Britain in recent years to highlight what they deem to be unfair child custody laws.<br><br>Their demonstrations -- in which protesters are often dressed as superheroes -- usually involve breaching security and occupying notable landmarks.<br><br>Activists have in the past egged Blair's car, scaled St Paul's Cathedral and the London Eye ferris wheel. They once hit Blair with purple powder during a speech in parliament.<br><br>Protesters even scaled onto a ledge at Buckingham Palace, the official London residence of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.<br><br>The rarely-seen Leo George Blair has always been a focus of media attention, being the first baby born to a serving British prime minister for more than 150 years.<br><br>The Blairs have sought to keep him, like his siblings Euan, 22 on Thursday, Nicholas, 21, and 17-year-old Kathryn, out of the media spotlight.<br><br>Just weeks after the birth, the Blairs issued the first of several calls for privacy after pictures of a sleeping Leo taken by a group of schoolchildren were printed.<br><br>The Sun said exact details of the plot were not revealed and no arrests had been made.<br><br>But police believe the conspirators were from a breakaway element of the group who believe the mainstream protesters are not radical enough, it added. - AFP /dt<br><br></div>
