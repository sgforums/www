            <div class='col-md body'>US deserter's snap implies Pyongyang abducted citizens from all over Asia<br><br>Nov 7, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br><br>BANGKOK - NORTH Korea abducted a Thai woman in Macau in 1978 and forced her to marry an American army defector in Pyongyang, a new book claims.<br><br>Intelligence sources fear many other people were seized, drugged and smuggled into the secretive communist state.<br><br>The kidnapped Thai woman was named as Anoche (the Japanese pronunciation of the Thai name 'Anocha') Panjoy in the book Kokuhaku (To Tell The Truth), published recently in Japanese and written by Mr Charles Jenkins, 64, the American soldier who defected to North Korea in 1965.<br><br>In a photograph from Mr Jenkins which was published on the website of US television network CBS and Thailand's Nation newspaper, the US Army deserter is seen sitting beside his wife and oldest child on a beach in North Korea.<br><br>But the new and potentially explosive information concerns a woman on the left of the frame whom Mr Jenkins said was the Thai national.<br><br>If what Mr Jenkins said is true, it would represent the first photographic evidence that North Korea abducted ordinary citizens from Asian countries other than Japan and South Korea, according to CBS.<br><br>In his book, Mr Jenkins writes: 'I saw many people from Hong Kong and South-east Asia who I am sure had been snatched, and many of the Europeans and Middle Easterners I knew, saw or met in North Korea were, for one reason or another, unable to leave the country due to obstacles that the North Koreans purposely constructed to keep them there.<br><br>'It is a tragedy, in my opinion, that more countries don't investigate further...I am certain there are abductees from all over the world in North Korea.'<br><br>Family and friends from Anocha's village in Thailand's northern Chiang Mai province believe the woman in the photograph is Anocha.<br><br>'It is conclusive that Anocha Panjoy lived here and people who knew her insist that she is the same person as in the (Jenkins) photo,' San Kamphaeng village district chief Surachai Jongrak told the Nation.<br><br>Anocha's brother, Sukham, told the newspaper he had always believed his sister was alive.<br><br>He added that he hoped to go to Bangkok soon to provide the authorities there with information about her.<br><br>'That is why I have never removed her name from our household registration,' he said.<br><br>Officials in the foreign affairs division of Thailand's National Police Bureau and its National Intelligence Agency said they had no record of the missing woman.<br><br>Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has vowed to follow up with the North Koreans, and the Thai Embassy in Japan is expected to ask Tokyo to request more information from Mr Jenkins, who now lives in Japan with his family.<br><br>Mr Jenkins ended up spending four decades in North Korea, unable to leave. In his book, he writes about the dull uniformity of daily life in Pyongyang, where he worked as a translator and English teacher.<br><br>Through the intervention of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Mr Jenkins, his Japanese wife Hiromi Soga and their two daughters were allowed to leave North Korea last November.<br><br>The family now lives in Japan. Since his release, Mr Jenkins has provided a rare first-hand account of the secretive ways of the hermitic communist regime.<br><br>He said one of three US Army deserters, Private Larry Abshier, had married the Thai woman, who was 19 at the time.<br><br>He said the woman had grown up in Thailand and was working as a prostitute in Macau before her abduction by North Korean agents.<br><br>The other two US Army deserters were Mr Jerry Parrish, who later married a Lebanese Muslim woman, and Mr James Dresnok, who married a Romanian woman.<br><br>Mr Parrish had three sons, while Mr Dresnok had two sons.<br><br>In a report aired by 60 Minutes on CBS recently, Mr Jenkins first revealed the existence of the Thai woman.<br><br>According to him, two North Korean agents had seized her on her way home from work and taken her to North Korea. -- THE NATION/ASIA NEWS NETWORK, ASSOCIATED PRESS<br></div>
