            <div class='col-md body'>BANGKOK : Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has vowed to prosecute protesters who broke into Government House in Bangkok overnight and called for him to resign.<br><br>A few thousand supporters of media mogul and Thaksin arch critic Sondhi Limthongkul rallied in a downtown park then walked to Government House late Friday when several hundred briefly entered its grounds.<br><br>"Regarding last night's events, it was regrettable that a former national police chief led protesters to break the gate at Government House, which I consider an illegal action," Thaksin said in his weekly national radio address.<br><br>"I will prosecute all who breach the law."<br><br>Government House is Thaksin's office, where his cabinet holds its meetings and he receives dignitaries.<br><br>Former police chief and Bangkok senator Pratin Santiprapob, who resigned in 2005 claiming senators worked for the government and were not neutral, joined the gathering of Sondhi's supporters in Bangkok's Lumpini park.<br><br>"These rallies are becoming unbearable and must stop," Thaksin said of several meetings during which Sondhi presents his "Thailand weekly" programme and airs alleged corruption by the Thaksin administration.<br><br>At their height, the rallies attracted tens of thousands of people, but began waning in early December after Thaksin withdrew all six defamation suits against Sondhi when revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej called on public figures to accept fair criticism.<br><br>Friday's event drew fewer than 5,000 chanting people wearing yellow t-shirts and head bands and waving Thai flags. Several hundred anti-Sondhi demonstrators tried to stop the rally but were unsuccessful, Thai media reported.<br><br>"There are some protesters who are hired and misled by wrong doers, people broken-hearted by the government's refusal to grant their wishes, people who every week invent stories and demand I step down," Thaksin said.<br><br>Thaksin heavily criticised the protesters and vowed he would not resign because of "mob" pressure, adding he was re-elected in a landslide in February 2005 and had brought many benefits to Thailand.<br><br>"I consider that they did not respect the rule of law and were aggressive by storming the Government House gates at midnight and calling for my resignation, accusing me that I cannot solve the nation's problems," he said.<br><br>"More than 19 million people elected me and since I assumed office I managed to repay the IMF's debt two years earlier than scheduled," Thaksin said of debt to the International Monetary Fund.<br><br>"Thailand is now a donor country, and has an historic record of international reserves at 52.8 billion dollars," he added. - AFP/ch</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also agree he made a lot of improvements for his country, and brought much prosperty to thai people, he's has strong business acument lah, quite honest lad but mebbe a tad high on the horse but which leader having brought success to so many won't behave like that. Unfortunately he not a strong military leader, a strong military leader will definately quash all the problems in the south like a matchstick.<br><br>I hope eventually they will preassure him to step down. Thailand is too strong a competitor for singapore with him at the helm pity his people are too blinded by petty political rivalry and domestic problems to realise that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe, and if he is less uncompromising and more apporachable to singapore it will be good ... mebbe we can "cut a deal" with him to abandon the mad quest.<br><br>but no lah, the current focus of problems they have now are non-economic, I see the next leader in the kingdom to be someone with strong military backing.</div>
