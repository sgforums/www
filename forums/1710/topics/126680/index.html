            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The prosecution in the trial of two Indonesian maids accused of murder refuted a psychiatrist's view that one of them had acted in a lapse of self-control.<br><br>They challenged Dr Douglas Kong's view that Juminem, 19, had acted in a lapse of self-control brought on by severe provocation by her employer Esther Ang.<br><br>Juminem and another maid Siti, 16, were charged with the murder of Madam Ang.<br><br>In its questioning, the prosecution reminded the court of Juminem asking Siti to hit her on the head with a bottle to make it look like a robbery had occurred.<br><br>The prosecution suggested this ability to formulate a plan showed Juminem was capable of logical thought during the incident.<br><br>Dr Kong objected, saying people could carry out many seemingly complicated activities in a state of numbness and incoherence.<br><br>He argued that only people under great emotional duress could hurt themselves without thought of pain, as Juminem eventually did in smashing the bottle against her own forehead.<br><br>The defence also made the point that although Juminem took nine credit cards from Madam Ang's handbag, she had neither owned nor learnt to use one before.<br><br>The prosecution submitted that Juminem exaggerated to Dr Kong the symptoms of depression she suffered, which she had not mentioned to the prosecution psychiatrist, Dr Kenneth Koh.<br><br>These details were also not found in the police statements Juminem had made earlier.<br><br>Dr Koh will be called to testify on Wednesday. - CNA</div>
