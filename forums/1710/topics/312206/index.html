              <h1><strong>It may be a White Easter, but these dogs know how to make their sheep say 'spring'</strong></h1>
              <p>Sheepdogs are trained to obey their master's every word. So when farmer
                  David Kennard decided one of those words would be "Spring", his dogs
                  did not hesitate.</p>
              <p>They rounded up the flock on the hills of Mr Kennard's north
                  Devon farm and, with a little help from their master, created a picture
                  that reminds us that, whatever the weather, this is officially the
                  first weekend of Spring.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The scene did call for a careful scattering of feed to make the sheep form themselves in the shapes of the six letters.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/sheep2203_468x352.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/sheep2203_468x352.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>It may be snowing elsewhere in Britain, but if these sheep say it's spring, it's spring</em></p>
              <p>However, it was down to the team of Collies – who everyone knows border
                  on the brilliant – to have the last word. They circled the 200-strong
                  flock and kept them from wandering off-message.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Three of David's five working dogs – Mist, Fern and Jake – were
                  employed to help create the perfect lettering, which took three hours
                  to achieve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Said David yesterday: "I'm proud of my dogs. They couldn't have
                  done it without my spreading the feed across the hillside, of course –
                  but I couldn't have done it without them, either."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then David's Border Collies are very much of the performing
                  breed. They have appeared on DVDs and on TV in films made by the
                  41-year-old farmer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He originally started making videos of his hard-working hands
                  ten years ago to supplement earnings at his 400-acre farm near
                  Woolacombe. He then wrote a top-ten best-selling book, A Shepherd's
                  Watch.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/sheepdog2203_468x352.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/sheepdog2203_468x352.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>The sheep were herded into position by the faithful - and now famous - sheepdogs</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That led to a TV film which followed the progress of one particular
                  dog, Mist, from puppyhood to full-grown sheepdog. Other starring roles
                  were taken by Mist's mother Gail, grandparents Greg and Swift and
                  fellow four-legged family members Ernie, Fern and Jake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The film proved so successful that Mist's adventures were
                  turned into a channel Five children's TV series with the voices of
                  Derek Jacobi, Brian Blessed and Sandra Dickinson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It all started when I noticed people leaning over the walls of
                  my fields to watch my sheepdogs at work," David said. "I realised my
                  dogs were my greatest asset and that if One Man and His Dog was so
                  popular, I ought to give it a go."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>David placed his first video on local farmers' market stalls –
                  but it ended up selling 80,000 copies worldwide. His TV series, Mist:
                  Sheepdog Tales, returns with a new series on Five next month (April
                  12), along with a newly-released DVD (April 14) of the entire first
                  series.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As well as going above the call of duty to earn their keep,
                  David's dogs are very much part of the family, sharing kitchen space
                  with his wife Debbie and their three children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when it came to getting sheep to put a spring in their
                  step, they proved they could conjure up a bright spell, whatever the
                  Easter weather.</p>
