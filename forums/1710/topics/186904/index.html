            <div class='col-md body'>there was this chinese current affairs program talking about the en bloc sale / upgrading of flats in jurong (east?). anybody watched?<br><br>last week, the program was saying a lot of residents were unhappy because the new flats allocated to them for selection were too small, too inconvenient as no public transport, no coffee shops, supermarkets etc.<br>they seem to paint a very negative picture. there was even one resident who was almost in tears as she says that there will be no one to help take care of her elderly father after moving to the new flats.<br>(details may not be entirely accurate, but something along that line)<br><br>but yesterday, this same program painted a completely different picture. it said that the new flats were actually bigger, the convenience stores and coffee shops were only 15 mins walk away (which i think is still a very long distance for older folks) and public transport will improve with time (so what are they going to do in the meantime? call taxi everyday?)<br><br>i can't help be think that such a move (correction of previously aired program) is made under political pressure (in the light of the uncoming election and all). have the producers not thoroughly checked the validity of the complaints of the residents before airing the program. should not such programs reflect the sentiments of the common people (i'm assuming that the 1st version is accurate because i don't agree with the explanations given in the second version) instead of subscribing to some political agenda? (yes yes. i know... i being idealistic)<br><br>in any case, i'm thoroughly disgusted with such a move.<br>in the past, when there were 2 TV broadcasting companies,<br>channel U always seemed to be more critical of the gahmen.<br>one can't help but think that perhaps that's why the gahmen were so vocal about the merging of the the 2 companies...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div>
