            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Should certain jobs be reserved for older workers, especially in a tough job market?<br><br>That's one of the more controversial ideas brought up in Parliament this week.<br><br>And while some worry about the market distortion that could cause, others argue not doing anything would create even more problems down the road.<br><br>72-year-old Ng See Siong has worked as a trolley retriever in Changi Airport for 3 years.<br><br>He applied for the job after noticing many older workers in this profession.<br><br>For Ng and 70-year old former policeman Soaeb Hasbullah, both had to work at various odd jobs after retirement before getting their present job of trolley retriever.<br><br>Mr Ng said: "Because old man nobody wants to take."<br><br>Mr Soaeb said: "It is very hard for me to get a job to secure myself."<br><br>Both men are part of a new silver contingent at Changi Airport where at least 70 per cent of the trolley retrievers are aged 55 and above.<br><br>But it wasn't always like that.<br><br>"In the beginning, it didn't start as a deliberate policy. What happened is that we didn't reject anyone that came to us for a job and over time it evolved and now we use it as a deliberate policy to give elderly jobs. They have a very good attitude and they are very patient," said Aaron Tiong Yuen, general manager of WSID Pte Ltd.<br><br>So what started off as something by word of mouth has now become established practice so much so that even children apply for these jobs for their parents.<br><br>But should this become a deliberate policy in other industries?<br><br>And if so, how can it be done?<br><br>Unionists like Nithiah Nandan are all for the idea which, he says, will need employers, government and workers to think differently.<br><br>One complication is that not all older workers fall into a homogenous group.<br><br>Mr Nithiah Nandan said: "When we zero in on older workers, we say they are low skilled, low paid, untrainable. I mean, economic downturn showed us three layers were affected. One comes from lower end, one comes from middle level where layering has been reduced and there is the professional group because certain industries have disappeared. We cannot just lump them together and say look at cleaning industry - that is unsuitable for certain groups."<br><br>And while some Singaporeans may agree to giving older workers jobs, there are concerns about market distortions.<br><br>"There will be some market distortions, if instead of letting market forces play, you adjust it. But in any country, that will happen. If you don't do that, other civic and social problems might also cause market distortions," said Mr Nithiah Nandan.<br><br>"Should just leave it to the market, depends on whether older workers are suitable for the jobs in the first place, because if you reserve the jobs for the older workers, what about the rest?" said a member of the public.<br><br>But another said: "It's a good idea. Finding a job in Singapore is very difficult now, even for the youngsters."<br><br>"Totally agree, because I know of some very fit older people who are just idling at home. Maybe, you should have a quota, then it's a fair system, no one complains," said a third.<br><br>A tripartite panel has been formed to consider how to keep the greying population employed longer. - CNA</div>
