            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Singapore has urged countries affected by the tsunami disaster to ensure that no security vacuum arises as a result of the turbulence and their relief efforts.<br><br>Speaking at an annual national security seminar, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan also called on nations to look ahead and put in place the necessary early warning mechanisms, both for tracking future tsunamis and terror threats.<br><br>The tsunami disaster and transnational terrorism have one thing in common - both are events of low probability but with a high consequence.<br><br>Dr Tan noted that in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, countries affected by it have been busy with the rescue and relief operations and this must be their top priority.<br><br>But he warned that it would be a grave mistake if these countries neglected dealing also with other more serious challenging threats, like transnational terrorism, while they are preoccupied with the tsunami outcome.<br><br>Dr Tan stressed it would be a disaster if countries relaxed their guard.<br><br>"Governments must ensure that no security vacuum arises as a result of the turmoil and turbulence caused by the tsunami, and that no groups, bent on mischief, can take advantage of the current situation," he said.<br><br>Similarly, in the field of security, Dr Tan cautioned that countries cannot sit back and be content, thinking that an attack matching or exceeding the devastation of September 11, 2001 terror attacks on the US would not happen again.<br><br>What's needed is a critical horizon scanning capability to peer into the future and to construct an early warning mechanism for acts of terror.<br><br>"Right now, Singapore is developing critical capabilities to identify, analyze and track evolving threats and trends. This represents, for us, our next priority area in the fight against terror," Dr Tan said.<br><br>"More broadly, governments must begin to adopt a more extensive, systems-based planning approach that can deal with strategic complexity, with multi-faceted, multi-dimensional challenges, investing in the necessary early warning and detection capabilities for all critical sectors, be it security, the economy or the environment. We can't predict the future. But we can certainly anticipate what might come before it strikes and prepare ourselves accordingly. That is our duty to our countries and to humanity," he added.<br><br>Dr Tan noted countries in the Indian Ocean belt now realised the damage could have been reduced if there was an early warning system.<br><br>Singapore, he said, can help in the international efforts to set up an early warning system as there's already much expertise both in the government and academia.<br><br>Dr Tony Tan: "You need to put sensors in the Indian Ocean, you need to put communications sytems, you also need to do scientific modelling and research in order to predict how the tsunami waves will spread, how fast they will reach the countries that have been affected. It's a complex system. A basic system can be set up fairly quickly and at a relatively, not exorbitant cost."<br><br>Turning to the Singapore Armed Forces' involvement in the relief operations in Aceh, Dr Tan said it would be phasing out its activities as the bulk of what it could do there was coming to an end.<br><br>He expects the SAF to complete its work there in one to two weeks. - CNA<br><br>The effect of the terroist, maybe...
