            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Jailed priest Joachim Kang's credibility was brought into question during cross-examination on Day 4 of the hearing over disputed assets amounting to some S$1.5 million.<br><br>Among the issues raised were allegations in Father Kang's affidavit, that he had been urged to enter into a plea bargain during his embezzlement trial last year.<br><br>Father Kang, who is serving a 7-and-half years' sentence, asserted that two high-ranking officials of the Archdiocese - the Chancellor and Vicar General - as well as the archbishop's lawyer, Senior Counsel Michael Khoo, had exhorted him to end the trial by way of a plea bargain.<br><br>The plea bargain resulted in an amendment of the 19 charges, with the prosecution proceeding with 6 charges and the rest were taken into consideration during sentencing.<br><br>Father Kang claimed that Reverend Father Patrick Goh and Monsignor Eugene Vaz were concerned about the impact of his trial on the Church, while Mr Michael Khoo had offered to speak with authorities about downgrading his criminal charges if he entered into a plea bargain.<br><br>But Mr Khoo rebutted that there were no such urging and it was Father Kang who changed his plea to avoid the submission of a letter he had written to his god-daughter Anna Lee - to save himself from embarrassment.<br><br>The Senior Counsel said, "What you say in your affidavit is untrue and scandalous, and tendered to portray your innocence, when the truth of the matter is that you were guilty of the offences, and were advised by counsel unreservedly, pleaded guilty to the charges unreservedly, admitted to the facts and consented to 13 charges being taken into consideration."<br><br>Mr Khoo also put to the priest that plaintiff Emily Chan entrusted the three S$10,000 notes with him for use in the event that something should happen to her and her mother - not gifts as he claimed.<br><br>The defendant, however, insisted Ms Chan had persuaded him to open a safe deposit box and offered to invest S$12,000 dollars in a unit trust account.<br><br>The case has been adjourned for lawyers to prepare their submissions. - CNA</div>
