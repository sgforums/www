            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>I COMPLETED my O levels last month and was posted to a junior college (JC) through the Provisional Admission Exercise.<br><br>Under current guidelines, students who take Higher Mother Tongue can get two bonus points deducted from their JC entry score. As a result, students like myself who do not take the subject are not eligible for the deduction.<br><br>Of course, students who do very well in their co-curricular activities (CCAs) are also awarded two bonus points.<br><br>When I was admitted into secondary school, I was neither in the top 10 per cent of the cohort, nor did I score an A* in my Mother Tongue. Hence, I was not eligible to take up Higher Mother Tongue in secondary school.<br><br>It was only two years later that changes were made to allow the top 30 per cent of students to take up Higher Mother Tongue.<br><br>So although I got a perfect score of six in my preliminary examinations, I was unable to gain admission to elite junior colleges where the cut-off was three points.<br><br>Yet students who had an L1R5 score of seven were admitted to these JCs, because they took High Mother Tongue and did well in their CCAs, thus gaining four bonus points.<br><br>This loophole in the system has certainly put students who do not take Higher Mother Tongue at a disadvantage.<br><br>I would like to propose that one or two bonus points be awarded to students who get an A1 or A2 for their O-level Mother Tongue exams. This suggestion helps late bloomers who may excel in Mother Tongue only in secondary school.<br><br>I hope changes can be made to level the playing field.<br><br>Celine Teo Ying Zhen (Miss)<br></div>

Would it really kill her if she didn't make it to one of the 'elites'? In the end, she's still going to get a JC education no matter where she gets posted to. If anything, with her grades, she ought to be able to get a place into one of the JCs on the higher end of the spectrum, just not the 'elite' ones which she so wanted to get into.<br><br>In the end, it's the student's ability and effort that counts, not the school he or she attends.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think a meritocratic education system, by the definition of 'meritocratic', no matter how good or objective, would always somehow penalise the late bloomer. It's very hard to devise a system that retroactively rewards the late bloomer when he or she finally comes good. For example, in this case, how can you give this Ms Celine additional points for her Chinese or other subjects/achievements, so as to compensate for her not-so-good performance in pervious years?</div>
