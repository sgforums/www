            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Authorities are expected to revise the current height limit for children in 2008.<br><br>That is when the next review on the National Growth Chart, done once in 10 years, comes around.<br><br>When that happens, companies such as transport operators may need to re-think the way they structure child fares on buses and MRT trains.<br><br>Stelle Teo looks like an 8-year-old, but she's only 4.<br><br>The pre-schooler stands at about 1.14 metres and because of her height, she has to pay transport fares while other shorter children get away with free rides.<br><br>"They should base it on age, instead of height. Otherwise, it's unfair to the parents. Some kids are tall for their age, so even when they are underage, they have to pay for the fares. And the fare is not cheap," said Angeline Lim, Stella's mother.<br><br>Transport companies and movie theatres have set 0.9 metres as the height limit for children. Those who are 8 years and above will need to pay.<br><br>But this system means that even those who are younger than 8 years old but are taller than the height limit are required to pay, and many feel the majority of children today fall in this category.<br><br>Most pre-school teachers and parents say children today are much taller for their age as compared to the past.<br><br>One pediatrician noted that babies born today are much bigger compared to their siblings some 10 years ago.<br><br>Dr June Lou, a pediatrician said: "Perhaps the authorities should look at the norm for the Singapore child and revise it accordingly. At least give the public the benefit of the doubt that there has been an increase in height.<br><br>"I don't know where they got the 90 cm limit from. It's probably based on some older data. So they should actually look at the present figures and put a decent number for the average Singapore child today, which would be about 103 cm for a 4-year-old," said Dr Lou.<br><br>Currently, TransitLink and Golden Village movie theatres say they have no plans to change the children's height limit of 0.9 metres. - CNA/ Is</div>
