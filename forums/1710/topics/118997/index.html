            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The police are expanding the use of surveillance cameras. Now, Closed Circuit TV cameras will be used in Geylang to help lower the amount of vice activity there.<br><br>The police have also released last year's crime statistics.<br><br>The number of arrests made by them hit a record high of 24,606 last year, an increase of 6 percent from 2003.<br><br>But this is attributed more to minor crimes such as theft and drink-driving, rather than serious offences.<br><br>Most major offences such as robbery, rape and murder registered decreases.<br><br>Police statistics also reveal that the number of molest cases in nightspots increased by more than 60 percent last year, from 54 cases in 2003 to 87 cases in 2004.<br><br>And while you are having fun at nightspots, you may also want to pay special attention to your mobile phone.<br><br>The number of theft and robbery cases involving mobile phones increased by 5 percent to 161 cases last year.<br><br>Said Singapore Police Force Assistant Commissioner Aubeck Kam, "We have seen some cases where people approach well meaning and helpful Singaporeans and ask to borrow their handphones and having taken possession of their handphones; they run away.<br><br>"The other thing that Singaporeans can do is to keep good record of their handphone IMEI or IMA numbers because if you happen to lose it, reporting that number can help the police to trace it back."<br><br>Other significant increases in crimes committed last year include drink driving, which went up by 44 percent to 834 cases, break-ins at industrial premises, which rose by 93 percent to 107 cases, and snatch thefts, which increased by 11 percent to 429 cases.<br><br>The police also announced that they will be installing eight surveillance cameras at Geylang.<br><br>It is hoped that the cameras will have a psychological deterrent on potential offenders and lower the amount of vice activity in this area.<br><br>Residents and shop owners surveyed say they welcomed the news.<br><br>"It's a good move because there is a lot of crime in this Geylang area, so it will be more security for everyone," one person said.<br><br>"The crime rate will go down if they know that the police are watching," said another.<br><br>"With the surveillance camera on, the place is safe here. People will come more to shop and have their food," said a third person.<br><br>Police say that the CCTVs earlier installed at Newton Hawker Centre, Little India and Boat Quay have helped them to diffuse several fights and to solve some cases. - CNA</div>
