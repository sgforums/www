            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: 17 students from Unity Primary in Choa Chu Kang have been hit by the Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD).<br><br>The students affected cut across all levels, from Primary 1 to Primary 6.<br><br>Students with HFMD symptoms were first isolated and then checked by teachers.<br><br>Those found to have fever, blisters on their hands and ulcers in their mouths were sent home.<br><br>The first two cases were detected on 1 April when parents of the Primary 1 students informed the school.<br><br>Five days later, another student from the same class contracted the disease.<br><br>Since then, about three students have been down with HFMD daily.<br><br>The school says that besides suspending all co-curricular activities, students are also seated further apart from each other in classrooms.<br><br>School principal Teoh Tiong San said: "Some of the measures we've put in place are active checking of pupils who have shown signs of the HFMD and isolating suspect cases.<br><br>"We have also stepped up our cleaning efforts. Classrooms are cleaned twice a day. Common areas like the halls, canteen and especially the toilets, are cleaned four times a day.<br><br>"We are also educating our students on the importance of personal hygiene and social responsibility."<br><br>Posters have also been put up to educate students on HFMD's symptoms.<br><br>Unity Primary is not the first school to report such cases over the last few weeks.<br><br>The public has called Channel NewsAsia's hotline to say some childcare centres were found to have the disease.<br><br>According to the Health Ministry, there was a slight increase in the number of children infected with HFMD last month compared to the same period last year.<br><br>But the Ministry says it's no cause for alarm.<br><br>It says HFMD, caused by enteroviruses commonly found among children, spreads easily when they gather in close proximity. - CNA/ir</div>
