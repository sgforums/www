            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : When news broke that both public transport operators had won an overall 2.4 percent fare hike effective July, share investors began favouring one company over the other.<br><br>The Public Transport Council had said the fare increase would raise revenue for each operator by S$13 million to S$14 million.<br><br>As a result, SMRT shares surged 6.8 percent on Monday, but gave up 2.7 percent on Tuesday.<br><br>In contrast, Comfort Delgro was more muted, gaining 0.6 percent yesterday, but giving it all back today.<br><br>Still, analysts believe it is Comfort Delgro that is headed for better times, and they believe SMRT will be left behind instead.<br><br>Analysts say SMRT's 6.8 percent share surge on Monday was overdone, and smacks of a knee-jerk reaction.<br><br>OCBC Research went so far as to downgrade SMRT from "buy" to "hold".<br><br>OCBC says the stock has already risen 20 percent in one month, and at Tuesday's S$1.07, is near its fair value of S$1.13.<br><br>NetResearch Asia believes SMRT has already overshot its fair value of just 98 cents.<br><br>Said Kevin Scully, managing director of NetResearch Asia, "SMRT is probably fairly valued already. My fair value is 98 cents. It's currently about 8 to 10 percent overvalued. And given that interest rates are rising, and it's a yield play, you will probably see it move closer to the one dollar level."<br><br>Said Gabriel Yap, senior dealing director at Phillip Securities, "For SMRT, my fair target is S$1.18. That is based on the earnings potential for this current year, as well as the price to book valuation."<br><br>Analysts favour Comfort Delgro for its more diversified earnings base -- it has its taxi business, owns 70 percent of bus operator SBS Transit, and operates the Metroline in the UK, with businesses in China and Vietnam.<br><br>Brokerage house Kim Eng is also keeping a "buy" on ComfortDelgro, with a fair value of S$2.18.<br><br>It says its group dividend is also attractive at 5.3 percent.<br><br>Kim Eng believes the impact of fare hike is unlikely to be significant to ComfortDelgro's group earnings in fiscal year 2005. - CNA /ct</div>
