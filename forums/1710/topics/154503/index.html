            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : From next year, Singaporeans and permanent residents can have MediShield coverage up to the age of 85, five years more than the current limit.<br><br>This is one of several planned changes in MediShield and Medisave announced by Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan.<br><br>Like many retirees, Abdul Aziz Hassan is concerned about rising healthcare costs.<br><br>So the 69-year-old welcomed news that MediShield will cover him and his wife for more years.<br><br>The extended coverage will start from January 2006, but to benefit you must already have Medishield coverage by the age of 75.<br><br>Some 750 people whose MediShield coverage ended when they turned 80 will also be invited to rejoin the scheme.<br><br>Annual premiums will cost S$600 for those aged 81 to 83 years old and S$705 for those aged 84 to 85.<br><br>Said Mr Khaw, "I think it's a rate that's sustainable and as low as we could get it because in the market today, if you want to buy those elderly products from NTUC or AIA, they all run into thousands of dollars."<br><br>Changes are also on the cards for those who are still working and have healthy Medisave accounts.<br><br>They will be allowed to withdraw more of their Medisave at private hospitals, subject to a cap.<br><br>And they may be able to dip into their Medisave for certain outpatient care.<br><br>If the changes go ahead, patients with chronic diseases would be allowed to use some of their Medisave for treatment at specialist outpatient clinics at hospitals or at their GP surgeries.<br><br>Said Mr Khaw, "Let's say you have diabetes and I know that over the next few years you will need to do this and do that, then maybe (have) some kind of package; say, okay you have diabetes so you can claim up to so many dollars for a diabetes package."<br><br>But the health minister said more work needed to be done because Medisave was designed for inpatient care.<br><br>He worries that if he loosens the rules too quickly, some people may deplete their Medisave accounts, leaving nothing for hospitalisation.<br><br>Mr Khaw said, "The potential for abuse at outpatient is a lot higher than the potential for abuse at inpatient, because for inpatient, beds are limited and we have strict admission policies; whereas outpatients are walk-in." - CNA/ct</div>
