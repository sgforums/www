            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: The owner of a famous curry puff stall in Ang Mo Kio Central has been sentenced to two weeks' jail for under declaring his profits so as to evade taxes.<br><br>Looi Saan Cheng, the boss of Tip Top Curry Puffs, pleaded guilty in the Subordinate Courts on Friday.<br><br>Besides a jail term, he also has to pay a penalty three times the amount of tax undercharged.<br><br>The 63-year-old runs a successful curry puff business, and was even mentioned during a National Day Rally.<br><br>IRAS said this is the first case where a hawker in a coffee shop has been prosecuted for tax evasion.<br><br>IRAS prosecutor Sinnadurai Maniam proceeded with two of the six original charges.<br><br>The court heard that Looi had on 2 April 2005 made a false entry when he filed his income tax returns. He stated that he had earned a net profit of S$6,080, when the actual amount was S$199,960.<br><br>Looi under-declared again in 2006. This time, he stated that net profit earned was S$18,204, when the amount was in fact S$236,140.<br><br>As a result, the amount of tax evaded in both instances came up to S$65,396.<br><br>The judge sentenced Looi to two weeks' jail on each of the two charges. However, the sentences will run concurrently, so Looi will only serve a two-week jail term.<br><br>He will also have to pay a penalty of S$196,195.<br><br>In arguing for a deterrent sentence, the prosecutor stressed that under-declarations or other instances of evasion operate as fraud to the authorities. This constitutes a serious offence which should be punished appropriately. - CNA/ir<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/304035/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/304035/1/.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chong Chee Kin<br>Sat, Oct 06, 2007<br>The Straits Times<br><br>OVER six years, Looi San Cheng made $1.06 million selling his famous Tip Top curry puffs from his Ang Mo Kio hawker stall.<br><br>But when it came to giving the taxman his due, Looi lied and declared profits of only $2,800 between 2001 and last year.<br><br>Yesterday, Looi became the first hawker to be convicted and jailed for tax evasion.<br><br>Looi, who will spend two weeks in jail for two of the six charges under the Income Tax Act, was also ordered to pay a penalty of $196,000 - three times the amount of taxes he dodged in 2005 and last year.<br><br>The remaining four charges were withdrawn after Looi paid a further $291,000 penalty to compound them.<br><br>Looi could have been jailed up to three years.<br><br>The 63-year-old founder of the family-run business made headlines in August last year on a much happier note.<br><br>Tip Top was cited by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally speech as a small local company having made inroads overseas, with outlets in Harbin and Shenyang in China.<br><br>Looi had started humbly, selling the snacks at his Marine Parade bakery in 1976. They became so popular that he moved to his present location three years later.<br><br>A different picture was painted of Looi yesterday by Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) prosecutor Sinnadurai Maniam.<br><br>He told the court that Looi had wilfully made false entries in his income tax returns for six years.<br><br>Following a tip-off in September last year, Iras raided Looi's Housing Board flat in Serangoon Avenue 2 and his Ang Mo Kio Central stall.<br><br>An audit of the accounts revealed the discrepancies.<br><br>It turned out that while Looi claimed he sold 4,000 to 5,000 curry puffs a day at $1 each, the figures did not match the statement of accounts for the stall.<br><br>He earned nett profits of $138,000 to $236,000 annually in those six years.<br><br>But Looi, in his tax returns for those years, declared that, at best, he made only $18,000 in nett, or taxable, profits.<br><br>In his 2002 income tax returns, he stated that he made a loss of $37,209 in 2001 when in fact, he made a profit of $145,000.<br><br>Urging the court to send a strong message that tax evasion would not be tolerated, Mr Sinnadurai pointed to the substantial amount of taxes which Looi had dodged.<br><br>In the six-year period, he under-declared his takings by about $1 million.<br><br>In a letter addressed to District Judge Aedit Abdullah, Looi, who was unrepresented, said he was remorseful and had followed the wrong advice from his bookkeeper.<br><br>He had been cooperative with the taxman and opened his books to them because he had 'nothing to hide'.<br><br>Looi was packed off to jail yesterday, but business hardly stopped at the Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8 stall, with customers coming from as far as Sengkang and Yishun for the tasty pastry's famed curry filling and crust.<br><br>Signs of a crackdown on hawker tax-cheats came earlier this year, when The Straits Times had reported that about a dozen food businesses were hauled up by the Iras for under-declaring their incomes.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
