            <div class='col-md body'>A 31-year-old man died on Monday following complications after undergoing gastric band surgery.<br><br>Ross Tay is believed to be the first person in Singapore to have died from such complications.<br><br>He had the procedure performed at Alexandra Hospital, which is a leading institution for such surgical weight management procedures.<br><br>Also known as lap band surgery, it is only available to people who are very overweight and who have not responded to changes in diet, exercise regimen and medication.<br><br>Mr Tay, a martial arts instructor and tour bus driver, weighed 176 kilogrammes and was diabetic.<br><br>His family told Channel NewsAsia he first went for gastric band surgery in March this year and suffered an allergic reaction to the band.<br><br>He had it removed days after but was advised to try the procedure again in July.<br><br>This time, surgeons found too much scar tissue to install the band.<br><br>When he returned home, he complained that he was feeling unwell and on July 29, was readmitted with a high fever.<br><br>Doctors operated on him a third time and removed infected tissue and his spleen.<br><br>Mr Tay then fell into a coma and continued to bleed internally, so he was operated on a fourth time.<br><br>He died on Monday from complications including blood poisoning.<br><br>Mr Tay had just got married in March; now, his family members expect the medical bills to come up to some S$20,000.<br><br>They say they are grateful for the staff who tried to save Mr Tay in the last days of his life, but wonder if his death could have been prevented.<br><br>Said his brother Melvin Tay, "Public awareness - we just want to let others know this cannot be 100 percent. It was like a very simple operation, we thought; we didn't expect that it would lead to today's stage."<br><br>Gastric band surgery is a keyhole procedure that involves putting a band around the upper part of the stomach to reduce appetite.<br><br>It is a measure of last resort, and the Health Ministry only allows it for people with a body mass index over 32.<br><br>Doctors here say the risks from gastric band surgery are low compared to other weight management surgery like stomach stapling; in fact, the mortality rate is 1 in 2,000, or 0.04 percent.<br><br>Still, doctors say that as with any surgery there are risks<br><br>As for this case, Alexandra Hospital says it cannot comment until the coroner's report, which is expected to be out in three to four months.<br><br>Alexandra Hospital has performed some 300 gastric band surgeries since 2001, with some patients losing up to 70 kilogrammes from the procedure.<br><br>Patients who opt for this procedure have to go through a six-month preparation period which involves tests and counselling.<br><br>The Health Promotion Board says the number of obese Singaporeans has increased from 6 percent in 1998 to 6.9 percent in 2004.<br><br>Of these, 16 percent are at high risk of developing obesity-related diseases. - CNA /ct<br></div>
