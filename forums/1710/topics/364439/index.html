              <p><span style="color: #000080;">The brouhaha wasn’t all bad, they say, as the women of Aware pick up the 
              pieces and chart a new course.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/463/5-7-Feature1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Unless you’ve been on Mars the past couple of months, the mere mention of 
              Aware brings a flashback of angry faces, angrier accusations, and images of the 
              dramatic Suntec showdown where the “old guard” ousted the “new guard” and 
              reclaimed the leadership of Singapore’s most active women’s group. In the run up 
              to that fateful meeting, membership swelled and everyone from ministers to 
              Ministers weighed in—the very soul of the organization seemed to hang in the 
              balance.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Now that Aware has disappeared from the headlines and its original 
              intent seems secure, how is the Association of Women for Action and Research 
              moving on from this debilitating and divisive episode? Certainly, the 
              organization has more talent and momentum than ever before—and an unrivalled 
              platform to push its causes.  But it also has something of an image problem, 
              with many people who were previously unaware of Aware forming perceptions based 
              on the hardened tactics of battle. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">         Aware’s once more-again new president, 
              Dana Lam, and her newly elected Executive Committee are picking up the pieces 
              and working to get the organization on its feet as quickly as possible.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">         “The first task will be to get our house in order,” says Lam. “We need to review 
              our internal processes and strengthen our systems. The new Executive Committee 
              has only been in office for a month, and during that time, we’ve had to soothe 
              our center staff who have been frazzled by the events of the past few weeks and 
              also touch base with our sponsors, to reassure them that we’ve got our act 
              together.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Lam is already on her toes to ensure that the new volunteers 
              who’ve recently joined Aware are properly managed. “I’m quite anxious; the 
              younger folks have shorter attention spans and are always readily enthusiastic 
              to get things going quickly,” she says. “They can come to you once, twice and 
              three times offering their help, but it takes time to respond and fit them in; 
              if you don’t get back to them swiftly, you’ll lose them.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        The newly 
              expanded database of over 3,000 members is one success of the May 2 
              Extraordinary General Meeting (EOGM) that Lam is keen to count on and to work 
              with. “The EOGM was an immensely rewarding experience,” says Lam. “Many new 
              members may have already gotten used to the fix of instant results; but it’s 
              much slower when it comes to seeing the fruits of our labor on the issues we 
              work on. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “Some of that excitement will disappear; we will lose some 
              members as we move along, because reality gets in the way, and they will go back 
              to their old lives and jobs.”</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Finances and Fundraising</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>From an operational standpoint, 
              the provision of new programs and services in the coming months will be reliant 
              on what funds are left in the organization. After all, it was well-documented 
              that the “new guard” Exco spent $90,000 in the one month they were in office. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Aware’s new honorary treasurer, Tan Joo Hymn, is working flat out to 
              ensure that there will be no repeat of financial excesses from here on. “By year 
              end, we have to ensure that there is a comprehensive set of policies and 
              guidelines in place for good financial management; one that is clearly 
              communicated to all staff and volunteers,” says Tan. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Aware’s overnight 
              membership growth spurt doesn’t automatically equate to more finances available 
              for more programs. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “Contrary to the comments made by one supporter of the 
              ousted Exco, increased membership will not recoup the $90,000,” claims Tan. “But 
              rest assured, we won’t be trimming budgets; we’d instead like to raise more 
              money to continue with our programs.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Meanwhile, Lam says that she expects 
              operating costs to rise on account of the increase in new members.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “Aware 
              has to raise funds every month,” says Lam. “After doing our sums, we know that 
              we have to raise $20,000 to cover our operating costs.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Among its 
              fund-raising initiatives, Aware teamed up with Wessex Theatre’s production of </span><em><span style="color: #000080;">Top Girls</span></em><span style="color: #000080;"> at the DBS Arts Centre, boosting its coffers with charity 
              ticket sales. Another high-profile fund-raising drive is Flag Day in August. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “Not only must we ensure that there are sufficient checks and balances in 
              place for large expenditures, we are also hounding our fundraising sub-committee 
              to ensure there is enough money for the next year,” says treasurer Tan.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Not Entirely a Bad Thing</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>Although the Executive Committee 
              is currently in overdrive rebuilding the organization, Lam does not view the 
              infamous saga in an entirely negative light, stating that it has given the group 
              the opportunity to reaffirm its values and highlight the core reasons for its 
              existence. The group’s mission, core values and agenda were well communicated in 
              the “We Are Aware” campaign, which the present Executive Committee members 
              mounted during the lead-up to the EOGM. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “We now have this huge base of 
              volunteers to call upon,” says Lam. “A lot of the new members have already 
              started helping. One of our objectives is to make full use of new media, and 
              members and volunteers have come forward to help with that.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        These members, 
              who had signed up to defend a well-respected secular gender-equality advocacy 
              group, bring with them a whole set of skills, from legal expertise, to 
              administrative and organizational capabilities, to database systems know-how and 
              even first-aid skills.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “Once we get ourselves more effectively organized, 
              we would no longer have to engage people for IT and database services,” says 
              Lam. “Likewise for legal matters, as we have a good number of lawyers who have 
              come on board.”  <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        And these new volunteers will be channeled into the three 
              main areas Aware focuses on, namely the direct services which provide emotional 
              and psychological support through the Helpline, counseling and legal aid; the 
              betterment of physical and economic well-being of women, such as sexuality 
              education, self-defense, body image and self-esteem programs, and financial 
              intelligence workshops; and intellectual development, where research is 
              conducted in workshops and forums on areas such as work-life balance and sexual 
              harassment. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Lam says the group will continue to expand and develop the 
              above three areas, and will have a line-up of new initiatives in the coming 
              months. “We have not yet gone to the public with our new programs, as we have 
              only just started plotting the direction we want to go,” says Lam.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Braema 
              Mathi, an ex-president of Aware, a former Nominated Member of Parliament and 
              prominent civil society activist, agrees that some good has come out of this 
              saga. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “Without the blind self-righteousness of the old Executive 
              Committee, we would not have seen that beautiful day of May 2 when so many women 
              stood up to speak, ask and assert what they will not put up with—it was a 
              beautiful moment of women coming into their own,” Mathi says.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Soul Searching</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>But there is no escaping the fact that the 
              whole saga has made Aware sit up and re-look at the way it has run itself for 
              the last 24 years. It also has to deal with the dilution of its image in the 
              eyes of the public. While many people rose to defend the organization during the 
              difficult period, questions surrounding its motives and agendas continue to dog 
              Aware. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “We’ve been hurt by harmful misrepresentations of a perceived 
              ‘agenda’ by people who appear to have their own,” says Vice-President Chew 
              I-Jin. “These people find feminism and its advancements in sexual politics a 
              threat to the belief structures that they cling to.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Lam meanwhile 
              reaffirms that she has no regrets about taking a neutral view on homosexuality. 
              “I will never apologize for saying that I take a neutral view to homosexuality,” 
              she says. “I’m not for it or against it; for those who need a reminder, that’s 
              what neutral means.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        She, however, said that she baulked when she saw an 
              Aware-issued instructor guide for the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) 
              Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) program which said that anal sex could 
              be neutral or healthy if a condom is used.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “I was shocked to see such a 
              thing in the booklet,” says Lam. “I don’t condone such views. But one has to 
              realize the following: That line was in an instructor’s manual that was strictly 
              confidential. It was not in any student manual. The previous Executive Committee 
              took it out of context and posted it online in a deliberate smear campaign 
              against us.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        The statement created such a ruckus that the MOE went from 
              saying that there were no complaints about Aware’s CSE program from students, 
              teachers and parents, to kicking it out of the program altogether. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “That’s 
              an example of how we need to strengthen our systems,” says Lam. “From now on, 
              when we put out such guides, we need to conduct an internal review process that 
              asks committee members whether they have any objections to the proposed texts 
              within.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Lam adds that Aware will review its CSE package and offer it at a 
              later date to the MOE, which now has a more stringent policy on the outsourcing 
              of schools’ sex-education to external vendors. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        The checks-and-balances 
              approach will be mainstay of the organization as it proceeds from this juncture. 
              Lam has also hinted, but not yet confirmed, that there will be a change to 
              Aware’s constitution to ensure there’s no repeat of a “back door” takeover. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Among the proposed amendments are rules that could require  members to 
              volunteer with the group for a year before they can be elected to executive 
              office. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Also, as the group continues to soul search in the aftermath of 
              the saga, ex-president Mathi weighs in wistfully with the thought that all the 
              brouhaha could have been avoided if the “other party” had engaged the-then 
              Executive Committee consultatively. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “I am still affected that we went 
              through all this for just one purpose—to ‘expose’ us as allegedly having a gay 
              agenda and for sexuality education programs that seem to be problematic,” she 
              says. “If one were that upset by our work, it could have been so easily settled 
              by meeting the Aware Exco as a group of citizens who could raise their 
              concerns—face-to-face, in a petition, in the forum pages… It did not need a 
              takeover to ‘correct’ our ‘bad’ ways. It was the worst form of disrespect shown 
              to an organization that has done more good work than bad. That still rankles.” </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Misconceptions</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>But the misconceptions remain; there are 
              still large swathes of people who now view Aware in a dubious light, suspicious 
              of its motives and agendas.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “People now view us as having a homosexual 
              agenda,” says executive member Nicole Tan. “The saga has set the organization 
              back and we are being marginalized. But Singaporeans are pragmatic. At the end 
              of the day, if we doggedly continue to deliver on our myriad of programs, public 
              opinion will eventually be swayed.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Another executive member, Hafizah 
              Osman, counters the allegation that Aware is against Singaporean values. “Aware 
              promotes gender equality, non-discrimination and non-violence against women,” 
              she says. “How are these against Singapore’s societal values? Having said that, 
              as an advocacy group and agent for change, we understand that the nature of our 
              work can put us seemingly ‘out of step’ with the rest of society. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        “While 
              we remain sensitive to divergent views, the nature of our organization is that 
              we push the boundaries every so often.” <br>  <br></span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Onward with its 
              Aims</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>While the factions battled out their standing over the past few 
              weeks, Singaporean women continue to face issues where pat answers can’t be 
              easily found—ranging from concerns for elderly women, to spousal abuse, teenage 
              delinquencies, and sexual harassment in the work place. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        President Lam says 
              that the group has not deviated from its main agenda since day one. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">         “The 
              agenda has always been to develop a gender-based equality—to create 
              opportunities for women, to strengthen women so that they can participate fully 
              in society,” she says. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Vice-President Chew meanwhile notes the following 
              issues. “We need to help women to lead a balanced life without having to exploit 
              another sector of women [foreign maids],” she says. “Another issue women face is 
              how to go about avoiding the consumerist trap, which makes you feel like you 
              have to keep up with the material aspirations of other Singaporeans. Another 
              important issue is striving to have a positive body-image—everyone is so 
              obsessed with their weight and appearance.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Hafizah says that, perhaps the 
              most important thing is to publicize the programs Aware has to offer—for 
              example, the Helpline services. “It is important that women in distress, 
              regardless race or religion, have access to the services they need,” she says. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Mathi believes that Aware is equipped to deal with the challenges faced by 
              women in Singapore. “Aware remains, till today, the strongest advocate on 
              women’s issues,” she says. “That constancy has to be admired, as it is managed 
              on sheer volunteer will.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">        Over the next few weeks, Aware will firm up its 
              programs for the coming year, review its standard operating procedures and 
              continue with its work of making Singapore a gender-equal society. The saga has 
              unleashed a huge torrent of goodwill toward Aware, and the ultimate question is 
              whether the newly reinstated leaders can harness that momentum, navigate the 
              tricky waters of public perception, institute closer management of Aware’s 
              process and policy, and use the organization’s newfound fame to further women’s 
              causes like never before. If so, the women of Singapore may be the ultimate 
              winners from the episode, which is what everyone—old guard and new—said they 
              wanted in the first place.</span></p>

              conference, introducing Dr Thio Su Mien, who titles herself a “Feminist Mentor” 
              and reveals the conservative Christian stance that the new Exco brings to the

              best ways I can help is promoting awareness of the issues among my friends and 
              contacts, and by encouraging open-minded debate and discussion on them. Both men 
              and women must be involved if true gender equality is to be achieved, and 
              without a good understanding of the issues involved, no one can make any 
              informed decisions at all.<br></span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">As a new member, how do you intend to
