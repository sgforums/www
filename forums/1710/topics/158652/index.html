            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: From November 1, a person buying a pre-paid Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card in Singapore has to be 15 years of age and above.<br><br>SIM cards are tiny removable circuit boards fitted into cellular phones containing data including a directory of phone numbers used by the owner.<br><br>The number of pre-paid SIM cards will also be capped at 10 cards per person, regardless of which mobile service providers the cards are purchased from.<br><br>And the details of all customers and their purchases will be keyed into a new electronic system.<br><br>This will replace the manual recording method, which often yields inaccurate or incomplete data.<br><br>Existing users will be given a six-month grace period to re-register their purchases before their cards are de-activated.<br><br>The Home Affairs Ministry announced these details on Friday as Singapore strengthens its security control in its fight against terrorism.<br><br>Studies show terrorist groups have been using pre-paid SIM cards extensively because of the anonymity they offer.<br><br>Mr Wong Kan Seng, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, said: "In the region, we have seen Jemaah Islamiyah elements using pre-paid SIM cards extensively to avoid detection.<br><br>"In Songkhla (Thailand) this April, three simultaneous bombings happened in the evening. All three bombs were detonated using mobile phones, possibly utilising pre-paid SIM cards."<br><br>The prepaid phone card market has seen an exponential growth of some 120 times since the cards were introduced in 1999.<br><br>Currently, there are more than 1.4 million local pre-paid SIM cards in Singapore, comprising 35 percent of the mobile market in circulation.<br><br>To ensure that customer particulars are recorded accurately, all existing pre-paid SIM card users must re-register at retail outlets which sell the cards sold by their respective mobile service providers.<br><br>They can do so from November 1 till May 1 next year.<br><br>If they fail to do so, their pre-paid SIM cards will be de-activated from 2 May 2006.<br><br>Also, come November, mobile phone service providers could face heavier penalties if their dealers fail to register the customers' particulars.<br><br>They could be fined or even have their licence suspended or revoked.<br><br>Under the current system, the service providers only receive a warning letter.<br><br>While the new regulation will apply to mobile phone users in Singapore, it still will not be able to close all the gaps.<br><br>Dr Choong May Ling, Home Affairs Ministry's Deputy Secretary for Security, said: "There are overseas prepaid cards that can be used in Singapore. So the system that we are coming up with is not 100% foolproof. But what I want to stress is that it is a start, a necessary start and it will cover the majority of prepaid cards that are in use in Singapore. It would also make investigation simpler."<br><br>The Home Affairs Ministry says it hopes to work with other countries to clamp down on illegal activities involving prepaid phone cards.<br><br>Its neighbours, like Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines are also considering similar legislation.<br><br>The legislation has already been enforced in countries like Switzerland and Australia.<br><br>Service providers in Singapore say the new ruling will not severely affect the prepaid phone card market.<br><br>M1's director of sales and marketing, P Subramaniam, said: "The propositions for prepaid are pretty much the same, so the customers who want the benefit of prepaid cards will continue to use them."<br><br>Telcos expect the authorities to come up with checks to keep their dealers in line.<br><br>SingTel's vice president (consumer sales), Ooi Lay Yong, said: "There could be a class licence for the retailers, the sort that says they would have to comply with the registration process."<br><br>The Home Affairs Ministry says flyers will be distributed to foreign workers who are big users of such cards. - CNA/de/ir</div>
