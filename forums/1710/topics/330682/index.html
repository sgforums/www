              <p><strong>Contaminated milk powder brand Sanlu not imported into S'pore</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA)
              has confirmed that the country does not import the Sanlu brand of
              infant formula. That's the milk powder brand that has been hit by a
              contamination scandal in China and has affected some 1,253 children in
              the country so far.
              <br> <br> Dairy giant Fonterra, which owns 43 per cent of Sanlu, said no milk from China is used in its products sold elsewhere.
              <br> <br> Its brands sold in Singapore include Anlene, Anmum, Fernleaf, Chesdale, Kapiti and Mainland.
              <br> <br> It added that all its milk powder and yogurt products sold here are made in Malaysia from New Zealand whole milk powder.
              <br> <br>David Ross, general manager, Fonterra (Singapore), said: "All
              Fonterra products available on the shelves have been subjected to the
              most rigorous quality controls in every aspect of production from our
              high-quality farmers milk right through the manufacturing and
              distribution process.‚Äù
              <br> <br> The AVA said it only approves infant formula which have a health certificate and laboratory test report.
              <br> <br> It advises consumers who had purchased the Sanlu product outside of Singapore to stop using it immediately.
              <br> <br> Sanlu milk powder was found to contain an agent called Melamine, which causes kidney stones to form.
              <br> <br>The Xinhua news agency said two brothers in northern China's Hebei
              province -- who are among the 19 detained -- had been formally arrested
              for allegedly selling three tonnes of contaminated milk per day from
              their station. <br> <br> The duo allegedly decided to add melamine after Sanlu repeatedly rejected their milk for failing to meet standards.
              <br> <br> Melamine, which is used for making plastics and glues, may have been
              added to make the milk appear it contained more protein than was
              actually the case, Chinese media have suggested.
              <br> <br>Chinese media reported that two babies, both in northwest China's
              Gansu province, had now been confirmed dead after drinking the
              contaminated milk powder. -CNA/vm </span></p>
