            <div class='col-md body'>KUALA LUMPUR : Malaysia has paid tribute to former Singapore President, the late Dr Wee Kim Wee, for his efforts in enhancing bilateral ties.<br><br>The late Dr Wee was High Commissioner to Malaysia from 1973 to 1980.<br><br>Acting Foreign Minister Kadir Sheikh Fadzir represented the Malaysian government when he signed the book of condolences at Singapore's High Commissioner's office in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>Mr Kadir, who is also Malaysia's Information Minister, said Dr Wee was most remembered for his efforts in boosting bilateral relations between the two countries.<br><br>"One particular thing we observe - he really valued Malaysia and Singapore relationship, and he worked very hard not only to preserve our warm relations but also to enhance it whenever possible. And we will surely remember him, and we will miss him very much," he said.<br><br>Since Dr Wee's death on Monday, local media have been carrying reports and pictures in fond memories of the late Singapore President.<br><br>His achievements as a young journalist, engaged by United Press International to head its regional office, also won him great admiration.<br><br>Mr Abdullah Ahmad, Former Chief Editor of the New Straits Times, said: "There were not many Malaysians or Singaporeans in those days where new agencies or foreign newspapers would hire. I was so proud to see a fellow Asian and a fellow Southeast Asian to do that in UPI."<br><br>An old friend, Mr Abdullah had known Dr Wee while he was a High Commissioner to Malaysia in the 1970s.<br><br>Mr Abdullah added: "President Wee was a good man, a great man, a good friend to Malaysia. He understood what Malaysia was all about...one thing that has always struck me - he was a decent, friendly human being."<br><br>Dr Wee's kindness and humility will be fondly remembered and deeply missed by many Malaysians.<br><br>At his funeral on Friday, Malaysia's Housing and Local Government Minister Ong Ka Ting will be the country's representative.<br><br>And some of Dr Wee's old friends have also travelled across the Causeway to be present for the funeral at the Mandai Crematorium. - CNA/de</div>
