            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DPP locks horns with defence psychiatrist</strong><br>Doctor says Took's story that 3 men killed the girl is sign of schizophrenia<br><br>By Chong Chee Kin<br>July 27, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br><br>SPARKS flew during the trial of murder accused Took Leng How yesterday as Deputy Public Prosecutor Lawrence Ang crossed swords with the sole defence witness, Dr R. Nagulendran.<br><br>Dr Nagulendran, who is testifying for Took, spent about four hours on the stand defending his diagnosis of the 23-year-old vegetable packer as a schizophrenic.<br><br>Took's hopes of avoiding a murder conviction rest on the credibility of the psychiatrist testifying in his defence, and DPP Ang pounded the doctor with questions, probing for holes in his theory.<br><br>Tempers began to fray and the two raised their voices several times, often cutting each other off in mid-sentence.<br><br>Dr Nagulendran also complained on numerous occasions that DPP Ang's questioning was 'unfair' and, at one point, even scolded his interrogator.<br><br>'For god's sake, please try to understand what psychiatry is about before asking these questions,' he protested.<br><br>At that point, Justice Lai Kew Chai intervened and tried to explain to the psychiatrist why his diagnosis might provoke 'controversy'.<br><br>Dr Nagulendran's conclusion, drawn from three meetings after Took's arrest, centres on the accused's stated belief that three Chinese men were responsible for killing the eight-year-old girl.<br><br>Calling this his 'primary delusion', the psychiatrist explained that despite being told there was no evidence to suggest that three men committed the crime, Took refused to accept any other version of events.<br><br>DPP Ang argued that the story was just another attempt by Took to evade responsibility and retract his previous confessions to the police.<br><br>Dr Nagulendran admitted that Took had told many lies, but insisted that these tales were spun to support his basic delusion.<br><br>DPP Ang then showed Dr Nagulendran a series of charts detailing the number of times Took had both knowingly lied to the police and changed his statement.<br><br>Since Took was prone to lying to the police, he argued, could he not be lying to his psychiatrist, too?<br><br>But Dr Nagulendran insisted that, given the close relationship Took had with Huang Na, he would have expected him to display 'anger or sorrow', whereas he showed very little emotion.<br><br>Could he then be 'hiding his guilt by appearing nonchalant', the judge asked.<br><br>The psychiatrist maintained this was possible only if Took consciously killed the girl and wanted to convince everyone that he did not do so by putting on an act.<br><br>His diagnosis, he said, was based mainly on two central factors: the 'bizarre, motiveless, senseless and brutal' murder, and Took's own muted reactions after it.<br><br>Describing Took's mood as 'inappropriate', he said the accused felt nothing when asked how he felt about her death and was constantly smiling when he described the episode.<br><br>Though Dr Nagulendran said he pointed out to Took that he had already confessed to the crime, he continued to stick to the story of the three Chinese men.<br><br>'When that happens, we ask ourselves, is that a sign of a psychiatric condition?' he said.<br><br>The trial continues today with psychiatrist G. Sathyadevan taking the stand for the prosecution.<br><br></div>

Sathyadevan from the Institute of Mental Health told the court that Took did not qualify for the defence of diminished responsibility.<br><br>He said Took appeared mostly calm during their interviews and was coherent and rational in his speech.<br><br>He also noted that the accused showed no sign of any grief about the loss of Huang Na and he was neither depressed nor suicidal.<br><br>Took's psychiatrist Dr R. Nagulendran had said previously that Took suffered from symptoms of schizophrenia - something Dr Sathyadevan disagreed with, saying Took had no delusions or hallucinations.<br><br>The defence will cross-examine the prosecution's psychiatrist on Thursday when the trial continues. - CNA/de<br><br></div>

Even if she fears looking at him, it is because she has labelled him as a brutal murderer who has killed her daughter.<br><br>Which newspaper did you read?  I go downstair and buy.
