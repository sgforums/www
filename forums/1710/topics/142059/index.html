            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : It was a child's game of hide-and-seek that had gone horribly wrong. That's what the accused, Took Leng How, told police after his arrest.<br><br>This came to light when the prosecution read out, in court, a police statement in which the accused recounted how he ended up strangling eight-year-old Huang Na.<br><br>When questioned on October 31, Took told police in a statement that he and Huang Na were playing a game of hide-and-seek at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre on October 10 last year.<br><br>Huang Na was left in a dark room and Took said in the darkness, she accidentally injured herself by knocking her head against some boxes.<br><br>After turning on the lights, he found the girl bleeding from the mouth. That is when he panicked and started strangling her.<br><br>Took also undressed her and began "poking" her to give the impression that she was raped.<br><br>He then proceeded to pack her body into a box.<br><br>After borrowing a motorcycle, Took the body to the Telok Blangah Hill Park.<br><br>On October 21, Took was being escorted by officers to the CID for a lie-detector test.<br><br>But realising he did not clean up the crime scene, there could be enough evidence left behind for Police to find.<br><br>So Took had decided to flee to Malaysia.<br><br>And because he was not under arrest at the time, he managed to give officers the slip.<br><br>He also recounted how he was able to slip through the Woodlands Checkpoint undetected.<br><br>He by-passed immigration by using the departure bus lane heading into Malaysia. - CNA/de</div>

Not for the first time, the court heard how, of all the workers at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre where her mother worked, Took was closest to Huang Na.<br><br>He was the one she turned to when she wanted someone to play with or talk to.<br><br>He was the one who often offered her mangoes when she loitered outside the shop where he worked.<br><br>But yesterday, the court was told that Took's colleagues had seen him scolding the girl on several occasions before, and that he had even hurt her at least once.<br><br>Took's employer, Mr Kelvin Eng Chow Meng, recalled seeing bruises on the girl's hand back in July 2003. Huang Na's grandmother, who was also working for him at the time, told him that Took was responsible.<br><br>Mr Eng said he confronted Took about the incident.<br><br>'The accused claimed that Huang Na was making too much noise and he was unable to sleep,' he told the court. He later said under cross-examination that he did not see Took hitting the girl.<br><br>Anyway, he said, the two mostly enjoyed a 'cordial relationship'.<br><br>Mr Eng said Huang Na would follow her mother, Madam Huang Shuying, to the shop when she worked the late shift. The girl often slept on Took's mattress bed under the staircase landing in the two-storey shop, but Took never objected, Mr Eng said.<br><br>Another prosecution witness, packer Tan Ban Tiong, recalled 'one or two' occasions when Took tied the girl's hands with raffia string to 'teach her a lesson not to disturb us'.<br><br>But according to Mr Tan, Huang Na enjoyed the game.<br><br>'She was giggling away and did not show that she was angry. She was enjoying herself while playing with us,' he said.<br><br>Earlier yesterday, Took was allowed to meet his family, including his wife, Madam Yuli, 23, and two-year-old son, Soon Wang. It was the first time they had seen one another since Took was arrested last year. The courtroom was vacated for them to talk to one another before he was led off to the lock-up.<br><br>The trial continues today, when one of the most eagerly awaited witnesses, Huang Na's mother, takes the stand.<br><br>Her presence in court yesterday caused a stir when she arrived slightly before 2pm.<br><br>Madam Huang was accompanied by two policewomen everywhere she went - even to the toilet. She was also followed by curious spectators waiting outside the court just to catch a glimpse of her.<br><br>She is expected to give testimony about her relationship with Took.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mum's painful sobs as horror unfolds</strong><br>By Low Ching Ling And Dawn Chia<br><br>July 21, 2005<br><br>IT must have already been hard enough for her to be in the same room as her daughter's alleged killer.<br><br>But to have to view graphic reminders of the tragic death must have been especially painful for Madam Huang Shu Ying.<br><br>Twice yesterday, the 32-year-old was subjected to such torment. Both times she wept, at one point breaking into quiet sobs.<br><br>The first time, she was shown a photograph of her daughter's decomposed body.<br><br>The second time, she watched a video re-enactment of the alleged murder.<br><br>Malaysian Took Leng How, 23, is on trial for allegedly murdering Huang Na, 8, last October.<br><br>Madam Huang, from China's Fujian province, finally took the stand as a prosecution witness on the seventh day of the trial yesterday morning.<br><br>She had entered the crowded courtroom with her usual stoic expression. The court kaypohs, who had been eagerly anticipating her arrival, gawked and pointed.<br><br>When asked by Senior State Counsel Lawrence Ang from the prosecution team to identify Took, she took a quick glance at him in the dock and nodded. Took appeared nonchalant.<br><br>It didn't take long for Madam Huang to be reminded of her grief.<br><br>Mr Ang asked her to identify Huang Na by showing her a photograph of the girl's decomposed body.<br><br>She cracked up, and Mr Ang had to halt his questioning for a few minutes to let her regain her composure.<br><br>It was a heartrending sight as her sobs, slightly amplified by the microphone, were the only audible sound in the quiet courtroom.<br><br>HE SIMPLY BIT HIS NAILS<br><br>Meanwhile, Took, who sat just 2m away, did not show any emotion. He simply bit his nails.<br><br>During her one-hour testimony, Madam Huang kept her head bowed most of the time.<br><br>Her head sank lower as Took's lawyer, Mr Subhas Anandan, grilled her on the stand.<br><br>After she stepped down, she looked annoyed.<br><br>In the afternoon, Madam Huang sat in the public gallery to listen to the proceedings.<br><br>Again, she kept her head down most of the time, looking up occasionally to see the photographs flashed on screen.<br><br>But several times, she stared long and hard at Took, mumbled under her breath and looked down again.<br><br>Then came the video footage.<br><br>It had Took demonstrating, on a mannequin, to the police how he had used the plastic bags to tie Huang Na up after he allegedly killed her.<br><br>Then he showed how he karate-chopped the back of her neck, strangled her, stomped on her neck, stripped her and finally molested her.<br><br>It was too much for Madam Huang to bear.<br><br>Once again, she choked up. Clutching pieces of tissue paper as she dabbed her eyes, her sniffles could be heard in the quiet public gallery.<br><br>In contrast, Took smiled to himself as he watched the footage. But his Indonesian-Chinese wife, Madam Yuli, 24, wept.<br><br>Minutes later, Madam Huang had to be escorted out of the courtroom by a female CID officer. She did not return.<br><br>When the day's session ended at 4.30pm, she emerged from the witness room, looking glum and with her head bowed as she walked out of the court.<br><br>She did not speak to the press.<br><br>Most of the 60-strong crowd had turned up in court to see her.<br><br>After she gave her testimony and returned to the witness room, a quarter of the courtroom was empty.<br><br>Mr Toh, a 56-year-old retiree, said in Mandarin: 'I'm going home now. There's nothing to watch anymore.'<br><br></div>
