            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Thursday was the start of a long public holiday weekend but for some Singaporeans it might have started the day before as they crossed over the Causeway to spend their holidays.<br><br>It had been brisk business for bus operators going into Johor since 6 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>Hundreds of people were seen eagerly boarding the buses, some with heavy luggage, and many with friends or families in tow.<br><br>"We are going to Johor Bahru, and then Kuala Lumpur and Penang. After that, we are flying back. My friends want to do some shopping," said a woman commuter.<br><br>"This is a long weekend. I take leave on Friday and we go for some retreat from work," said another.<br><br>"I'm going home because it's a long holiday. I'm also meeting my friends in my home town," said a third.<br><br>There were also those who were heading into Malaysia for last-minute Hari Raya shopping.<br><br>"We want to buy for Hari Raya celebrations, buy kampung biscuits and cakes. The price is better than in Singapore, better than Geylang," said one.<br><br>With so many people heading to Malaysia, one would expect slow traffic at the Causeway, but it seemed that that was not the case, at least up till 1pm.<br><br>There was no traffic jam at the stretch nearing the Causeway nor at the roads after the Singapore customs.<br><br>Although traffic at the car lanes coming into Singapore seemed heavier, the bus lanes were fine.<br><br>"No jam today," said a woman.<br><br>"Everything is fine and good, going is very smooth, coming back to Singapore, also very smooth," said a man.<br><br>The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority had earlier advised commuters to plan their travel carefully to avoid possible congestion starting from the eve of Deepavali.<br><br>From the look of things, many might have heeded the advice. - CNA<br><br>The scene was filmed @ Kranji MRT Stn... Filmed SBS Sv 170X<br><br>FYI, SBS deployed all its 60 Sv 160/170 buses out for period bet Fri and Mon</div>
