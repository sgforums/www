            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : A record number of aircraft will be seen at Singapore's birthday celebrations on National Day.<br><br>They will not only fly over the Padang but all across the island including the heartlands and the Carnival at Marina.<br><br>The flypast has always been a crowd favourite.<br><br>However, this time round, the A4 Skyhawks will be replaced by RSAF's latest fleet of aircraft - the twin-seater F16 fighter jet.<br><br>It is able to fly at twice the speed of sound.<br><br>It is used mainly to protect Singapore skies but five of these planes will be making their debut at this year's Parade.<br><br>Led by Lieutenant Colonel Leong Choong Yew, the bomb burst they are performing lasts only 25 seconds, but it has taken the pilots three months of hard work.<br><br>Lt Col Leong Choong Yew, Commanding Officer, 145 Squadron, said: "We have 3 levels of training. The first one is squadron internal training whereby we perfect our timing and coordination. Second level of training is the internal rehearsal within the RSAF whereby other units of the RSAF will come together and train. The third level is the combined rehearsal whereby the RSAF as well as the other supporting ground unit will be training together to perfect the timing and the coordination."<br><br>The youngest of the team, 27-year-old Captain Oon Kok Choon, has taken part in the parade before.<br><br>But it will be his first time manoeuvring the F16 for the bomb burst aerial display.<br><br>Captain Oon, Pilot, 145 Squadron, said: "In terms of mission planning there is certainly a lot more things to do. Last year it was a simple level straight through. This year we have 2 more aircraft than last year that makes it 5."<br><br>And some first-timers are also joining the veterans in the Parade.<br><br>"Every practice makes a difference to me because my sister is performing together with me so we look out for each other and take care of each other and when she's doing well, it motivates me to do well too," said Nursyamira Mazlan, who will be at the NDP for the first time.<br><br>"Most of the time I take part at the Stadium and this time I feel very proud to come back to the Padang," said Jalaludin Peer Mohamed, a veteran.<br><br>And on the ground, the parade commander has been taking herbal soups and honey to keep his voice in tip-top condition for the big day.<br><br>Lt Col Choon Soon Onn, Parade Commander, NDP 2005, said: "At any opportunity when nobody is around like in my car or sometimes in my house, where I can shut all the windows, I actually practice shouting out the orders just to get used to the pronunciation and to make sure I get my diction correct."<br><br>More than 2,200 participants who are taking part in the Parade's ceremonial showpiece will enter the Padang from different directions.<br><br>The aim is to make the show more fluid and dynamic. - CNA /ch<br><br>The F-5, F-16, CH-47, KC-135 will take part</div>
