I believe its the failure of the UNSWAsia to market their campus here well in Singapore.<br><br>Take for a very little example here i have with me.<br><br>My Brother completed his NCC Advance International Diploma in Business with straight As. NCC has been recognised as a Computing organisation in the public but for those who understand much in the education sector (Inc. of UNSWAsia), NCC Business has been widely recognised to represents the quality standard of up to Year one for its Diploma of a whole list of universities and Year two for its advance diploma.<br><br>My Brother here wanted to ask about the UNSWAsia during the career fair this year but this is how they market their university:<br><br>Person at Counter (PAC): *Ignore*<br><br>I could be one of the factor that UNSWAisa closed down.. But I guess there are other factors behind it..<br>My Brother and I (B&amp;I): Hi, would you mind advising us on the business course?<br>(PAC): Huh? Do you want to ask about the one in sydney or Singapore?<br>(B&amp;I): We want to ask about the one in Singapore.<br>(PAC): *Ignore*<br>(B&amp;I): We want to ask about the one in Singapore. (Repeat)<br>(PAC): The business course we offered here in Singapore is here in the brochure in front of you.<br>(B&amp;I): Oh, which is it? (There's quite a number of them on the desk)<br>(PAC): There! (Then with a disgusted face, he draw out a piece and throw it on the counter)<br>(B&amp;I): Thanks (While thanking we look at each other thinking what kind of attitude it was with no other ppl ard.<br><br>(B&amp;I): Can you tell us more about the course? (Interested in knowing more)<br>(PAC): What is your education level now? (Without answering our question)<br>(B&amp;I): I have completed my NCC Internatonal Advance Diploma in Business. Can i know more about the course?<br>(PAC): Huh? What NCC? National Computing what that one ah? (Get a looking down laughing and then say this)<br>(B&amp;I): Yah<br>(PAC): You better look for other university here at the fair<br><br>We were standing there waiting for any explanation but what we get is a total ignorance without even a look in the eye. (P.S: There were no one at the counter when we were there)<br>We didn't bother to ask anything else here since the man didn't bother to answer any of our question.<br><br>Now, the main concern here is not really whether they recognise the Diploma or not (Which is impossible), but the problem here is how they actually deal with people. With that kind of attitude as their marketers (Whether they are professionals or not), i don't think its going to be a attractive school in Singapore. Can you guys imagine the situation there? A Straight As student standing in front of them where so many university is offering a place for him?<br><br>Well, i believe if we get that kind of attitude, many of them out there is going to get something similar or even worse. UNSWAsia has a failure in Cost AND Marketing i guess.</div></blockquote></div>
