              <p><strong>First picture of the baby girl born using frozen sperm from father killed by cancer FOUR years ago</strong></p>
              <p>Her father couldn't be there when she was born. And he won't be able to watch her grow up.   <br> <br> But Jaimie-Rose Roberts, born four years after his death, will still be a Daddy's girl.  <br> James Roberts, who died from cancer at 33, had always dreamed of adding to his family.  <br> <br> As he battled his illness, he and his wife Lisa, who already had a son
              together, decided to have his sperm frozen to ensure they could have
              more children after his treatment. <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/LisaBabyHUWE_468x660.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Joy: Lisa Roberts proudly hugs Jaimie-Rose, conceived through her dead husband's frozen sperm</em><br> <br> Last week, Mrs Roberts fulfilled their dream on her own after a course
              of IVF treatment that doctors had warned had only a 20 per cent chance
              of working. <br> <br> "She's amazing," she said as she held her week-old daughter in her arms.  <br> <br> "I hope James is looking down on us with a smile on his face.  <br> <br> "I wish he was here to see her because I know he would be so happy.  <br> <br> "She's just beautiful.  <br> <br> "I can't believe that something so lovely can come from something so tragic."  <br> <br> The couple's son, Cameron, is now seven.  <br> <br> He is delighted to be a big brother and suggested his little sister's name as a tribute to their father.  <br> <br> Lisa and James Roberts had been married for six years when he was diagnosed with a cancerous leg tumour.  <br> <br> They were warned that treatment would leave him infertile so he had his
              sperm frozen for future use and signed over ownership to his wife. <br> <br> "He was really pleased about the medical technology to store his sperm
              for us to have more babies in the future," Mrs Roberts said. <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/JamesLisaHUWE_468x674.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Together: Lisa and husband James Roberts</em><br> <br> "James always wanted a family - he always wanted children, he loved children.  <br> <br> "We had been trying for three years before Cameron. He was so excited when he was born.  <br> <br> "He was a great dad and a great husband."  <br> <br> Sadly, Mr Roberts's tumour spread despite the chemotherapy treatment
              and he died in hospital with his wife by his side in October 2004. <br> <br> Mrs Roberts concentrated on bringing up their son at the family home in
              Chepstow, Gwent, and waited more than two years until she felt strong
              enough to go through with the IVF treatment. <br> <br> "I suddenly felt it was the right time," she explained.  <br> <br> "I used our savings of more than Â£4,000 to cover the cost because I
              couldn't think of anything in the world better to spend it on - I know
              James would have approved." <br> <br> Doctors told her that only one of the ten resulting embryos was viable, dramatically cutting her chance of becoming pregnant.  <br> <br> "They told me not to hold out much hope, saying there was just a 20 per cent of me getting pregnant.  <br> <br> 'But it was amazing. It worked straight away - something inside me knew it always would. I had a feeling it would be fine.  <br> <br> "I took lots of pregnancy tests which were all positive before I could
              believe I was having James's child. Cameron came to the scans with me -
              taking the role James had when I was expecting him. We read all the
              baby books together." <br> <br> Jaimie-Rose was born a week ago by caesarean section weighing in a
              healthy 6lb15oz and is back at home with her mother and brother. <br> <br> "It was Cameron who suggested calling her Jaimie after their daddy. He was adamant about it,' Mrs Roberts said.  <br> <br> "He's been fantastic and so supportive. He is so proud of his little sister - knowing that she is also from his daddy."  <br> <br> Mrs Roberts is not the first widow to become pregnant using her late
              husband's frozen sperm. Because her husband gave his permission,
              however, she avoided the legal anguish of the Diane Blood case. <br> <br> Mrs Blood's husband Stephen was unable to give his consent for the
              procedure before he died of meningitis in 1995. She eventually won a
              lengthy legal battle and has since had two sons. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <em>Source: Daily Mail UK, Mar. 19, 2008</em></p>
