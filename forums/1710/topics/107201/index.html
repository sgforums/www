            <div class='col-md body'>The thought had probably crossed their minds, but the only artiste not afraid to say it out loud, on national TV, was Sharon Au.<br><br>"My ex-colleagues are coming back next year, so I'm afraid I won't have a chance to get a trophy. Let me have it please," she said, to laughter from the audience, at Sunday night's Star Awards when asked why she yearned to get the Best Variety Show Host award.<br><br>But the title went to Mark Lee, for his witty show in Be My Guest.<br><br>Sharon did, however, secure a spot in the Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes category.<br><br>Backstage, Mark's handphone rang incessantly as he fielded questions from reporters.<br><br>On the line were his wife and other well-wishers.<br><br>"IÂ’m thrilled to win the award, of course. I've waited so many years," he said.<br><br>And his win couldn't have come at a better time; "There will be more people fighting for the same pie next year."<br><br>Indeed, with the expected return of 20 or so SPH MediaWorks artistes invited back into the fold after the media merger, things are about to change on Caldecott Hill.<br><br>The returnees include Sharon's former City Beat co-hosts, the immensely popular Kym Ng and Bryan Wong.<br><br>There's also the suave and steady Guo Liang, whom Mark is already placing his bets on to win next yearÂ’s Best Variety Show Host title.<br><br>"He's proven to be a credible, live show host with his wit and formidable command of Mandarin," said Mark, who also won a Top 10 Most Popular Male Artiste award.<br><br>Meanwhile, seated in the MediaCorp bigwigs' row, next to MediaCorp TV CEO Chua Foo Yong, was MediaWorks COO Man Shu Sum, who will be returning to Caldecott Hill as an executive adviser next month.<br><br>At one point, Caldecott princess Fann Wong went over to Mr Man, and the two hugged each other warmly.<br><br>What did they talk about?<br><br>Fann would only tell TODAY that she was delighted to see Mr Man in the audience after a four-year absence.<br><br>"IÂ’m glad to have him back," she said. "I know I can count on him for advice in the future."<br><br>Sharon also acknowledged Mr Man when she accepted her Top 10 Most Popular Female Artiste award.<br><br>"IÂ’m so happy to see you here, Mr Man," she said.<br><br>"Ten years ago when you signed me up, I was just a girl. Mr Man, don't you think IÂ’ve grown up now?"<br><br>An exuberant Chew Chor Meng, who was honoured with an All Time Favourite Award, along with Zoe Tay and Li Nanxing, quipped that he's looking forward to a reunion with his two screen wives from the sitcom Don't Worry Be Happy.<br><br>Actress Lynn Poh, who took over from Quan Yifeng as his other half, later crossed over to SPH MediaWorks as well. - TODAY</div>
