            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore looks set to start testing a new biometric passport next month.<br><br>The high-tech travel document will contain unique personal data, possibly facial features, fingerprints or even an eye scan.<br><br>But the good news is you don't have to change your passport.<br><br>What is likely to happen is a chip stored with your biometric data will be inserted into your current passport.<br><br>Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US has been pushing the use of biometric technology at its borders to keep out would-be terrorists.<br><br>By October next year, all Singaporeans entering America will need biometric passports.<br><br>But the Republic is not waiting till then to roll out its own high-tech travel document.<br><br>Biometric data, including facial features, fingerprint and perhaps even a scan of your iris, will be stored on a small chip to be embedded in a smart card, which will then be inserted into your current passport.<br><br>This smart card may even double up as an identity card in the future.<br><br>The best part is there is no need to change your entire passport to clear immigration at the US checkpoints.<br><br>Industry experts Channel NewsAsia spoke to say this is the best alternative; it is much cheaper than issuing new passports to all Singaporeans.<br><br>All you need is a simple add-on to turn your passport into a biometric travel document.<br><br>Both security and biometrics experts say Singapore's use of a smart card to upgrade its passports may be a world first.<br><br>Kelly Richdale, managing director at A4Vision, explained, "To have a self-standing card as opposed to a passport can be flexible. It can also play an additional role such as an employee card and give access to health benefits.<br><br>"The disadvantages are that the passports are seen as a document issued by one authority with specific uses, so there is the fear it could be too flexible and detract from the security of it."<br><br>IDLink Systems managing director Christopher Bian said, "Facial (imaging) is definitely a good option with inter-operability. Already, passports are using photos to compare; it's non-intrusive and there's no issues with privacy."<br><br>The Government may release more details about Singapore's new biometric passports next month.<br><br>The International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO, has only made the facial biometric image of the holder mandatory, together with a contactless chip that can be read across different borders but other countries are free to add on other biometric features.<br><br>Individual countries could also have the option of upgrading from two-dimensional to three-dimensional facial recognition technology over time.<br><br>This means the system will remain robust and possibly lead to automated border control in the future. - CNA<br><br></div>
