            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Remake the 1968 spirit to have a more rugged society: MM Lee </strong><br><br>Remake the 1968 spirit to build a more rugged society in Singapore.<br><br>That's the call by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>"We must think of a way to keep the next generation rugged and tough inside," he said.<br><br>The call is to be as rugged as the generation which, during the 1968 National Day Parade, had braved a heavy downpour to show their resolve and determination to soldier on.<br><br>And this, just months after the British announced they would be withdrawing their forces from the region.<br><br>As a result, a certain bond was formed that helped the country overcome the traumatic times.<br><br>But what of today's youth?<br><br>Jeremy Ee, president of NUS Students' Union, said: "If we were to be facing a tough time or problem, we may have the initial difficulties trying to catch up. But given a short time, we will pick ourselves up and go through anything that's a crisis or disaster."<br><br>Patrick Tay, executive secretary of Young PAP, said: "Young Singaporeans have to battle it out not just within but regionally. That has tuned us in terms of our mental resilience and the ability to handle and overcome any odds."<br><br>Siraj Omar, a lawyer, said: "If we are looking at physical and mental strength, agility and ruggedness, I think, we are weaker than what we used to be. I think it is important we recognise that while there are a lot of creature comforts which we can avail of in society nowadays, we cannot be complacent and lazy, and not have the required toughness and will to survive. That's really the challenge."<br><br>MM Lee said Singapore is not alone in facing this problem.<br><br>He suggested boarding schools as a way to foster a sense of ruggedness among the young.<br><br>MM Lee said: "The parents also are too soft-hearted, they don't want to send their children to boarding schools. But if we can, I think, we should.<br><br>"There must be a certain discipline. If you watch how the British built up their successive cohorts of empire builders, that was one of the key functions of the boarding school education."<br><br>There are heartening signs of this ruggedness emerging.<br><br>For instance, the SARS crisis in 2003 where Singaporeans pulled together as one, and the post-tsunami relief efforts in Indonesia's Meulaboh and Aceh which saw volunteers helping those in need.<br><br>MM Lee said: "I think the physical ruggedness is less than before. But I am not sure that the inner ruggedness is less. I think the best is yet to be. We have not wasted the last 40 years and there is no reason why we cannot make this breakthrough."<br><br>Overall, young Singaporeans are upbeat and optimistic about the future.<br><br>They say they're confident the younger generation will rise to the challenge in the event of any crisis, to remake the 1968 spirit in modern-day Singapore.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia will telecast a special half-hour documentary on "1968...An Unending Resolve" at 8.30pm on Sunday, August 28. - CNA/ir<br><br>Tonight the show</div>
