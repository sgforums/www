            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Parliament has been told that soliciting for sex with minors is a crime which will be treated seriously by the police.<br><br>And whether it is on the Internet or via organising overseas sex tours, those involved will be severely dealt with.<br><br>Even if the offence is done overseas - if preparations are done here - it is regarded as abetting a crime.<br><br>Between 1994 and April this year, there were three cases of Singaporeans arrested overseas for sexual offences with children aged below 16.<br><br>While it has been reported that Singaporeans form a large number of sex tourists in the region, the police have not come across any cases of sex tours being organised here.<br><br>Ms Eunice Olsen, Nominated MP, said Singapore was well-placed to do something about the problem.<br><br>She asked if enacting a law would help show that Singapore will not condon such act and that it did not want its citizens to go overseas to do things like this.<br><br>Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, said: "There are countries overseas that have implemented laws with extra-territorial application.<br><br>"While we can have these laws in place, it is very difficult to implement them. Principally there will be legal and very serious practical problems of gathering evidence and putting up a strong case in court...we do no want to have laws that are difficult to enforce."<br><br>But Singapore is studying the situation and if needed later on, the laws will be amended.<br><br>Professor Ho made clear that Singapore laws treat the crime of having sex with minors very seriously.<br><br>And that's the case with Internet-related sex offences. Eight cases involving those below 16 were reported last last year.<br><br>But these were cases where the offenders had sex with the children.<br><br>Dr Amy Khor, Mayor of South West District, said: "Were there any case that were prosecuted because of solicitation on the Internet, the deed is not performed but there was clear evidence of solicitation?<br><br>"I would also like to ask the Minister if the industry is required to undertake surveillance of the website to block or shut down the websites where there is solicitation of sex for minors."<br><br>Dr Lee Boon Yang, Minister for Information, Communications and The Arts, said: "I am not aware of any prosecution of procurement online.<br><br>"Conceivably, one could mount a sting operation to ensure that those who use such forum whether it's chatline or chat rooms to ensure that those who do so, may well face the full force of the law."<br><br>But the point which was made clear - protecting children against sex predators whether in Singapore or overseas should not just be the goverment's responsility.<br><br>Parents, schools and the community have a role to play to condemn such activities and instill the right values in the young. - CNA/de</div>
