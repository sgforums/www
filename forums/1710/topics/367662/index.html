              <p><span>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak marks his
              first hundred days in office on Saturday, with a significant
              improvement in approval ratings.
              <br> <br>An independent poll by Merdeka Center showed his popularity has
              shot up to 65 per cent in July, up from 42 per cent just before he was
              sworn in about three months ago.
              <br> <br>When the 55-year-old came into power in April, there was certainly
              no honeymoon period traditionally accorded to a new prime minister.
              <br> <br>Not only was the economy sinking, allegations of corruption and
              attempts to link him with the murder of a Mongolian model badly tainted
              his image.
              <br> <br> "Please judge me by my actions, my actions will come in due course," he had said then.
              <br> <br> After just 100 days in office, his political fortune is reversing.
              <br> <br>He got a big thumbs-up for releasing several high profile Hindu
              rights activists, as well as approving measures to liberalise the
              services and financial sectors, and chipping away at affirmative action
              for ethnic Malays.
              <br> <br>Abdullah Ahmad, former editor-in-chief of the New Straits Times
              Press, said: "Overall, he's said all the right things. If he can
              deliver what he said, he will be in a good stead, but will he be able
              to do it? <br> <br> "He has to contend with those groups who are unhappy with what he's
              doing and PAS (Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party) is one of them. Malays
              should be confused, we used to get 30 per cent and PAS will exploit
              it."
              <br> <br> However, his political rivals claim it is all a political gimmick.
              <br> <br>Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition parliamentary chief, said: "It's for
              his own survival and for the survival of this country's economy. It's
              not whether he wants it or not. Look at the latest figures relating to
              the recessionary trend and foreign investments, which is disastrous."
              <br> <br> His critics say the state of the country's judiciary, its police force, and high crime rate leaves much to be desired. 
              <br> <br>Still, many Malaysians are putting their trust in Mr Najib to
              realise his goal of "1Malaysia" â€“ a promise of more equal opportunity
              for all, regardless of race and religion.
              <br> <br>K K Ng, a Malaysian retiree, said: "I hope he'll do something good,
              but he's got to make it quick, otherwise come next election, the UMNO
              (United Malays National Organisation) and BN (Barisan Nasional)
              government will fall into oblivion." <br> <br> Still, how far can Prime Minister Najib go to shore up his support
              before the next general election, which must be held by 2013? <br> <br> Analysts say much will depend on the state of the country's economy,
              which is expected to shrink as much as five per cent this year. <br> <br> - CNA/yb </span></p>
