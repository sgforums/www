            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan has announced changes to the Main Upgrading Programme.<br><br>This includes residents enjoying subsidies only after upgrading is completed, not from when the results of the upgrading poll are announced, and offering the space-adding scheme only to three and four-roomers.<br><br>Making his rounds at Telok Blangah Crescent, Mr Mah wanted to get a feel from residents if the MUP, completed in the area two years ago, was still relevant.<br><br>The answer was a resounding 'yes'.<br><br>Mr Mah took the opportunity to announce some refinements to the programme.<br><br>Residents will enjoy the upgrading subsidy at the point of billing after the completion of upgrading, not from when the results of the upgrading poll are announced.<br><br>Mr Mah said, "The time lag between billing and polling is four to five years, so this means effectively that the household will not be tagged and be considered as second timers until very much later. This will have benefits to more households, that they will not have to pay more for the second upgraded flat or not have to pay the levy."<br><br>The new policy will apply to projects announced from this year.<br><br>In more good news for residents, the upgrading levy will be abolished.<br><br>This means residents will no longer have to pay money back to the HDB if they sell their second upgraded flat.<br><br>Said Mr Mah, "I believe that this is a fairer system for the household that has been undergoing MUP, and we have revised this as part of our regular review and hope that this is a more equitable system."<br><br>In addition, the space-adding item, which could be an extra room, will only be offered to three- and four-room flat owners, in blocks which have a mix of flat sizes.<br><br>This is because few four- and five-roomers actually want the extra space; the support level among the four- and five-roomers has been less than six percent.<br><br>The Main Upgrading Programme was introduced in the early 1990s to inject life into old estates, such at the one at Telok Blangah Crescent.<br><br>Since then, more than 100 precincts have been upgraded. But Mr Mah says that due to budget constraints and a shifting focus on the Lift Upgrading Programme, fewer precincts will be chosen to be upgraded from now on.<br><br>In 2002, 10 precincts were chosen for the programme; last year only three precincts were chosen.<br><br>Flat dwellers welcome the push to have lifts at every floor.<br><br>"For elderly people to take the staircase is very dangerous for them. It's better to take the lift up," one person said.<br><br>The government will spend S$5 billion on the Lift Upgrading Programme over the next 10 years. - CNA</div>
