            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Polytechnic graduates continue to be among the most sought after.<br><br>Last year, nine in 10 got their first job within five months of graduation.<br><br>Those from the Health Sciences, Chemical and Life Science, and Maritime courses led the pack in being top earners.<br><br>Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts, and Health, Dr Balaji Sadasivan said this at Ngee Ann Polytechnic's graduation ceremony on Monday.<br><br>He said polytechnics needed to continue revamping themselves to stay relevant.<br><br>Newspaper delivery boy, hawker assistant, cleaner, fish farm helper and factory worker - these were just among the many odd jobs 27-year-old Alvin Pang had held to help his family make ends meet.<br><br>But now the former school drop-out has every reason to stand tall.<br><br>Despite having to give swimming lessons, between lessons, to earn some pocket money, the aspiring radio journalist came out tops from the School of Film and Media Studies, bagging numerous awards, including the MediaCorp Gold Medal.<br><br>Alvin said: "I realise that I have a lurking potential in me and I came here to realise that potential, giving up a full-time job to come back to study to realise my potential because I believe."<br><br>Ngee Ann Polytechnic also believes revamping its curriculum is the way to go to stay competitive and relevant.<br><br>A nursing diploma was launched just seven weeks ago with its first intake of 170 students.<br><br>The number is expected to soar to 400 in four to five years.<br><br>Dr Phang Chiew Hun, Acting Director of School of Health Sciences at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, said: "The diploma has emphasis in clinical attachment. It is a 48-week clinical attachment over a three-year period. It is longer than what other institutions are offering. In addition we also have emphasis on pharmacology.<br><br>"The other difference is that we offer Life Science electives in the area of clinical trials and intellectual property management, and one more elective is drug discovery and development."<br><br>If there is demand, the polytechnic has plans to roll out a two-year accelerated programme for mid-career professionals interested in nursing.<br><br>These steps will certainly propel Ngee Ann Polytechnic as a serious player in the field of health science education.<br><br>More than 4,000 students from the polytechnic are expected to graduate this week. - CNA/de</div>
