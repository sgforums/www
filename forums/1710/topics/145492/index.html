            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore celebrated Nurses' Day on Monday across the island, including the Istana, where three nurses were recognised for their outstanding contribution to healthcare.<br><br>Director of Nursing at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Kwek Puay Ee was presented the President's Award for Nurses.<br><br>Ms Kwek drives research-based initiatives to improve patient outcomes and has presented her work at overseas conferences.<br><br>Two other nurses also received the award this year - Cynthia Pang and Lina Ma.<br><br>Ms Pang has been in nursing for three decades.<br><br>When she started as a breast-feeding specialist 13 years ago, only half of mothers breast fed.<br><br>But her dedication to educating and helping women breast feed has paid off.<br><br>Now 90% of mothers choose the breast over the bottle and her efforts have been recognised with the President's Award for Nurses.<br><br>"Awareness has changed. Mothers are now aware of the benefits of breast feeding. They want to breast feed but they need more help to manage and breast feed for a longer period," said Cynthia Pang, a lactation consultant with KK Hospital.<br><br>Another winner of this year's President's Award for Nurses is changing the face of eldercare to help meet the needs of the aging population.<br><br>At a special unit of the Lions Nursing Home for Elders, residents look after themselves.<br><br>The Assisted Living Unit, which opened two weeks ago, is for people who no longer require nursing care but are not yet able to live at home.<br><br>There is just one assistant on hand to help them build up confidence and independence so they can return to their families.<br><br>It's the brainchild of the home's manager, Lina Ma, who has worked with the elderly for more than 30 years.<br><br>"If we can do something like, maybe speak on behalf of them and to get round the administrative issue, help them get what they rightly deserve, then I think it's worth everything," said Lina Ma, Manager of the Lions Nursing Home for Elders.<br><br>Care of the elderly is not seen as a glamorous medical specialty. But Ms Ma hopes her President's award will inspire more nurses to take it up and see the benefits of adding life to years.<br><br>- CNA /ls</div>
