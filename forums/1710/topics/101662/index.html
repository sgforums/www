Tight security was expected for the one-day visit.<br><br>"The main point of today is not about security, it's to boost the morale of the people at Tak Bai," said government spokesman Jakrapob Penkair.<br><br>There have been a spate of reprisal attacks against Buddhists following the death of 87 people on October 25 after security forces broke up a protest outside Tak Bai police station with gunfire, tear gas and water cannon. All but nine of the Muslims died while in detention.<br><br>In the latest killings Paosan Tayamanon, 42, was shot dead in his grocery shop around midday Saturday in Narathiwat by two men posing as customers, police said.<br><br>Chan Monopak, 40, was shot by two gunmen on a motorcycle late Saturday in Narathiwat while travelling home from work and died later in hospital.<br><br>Both men were Buddhists, estimated to make up 30 percent of the population in Thailand's three southernmost provinces near the border with Malaysia.<br><br>Panitan Wattanayagorn, assistant professor at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University and a security expert on the south, told AFP that attacks appeared to be increasingly better coordinated and planned.<br><br>He said the militants included a mixture of groups including separatists, Islamic hardliners and the disaffected.<br><br>"People are more randomly selected. I think the offices and the camps and the high-profile targets are better protected. They have still been attacked, but since September they have switched their targets to softer ones."<br><br>Thaksin has cancelled his trip to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Chile this month amid fears of continuing violence.<br><br>He had been due to fly out on November 18 but his place will now be taken by Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, according to officials.<br><br>Thaksin, who has been criticised by Thailand's opposition and abroad for his hardline tactics in the south, showed few signs of softening his approach during his weekly radio address on Saturday.<br><br>He rejected any negotiations with separatists battling for autonomy in the Muslim-majority region and warned that anyone found with assault rifles or bombs faced the death penalty.<br><br>Militants have been behind almost daily killings since January when a decades-old separatist insurgency sparked back into life. Some 539 people have died this year.<br><br>Narathiwat council member Ahmad Benno, a Muslim, said he wanted Malaysia to act as a broker between the two communities in the south to try to resolve the crisis.<br><br>"We need a third party to come in," said the former activist for Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party. "It it's just the two parties, then no way."</div>

The government will apply a softer approach," he said.<br><br>Two more Buddhists have been shot dead since Friday afternoon taking the death toll to at least 537 this year from a long-running insurgency that sparked back into life in January.</div>
