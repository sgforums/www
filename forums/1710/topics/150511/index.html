            <div class='col-md body'>It's all systems go as Istana staff gear up for the big day.<br><br>President S R Nathan will be sworn in for his second term in office on 1 September.<br><br>This time round, the ceremony is expected to be bigger than in 1999 - with more guests, especially those from the diplomatic corp.<br><br>Chief butler Francis Ho and his team have been busy getting the Istana ready for the swearing-in - from the pots of plants to the flags and, of course, the all-important stationery for the President to sign his oath of office.<br><br>After six years of working for Mr S R Nathan, Francis now knows his likes and dislikes better, especially when it comes to food.<br><br>He said: "He likes mee siam, mee rebus. I think mee siam is his favourite! He cares for us in his way, he takes notice of the little things we do and gives us a pat on our shoulder whenever necessary."<br><br>Major Danny Teo has also been busy, coordinating logistics for the ceremony over the past month.<br><br>He says viewers can look forward to a short, simple yet dignified ceremony.<br><br>The Navy officer also shared his insights on what it's like to work with Mr Nathan.<br><br>He said: "Nobody looking at him knows or believes he is 81 years old. Frankly, having seen people in their 60s, 70s and looking at President Nathan, he really doesn't look 81. That's something I really admire him for - to be at this age and still going at the rate he's going, and here we are - 31, 32 - trying to keep up with him."<br><br>More than 200 guests - made up of Cabinet ministers, top civil servants and members of the diplomatic corp - will be at the Istana's State Room to witness President S R Nathan take his oath of office.<br><br>The swearing-in ceremony will be broadcast live on Channel NewsAsia on Thursday at 7.50pm.<br><br>Repeat telecasts will be shown on: Channel 5 at 10pm on the same day of the ceremony; Suria at 8.30pm and Vasantham Central at 8pm on Friday. - CNA/ir</div>
