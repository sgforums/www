            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Some residents of Joo Chiat are seeing red about the many entertainment outlets that have sprung up in their largely residential area.<br><br>Many complain that these outlets are attracting undesirable activities, such as prostitution to an area known for its historical architecture and Peranakan culture.<br><br>At last count, there are about 70 karaoke lounges, more than 30 massage parlours, and at least seven budget hotels along Joo Chiat Road alone.<br><br>And residents aren't thrilled.<br><br>Residents say that over the past six to twelve months, there has been a rapid rise in the number of karaoke lounges, pubs, health centres and massage parlours - establishments that they say, are attracting social problems and give Joo Chiat a bad name.<br><br>Some concerns raised by residents - foreign women who openly solicit for customers, including drunken patrons.<br><br>"The residents here are concerned with the wives and daughters walking along Joo Chiat Road. They can be mistaken as one of the prostitutes. I have been driving every night along the road and the cars turn around to look at the wonderful girls walking down the streets and that slows down traffic. Of course it's colourful but it brings out the wrong image to Joo Chiat. It's a colourful night life I would say but not to the advantage of the residents," said James Ling, a resident at Joo Chiat.<br><br>Another resident Patricia Sharma said: "The area has degenerated into an area that is just like Geylang. I, as a woman cannot walk down the street and feel safe anymore because there's more drunk driving and drunken brawl. Men look at me, if I dress in anything but fully covered. You'll be stared at by all these men who assume you are a prostitute."<br><br>Residents have aired their concerns and grievances to their MP, who says the new businesses are due to the lifting of the Rent Control Act three years ago.<br><br>Landlords can now raise rents and because of that, many traditional businesses have moved out.<br><br>Chan Soo Sen, MP for Joo Chiat said: "I can understand why my residents are upset and I empathise with them. The law enforcement agencies have been checking on these establishments regularly, checking the papers of these women regularly. From what they told me, there are not many vice activities. Quite a lot of activities relate to buying drinks for the ladies. The law enforcement agency says this does not constitute an offence but they will continue to monitor."<br><br>Mr Chan has regular meetings with the police and various agencies, including the Land Transport Authority and the URA, to review the situation and take action where needed.<br><br>But residents want more to be done.<br><br>Another Joo Chiat resident said: "Next to my house, there's a new pub coming up and there's another open already. I get disturbance every now and then because people are drunk and staff who come out of the shops make noise. One thing I feel is that, they have to be careful when they give out licences, and cut down the hours of operation. Joo Chiat has been a lively area for a long time. It's fine if you don't want to kill businesses here but you have to bear in mind that you have residents living here."<br><br>However, the MP says the businesses are legitimate, and as long as they don't contravene the law, there's not much that can be done.<br><br>"I have to say that whatever action taken has got to be within the framework of the law. There's no reason for police to go beyond what is legally permissible," the MP added.<br><br>So for now at least, it seems Joo Chiat is set to remain a lively area. - CNA</div>
