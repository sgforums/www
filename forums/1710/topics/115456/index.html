            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Students and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew engaged in a lively question-and-answer session that lasted more than an hour on Monday evening at the annual Kent Ridge ministerial forum.<br><br>Opening Singapore's political space and speculation about the next general elections were some of the issues raised by the students.<br><br>Mr Lee, in turn, threw down his challenge for those who called for political alternatives to become the alternative themselves.<br><br>It was a spirited exchange between students and the Minister Mentor - kicking off on a student's concern about young Singaporeans lacking ownership of the country.<br><br>MM Lee asked: "What will give those friends of yours who don't feel they own this place a sense of ownership?"<br><br>"I don't know that's why I am asking0" replied the student.<br><br>MM Lee said: "You are prescribing a malady which I don't know exists - which has been talked about. This is a phase Singapore is going through because a younger generation feels they're entitled to a bigger space, that they should be in charge - they will be in charge but only some of them will be in charge not everybody. But everyone will be given the chance to give inputs."<br><br>In response to those who felt they're not being heard, the Minister Mentor suggested starting a publication or a website on the Internet.<br><br>This open and frank discussion saw many students queuing up to pose questions which ended with Mr Lee throwing his challenge to the students.<br><br>One student said: "I believe oppressive acts like the Printing Act and the Internal Security Act should be reviewed since maybe they are no longer relevant as we have reached a stage where stability is here."<br><br>MM Lee replied: "There is nothing to prevent you from advocating that strenuously and getting your political party to adopt that platform and put it to the vote. My message is a simple one - remember how we got here and before you make fundamental changes - make sure your alternative is viable. This is not an ordinary country. If you have two election terms of a dud incompetent government, it will set Singapore back so badly, it may take decades to recover or never."<br><br>He noted that some of the limitations of the Republic do not change: size means vulnerability "to be overcome by an extraordinary effort...if we are just ordinary we will fail - we have not failed because we are not ordinary". - CNA</div>
