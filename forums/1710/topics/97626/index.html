            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamed thinks Asians are waiting for a credible leader from a credible nation.<br><br>Dr Mahathir was speaking at the 2nd Leadership in Asia lecture organised by the Singapore Management University.<br><br>Mr Ho Kwon Ping, Chairman of SMU, said: "Dr Mahathir has surely never been called a follower. He has always led by example and from the front, and in blunt straight-forward language."<br><br>And sure enough when the man himself took to the stage, he lived up to that introduction.<br><br>In a short speech peppered with witty jibes at the West, Dr Mahathir lamented the current state of Asian leadership.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said: "I believe that Asians are waiting for a leader, a credible leader from a credible nation. Those who kowtow too much to ethnic-Europeans should not be surprised if their people rise against them and commit acts of terror or whatever.<br><br>"Asian leaders have a choice. Assume and assert true leadership, seize the initiative in terms of ideas and thoughts, restore self-respect or face the humiliation of foreign hegemony and the contempt of their own people."<br><br>During an hour-long question-and-answer session that followed, many students, professors, businessmen and former ambassadors took turns to quiz Dr Mahathir for his views on a wide range of issues - from democracy and leadership in Asia, to Iraq, the Muslim world and Malaysian politics. And inevitably, the Anwar question was raised yet again.<br><br>He was asked what will happen to Malaysian politics and democracy now that Anwar Ibrahim is free?<br><br>Dr Mahathir said: "I have no doubt he will try to make a comeback but it will be a futile effort. He can cause a lot of problem but the present government will be able to handle that, I am not worried about that, as for me, of course, I am out of the picture."<br><br>He was also asked for his take on Singapore-Malaysia ties, especially after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's visit to Kuala Lumpur.<br><br><strong>Dr Mahathir said: "When I became Prime Minister in 1981, I made a trip and saw Mr Lee Kuan Yew - yes it was nice initially but we will never know what will happen later, things change, so I am glad all the problems I created has now been relegated to the background and I hope they will never come back." </strong><br><strong>You can watch excerpts of Dr Mahathir's speech on a Channel NewsAsia Special on Asian Leadership this Saturday at 8 pm.</strong> - CNA<br><br></div>
