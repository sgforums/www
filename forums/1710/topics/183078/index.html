            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Pasir Ris, Punggol and Sengkang residents will have more reasons to keep to a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>Over S$850 million has been set aside to upgrade their estates in the next five years.<br><br>Of this, S$150 million will be used to develop facilities like sports complexes, and S$700 million will be for new housing developments.<br><br>Residents in Pasir Ris and Sengkang can look forward to sports complexes and swimming pools.<br><br>"I'm very excited. We have been waiting very long for a swimming pool, actually. Before, if we wanted to go for a swim we would have to go to Downtown East but Downtown East has been converted to Wild Wild Wet. Now, we have to go all the way to Tampines," said Pasir Ris resident Ng Cher Pheng.<br><br>"In Pasir Ris we don't even have a squash court, so if we have a sport complex here, it will be great," resident Dorran Leong said.<br><br>Pasir Ris will also see a new food cum entertainment mart at Downtown East by 2007, and a S$200 million mega retail warehouse complex by 2008.<br><br>The five-year development plan will also include the needs of the elderly.<br><br>There will be six elderly fitness stations like the ones at Punggol 21; Pasir Ris and Sengkang are expected to follow suit.<br><br>"It's very good to have such facilities for senior citizens so every morning we can exercise and at night the grandchildren can come down and play," said Paris Ris resident Tan Kin Tee.<br><br>Residents will benefit further when the S$1.7 billion Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) is ready by 2008.<br><br>Also expect more greenery and landscaping as park connectors between the towns are further extended, incorporating leisure and recreational facilities by the waterfront.<br><br>Said Dr Michael Lim, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, "We've got about 25 government departments working with the grassroots organisations so that we can plan the facilities and amenities in time. Many of the things were pre-planned, like the RC centres, childcare centres, kindergartens -- they were planned even before the population moved in so that when they move in everything was like clock-work."<br><br>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean says the PAP is confident of meeting the residents' needs.<br><br>He said, "Our residents here will be able to decide wisely on who will be able to serve them best in the future. I think they would want to choose someone who has a real concern for their interest and who will not be here just two or three weeks before an election to stir things up."<br><br>Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC was recently expanded from a five-member to a six-member team.<br><br>But Mr Teo was tight-lipped about the identity of the sixth member and would rather leave it to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to make the announcement. - CNA /ct</div>
