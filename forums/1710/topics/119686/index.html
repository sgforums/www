            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's Foreign Minister George Yeo has highlighted the importance of US leadership in the world as he holds talks with top US officials in Washington.<br><br>Mr Yeo met US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at the State Department, where they discussed regional issues facing their two countries.<br><br>He also met Stephen Hadley, the National Security Adviser.<br><br>According to the State Department, talks with Dr Rice focused on ways to strengthen cooperation, the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and tsunami relief efforts.<br><br>Dr Rice also expressed US appreciation for Singapore's deployment of personnel and equipment to Iraq.<br><br>Mr Yeo said: "I mentioned to both Secretary Rice, and Mr Hadley that all this show how important US leadership is in the world. Yes, the US cannot operate on its own. Needs friends, allies. However on most important issues, you need US leadership. I talked about how important that was in Asia after the tsunami...the US provided enormous resources and assets that could be mobilised. This is an opportunity for US to strengthen relationship with Southeast Asia which is important for Singapore, important for stability in region."<br><br>Mr Yeo also said that the US had expressed concern about an upcoming inaugural leaders' meeting of East Asian countries.<br><br>He said: "Singapore's position is that it's important for ASEAN to be the fulcrum of this new construction...important that summit is inclusive not just confined to fixed number of countries, that it looks outwards."<br><br>He also noted that Washington has some concerns that the East Asia Summit may be inward looking and exclusive.<br><br>"I told them that other countries in the region would also be against that. Bilaterals are excellent...so we talked about issues that affect us in a larger way and longer term in nature, like terrorism," he added.<br><br>State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called the meeting very positive and constructive and a very good consultation with a close friend.<br><br>He said: "The meeting with Minister Yeo from Singapore was very, very good. It was an extensive discussion of regional issues as well as US-Singapore cooperation." - CNA</div>
