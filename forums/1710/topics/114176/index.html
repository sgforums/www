            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: MediaCorp says it will ensure that creativity and innovation can survive and even thrive in what's now a single-player local TV industry.<br><br>The company also wants to partner others to develop Singapore's creative community, says MediaCorp chairman Ho Kwon Ping.<br><br>He was speaking at the Singapore Press Club talk, attended by top brass from MediaCorp and the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH).<br><br>"I was asked whether I had any major announcements today and I said I didn't have anything except the very small announcement that if within three years Today does not exceed Straits Times' circulation, we will close Today. But, we are confident that can be reached. So that won't be a problem.....just for the record, that was a remark meant in jest," said Mr Ho.<br><br>The banter set the tone for the talk.<br><br>Mr Ho felt that competition in the free-to-air TV market had resulted in a 'lose-lose' situation for both MediaCorp and SPH.<br><br>But, with the merger of their mass market television channels and free newspaper operations and thus the end of destructive competition, MediaCorp can now focus on what consumers want and the quality in production.<br><br>Mr Ho said: "I see my primary role as a catalyst: to provoke the start of a transformational process which is carried throughout the MediaCorp organization, so that the benefits which would ordinarily arise from competition can still accrue to a sole player."<br><br>"MediaCorp can through a re-engineering of its creative process, ensure that the stifling nature of a monopoly need not be our fate," he added.<br><br>One challenge is for MediaCorp to develop alternative processes to supplement the time-tested range of local TV programmes and to create a culture of internal competition within MediaCorp itself, all in the name of being daring, different and taking creative risks.<br><br>The huge success of the Singapore Idol show has taught MediaCorp some lessons.<br><br>Firstly, give consumers more power by involving them in shows and giving them choice.<br><br>Secondly, there's a huge reservoir of talent in Singapore waiting to be unleashed.<br><br>So, MediaCorp will continue to develop the creative community and also promote the arts.<br><br>Mr Ho also debunked the myth that the licence fees paid by consumers go directly to MediaCorp.<br><br>He said: "In the good old days or bad old days, when you paid for your TV and radio licence, all the money came to us. Now, it goes to the Media Development Authority (MDA). We only get a fraction of that."<br><br>"We would probably like to be in a state like the BBC - you pay your TV and radio licence fees, they increase the fees and index them to inflation and the money actually goes to them. But, my honest answer is that it is not within our ambit. It has been taken out of MediaCorp's control already. The licence fees are being paid to the regulatory authority and they then disburse it," he added.<br><br>Mr Ho felt that Singapore's political role in the region is quite respected and MediaCorp's reports of events can be seen as neutral.<br><br>"That's why I feel we can still be a credible news and current affairs organization," he said.<br><br>"In the last few years, there has been considerable opening up in Singapore. Events we couldn't contemplate a few years ago are now openly allowed by the authorities. So, my sense is that there is tremendous social cultural change in Singapore and we will be part of that. But, it's not our job to be a prime mover of that change," Mr Ho added.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia will lead in this area as it develops world-class content for the region.<br><br>Still, the reality is that quality of content can only be developed with funds.<br><br>That is why it's important the broadcaster is profitable.<br><br>Mr Ho said: "After this nice talk of creativity, we will have to go back to the office and think about how to make money. That's what everyone has to do." - CNA</div>
