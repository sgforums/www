            <div class='col-md body'>KUALA LUMPUR : Malaysian police used batons and water cannon on Sunday to disperse hundreds of anti-government protesters at Kuala Lumpur's iconic Twin Towers, arresting more than 20 and beating several as stunned shoppers looked on.<br><br>Some 400 people, including trade unionists, opposition parties and non-government organisations, had gathered at an upmarket shopping mall at the towers for the latest in a series of rallies against fuel price rises since the government sharply raised prices on February 28.<br><br>They were met by over 400 police, including officers with dogs and on horseback. Police in riot gear wielding batons and rifles were also seen in formation, while two water cannon trucks stood ready.<br><br>Shouting anti-government slogans and holding floating black balloons to symbolise oil and inflation, the protestors demanded the government reverse the price rises.<br><br>"When the petrol price goes up, all our essential goods go up," K. Brabakarun, a vice president from the Malaysian Trades Union Congress, the main protest organiser, told reporters.<br><br>"There's a limit. Workers can't afford a price increase against their salaries so we are telling the government," he said.<br><br>The MTUC and other organisations will deliver a memorandum to Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi on Monday over the issue, he said.<br><br>The rise has sparked public anger. Abdullah's administration has pleaded for public understanding, citing high global oil prices.<br><br>Crowd numbers at the rallies during the month have been dropping but protesters have become increasingly defiant.<br><br>Chaotic scenes ensued as the demonstrators followed a police call to disperse, but then marched further down the street to continue the rally before heading back to the Twin Towers.<br><br>Police then used a water cannon to disperse demonstrators, who scrambled across a paved forecourt in front of the towers to continue their rally.<br><br>For over two hours protesters repeatedly dispersed to mingle with onlookers, but then gathered again in small groups near the towers only to be chased by police.<br><br>Police finally pointed a water cannon at shocked shoppers and tourists outside the Twin Towers and at an exclusive mall across the street to clear the roads, before the protest petered out.<br><br>Several protestors were seen being beaten and kicked by police before being handcuffed and arrested. Deputy district police chief Rodzi Ismail said more than 20 had been arrested but police were still confirming numbers.<br><br>A leader in the opposition Islamic PAS party, Hatta Ramli, and two of his daughters were among those arrested.<br><br>"What the police have done today is to show the government is desperate to disperse all these forms of demonstrations so we must go on to fight," said a PAS official, Zulkifli Ahmad. - AFP/de</div>
