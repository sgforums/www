            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : There were 590 fewer babies born in the first 10 months of this year compared to last year.<br><br>But things are looking up. Experts say the government's pro-family package announced in August is already having an impact.<br><br>Investment bankers Sheldon and Elaine Chan's baby girl looks set to have fewer classmates when she goes to school.<br><br>Fertility experts hope babies like her will help boost Singapore's birth rate for the last three months of the year.<br><br>This is especially since only 30,581 babies were born up to October, compared to 31,171 in the same period last year.<br><br>Singapore had announced generous pro-family benefits in August.<br><br>Experts say the impact will not be felt yet, but there are already signs that it could have a positive effect on next year's birth rate.<br><br>Ms Elaine Chan, First-time Mother, said: "It is definitely a bonus that we got all these benefits from the government. It was an extra bonus for us. And I pretty like the childcare leave, especially for both my husband and myself, and also because my kid will be able to enjoy some maid's levy, as well as the childcare centre next time."<br><br>Magazine designer Rachel Lim, who is five-month pregnant with her second child, said the procreation package has helped her decide not to stop at baby number 2.<br><br>She said the government subsidy of about S$400 would be a bonus.<br><br>"Definitely we will consider because of $400, by the time the third one comes along just nice, infantcare and all that," she said.<br><br>And the comprehensive package, covering everything from parental leave, childcare options and cash, has pushed couples to seriously think of having baby Number 2 or 3.<br><br>Dr Ann Tan, a gynaecologist, is encouraged that more younger parents-to-be are turning up at her clinic.<br><br>Dr Tan said: "I think it's encouraging that more people, at least I see more young people, early pregnancies now. Perhaps it's a change of heart. Perhaps things are looking up for the country.<br><br>"I do think it is part of all these publicity of fertility or rather infertility issues that have caused the younger women to have their own state of health, and come up and have their fertility checked.<br><br>"Even in their earlier 20s, am I okay? Do I have cysts...so they are actually being more concerned."<br><br>Experts say Singapore could actually stop the fall in its birth rate but reversing Singapore's low birth rates will take a much longer time.<br><br>The latest World Fact Book says Singapore's total fertility rate could drop from last year's 1.25 to only 1.04.<br><br>Population experts are watching the country closely as they say no country has managed to raise its fertility above 1.5 after it has fallen below that figure.<br><br>Associate Professor Pauline Tay Straughan, Sociologist at the National University of Singapore, said: "The trends that are pushing fertility down include getting married later, proportion of singles also going up in Singapore, so it is not just about having babies.<br><br>"It is about getting married, and embracing families and parenthood as a package. So, it will take time for mindsets to change. That is not to say that the new policies announced in August are not working.<br><br>"We need to be patient, wait at least 10 months next year to see if the package has brought relief to would-be parents. Hopefully at least it won't slide any further.<br><br>"I'm not that optimistic personally that it would effect a significant increase in birth rates or total fertility rates. But perhaps we can be a little bit hopeful that it will arrest the decline."<br><br>But it will be an uphill task.<br><br>Singapore's total fertility rate is the third from the bottom in a survey of 225 territories. - CNA</div>
