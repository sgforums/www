            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore will open its air and naval bases to anyone who is bringing in supplies for the relief efforts in the region.<br><br>Singapore's Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean said his Indonesian counterpart's told him that airports in Medan and Banda Aceh are overstretched.<br><br>The bases in Singapore will be used as additional staging and logistics points, and already Singapore has been sending aid to Indonesia's most badly-affected areas.<br><br>Chinooks have already brought relief supplies to Maloubu, the worst hit area in Aceh.<br><br>A medical team from Singapore's armed forces flew into the area on Thursday, and ferried whole families out.<br><br>Singapore, which was mostly unaffected by the tsunamis, has been offering aid to Indonesia and the rest of the region.<br><br>Over 12,000 pounds of food relief is already reaching Maloubu.<br><br>Four to six C-130 planes are operating between Singapore and Indonesia to bring relief to the disaster area.<br><br>Mr Teo has been in constant touch with his Indonesian counterpart.<br><br>He found out that the airport in Banda Aceh suffered serious damage - hence it is opening up Singapore's facilities.<br><br>Mr Teo said: "I understand that the control tower is operating out of a tent. I told the Minister Yuwono, Singapore is opening up our air bases and our naval base for anyone who is bringing relief supplies to this area so that they can use that as an additional staging and logistics point to bring humanitarian supplies and aid to that part of Indonesia.<br><br>"We have contacted the Australians, French, Japanese as well as the Americans who have expressed some interest in making use of this.<br><br>"For example, they may want to bring heavy lift supplies, heavy lift aeroplanes and ships, and break bulk here and transport them through smaller aircraft which will then have greater access into different more remote parts of Sumatra more easily. That is one possible way of working."<br><br>On Friday, some 500 personnel and equipment left Tuas Naval Base in Singapore for the western Sumatra region.<br><br>The men from the RSS Endurance were told on Tuesday that the Landing Ship Tank would set sail for Indonesia.<br><br>Since then, they have been working round the clock to get the 6,000-tonne ship ready.<br><br>The landing ship tank RSS Endurance has been stocked up with a whole range of engineering and medical equipment.<br><br>It will take about two days to reach its destination in western Sumatra and once the SAF team reaches there, it will work closely with their Indonesian counterparts to provide a whole range of services, among them helping to clear roads and debris, and providing primary healthcare services."<br><br>Mr Teo said: "If we go into an area, or receive a warning about seismic activity, we will limit our exposure on the ground. These are the basic precautions our people will take.<br><br>"It is known that after a major earthquake there are aftershocks...you just have to work with it and accept that risk."<br><br>Dr Low Cheng Ooi, SAF Relief Mission to Indonesia, said: "Things we are expecting in the area where we are going to work are things like water-borne diseases and post-trauma cases related to earthquake.<br><br>"We have the means to treat all these patients, we have the means to help identify what the diseases, we have the means to treat them and we have the capability to perform surgery on the field."<br><br>The teams received all their innoculations and have been well briefed about the hygiene precautions to take. - CNA<br></div>
