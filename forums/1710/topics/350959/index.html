              <p><strong>7 year old girl survives after falling 4 storeys onto a concrete floor</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE — She fell four storeys on to a concrete
              floor, but Siti Nur Aini, 7, miraculously was still able to tell the
              paramedics she was in pain.</p>
              <p>She had slipped through a gap in the metal railing by the flat’s lift—landing, suffering multiple fractures.</p>
              <p>Her family said the gap was reported in December to the Bukit Merah
              Town Council. But the latter last night said it could find no record of
              the call.</p>
              <p>The Blangah Rise Primary School student’s grandfather, retiree
              Johari Mohd Siamu, said: “We thought it was quite dangerous, the whole
              thing (railing) is rusty and shaky.”</p>
              <p>At about 4.30pm yesterday, the 69—year—old had been cooking mee
              rebus for his granddaughter at their flat at Telok Blangah Crescent,
              when his sons brought her in after she had fallen.</p>
              <p>“Her eyes were open but she didn’t talk. Then she started crying and
              saying she was in pain,” said Mr Johari. His sons called for an
              ambulance while he comforted her.</p>
              <p>At the time of the mishap, a picnic mat had been hung to air over
              the gap in the railing. Siti had been playing nearby. “I think she was
              crawling behind it, and then suddenly we saw the mat move and then we
              realised she had fallen,” said Mr Muhammad Azman, 24, a family friend.</p>
              <p>Mr Muhammad and Siti’s uncle Muhammad Syukri had been sitting nearby
              at the landing, playing the guitar. “She knows not to play there,” said
              Mr Muhammad Syukri, 20, currently unemployed. “We always warn her not
              to run around too close.”</p>
              <p>It was he who reportedly called the town council three months ago
              about the broken railing. He claimed he was told someone would be sent
              to check on it. “I didn’t hear from them, I don’t know if they came or
              not.”</p>
              <p>Neighbour Wee Deng Seng, 55, said residents often gathered at the
              landing, where someone had left a sofa to sit on. “Sometimes when we
              wait for the lift, we will lean on the railing, but then we realised it
              was shaky.”</p>
              <p>Last night, Member of Parliament for the ward Sam Tan and a town
              council representative were at the National University Hospital (NUH)
              to visit Siti, who was undergoing surgery for bleeding in her abdomen.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Tan: “We want to make sure the family doesn’t have to worry
              about the medical expenses and that Siti gets the best treatment
              possible.”</p>
              <p>The medical bills, he said, could be billed directly to the town
              council if the family has difficulty paying, and the town council would
              contact its insurers to find out more about covering with its public
              liability insurance.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, a town council officer will be stationed at the
              hospital to assist the family. The railing was also cordoned off after
              the incident.</p>
              <p>Town council property manager Vincent Lim, who went to NUH with Mr
              Tan, said that typically if a report about damaged property came in
              during office hours, officers would be sent down immediately. “If it’s
              after office hours, then we will record it in the system and alert
              someone to go down the next working day,” he said. — TODAY/ar</p>
