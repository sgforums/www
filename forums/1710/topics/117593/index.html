            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Tougher enforcement against soliciting women and drunk pub customers in Joo Chiat has meant the neighbourhood has taken on a slightly cleaner image.<br><br>But residents and MP Chan Soo Sen, who formed the Community Watch Group there, wants to implement a more long-term solution.<br><br>Women soliciting along the streets in Joo Chiat Road, drunkards relieving themselves behind resident's homes - these are the common scenes.<br><br>These establishments share a common wall with some of the homes along Onan and Tembeling Roads.<br><br>Such activities come as no surprise since this stretch is home to some 40 establishments like pubs, karaoke lounges and massage parlours.<br><br>Places like these have sprouted out in the area in the past year.<br><br>Media reports highlighted the problem and police enforcement increased.<br><br>From December 21 last year, the Police even agreed to a moratorium on issuing licences to new pubs and similar establishments in Joo Chiat.<br><br>That has helped some, but the watch group wants to make sure the problem does not come back.<br><br>Roger Soh, Leader of Joo Chiat Community Watch Group, said: "We need to let the residents know us.....we need to work out a platform, something like a letter or pamphlet for the residents to fill up, in a format like airmail already paid that they can fill up and send it to us."<br><br>The business operators at the root of the controversy will, however, continue to operate within the new rules.<br><br>But it will be a challenge to play by the books since business has plummeted some 80 percent since the clampdown.<br><br>Chris Yap, Member of Joo Chiat Community Watch Group and Business Community Representative, said: "The women, I'm not saying that there won't be any more foreign women coming back.<br><br>"In fact, we are hoping that they would come back but behave in a proper manner, for example, stop soliciting on the roads and I'm sure it would be bearable by the authorities as well as the residents."<br><br>Not everyone though thinks such businesses should continue.<br><br>"Save Joo Chiat Group" which is part of the Watch Group would prefer a clean image for the neighbourhood.<br><br>They want the place to attract tourists and families in the long run by selling its rich Peranakan heritage. - CNA</div>
