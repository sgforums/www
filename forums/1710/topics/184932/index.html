            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's Official Assignee and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority have responded to claims by Chee Soon Juan on the SDP website that he was not allowed to leave Singapore to attend a conference in Turkey on April 1.<br><br>Responding to queries from Channel NewsAsia, an ICA spokesman said that on that day, Dr Chee presented himself to the immigration counter at Changi Airport for departure clearance.<br><br>Dr Chee needed permission from the Official Assignee before he's allowed to leave the country as he has been declared a bankrupt.<br><br>But Dr Chee was unable to show that he had been granted permission by the Official Assignee and so he was not allowed to depart.<br><br>In a separate reply to CNA, the Official Assignee's office stressed that all bankrupts have to obtain the approval of the Official Assignee before they can travel out of the country .<br><br>If a bankrupt is cooperative in the administration of his bankruptcy affairs, he will be granted approval immediately.<br><br>If, however, there are outstanding matters pertaining to his bankruptcy administration, his application to travel will not be approved until all these matters are dealt with by the Official Assignee.<br><br>In Dr Chee's case, the Official Assignee said Dr Chee was told by the bankruptcy officer that he should not leave the country without prior approval of the Official Assignee until his affairs in bankruptcy are resolved.<br><br>Despite this, Dr Chee informed the officer that he will proceed to travel, indicating his intention to deliberately break the law.<br><br>So to ensure that Dr Chee does not leave the country, the Official Assignee directed the Controller of Immigration to prevent him from leaving Singapore.<br><br>Dr Chee's passport has been impounded and forwarded to the Official Assignee.
