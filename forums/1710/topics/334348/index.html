              <p><strong>Companies recall hot/cold packs found to contain toxic substance</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Ten types of hot/cold packs sold in Singapore have
              been voluntarily recalled by their companies as the packs contain a
              toxic substance.
              <br> <br>Laboratory tests revealed these packs contain the anti-freeze
              ingredient ethylene glycol, instead of the non-toxic substance
              propylene glycol.
              <br> <br> The 10 affected packs are marketed under three brands - SURGIPACK, Soft R&amp;R and OSIM.
              <br> <br>The packs are Surgipack Soft Hot/Cold Pack Large, Surgipack Soft
              Hot/Cold Pack Small, Soft R&amp;R Cold/Hot Pack-M, Soft R&amp;R
              Cold/Hot Pack-L, OSIM uBaby Fever Band, OSIM Shoulder Pad, OSIM uKids
              Fever Band, OSIM Face Mask, OSIM Eye Mask and OSIM Hot/Cold Compress.
              <br> <br>The packs can be frozen or heated up and are used as a compress to
              relieve headache, toothache, aching muscles and strains (sic). <br> <br> While there have been no adverse reports from the use of these products
              locally, the Health Sciences Authority (HAS) says the recall is a
              precaution.
              <br> <br>It was alerted to the danger following a case of accidental
              poisoning in Australia, where a young child had chewed through the
              plastic packaging and swallowed some ethylene glycol.
              <br> <br> HSA says the affected products have been voluntarily withdrawn from sale since Thursday.
              <br> <br> An estimated 2,000 pieces of the affected products have been sold in Singapore.
              <br> <br> Consumers who have purchased these products are advised to stop using them immediately.
              <br> <br> For more information, consumers can contact the respective companies:

              <p><strong>Pharmacies pull affected hot/cold packs off the shelves</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Companies carrying the affected hot/cold packs have completed their recall at the wholesale and retail levels.
              <br> <br> Pharmacies voluntarily pulled out some 600 packs off the shelves on
              Tuesday, after the Health Sciences Authority issued an alert on 10
              packs on Monday.
              <br> <br>Laboratory tests had revealed that these packs contain the
              anti-freeze ethylene glycol, instead of the non-toxic propylene glycol.
              <br> <br> Frozen or heated, the packs are used to relieve headaches, toothaches, aching muscles and strains.
              <br> <br> The three affected brands are Surgipack, Soft R&amp;R and OSIM.
              <br> <br> OSIM is encouraging customers to return the packs for a voucher or a product of a similar value.
              <br> <br> A pharmacy says a water-based pack is a safer alternative.
              <br> <br> Some say the move to recall the products was overly cautious as it
              takes tampering to rupture the plastic packs before any liquid can
              leak.
              <br> <br> Others thought it wiser to err on the side of caution.
              <br> <br>A member of the public said, "I have 4 kids and I support that
              decision to have that stuff taken off the shelf because… kids tend to
              bite or take the stuff (and) I think it is harmful for them.
              <br> <br>"I have used packs similar to this one. For adult usage I think (it
              is) perfectly safe. You just have to watch the supervision of your
              children (if they use it) because you know that is something like any
              other household product. Even if it has a warning, you still have to
              watch."
