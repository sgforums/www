              <p>The world's biggest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, completed its
              first commercial flight to Europe at Heathrow Airport today. <br> <br> Aviation minister Jim Fitzpatrick was among dignitaries at Heathrow to
              greet the Rolls-Royce-powered Singapore Airlines plane, whose wings are
              made in the UK. <br> <br> The 240ft-long aircraft had been given a rousing send-off by staff at
              Singapore's Changi Airport and it was met at Heathrow by a water cannon
              salute from fire brigade crews after its 6,800-mile journey. <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/A380PA1803_468x290.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Perfect

              spent more than £100 million to accommodate the A380 that will not
              operate on a daily basis between Singapore and London</em><br> <br> The
              Dubai-based carrier Emirates will start A380 services to Heathrow in
              December and Australian carrier Qantas is also expected to use the
              superjumbo to fly to London. <br> <br> In the future, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will be flying the
              A380 at Heathrow, where both terminal three and the new £4.3 billion
              Terminal 5 can take the new aircraft. <br> <br> All of those on board were given a certificate with their names on to
              mark the event, with intrepid traveller Mark Barden, 45, from
              Southampton possibly the most worthy recipient. <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/A380PA1803_468x302.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Preparing

              third A380 trip in two days and was even contemplating going in to work
              on Thursday. <br> <br> The certificates passengers received were all signed by the captain of
              the flight Gerard Yeap, 55, who said on the flight: "It is an absolute
              pleasure to fly this plane. It's smooth and it's quiet and you don't
              feel it is a really big plane." <br> <br> Enjoying first class today was company director John Read, who was
              returning from Melbourne after watching Lewis Hamilton win the
              Australian Grand Prix. <br> <br> Mr Read, from Cuffley, Hertfordshire, said: "It's superb. I can't fault
              it. I booked the return flight to watch the Grand Prix hoping I might
              be able to go on the superjumbo and I was very pleased to have done
              so." <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/10_04/a380shopDM2510_468x456.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>In-flight retail therapy: A duty-free store<br> <br> </em> One passenger who appreciated the "greenness" of the new plane was
              retired environmental manager Roger Simpson, 56, from Fowey, Cornwall,
              who was returning from a holiday in New Zealand with his wife, Sue. <br> <br> Mr Simpson said: "This plane is a big step forward. It's quiet and roomy and it's less polluting." <br> <br> Another UK couple returning from holiday in New Zealand were Edward and Val Fielding from Aslacton, near Norwich, in Norfolk. <br> <br> Passengers today were sitting in three classes - first class, which has
              12 luxury suites with 23-inch TV and cinema screens and double beds;
              business class where 60 people can enjoy flat-bed sleeping; and economy
              where nearly 400 passengers have seat-back screens and more room than
              rival aircraft. <br> <br> Singapore Airlines UK and Ireland general manager Marvin Tan said: "The
              arrival of the first commercial A380 flight to London will be a proud
              moment not only for Singapore Airlines but also for British aviation,
              with the magnificent wings of the aircraft made in Broughton, North
              Wales, and Filton, Bristol, and powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 900
              engines." <br> <br> Ian Godden, chief executive of the Society of British Aerospace
              companies, said: "Aerospace is a manufacturing success story in the UK,
              investing over £2.5 billion per year in research and development. <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/A380Spray2G_468x216.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Cooling off: Jets are used to hose down the Airbus after landing</em><br> <br> "Without the contributions from many British and British-based
              companies air passengers around the world would literally not be able
              to get off the ground. <br> <br> "The country should be proud of the enormous contribution that more
              than a quarter of a million UK aerospace workers make to keep the
              global economy moving. <br> <br> "At a time when there is a widely-held perception that Britain no
              longer has much of a manufacturing industry the aerospace sector
              conclusively proves otherwise." <br> <br> Heathrow has spent more than £100 million on new facilities to accommodate the A380 which will be flying in to Terminal 3. <br> <br> The airport's new £4.3 billion Terminal 5, which was officially opened by the Queen last week, can also take the superjumbo. <br> <br> British Airways is due to take the first of its ordered A380s in 2012,
              with Sir Richard Branson's airline, Virgin Atlantic, receiving its
              first superjumbo in 2013. <br> <br> Singapore Airlines now has three A380s. Australian carrier Qantas is
              due to take delivery of the first of its superjumbos this summer, with
              Dubai-based airline Emirates beginning its A380 services from Dubai to
              London on December 1. <br> <br> <br> <br> <em>Source: Daily Mail UK, Mar.18, 2008</em></p>
