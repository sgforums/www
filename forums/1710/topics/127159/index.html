            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Once the second biggest casino gambler in the world, he is serving 42 years in jail for cheating banks of $117.1 million to feed his habit.<br><br>Chia Teck Leng, now aged 45, is against having a casino in Singapore but says if there is to be one, Singapore needs to at least tame it.<br><br>He wrote a paper "Taming the Casino Dragon" while in prison to 'share his experience' and 'lessons learnt'.<br><br>The Home Affairs Ministry is releasing it now - as part of the public education on the casino debate.<br><br>What is the fuss about a criminal's account?<br><br>It was the largest case of cheating involving a Singaporean - the former finance manager of Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd - ended up in jail because he was 'hooked' on gambling.<br><br>He was given time off from prison work to write this 13-page paper - and took about five months till December.<br><br>It is almost academic in tone - informative - introducing words like 'whale' to mean the big players and 'house advantage' for the odds in favour of the casino in the long-term.<br><br>Self-deprecating at times - saying "like an inexperienced teenager succumbing to the lure of a newly discovered vice, I was soon hooked".<br><br>And at others, prescriptive. In fact, without irony, he recommends over 10 'safeguards' to protect Singaporeans from the ill-effects of casino gambling.<br><br>Chia spoke about being accosted by "alluringly colourful lights, attractive croupiers and the magical promise of easy money."<br><br>The turning point came when he lost three-quarters of a million dollars which he had painstakingly saved. To recoup losses, Chia sought bigger bets.<br><br>He travelled to exclusive casinos in Australia and London where he placed million-dollar bets.<br><br>Besides that, Chia gives an insight into just how lucrative the casino trade is, giving the example of just how much operators make in one game - Baccarat.<br><br>His plain message was the casino always wins. - CNA /de</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chia Teck Leng was a pseudo whale....one of the world's biggest mug punters....how dare he claims that he was the world's 2nd biggest punter?<br><br>He was only betting $20,000 on 2 boxes in Black Jack game.<br><br>Casinos are around to make profits and the only reason they allowed him such stakes in Black Jack was b'cos he was the biggest mug punter.<br><br>To play such stakes you've got to at least have some basic knowledge of cards-counting which he obviously he did not have.<br><br>The other Black Jack punter who was allowed to bet $50,000 by 7 boxes is an Australian billionaire who used to play with 30-40 millions US$ front money. He outsmarted a casino in Vegas, winning 40 millions Dollars on one trip and thereafter his stakes were immediately reduced down by all Vegas casinos to $5,000 per box.<br><br>His formula was his two bodyguards who were class one cards-counters from Sydney. His bodyguards were signalling him to play his hands.<br><br>Chia was very fond playing Black Jack in a London most exclusive casino called Aspinalls Club....the late John Aspinal once told me that it was like taking candy from a little kid.<br><br>Whales that I know of in this part of the world are one Australian billionaire, the big boss of Taiwan Bamboo Secret Society, Jakarta's biggest soccer bookmaker, a number of Indonesian billionaires, a few from Thailand, a couple from Malaysia and so many from China that the gaming industry can't keep track.<br><br>These whales favourite game is Bacarrat, and they usually come in with front money of 10-30 millions Dollars, and their bets per hand can go up to 400k.<br></div>
