              <h1>I'm off to China to be with my bride: The food's fresher, living is cheaper... and bins are emptied TWICE a day</h1>
              <p>In just 18 months of marriage, Ken Miller and his bride have found the road to wedded bliss rather rocky.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is their 25-year-age gap, the fact that they live 6,000
              miles apart - not to mention the small matter of neither speaking the
              other's language.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when 70-year-old Mr Miller managed to secure his 46-year-old
              Chinese wife Lei Genxiou a place in his sheltered accommodation near
              Swansea, it seemed they would at last be together - until she was
              refused a visa.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/chinaDM2203_468x335.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/chinaDM2203_468x335.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>'Every old man's dream': Ken Miller, 70, says he's off to China to be with his wife and won't be coming back</em></p>
              <p>So now he is turning his back on Britain and moving to China to be with her ... and he can't wait to get there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Miller will set up home in the south-western Chinese city of
              Nanning, where the couple married in 2006 after meeting on the
              Internet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The quality of life over there is much better than it is here,"
              he said. "The food is fresher, the lifestyle is cheaper, and you get
              your rubbish emptied twice a day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The British have an old-fashioned view of China. It is a great
              place to live. I know of people who have come from Nanning to live
              here, and hated it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"In China, there are 14-lane roads in the middle of town lined with shrubs and trees which are never damaged by vandals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They've got shops that women over here would die for. I am very
              excited about going to live with Lei, and she is too. I have just been
              talking to her on the computer. We have never been closer."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He has visited his bride three times since they married and says he will have no regrets about leaving Britain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recalling a recent visit to Nanning, he added: "We went out to a
              restaurant which served 30 different dishes of food. The bill for seven
              of us was £14, and we drank 35 pints of beer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"So they haven't got an NHS, but on practically every street
              there are doctors and dentists which are open 14 hours a day, seven
              days a week. And yes, they eat dogs there - but we eat deer and
              rabbits."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Miller, who has been married twice before, said they can live
              well off his pensions. "And my wife has a job as a buyer for a
              restaurant so I will definitely be well-fed."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He dismisses anyone who might be tempted to question the basis of their relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"People have said to me that she's just after a visa. I say,
              'Yes, of course she wants a visa. Of course she wants a better life.
              And who can blame her?' But it works both ways - I get companionship,
              so I think it's a fair gamble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"And now she has been refused a visa and we are still together,
              so what does that prove? This is my life and after all my years, I've
              earned the right to do as I please."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Asked if he is nervous about moving to a country without
              understanding the language, he said: "Lei's not taking English lessons,
              and I can't say five words in Mandarin. But when we're together, we
              communicate a lot through touch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I've been around long enough to know I'll get by. You pick up
              the language more easily if you live in a country, and I might take
              some lessons."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their romance began after Mr Miller saw an advert in a local
              newspaper for a dating agency which specialised in matching British
              lonely hearts with Chinese brides.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After paying £300, he was put in touch with Lei and they began communicating via the internet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He described the lifestyle he is seeking abroad with a younger woman as "every old man's dream".</p>
              <p>Describing their mutual attraction, Mr Miller added: "She is
              absolutely gorgeous. She says I'm handsome. But whether or not she
              loves me, I don't know. What is the definition of love anyway? I've
              only got a few years left, so I'm going to China and I'm not coming
              back."</p>
