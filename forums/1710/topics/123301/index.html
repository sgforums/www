            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Getting into the junior college of your choice is a little tougher this year, as students who got their postings on Tuesday found out.<br><br>With a bigger cohort, junior colleges are also making it more competitive as some schools have tightened their admission cut-off points.<br><br>It was a nerve-wracking morning as students islandwide scrutinised the notice boards, checking to see if their names have been included into their school of choice.<br><br>"It's quite competitive. The previous cut off point for AJC was around 9, but this year for science it is 8," said one student.<br><br>"I've been posted to Meridian JC, which is my fourth choice and AJ is my first choice and I got 8 points, which is just nice. It's the school's cut off; I know it's risky but I wish I could get in," another student said.<br><br>"I was surprised by the posting results. I got 8 points after bonus; I guess the competition is stiff," said a third student.<br><br>The reason is that this cohort were all born in 1988, the Chinese year of the dragon.<br><br>When contacted by Channel NewsAsia, at least four junior colleges -- Anderson, Victoria, Hwa Chong and Raffles -- have tightened their admission criteria.<br><br>Still, it did not deter students from choosing to enter the junior colleges.<br><br>"I feel after that we can still proceed to a poly if we choose or continue tertiary education into the university. It does offer more choices. In JCs, it's still like a classroom environment, it's an easier transit for us from secondary school," a student said.<br><br>"In JC, I feel I'll be able to have a higher chance to get into university, so I can get a better job compared to poly, although the choices there are wider," said another.<br><br>According to the Education Ministry, there was a spike in the number of students in the Joint Admission Exercise, from around 45,000 last year to more than 52,000 in 2005.<br><br>That is a jump of more than 16 percent.<br><br>Compared to last year, fewer chose JCs as their first choice; more are also applying to Polytechnics this year than in 2004. - CNA</div>
