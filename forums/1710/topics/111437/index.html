Sentencing will take place next Friday.<br><br>The 19-year-old NSman died during combat survival training on Pulau Tekong last August.<br><br>After 36 days of testimonies from 50 witnesses, January 7 was to be a day for the lawyers to make their closing submissions.<br><br>Lawyers from all sides presented their closing arguments and expected judgment to be adjourned to a later date.<br><br>But 40 minutes later, District Judge Ng Peng Hong returned from his chambers with a judgment.<br><br>The judge found the four army officers guilty of causing the death of Second Sergeant Hu by committing a rash act.<br><br>The verdict comes nearly 10 months after Second Sergeant Hu died after his head was repeatedly held under water.<br><br>This was part of the Combat Survival Training course, designed to prepare trainees for the potential treatment they might receive as a prisoner of war.<br><br>Both Lieutenant Jeff Ng Chin Fong and Lieutenant Divanandhari Chandrasekharan were among those who conducted the training course.<br><br>They were charged with causing death, by holding Mr Hu's head under water and ''digging his nose'' to prevent him from holding his breath.<br><br>Captain Pandiaraj Mayandi, supervising officer of the course, was charged with abetting Mr Hu's death, by instigating the instructors to carry out the training.<br><br>Captain Pandiaraj said he did brief instructors not to immerse trainees' heads in water more than four times, and not to exceed 20 seconds each.<br><br>Warrant officer S. Balakrishnan, who was the course commander, was charged with abetting the instructors, by not stopping them from immersing Mr Hu's head in the water.<br><br>The four accused officers were each also charged with causing grievous hurt to Captain Ho Wan Huo who underwent the same training.<br><br>Mr Ho almost drowned and suffered respiratory distress syndrome after the alleged acts were committed on August 21 at Pulau Tekong.<br><br>On each charge, the men can be jailed for up to two years and fined.<br><br>Sentencing has been scheduled for January 14. - CNA</div>
