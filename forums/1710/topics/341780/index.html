              <p><strong>Public hospitals see 51% jump in couples seeking help to have babies</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The stork looks set to be making more deliveries in the year ahead.
              <br> <br> On average, public hospitals saw a 51 per cent increase in the number
              of couples seeking fertility treatment in the last quarter of this
              year, following the government's enhanced Marriage and Parenthood
              Package unveiled in August.
              <br> <br> But efforts to boost the birth rate may be affected by the current economic crisis.
              <br> <br>According to the "Annual Report on Registration of Births and
              Deaths", the provisional figures for total births this year between
              January and November is 36,437, down from the full year figures of
              39,490 for last year.
              <br> <br>Said Jaslyn and Gary Chong, who became parents of a pair of twin
              daughters on Christmas Eve: "It's a tough ride… We became adverse to
              going for gatherings because we are at an age group where all our
              friends around us are having kids and inevitably you will have someone
              coming up to ask us, why don't you have kids? We were the lucky ones. I
              just hope more can be done to help others because we have been down
              that tough road.
              <br> <br>“If more (help) can be given, that would be great because sometimes
              not necessarily through one attempt you will be successful. Those who
              don't qualify because of age... I think it will be very disappointing
              for them because this group, they want it as much but yet they don't
              qualify." <br> <br> The government had earlier explained that they have capped the age of
              prospective mothers at 40 years old because medical evidence show that
              the success rate of IVF declines sharply after 40.
              <br> <br>Under the enhanced package, the government will co-fund, at a cap
              of S$3,000, the cost of Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART)
              treatments up to three cycles for married women aged 40 and below.
              <br> <br> And the move has clearly sparked interest. </span></p>
              <p><span>KK Women's and Children's Hospital says it has seen a 64 per cent
              increase in cases between September and November compared to the same
              period last year, while the National University Hospital (NUH) saw a 50
              per cent jump.
              <br> <br>Over at the Singapore General Hospital, it was a 41 per cent rise
              between September and mid-December compared to the same period last
              year.
              <br> <br>NUH adds that there has been a 45 per cent increase in first-time
              patients. The number of repeat patients seeking treatment is also up by
              25 per cent. <br> <br> Although these are positive signs, family experts are not expecting the
              replacement rate of 2.1 babies to each eligible female attained in 1976
              to be attained anytime soon.
              <br> <br> The Total Fertility Rate last year was 1.29.
              <br> <br>Despite the economic downturn, the Singapore National Employers
              Federation says companies have not expressed difficulties in meeting
              the leave benefits under the new package.
              <br> <br> Under the Package, the government will fund the additional one month of maternity leave. 
              <br> <br>The Manpower Ministry (MOM) further explains: "The last two months
              of maternity leave out of the four months can be taken flexibly over
              one year, instead of six months, allowing employers and employees to
              mutually agree on an optimal working arrangement that meets the needs
              of both parties."
              <br> <br> Still, some family experts argue MOM should keep its ears to the ground. 
              <br> <br>Said Associate Professor Paulin Straughan, Deputy Head of the
              Sociology Department in the National University of Singapore: “It's
              very important for MOM, for the Ministry of Manpower to perhaps have a
              closed-door session with employers, especially the SMEs, because it's
              harder for them to fill the gaps left right when employees have to take
              time off to care for children. <br> <br> “It's important for us to come to the table and see how we can
              alleviate these stresses cos if you don't help them to cope, employers
              may end up having to take decisions that will not benefit those who are
              pro-family, particularly woman."
              <br> <br>“If they find that they cannot cope with having their female
              employees absent from the office then they choose not to employ women
              and it's very hard to document discrimination. <br> <br> “So rather than wait till these kinds of scenarios occur, I think that
              we have to be upfront, and acknowledge that it is not easy for SMEs
              particularly to manage pro-family policies and to hear their
              constraints, try to come together to work out a scenario where they can
              afford to run a profitable business and concurrently support these
              important social initiatives."
              <br> <br>The National Population Secretariat says there will be no roll-back
              of any of its pro-babies measures, given that the goal to boost
              fertility rate and foster a family-friendly environment is a long-term
              one.
              <br> <br>"The Package is meant for the long-term good of fostering an
              overall family-friendly environment to support Singaporeans in getting
              married, and having and raising children," a spokesperson of the
              Secretariat told Channel NewsAsia. <br> <br> He added that "Under the current economic downturn, it is even more
              important for us to support Singaporeans in family formation." </span></p>
              <p><span>While economic downturns are usually associated with a lower
              birth rate and more stress at the workplace, experts say it could well
              be time for individuals to think about having a more holistic life.
              <br> <br>Said Assoc Prof Straughan: “ If you can afford to scale back from
              over-investment in work, it's good time to invest in the social, get to
              meet people, find the right person, get married and then when the
              economic outlook is more secure, then you are all ready to start your
              family."
