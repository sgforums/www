            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: A participant of the Singapore Bay Run, also known as the SAFRA Sheares Bridge Run &amp; Army Half Marathon, collapsed and died on Sunday morning.<br><br>25-year-old Captain Ho Si Qiu, a platoon commander at the Singapore Armed Forces Officer Cadet School, collapsed at 7am at the end of his 21-kilometre run.<br><br>Medics attended to him within 30 seconds.<br><br>At the medical post, an intubation was performed and when no heart rhythm was shown, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was immediately carried out.<br><br>Captain Ho failed to respond and was sent to the hospital some 20 minutes later.<br><br>The cause of his death is being investigated.<br><br>Organisers of the run have extended their deepest condolences to the family of Captain Ho.<br><br>Organisers said proper safety measures were in place, with 13 medic points set up and over 100 medical personnel deployed.<br><br>Sixteen ambulances, each equipped with defibrillators, were also present.<br><br>Captain Ho's death is the second sudden death from a marathon this year Â– the first athlete who died was 17-year-old Thaddeus Cheong in June.<br><br>As sports participation among Singaporeans is on an up trend, the Singapore Sports Council has already stepped up safety training among its staff.<br><br>Oon Jin Teik, CEO of the Singapore Sports Council, said: "We have to expand this safety awareness to all parties Â– the public, the organisers and everyone concerned with organising mass events and understanding the risks involved.<br><br>"Sports is still very safe and sports is still important to prevent health issues. But at the same time, we are trying to ensure that all aspects are covered."<br><br>The latest casualty comes at a time when the National Sports Safety Committee is due to release its report to the Sports Council.<br><br>The committee is fine-tuning the report to ensure all areas of safety are covered and best measures are implemented.<br><br>The Community Development, Youth and Sports Ministry (MCYS) is also studying a preliminary report that has been submitted by the National Sports Safety Committee and is discussing the findings with relevant sports associations.<br><br>Some 70,000 people took part in the run this year Â– 5,000 more than last year Â– including Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said he was saddened by the death of Captain Ho, but he believed organisers had taken all possible safety measures.<br><br>He said: "As I was running, I noticed there were many ambulances, medical teams and medical equipment. This was one event in which the SAF, I believe, took every effort to make sure the medical cover was present, was available and was able to move into action immediately.<br><br>"At the finish line, he (Captain Ho) was treated by a full medical team, including a doctor. So at this time, it appears that what measures could be taken, were taken."<br><br>- CNA/so<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/296104/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/296104/1/.html</a></div>
