            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The government will be inviting interested casino operators to submit their proposals to build a casino in Singapore.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said this would be done over the next week or so.<br><br>It is a score when it comes to the economy this year, as Singapore's economic growth is expected to grow by 8 to 8.5 percent.<br><br>But plans to build a casino in Singapore are still up in the air.<br><br>He said the government was still evaluating the proposals to have a casino built, although it will be inviting interested parties to submit their proposals.<br><br>Mr Lee was speaking to reporters at the PAP Community Foundation Day held in Sentosa on Sunday.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "(Finally) we have to decide, really, the overall perspective for the whole of Singapore. We have not absolutely quite reached that point yet but I have said in the rally in August, we will ask for proposals and decide whether we want it or we do not want it.'<br><br>If the proposal for a casino is passed, it may be built on Sentosa.<br><br>Mr Lee said he was aware that some portions of the society are still against the idea.<br><br>While the government is monitoring public feedback, some Singaporeans are against having a casino and have collected more than 1,000 signatures in an online petition.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "This is matter where Singaporeans have strong views and some segments of Singaporeans have strong views, and I am not surprised if they want to make their views known, within their rights to do so."<br><br>Turning to the economy, Mr Lee says the outlook for next year is "cautious but optimistic".<br><br>The government expects Singapore's economy to grow between 3 and 5 percent next year.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "I think it is not bad. I do not think next year will be as strong as this year because this year is a rebound, and electronics was very strong in the first half but the outlook as it appears now is not bad. We are not expecting trouble.<br><br>"I think because of the global economy, if it continues to grow, although people expect it would be slower than this year, we should be alright.<br><br>"The region around us is not doing too badly and basically we are doing the right things, so we are prepared for whatever comes."<br><br>Earlier, Mr Lee gave out cheques to charitable organisations.<br><br>Some $740,000 had been raised from ministers-led fund-raising events, of which $340,500 will be donated to the PAP Community Foundation Headstart Fund.<br><br>The fund was set up last year to assist needy families with young children.<br><br>When asked for his comments on the recent bilateral talks between Singapore and Malaysia when Senior Minister Goh visited the Malaysian capital, Mr Lee described it as a "good discussion".<br><br>Mr Lee said: "I do not think it will be a matter which I want to comment publicly and then it will get back to megaphone diplomacy and well, we cannot negotiate through the media.<br><br>"It has to be done privately and we hope that we will be able to get a win-win outcome, but if we cannot, then we will not allow it to affect our overall relationship because both countries agree that we should not hold back on the many areas of cooperation that are open to us which we should allow to proceed." - CNA<br><br></div>
