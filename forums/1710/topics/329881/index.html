              <p>Two nightmare scenarios, two ends of the world. In the first, there is
                  little warning. For maybe a month there would be no sign that life was
                  about to come to an abrupt and nasty end for all living things on
                  Earth. <br> <br> Then, earthquakes would start unexpectedly, alerting geologists that something terrible, unimaginable, was amiss. <br> <br> After a few days, these seismic disturbances would reach catastrophic proportions. <br> <br> Cities would be levelled, the oceans would rise and wash in a series of
                  mega-tsunamis that would attack the world's coasts, killing millions. <br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09/04/article-1052354-02839BA700000578-282_634x423.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <em>Is the end of the world nigh? Doom-mongers fear the consequences of scientists replicating the Big Bang</em><br> <br> The fact that the earthquakes were striking randomly, not along
                  well-known geological faultlines, would be proof that something
                  devastating was afoot. <br> <br> Finally, the end would come, in a disaster of Biblical scale. The Earth would literally start to crack up. <br> <br> Molten lava would wash over the land and the seas would start to boil. <br> <br> Mega-hurricanes would level buildings and forests the world over.
                  Eventually, mountains would crumble as the Earth's crust continued to
                  disintegrate. <br> <br> The fabric of the planet itself would start to disappear, trillions of
                  tonnes of rock, water, air and life sucked into a whirlpool of
                  unimaginable force. <br> <br> From space, our blue-and-white home would appear to vanish down a plughole in a flash of light.<br> At least in this scenario we would have a little time, perhaps, to come to terms with the end. <br> <br> However, a second doomsday scenario is even more terrifying. There would be no warning at all.<br> In an instant - about one-twentieth of a second - the entire Earth would simply vanish from space. <br> <br> Less than two seconds later, the Moon would follow suit. Eight minutes
                  later, the Sun would be ripped apart, followed by the rest of the
                  planets in the solar system and onwards, a wave of destruction caused
                  by a rent in the fabric of space itself, spreading out from our world
                  at the speed of light.<br> Any extra-terrestrials out there would die too, in due course. And there would be nothing technology could do about it. <br> <br> But why should we now be worrying about such possible causes of Armageddon? <br> <br> The answer is a gargantuan machine - the largest, most expensive
                  scientific experiment in history, the 'Large Hadron Collider', to be
                  turned on next Wednesday. <br> <br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09/04/article-1052354-0175F0CE00000578-889_634x452.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <em>Doom? The Large Hadron Collider CMS detector under construction</em><br> <br> Although it was designed to answer the fundamental questions of life,
                  some people have claimed that it could end up destroying the entire
                  cosmos. <br> <br> This gigantic £4 billion-plus atom-smasher has been built under the
                  Swiss-French border near Geneva, and is the most powerful device ever
                  built for probing the secrets of the atom and the forces and particles
                  which make up our Universe. <br> <br> It is a staggering device, occupying a train-sized tunnel 18 miles
                  long, buried 300ft underground, studded with gigantic, cathedral-sized
                  ring-shaped detectors where collisions between packets of 'heavy'
                  subatomic particles, 'hadrons', will take place in the hope that the
                  innermost workings of matter and energy will be revealed. <br> <br> The LHC is, arguably, the most impressive machine ever built by Mankind. <br> <br> But a few people are convinced that it should never be turned on. A
                  lawsuit has been lodged at the European Court For Human Rights by a
                  small group of maverick scientists. <br> <br> They claim there is a small - but not zero - chance that when the LHC
                  is activated it will create either a mini-black hole which would fall
                  into the ground and swallow the Earth from within (scenario one). <br> <br> Or, even more bizarrely, trigger a catastrophic chain reaction in the
                  very fabric of space and time itself, which would rip apart the entire
                  universe like the skin of a bursting balloon (scenario two). <br> <br> Bizarrely, this group, led by a German chemist called Otto Rossler, are
                  using the European Convention on human rights to argue that, should the
                  LHC destroy the entire Universe, it would 'violate the right to life
                  and right to private family life'. <br> <br> In fact, since 1994, when the collider was first mooted by the
                  multi-national European nuclear research organisation (CERN), a small
                  number of doomsayers have claimed that by replicating the conditions
                  pertaining at the start of the universe (Big Bang), about 13,700
                  million years ago, there would be a small but real risk an unstoppable
                  cataclysm would take place. <br> <br> This is not a threat taken seriously by the scientists at CERN. When I
                  visited the place a couple of years ago, to see the collider being
                  built, any mention of mini-black holes and other risks elicited only
                  raised eyebrows and shrugs of derision.<br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09_01/cern9L0309_304x337.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>The
                  Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is an underground accelerator ring 27
                  kilometres in circumference at the CERN Laboratory in Switzerland. It
                  will recreate the conditions at the birth of the universe by smashing
                  protons together at incredibly high speeds</em><br> <br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09_01/cernL0309_304x337.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>The

                  will generate temperatures more than 100,000 times hotter than the
                  heart of the Sun. Physicists hope that under these conditions, the
                  protons and neutrons will 'melt', creatingquarkâ€‘gluon plasma, which is
                  believed to have existed soon after the Big Bang.<br> </em> <br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09_01/cern5L0309_304x337.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Workers

                  each carry the energy of an aircraft carrier travelling at 12 knots. In
                  order to dispose of these beams safely, a beam dump is used to extract
                  the beam and diffuse it before it collides with a radiation shielded
                  graphite target.</em><br> <br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09_01/cern7L0309_304x337.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>A
                  technician walks under the core magnet of the CMS experiment (Compact
                  Muon Solenoid). This will search for the 'Higgs boson'. Peter Higgs
                  suggested that all particles had no mass just after the Big Bang. As
                  the Universe cooled an invisible force field called the 'Higgs field'
                  formed together with the 'Higgs boson'. Any particles that interact
                  with it are given a mass. Scientists hope this experiment will prove
                  the theory.</em><br> <br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09_01/cern2L0309_650x441.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>ATLAS
                  (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) is one of the six particle detector
                  experiments at the Large Hadron Collider. A small group of scientists
                  fear the LHC could create a black hole that would swallow the Earth.</em><br> <br> The LHC was not designed to destroy the universe, of course, but to
                  fill in some of the embarrassingly large gaps that still run through
                  our basic understanding of physics and how the universe works. <br> <br> It could discover, for instance, what most of the Universe is actually made of. <br> <br> The ordinary 'stuff' that we see around us - the atoms and molecules of
                  water, carbon, iron, oxygen and the rest that make up our bodies, the
                  planet Earth, the Moon, the other planets, the Sun and all the stars -
                  actually accounts for only about one part in 25 of the total
                  'ingredients' of the cosmos. <br> <br> Astronomers know that something else, invisible and mysterious, must
                  pervade every inch of space, its subtle gravity affecting the movements
                  of the galaxy. <br> <br> This material - no one really has a clue what it is - has been dubbed
                  'dark matter' and it is hoped that the collider just might shed some
                  light on what it is, perhaps uncovering a new type of particle. <br> <br> Perhaps more embarrassingly, we don't know what it is that gives even ordinary matter its mass. <br> <br> In the 1960s, British physicist Peter Higgs proposed the existence of a
                  new particle, now known as the 'Higgs Particle', which effectively
                  lends 'weight' to the stuff of the universe. <br> <br> So important and fundamental is this hypothetical entity that it has been dubbed the 'God particle'. <br> <br> It is hoped that if Higgs is right, the collider could finally clear up
                  this mystery and, as a result of its super-powerful collisions, traces
                  of this particle could emerge. <br> <br> That alone would, in itself, be justification for a large chunk of that
                  £4 billion outlay. By simulating the Big Bang, it is hoped the LHC will
                  act as a 'universe in a test tube', allowing scientists to examine a
                  whole suite of exotic subatomic particles and forces and to go some way
                  to completing the work started by Einstein and the other giants of
                  20th-century physics. <br> <br> So is there really a chance that the scientists have made a terrible
                  miscalculation and that their new toy could inadvertently kill us all?<br> Happily, the simple answer is no. CERN's scientists have in fact
                  commissioned several safety reviews (such as those that have taken
                  place before other big particle accelerators have been turned on). <br> <br> All have concluded that there is no measurable risk whatsoever. Perhaps
                  the best argument against the LHC doomsday scenario is that cosmic rays
                  - natural high-energy particles from space - smash into the Earth's
                  atmosphere all the time with far, far more energy than will be
                  generated by this machine. <br> <br> If it were possible to create a dangerous black hole by simply bashing
                  atomic particles together, this would have happened naturally long ago,
                  and we wouldn't be here to build this particle accelerator in the first
                  place. So we are safe.<br> In fact, what the scientists at CERN really fear is not the end of the
                  world, but that their machine simply isn't big or powerful enough to
                  uncover anything new - that to probe the deepest secrets of the cosmos
                  they will have to ask for yet more cash to build something on an even
                  greater scale. <br> <br> Either that, or their equations are simply wrong and a whole new approach is needed, despite the billions they have spent. <br> <br> Not a doomsday for Earth, perhaps, but a catastrophe for physics.<br> As for the rest of us, we have to hope that the scientists have done
                  their sums right - and keep our fingers crossed next Wednesday. <br> <br> <em>Source: Daily Mail UK, September 6, 2008</em></p>

              <p>No chance the world would come to an end. It's not biblical at all. According to the bible the world would come to an end a long time after Jesus second coming. No i'm not preaching just that when most people think about the biblical end of time they don't know the bible.</p>
              <p>Anyway perhaps the device would let loose a couple of demons . . . .I read somewhere that the scientists were trying to get a glimpse of another dimension. Something like that with the operation of the device is possible. A gateway to the other side? Hmmmmpppfffffffff . . .Stargate anyone? LOL.</p>
              <p>Funny to think that scientist could build such seemingly advance machine for research purposes while the world is still solely and hopelessly dependant on the extract of dead animal, that is oil.</p>
