            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Crowd packs courtroom for glimpse of accused in Huang Na murder case </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : About a hundred people turned up at the Subordinate Courts on Monday to catch a glimpse of Took Leng How, the man who has been charged with the murder of 8-year-old girl, Huang Na. But many were turned away, as the court was packed.<br><br>Took made a brief three-minute appearance in the dock, wearing the same red polo shirt, dark blue bermudas and slippers that he did last week.<br><br>The Court heard that investigations were not complete yet and the accused was soon led back into police custody.<br><br>That means even Took's lawyer was not able to meet his client to take instructions. Those who didn't make it into the courtroom, however, managed to get a view of Took's parents, who came from Penang.<br><br>They left the court straight after they heard that their son's case would be mentioned again this Friday. Took's father had earlier told Malaysian press that his son was innocent, or he would not have turned himself in to the police. - CNA<br><br></div>
