            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Malaysia wants to attract more conventions and exhibitions - many of which are now being hosted in neighbouring Singapore.<br><br>So it is building a mega convention centre in the southern state of Johor.<br><br>The Persada Johor International Convention Centre will cost more than US$13 million and should be ready in July 2006.<br><br>Convention officials say there is already interest from some 10 countries.<br><br>The Persada Johor International Convention Centre is the first such centre for Johor and the entire southern part of Malaysia.<br><br>Developed and owned by Johor Corporation, the state government's investment arm, it hopes to capture a slice of the growing market for meetings, conventions and exhibitions.<br><br>The state-of-the-art centre incorporates traditional Malay architecture and hopes to be a venue for weddings, concerts and dinners as well.<br><br>With a built-up area of over 24,000 square metres, the two-storey building can accommodate 3,500 delegates.<br><br>It is banking on its proximity to two airports - the Senai International Airport in Johor and Singapore's Changi International Airport.<br><br>But the new kid on the block is not being seen as competition by one of Asia-Pacific's largest convention space - Suntec Centre in neighbouring Singapore.<br><br>Suntec says it is competing with the larger destinations that are known to attract international associations, such as London, Capetown, Sydney and Melbourne.<br><br>Warren J Buckley, CEO, Singapore Suntec International Convention and Exhibition Centre, said, "Here in Singapore, we have 40 different airlines reaching 160 cities. They're looking for (a) safe and secure environment. Singapore can certainly offer that and they're looking for ease of access around the city.<br><br>"Here in Suntec we are connected to 5,000 hotel rooms. It really is a drawing card for international associations. On the other hand, if you are looking for a regional or corporate meeting, I think JB will be a perfect location."<br><br>The Suntec centre, which can host up to 12,000 delegates, holds familiarisation tours as part of its marketing strategy.<br><br>Suntec also says that contrary to criticisms that doing business in Singapore is expensive,<br>accommodation and transport costs for example, are more than competitive, compared with other international venues.<br><br>Mr Buckley said, "Most associations would like to know that they're going to attract a maximum number of delegates and Singapore has a lot going for it. And even if it's not in Singapore, they'll stay longer because they'll use Singapore as a stepping off point to dip their toes in other parts of Asia. That we use as a selling point as well."<br><br>Thus Suntec prides itself as a self-contained convention city that no other venue can match. - CNA</div>
