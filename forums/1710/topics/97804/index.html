Last time during my bmt, we were in this 3 tonner (last time 5 tonner hvent intro yet) going fm BMTC to another part of e island.<br><br>There were 3 tonners in all, my was in e middle. Than suddenly suay suay my tonner broke dwn, instead of waiting for a replacement tonner we were all told to get dwn by e 3sg n get into e last tonner who had stopped as it was behind us.<br><br>E last tonner was already full of recs liao. But e 3sg just said "i dun care hw u all squeeze, i just want every1 to be in there" (pointing to e last tonner)  Just imagine, recs fm 2 tonners all being squeezed into 1 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> E tonner was packed like sardines!</div>

Last time in my camp, there was a driver who crashed his minbus into e drain in e camp compound smemore nt outside as in public area. N suay suay kana seen by another unit CO, die die e other unit CO wana charge him. So my unit MTO n others oso cannot do anything. In e end this poor driver kana sent to DB 4 2 wks.<br><br>Its hard to cover if e damage is serious. If is small like a broken headlamp, than can cover up. Because u need to send e vehicle 4 repair, n e cost can be quite high as in 1, 2 thousand dollars.  Its e SAF who is paying for e repair, n they will sure launch an investigation as to how the accident occurred. So e driver sure kana DB wan.  Thats y gt plp say drivers very easy kana DB!</div>
