            <div class='col-md body'>LONDON : A chemical and biological terrorist attack is a possibility in Britain and a nuclear attack could not be ruled out, a former head of British intelligence said.<br><br>Sir Richard Dearlove, who retired last year as head of the Secret Intelligence Service, said the July 7 bombings that killed 52 London commuters did not amount to a "strategic terrorist event," the Daily Telegraph reported.<br><br>Dearlove, who was taking part in a debate on terrorism arranged by the London law firm Ashurst, said the July attacks on three subway trains and a bus "bore the characteristic of a locally planned and carried-out event".<br><br>However British officials probably had to conclude that "the clock is running on some much more dreadful events that could occur," the former MI6 chief said.<br><br>In the medium to long term, terrorists would have access through the Internet to "some quite frightening dual-use technologies," he said.<br><br>These had not yet been used in the context of terrorism, but Sir Richard thought that they would probably eventually be used.<br><br>"There is no question that bits of al-Qaeda would have been extremely interested in biological weapons technology, chemical weapons technology, radiological devices and, ultimately, nuclear devices," he said.<br><br>Dearlove expressed "some sympathy" for the government's approach to fighting terrorism through legislation, adding that there was "extensive complacency" in Britain about the nature of the terrorist threat.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror reported that all four July 7 suicide bombers were tracked by security services a year before they attacked London.<br><br>But the surveillance operation was ditched after intelligence officers decided there was nothing suspicious about their behaviour, according to sources quoted by the newspaper.<br><br>- AFP /ct<br><br></div>
