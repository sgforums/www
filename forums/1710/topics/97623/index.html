            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : David Yeo, fondly known as the Ah-Beng Idol, is still recovering from the shock of being booted out of Singapore Idol.<br><br>Idol fans, meanwhile, have blamed his surprise exit on a New Paper article, which had singled out and criticised another contestant - but had mistakenly shown David's picture instead.<br><br>The headline screamed "Someone wring Jerry's neck please" - and the article slammed Idol contestant Jerry Ong. The only problem is the picture on the page was David Yeo.<br><br>In fact, there wasn't a single word about David in the entire article - which hit newstands on the same day as the results show.<br><br>So when David - one of the crowd favourites - was booted out - some viewers asked if the article had cost him votes.<br><br>"I don't think it's much of an issue because ultimately people vote in for who they want and not vote out who they don't want so if people have had wanted to vote me in originally, they would have known who I am and that article wouldn't have mattered anyway," he said.<br><br>Despite being devastated after the show, David was still a sport and signed autographs for fans.<br><br>"Originally I had no expectations, I didnt expect to make it this far but I guess being human as I went further- and further, I wanted more and more and I guess that's why I feel disappointed," he said.<br><br>David said he was keeping his singing options open, but for now it is back to studying to be a lawyer.<br><br>As for the remaining eight Singapore Idol contestants, their journey continues with another elimination show on Friday.<br><br>And the prize is now even sweeter - the first Singapore Idol will also compete in World Idol and have the chance to put Singapore on the world map.<br><br>David said: "The whole reality of the situation is still sinking in, but I'm still keeping my options open in regards to singing, music, entertainment but I guess if nothing else happens I will just continue studying law." - CNA<br><br></div>
