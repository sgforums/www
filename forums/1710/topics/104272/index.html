            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Smoking could be banned in more places in Singapore.<br><br>Giving notice to diehard smokers was the Environment and Water Resources Minister Yaacob Ibrahim who told Parliament that the National Environment Agency is studying if bus stops, coffee shops and hawkers centres should be covered by the ban.<br><br>It is rather expensive to have a puff in Singapore, with taxes on cigarettes, one of the few which constantly go up each Budget Day.<br><br>And with feedback from the public, the National Environment Ministry is now studying if, besides indoor places where food is sold and in queues, the ban can be extended to some of the few outdoor areas which smokers can now smoke without breaking the law.<br><br>The call to ban smoking in pubs and nightspots have become louder.<br><br>MPs who spoke on Wednesday emphasised the need to protect passive smokers especially the young.<br><br>And it's because of public feedback on the issue that the Environment Ministry is studying if the ban should be expanded and not just to smoke filled nightspots.<br><br>"I think if smokers can be considerate enough not to blow the smoke in the children's way then you can leave us our space. There is very little space that we have left compared to other countries," said one non-smoker.<br><br>"It's a good idea that they ban smoking in the coffeeshop area, because as a pregnant woman we also patronise this area and the smoke will harm us," said another.<br><br>Cynthia Phua, MP, Aljunied GRC, said: "There are many young children especially in hawker centres and eating houses...It is very easy for a passive smoker to become an active smoker."<br><br>Minister Yaacob told the House that the NEA will study the issues carefully and consult both the public and businesses before taking a decision.<br><br>He said: "We do have evidence to show that non-smokers who are exposed to the smoking environment eventually take up the smoking habit and this is something we want to prevent. We will consult, we will consider all the issues before we move because there are implications."<br><br>He added that businesses will be consulted because they have to be made to understand that the move will not affect them adversely.<br><br>"At the same time we want them to be a responsible partner in the move to encourage people not to smoke and to take up a healthy lifestyle," the minister told the House.<br><br>A coffeeshop stallholder said: "If they ban the smoking in these coffeeshops that will affect our business. All the smokers cannot smoke here. Usually after they have their drinks, they will relax and smoke, then they go, continue their work."<br><br>But then the question of enforcement will arise and what sort of penalties will there be for smokers who decide to light up in these areas. - CNA<br></div>
