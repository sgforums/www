            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who is handling Singapore's negotiations with Malaysia, says both sides should look forward to a cooperative working relationship and not be bogged down by past issues.<br><br>He said this in response to questions from foreign journalists at the Global Entropolis @Singapore event.<br><br>Senior Minister Goh says he will make a trip to Kuala Lumpur by year's end to meet with Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi.<br><br>The last time they met was earlier this year, when Mr Goh was still prime minister.<br><br>Mr Goh said the upcoming meeting would be the first step to make progress on negotiations on the outstanding issues, which include water and the proposed bridge to replace the Causeway.<br><br>Asked if there would be a change in approach to discussions, Mr Goh said Malaysia had earlier signalled its preference to deal on an issue-by-issue basis.<br><br>He said Singapore would accept this approach if it is the preferred option of the Malaysian leadership.<br><br>But Mr Goh reiterated there would not be any negotiation through the media, as agreed with Mr Abdullah.<br><br>As such, he did not want to discuss Singapore's position or expectations, as bilateral talks are a sensitive process.<br><br>"I would not want to negotiate through the press. So I would not give any inkling as to Singapore's position on the negotiations. I would not be signalling to Malaysia through the press on what our expectations are," Mr Goh said.<br><br>Instead, the best way is for Mr Goh to meet Mr Abdullah himself and try to resolve the issues.<br><br>He added both leaders have a warm relationship based on mutual trust.<br><br>This is an important factor, and assured there would be no tricks up their sleeves during the negotiations.<br><br>"I trust him and I hope he trusts me as well. And if we negotiate, if I tell him this is what I can do, this is what I can't do and I propose to resolve it in a certain way, he can be sure that behind what I've offered, there'll be no tricks, there's nothing hidden," Mr Goh said.<br><br>Mr Goh also pressed home the point that ultimately, both leaders would still have to look after their own national interests.<br><br>At the same time, he said it does not make sense for both sides to be bogged down by the outstanding bilateral issues.<br><br>Instead, he expressed hope that Singapore and Malaysia should look forward, as there is much to gain by working together. - CNA<br><br></div>
