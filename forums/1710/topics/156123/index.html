The two businesses may also tie in well together, they added.<br><br>PSC may explore ways to take advantage of Tat Seng's presence and network in China to grow its business.<br><br>Tat Seng, which designs, manufactures and sells corrugated paper packaging products according to customers' specifications, has customers such as:<br><br>Matsushita Electronics;<br><br>Mentor Media;<br><br>Tee Yih Jia Food Manufacturing; and<br><br>KC Dat (Singapore).<br><br>It caters to various industries in Singapore and China, and has a factory in both countries.<br><br>The acquisition will be completed on Oct 18. PSC said it has no intention of taking Tat Seng private.<br><br>For the first half ended June 30, PSC's net profit rose 152 per cent to $2.94 million on the back of an 11 per cent rise in turnover to $83.1 million.<br><br></div>
