              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA)
              is more than halfway done with testing food samples for traces of the
              industrial plastic, melamine.
              <br> <br>Of the more than 2,200 samples, 1,450 have been tested. Moving
              forward, the AVA said it would expand its test on animal feed and pet
              food.
              <br> <br>Some pet owners may not be aware of this, but pet food such as
              doggie treats contain milk and some ingredients used are from China.
              <br> <br>While industry estimates put the proportion of China-made pet food
              at about 5 per cent of total market share, retailers whom Channel
              NewsAsia spoke with are not taking any chances.
              <br> <br>Even though the AVA has not issued any advisories on pet food, one
              company has stopped the import of a doggie treat that is manufactured
              with China-made milk. It estimates a five-figure sum loss but said it
              would rather play it safe.
              <br> <br>The last time reports surfaced on melamine-tainted pet food was in
              March last year when there was a massive recall of China-made pet food
              in the US. Thousands of cats and dogs were reportedly ill, and hundreds
              more were said to have died from eating the tainted food.
              <br> <br> In fact, since the melamine fallout in the US last year, one company has stopped selling pet food made in China.
              <br> <br>Vincent Kok, owner of Petz Evolution, said: "Previously, there were
              some (pet food) from China but some of the distributors have removed
              them, so till now, we have not sold anything made in China."
              <br> <br>Petz Evolution said since the melamine scandal broke out in
              Singapore three weeks ago, it has received about 20 to 30 calls a week
              from concerned pet owners.
              <br> <br> On their part, pet owners are also checking labels to find out where the pet food has been manufactured.
              <br> <br>Some pet food retailers are going a step further to check with
              suppliers and distributors to ensure that the imported products they
              sell do not contain any milk-based ingredients from China.
