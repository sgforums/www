            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : More than five million people visited Sentosa in the past year - a record high in the island's 33-year history.<br><br>Five-year-old Dynes Quek literally left his mark on Sentosa when he visited the island on Good Friday with his family.<br><br>As the fifth millionth visitor, he had his palm print and his name immortalised in the annals of Sentosa's history.<br><br>The little boy also planted his own tree on the island.<br><br>Dynes said, "It's nice! I'd like to come back tomorrow...to see the tree!"<br><br>Dynes' mother, Mrs Jenna Quek, said, "Probably he will come with his girlfriend, to see the plant he planted today. It's a very unusual occasion for us."<br><br>Sentosa Leisure Group said it was on track with its 10-year redevelopment plan, to draw more visitors to the island.<br><br>Mr Darrell Metzger, CEO, Sentosa Leisure Group, said, "Next year and the year after that, I see steady growth. I see us going right along with the overall tourism growth and we penetrate about 25 percent of all the tourists coming to Singapore, and I think we will continue to do that."<br><br>The government is expected to announce its decision on whether to proceed with the integrated resort in Parliament on April 18.<br><br>Sentosa said its growth would not be derailed if it loses out to Marina Bay as the integrated resort site.<br><br>Mr Metzger said, "Even before the concept of an integrated resort was even mentioned, we were seriously negotiating with two potential theme park developers, and that was our original plan. And that's what we will revert to."<br><br>With the opening of a 630-lot carpark on April 1, more visitors can be expected.<br><br>Sentosa said for an escalated growth in visitorship, it would need all its basic infrastructure in place, like the LRT, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2006. - CNA</div>
