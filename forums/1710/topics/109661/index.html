            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : It was the training accident that rocked the Singapore Armed Forces.<br><br>2nd Sergeant Hu En Huai died on August 21 2003 after he was dunked repeatedly into a tub of sea water.<br><br>Another trainee Captain Ho Wan Huo barely survived the dunking.<br><br>Four red berets were charged; the trial will resume on January 7 next year.<br><br>The Combat Survival Training course was designed to prepare trainees for the potential treatment they might receive as a prisoner of war.<br><br>Dunking was one way to make them reveal mission secrets and other details like their rank.<br><br>Both 2nd Sergeant Hu and Captain Ho were attending the course conducted by the Commando Training Wing.<br><br>Captain Ho told the court that whoever dunked him wore gloves which exposed the fingers.<br><br>Lieutenants Jeff Ng Chin Fong and Divanandhari Chandrasekharan were among those who conducted the training.<br><br>Both claim they could not remember dunking 2nd Sergeant Hu and were not involved in Captain Ho's dunking.<br><br>They also said they wore full gloves that day.<br><br>Captain Pandiaraj Mayandi, charged with instigating the instructors, said he briefed instructors not to dunk the trainees more than four times and not to exceed 20 seconds each.<br><br>The captain did not think it was wrong because he went through similar treatment as a Ranger trainee himself.<br><br>2nd Warrant S Balakrishnan said he thought dunking was approved because he learnt it from senior instructors before him.<br><br>Warrant Bala said he was carrying out other duties at the time of the dunkings, and so could not have prevented it.<br><br>A strange twist emerged when Master Sergeant K Rajindran said there were missing photos apart from the ones tendered in court as evidence.<br><br>When interviewed by the Criminal Investigation Department before the trial, Master Raj saw photos which showed an instructor armlocking a trainee. He said another instructor was seen sitting on the back of a trainee.<br><br>But a CID officer, ASP Abdul Halim Osman refuted the claim saying the CID received the negatives the day after Master Raj's interview.<br><br>The trial resumes on January 7 2005, when lawyers will make their final submissions.<br><br>If convicted, the four commandos could face up to 4 years in jail each. - CNA</div>
