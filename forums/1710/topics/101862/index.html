            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : A defence witness may be impeached in the trial of the four commando trainers charged with causing the death of 2nd Sergeant Hu En Huai and the near drowning of Captain Ho Wan Huo.<br><br>The evidence of commando instructor Staff Sergeant Ng Chong Chee is now in doubt after the judge allowed prosecutors to go ahead with the impeachment proceedings.<br><br>Rather than bolstering the case for the defence, Staff Sergeant Ng may have dent it instead.<br><br>The issue centres on Staff Sergeant Ng's own experience as a combat survival trainee in 1995.<br><br>During police investigations in November last year, he had told CID officers that the only water treatment he received was by instructors spraying him with a water hose. But in court he gave a different account.<br><br>Staff Sergeant Ng told the court that in his 1995 course, dunking was done in a water bay and trainees were occasionally sprayed with a water hose at a holding area.<br><br>When challenged by the prosecution on why the different accounts, he said, "I was not told to illustrate what was going on during my Combat Survival Training. What I said in court is more accurate.<br><br>"I was not concentrating on my 1995 CST. I was concentrating to assist the CID on the 80th CST. At the time, I thought the spraying was my water treatment. I was not able to think clearly and was actually quite confused why the CID asked me about my CST."<br><br>Staff Sergeant Ng had also testified that while leading Captain Ho away from the water tub, he had seen one of the accused commandos, Lieutenant Divanandhari walking towards them. - CNA<br><br></div>
