            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Flyers of Singapore Idol finalists Taufik Batisah and Sylvester Sim have been hitting the streets. With just days to go before the finals on December 1, their fans have been stepping up efforts to rally more support.<br><br>Some hard-core Sly fans spend their time drawing and painting while waiting for their Idol.<br><br>They make posters, banners and even folded little hearts to form Sylvester's name.<br><br>"To show our support for Sylvester, we don't need to do anything fanciful for him. We might be doing something simple and we might be saving all the money to vote for him during the finals," one fan said.<br><br>Viewers may have noticed an overwhelming amount of publicity regarding Sylvester, whether it's about his fan base or even his family problems.<br><br>But Taufik's fans say Taufik should not feel left out, as he has the support and backing of his former school, Singapore Polytechnic.<br><br>So if you are travelling along Dover Road, you will come across a 15-metre banner that screams, "Vote Taufik, Singapore Poly graduate!"<br><br>"It's good for us to support our former graduate; but most of all his voice is very good so we must support him," one Singapore Polytechnic student said.<br><br>Taufik's fan base have also spilled onto the streets -- some 20 Singapore Poly students distributed 5,000 flyers to rally the public to vote for Taufik.<br><br>"My strategy is to give out flyers to those teenagers, working professionals and old folks. Basically working professionals have the spending power to vote for him and the teenagers are much more into music," one student said.<br><br>Other fans prefer to show their support by making cards and banners.<br><br>"We are going down to the paint brushes, to the crayons and everything else. It's all with our own hands, will all our sincerity and lots of love for Taufik," one fan said.<br><br>"Like Taufik says, he is going to give more than 100 percent; so are we," another said.<br><br>Indeed the fans are working hard, and only time will tell if all their hard work will pay off. - CNA<br><br></div>
