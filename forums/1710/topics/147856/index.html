            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Home Affairs MInister Wong Kan Seng has warned that those who play pranks on Singapore's public transport system, for example with bomb hoaxes, will be prosecuted - and the penalty will be very heavy.<br><br>In fact, two persons were charged in court on Monday for such a prank.<br><br>Mr Wong left no doubt about the government's uncompromising stand on mischief makers when he replied to questions in Parliament on Monday on Singapore's anti-terror measures.<br><br>Mr Wong said public education on enhancing security in Singapore's public transport system was ongoing.<br><br>And this is not just confined to the MRT trains but also bus interchanges and taxi companies, whose drivers have been trained to identify suspicious persons and articles.<br><br>But there is an ugly side to Singaporeans that needs to be addressed.<br><br>Ms Irene Ng, MP for Tampines GRC, said: "There has been instances where the MRT services were disrupted because suspicious parcels were found, but they were found out to be litter left behind by Singaporeans."<br><br>Mr Wong said: "They may not just be considered a lost item, but if the item looks suspicious, it may even cause inconvenience to other travellers, and I would urge them to be very careful about leaving any parcel behind.<br><br>"Even on the MRT itself, there are posters advising commuters to look out for such items. And when they see such posters I hope they also will be reminded that they should not leave such items behind, they cause suspicion."<br><br>Mr Wong said there had been instances when people call up and make bomb hoaxes. They were caught and sentenced to long-term jail sentences.<br><br>For example, a disgruntled SMRT staff who left a suspicious parcel under a train seat, was caught on closed circuit TV - and he is now in jail for three-and-a-half years.<br><br>Mr Wong said: "Under the current situation and the threat we are facing, we will not look kindly on anyone who wants to cause such a prank."<br><br>Turning to air transport security, he said Singapore was pursuing agreements with foreign authorities prepared to accommodate air marshals on selected flights.<br><br>Mr Wong said: "You can have the best of systems, the best of procedures, the best of equipment. Ultimately, it must depend on the person who implements those procedures, who executes those measures and screens the passengers, and that is the part we pay attention to. And when we find airports that we are lacking, we will also pay particular attention to them."<br><br>Parliament was also given an update on the enhanced security at SAF camps.<br><br>New technology has been introduced, including intrusion detection devices and equipment to screen visitors and vehicles.<br><br>Mr Teo Chee Hean, Defence Minister, said: "The 'hardware' measures put in place at our SAF facilities include the installation of intrusion detection devices along security fences and the use of CCTVs to enhance the monitoring of remote places.<br><br>"These are complemented by guards who make frequent patrols to provide added deterrence. These patrols are deliberately executed at irregular intervals so as not to make the routine predictable.<br><br>"X-ray machines and walk-through metal detectors are also employed to screen visitors and servicemen prior to entry. Physical searches by security personnel may also be enforced. Vehicles are also subject to inspections by undercarriage mirrors and cameras, and explosives-trained sniffer dogs."<br><br>He added that to avert the possibility of vehicles charging in at high speeds into SAF facilities, barriers have been erected to deny vehicles a straight run towards a facility.<br><br>At key installations, mechanical retractable bollards and rising kerbs have also been installed and can be activated by security personnel, should an unauthorised vehicle attempt to barge into an SAF facility.<br><br>Security awareness programmes have also been instituted throughout the SAF, including among new recruits. - CNA/de</div>
