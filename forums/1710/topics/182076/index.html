            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The People's Action Party (PAP) expects to introduce its slate of some 20 new candidates "in a couple of weeks", says party chairman Lim Boon Heng.<br><br>He also welcomed contests in the upcoming General Election, which he says will give the people a chance to express their support for the MPs - "something like a referendum on their performance".<br><br>At a separate event on Sunday, six PAP MPs were at a morning walkabout in the five-member Aljunied GRC - with hints of possible changes to the PAP's ticket there.<br><br>Residents say they are also looking forward to a contest in the GRC.<br><br>It was a warm welcome for Marine Parade GRC MP Lim Hwee Hua at Kovan Market, in the very heart of Aljunied GRC.<br><br>Her Serangoon Gardens constituency is now part of Aljunied, after the release of the boundaries report.<br><br>Mrs Lim says: "I think the profile, the likes and dislikes, are fairly similar so the integration will not be a problem at all. In terms of the draw to food, good wet market stalls and patterns of hanging out and drinking tea - they are very, very similar."<br><br>But as the six MPs went about their morning walkabout in the five-member constituency, the question being asked was - who will be fielded out of this GRC?<br><br>Mr George Yeo, Foreign Affairs Minister and MP for Aljunied GRC, says: "Let us not assume Madam Cynthia Phua will be leaving us, let us not assume Dr Ong is leaving us, that's why all six MPs are here this morning, but I expect Mrs Lim Hwee Hua to come.<br><br>"I don't know which among us will go across. The Prime Minister is keeping his cards close to his chest so we don't really know how the candidates will be deployed. We will know when the time comes."<br><br>Ms Cynthia Phua, MP for Aljunied GRC, says: "Based on the electoral boundary, with Serangoon coming over, most of the GRC's boundaries are intact except the Kembangan side."<br><br>A third of Dr Ong Seh Hong's ward or 8,000 voters in Kembangan is now part of Marine Parade GRC - but is that a sign that he could move over?<br><br>Dr Ong, MP for Aljunied GRC, says: "Only until Nomination Day will we know the final outcome. I would say I would not like to speculate. My point is the same, I will continue to stay focused and serve my residents."<br><br>The PAP MPs also welcomed the opposition's plan to contest up to 57 of the 84 parliamentary seats.<br><br>Mr Yeo says: "It is good for Singaporeans to have the opportunity to vote. It is never satisfying when you have a walkover and I think voters would like to exercise their right to vote and allows us to enable voters to have that choice, and we welcome it."<br><br>He says it is no surprise that the Workers' Party has set its sights on Aljunied GRC, like it did in the previous election in 2001. The WP was disqualified after filling up the forms wrongly on Nomination Day.<br><br>But this time round, Mr Yeo is looking forward to a contest while residents are also looking forward to the chance to vote.<br><br>"We did not vote the last time round, so this time we can assess how the MPs have performed and decide."<br><br>"Whether I prefer the PAP or the opposition, I am given the chance to vote, so I am happy."<br><br>So all eyes will be on who is standing where and when will the elections be called? - CNA/de</div>
