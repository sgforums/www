            <div class='col-md body'>30 sen hike in fuel prices: Consumers caught by surprise<br><br>"Simply too much." This was the reaction from Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) president Marimuthu Nadason when asked to comment on the 30 sen fuel increase, effective today.<br><br>The price hike for petrol and diesel is 30 sen per litre, while for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is 30 sen per kilogramme.<br><br>In a Bernama report yesterday, a statement from the Prime MinisterÂ’s Office also said the price increase was to counter impact from the increase in the price of crude petroleum in the world market, and curb the increase in subsidy borne by the Government.<br><br>Marimuthu said the increase would cause other sectors to hike prices of their products.<br><br>"Like in the previous fuel price hike, there will be a chain reaction. Expect to see price increase in transportation, hotel, food and beverages and construction industries as they will be affected by this," he said.<br><br>"Consumers will suffer the most. We were not aware of this (price hike) as there was no prior discussion with the consumers associations.<br><br>"The Government should have instead, made the public aware and prepare for it, and not just make some announcement at midnight."<br><br>Selangor and Kuala Lumpur Lorry Operators Association secretary-general Alvin Choong said even the present diesel subsidy for commercial vehicles was not enough.<br><br>"Besides, not all lorries are subsidised. The non-subsidised ones are the cement mixers and those carrying construction materials.<br><br>"We are sending a memorandum to Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak by next week, and also appealing to the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to consider our plight.<br><br>"We are left with no choice but to review our charges," he said.<br><br>Malaysian Taxi, Limousine and Hired Cars Association president Yusof Lahir said the increase in taxi fare was of no use because of the fuel hike.<br><br>The hike is definitely a burden, especially for those whose vehicles run on petrol as there is no subsidy for such taxis.<br><br>"We are hoping the Government will consider subsidising taxis that run on petrol in the Klang Valley."<br><br>Earlier, in a statement released by the Prime MinisterÂ’s Department, the Government gave the assurance that it would not be raising the prices of petroleum retail products anymore this year following this latest hike.<br><br>The last time the prices were increased was on July 31, 2005, where petrol price was pushed up 10 sen per litre, diesel price 20 sen per litre and five sen per kg for LPG.<br><br>The statement also said that the prices of petrol and diesel in Malaysia were still low compared with other Asean countries, except Brunei.<br><br>Bernama reported that the Government has also introduced the provision of subsidised diesel to 84 per cent of vehicles that use diesel in the land transportation sector comprising operators of public transportation and consumer products services through the Fleetcard.<br><br>Through the Fleetcard, they can buy subsidised diesel at petrol stations where the cost of fuel is 15 sen less than the stipulated price. - The Malay Mail 28/02/06</div>
