            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore's plans to build two integrated resorts entered the next phase on Friday.<br><br>The Singapore Tourism Board has started inviting selected resort operators to submit firm proposals.<br><br>The final shortlist has not been revealed, but those which made it to the list include South Africa's Peermont Global and Sun International, Bahamas-based Kerzner, US Harrah's Entertainment and Malaysia's Genting Berhad.<br><br>Australia's PBL - which partnered Macau tycoon Stanley Ho for its bid - is also in.<br><br>Australia's TabCorp would not comment, while Wynn Resorts, MGM, Las Vegas Sands and Eighth Wonder could not be reached.<br><br>It has not even been a week since the government gave the go-ahead for the integrated resort project in Singapore - but already the spotlight has been turning to the bidders, and who would be shortlisted.<br><br>One by one, the STB has been in touch with parties which submitted concept proposals.<br><br>For Hong Kong's New Century Group, it was an early end to the race.<br><br>The Hong Kong vessel chartering and property investment firm says its proposal has not been accepted.<br><br>Meanwhile, another small player, Macau's Greek Mythology, would only say it had yet to receive any answer.<br><br>But some of those who have made the cut wasted no time in sharing the good news.<br><br>South Africa's Peermont Global and Sun International, Bahamas-based Kerzner, US Harrah's Entertainment and Malaysia's Genting Berhad have all come out to say that they are still very much in the game.<br><br>These are the firms which have promised to bring in the likes of Universal Studio theme parks - and will invest billions to make the Singapore resort their flagship in the region.<br><br>Analysts say that the race will be intense.<br><br>Tony Raza, Head of Research, Merill Lynch, said, "They are all trying to add something that is very creative, iconic, something that raises eyebrows and creates a lot of interest in their project. So on that front, everyone is bidding aggressively on what they can add in to their proposals, but (the) bottomline line is they are also very aggressively in funds committed to this project."<br><br>The guidelines for the firm proposals are expected to be issued before June 30.<br><br>The deadline for the final submission has not yet been announced.<br><br>But the successful bids will only be unveiled in December. - CNA/ms</div>
