            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: A comprehensive review of speed limits on Singapore's roads will be completed by the end of the year, and cameras in Geylang to help control vice were some of the other issues raised during the debate on the Home Affairs Ministry's budget.<br><br>Kudos to the Traffic Police, say MPs, for stepping up enforcement of speed limits on Singapore's roads.<br><br>Though some felt the manner in which enforcement was done, could be improved.<br><br>MP for East Coast GRC Tan Soo Khoon said, "Working on the premise that the traffic police now understand that prevention is better than cure, I suggest that the TP also use this approach when dealing with the problem of drinking driving which we all know is very serious. I think the problem of drink driving will drop dramatically, if police show their faces around the carparks of our popular nightspots. It might be good idea if they conduct a breathalyser test before the drivers drive off. Maybe you could even set up a booth or table and charge them for the test."<br><br>Mr Tan also mentions drink driving is also another area where traffic police have raised the level of enhancement, and as for his point whether traffic police should mount operations before they drive off.<br><br>"I think a better solution is to work with nightspot operators and this has been ongoing, night spot operators, pub operators, I know many of them actually have this device outside their pub and it's a good think so the patrons are encouraged to test themselves," added Mr Tan.<br><br>Many also called for review of the speed limits.<br><br>Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Assoc Professor Ho Peng Kee, said this will be completed by the end of the year and speed limits should be raised on some 40 roads.<br><br>Limits would also be reviewed monthly instead of every 3 moths.<br><br>But he cautioned that speeds limits in some areas would have to stay within 50 km per hour.<br><br>"For our roads and residential areas and industrial estates, we should be careful about raising the speed limits from the current 50. Because this is where Singaporeans and work and a sense of safety will be impacted if we do that," said Assoc Professor Ho.<br><br>But the use of cameras by the police is not just confined to monitoring speed limits on roads.<br><br>It is also being used to enhance the sense of public safety and security for residents and businesses, like the CCTVs being installed in different parts of the island.<br><br>The latest will be in Geylang as part of the strategy to deal with vice.<br><br>Home Affairs minister Wong Kan Seng said, "It's no different from the kind of camera you see in little or boat quay or in newton. I think for Singaporeans they are more concerned about security and safety that for privacy. I'm not saying they are not concerned about the intrusion on privacy. Let me assure Singaporeans that police will not intrude in their privacy of it has nothing to do with a law and order problem."<br><br>"I've received reports from my grassroots and residents that there are these women in coffeeshops for example. Mind you, some of the uncles don't seem to mind very much, but the aunties are really very upset about it. But I think the main concern here is really, we are an open society and obviously we don't want to discourage people from coming here because we need to develop our tourism industry. But at the same time there will be people who abuse the privilege." Saud Indranee Rajah, GPC Chairman for Home Affairs and Law, and MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC.<br><br>Mr Wong said that Joo Chiat now has a community watch group which has helped improve the situation there and said 5200 female foreigners were arrested for vice last year, and the ministry will continue to step up enforcement.<br><br>Minister Wong also addressed concerns of MPs of a growing number of synthetic drug abusers.<br><br>"Synthetic drug abusers continued to form the majority of drug abusers arrested at 56%, while heroin abusers formed only 12%. This is the second year since 2003 that synthetic drugs have displaced heroin as the main drug of abuse in Singapore. Before we become unduly alarmed, I would like to assure the House that in absolute terms, the number of synthetic drug abusers fell by 46% from 980 in 2003 to 532 last year. The number of heroin abusers fell by an even larger percentage of 80% from 567 in 2003 to 111 last year," said Mr Wong.<br><br>Mr Wong said the Singapore Prison Service will soon be introducing a DRC treatment regime for 1st and 2nd time synthetic drug abusers.<br><br>And when that's introduced, those who fail to change after 2 DRC admissions and are caught the 3rd time could face a long imprisonment term. - CNA</div>
