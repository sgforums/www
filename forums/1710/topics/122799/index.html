            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore's demand for water has grown nine times since the 1950s to 300 million gallons a day.<br><br>This is enough water to fill 500 Olympic-sized pools.<br><br>And it is estimated that in 10 years, water consumption will be a fifth more than today's.<br><br>Ahead of a ceremony to mark the construction of Singapore's reservoir in the city, Channel NewsAsia finds out how the marina barrage will help the island cope with an increasing demand for water.<br><br>Rain has been the traditional source of water in Singapore for many years, but with limited land and an ever growing demand for more water, new sources need to be found.<br><br>One way is the construction of the Marina Barrage.<br><br>In January this year the PUB awarded the contract to build the $226 million barrage - which will become Singapore's 15th reservoir.<br><br>When completed, the Marina Barrage will enlarge the country's water catchment from half to two-thirds of the island, adding 10,000 hectares of catchment area.<br><br>It will turn the Kallang Basin, Marina Bay and the Marina Channel into a fresh water reservoir.<br><br>Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Minister Mentor, said: "At that time in 87, PUB told me we cannot use the water because it is highly, the catchment is the city itself and water will be too highly polluted with all kinds of microns.<br><br>"I was fairly optimistic that given time because of the growing demand for water worldwide especially in cities, there would be research to find a way to filter highly-polluted urbanised waste. This comes sooner then I expected."<br><br>Mr Tan Gee Paw, Chairman of PUB, said: "Today we can handle anything that concerns water. From rain water to used water to salted water to NEWater and we take care of all of them because we are integrated this way.<br><br>"We can use technologies that cut across the various part of the water cycle, optimise it and produce water that is in the most cost effective manner."<br><br>Mr Lee added: "It is important that our people understand that this is a precious resource for us as we are going to need and we want it at the lowest cost. And not only that, we can then enjoy the aesthetic environment. We'll have a reservoir within the cityÂ…..it is right within the city, the crowds are there. So it is a tremendous asset."<br><br>The 350-metre barrage will also act as a tidal barrier to control flooding in the city.<br><br>It will also be a playground for those with an affinity for water.<br><br>For more on Singapore's water resource management and the Marina Barrage, catch the first of a two-part documentary series "Reservoir in the City" on Sunday on Channel NewsAsia at 8.30pm. - CNA</div>
