            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Big industry customers of electricity are apparently concerned about the rising incidence of voltage dips in Singapore's power supply.<br><br>This what the Energy System Review Committee found in its review of the gas and electricity system.<br><br>The committee, which was tasked to investigate the cause of the power outage on June 29 last year, had announced its findings on Thursday.<br><br>Since 2002, incidences of voltage dips in the PowerGrid have been growing steadily.<br><br>And according to the Energy System Review Committee report, last year saw a significant jump in voltage dips caused by PowerGrid - which are momentary falls in the voltage level of the electricity system.<br><br>And this raised concerns among big electricity customers about the quality of power supply in Singapore - although they are generally satisfied with the reliability of the grid.<br><br>Large power customers - including pharmaceuticals, chemical and semi-conductor firms - are least tolerant of voltage dips.<br><br>They have operations and machines that are so sensitive, that a fall in voltage - even for a split second - can cause damage and throw production processes into disarray.<br><br>The Committee has noted that some of the causes of voltage dips are not necessarily within the control of PowerGrid.<br><br>It has recommended that a measure of service quality be set up, with rewards and penalties to ensure consistently good power supply.<br><br>The Committee also fully supports a proposed incentive scheme by the Energy Market Authority, which will set penalties for PowerGrid based on the average performance for voltage dips over recent years.<br><br>It is also recommending a review of the spot price mechanism - which could penalise unrealiable operation and reward reliable and reserve generation of power.<br><br>Peter De Wit, president (Asia), Shell Gas and Power, said, "One example is the electricity price, where we saw a huge increase in that, during the blackout on 29 of June, from 80 dollars per megawatt hour to 4,500 dollars. That was a very sizeable increase. It does show that people will react to that, and make decisions about investments, on otherwise, based on financial inducement."<br><br>The current price market cap is S$4,500.<br><br>The committee feels that a higher price ceiling will encourage future capacity investment by industry players. - CNA</div>
