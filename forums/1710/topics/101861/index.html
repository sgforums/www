            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Somewhere in Singapore, two private-estate owners are keeping a tiger and a bear as pets. And the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) is determined to hunt them down.<br><br>The Society has received four tip-offs about a full-grown tiger being kept in the basement of a house in the vicinity of Sixth Avenue and a caged Malayan sun bear in a house around the Mandai area.<br><br>Now, Acres is offering a $1,000 cash reward for information leading to the successful confiscation of either animal.<br><br>The people who tipped Acres off were the owners' friends who have "seen the animals around".<br><br>"But they are unwilling to give us the exact address as they do not want their friends to get into trouble," said president of Acres Louis Ng.<br><br>The Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) said it had also heard from a few sources about someone who has been keeping a tiger for 10 years, but was unable to proceed with investigations without specific information.<br><br>AVA views the illegal keeping of dangerous wild animals seriously and urges anyone with information to contact AVA immediately, as these wild animals may endanger their owners, neighbours and the public.<br><br>"They may attack and kill humans even without provocation. They are wild and not suitable to be kept as pets," said the head of AVA's Wildlife Regulatory Branch, Ms Lye Fong Keng.<br><br>Acres is also concerned about the welfare of the tiger and sun bear as it is impossible to house wild animals in optimal conditions in captivity.<br><br>"The guy who tipped us off said his friend's bear was well-kept in a cage. It can't possibly be well-kept because these Malayan sun bears, being good climbers, are supposed to be sleeping in trees," said Mr Ng.<br><br>A person found to possess an illegal Cites specimen may be fined up to $5,000 ($10,000 for a repeat offender) and/or jailed up to a year.<br><br>A person who keeps a wild animal without a licence from AVA can also be charged under the Wild Animals and Birds Act, which carries a maximum penalty of $1,000 per animal.<br><br>Anyone with information can call the Acres Wildlife Crime Hotline at 9783 7782 or AVA at 6227 0670. - TODAY<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NOW<br><br>SINGAPORE: A tiger spotted in Sixth Avenue? An incredible story?<br><br>Well, not, according to animal rights group ACRES whose volunteers have been pounding the streets in the area after it got tip-offs that a tiger was being kept in captivity in a home there.<br><br>Going from house to house, braving excitable dogs and non-responsive owners, the volunteers from the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) want to create awareness among Sixth Avenue residents about the possibility of a tiger being kept in captivity in the area.<br><br>The reward for giving information about the tiger? $3,000.<br><br>As for the tiger search, the AVA says it will only come in to take action once there is specific information on the location of such a tiger.<br><br>ACRES says it believes the tiger may be full-grown and may have been kept there for about 10 years - possibly in the basement of a house.<br><br>Louis Ng, ACRES president, said: "We are quite worried for the tiger because if it is being kept in a basement, he probably has cataract and hasn't seen sunlight for a while."<br><br>But how does one spot a tiger? Other than tip-offs, ACRES hopes to rope in an ex-tiger keeper.<br><br>Mr Ng said: "He might be able to hear something. Plus, the tiger's urine is very pungent, so we might be able to smell and hear something."<br><br>But with a few hundred households in the Sixth Avenue area, the going was slow, especially with only five ACRES volunteers working, as anything above that, the group says, would constitute unlawful assembly.<br><br>However, many residents Channel NewsAsia spoke to were sceptical about a tiger being kept in a house, although a few admitted it could be a possibility in one of the bigger houses.<br><br>"I don't think so, because surely the person concerned has a maid, and the maid will pass the word around," said a resident.<br><br>"I don't think anyone would keep a tiger as it's pretty dangerous, but there are a few houses around there that would be big enough (for a tiger)."<br><br>ACRES said AVA officers had gone to a specific location in Mandai to search for another illegally-kept exotic pet, a Malayan sun bear, which they hoped to rescue.<br><br>But the search had come up empty. - CNA<br><br></div>
