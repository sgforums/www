            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan is leaving Tanjong Pagar GRC to lead the PAP team in Sembawang GRC.<br><br>He is taking over from former Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan who is retiring from politics and will not be standing at the upcoming General Election.<br><br>Mr Khaw also announced plans for a possible new general hospital in Woodlands to complement the yet-to-be constructed Yishun General Hospital.<br><br>Dr Tan praised Mr Khaw, saying that he had shown his mettle in fighting SARS and handling the NKF issue.<br><br>After 28 years in Sembawang since its days as single member ward, veteran Dr Tan says he will still continue to be involved in Sembawang GRC.<br><br>Dr Tan says: "Sembawang has a special place in my heart. I am happy that I am going to leave Sembawang in the capable hands of Khaw Boon Wan and I am confident that he will be able to keep up the very high standards."<br><br>Mr Khaw says Dr Tan has offered his support during campaigning, something that he would gladly accept.<br><br>The Health Minister says he feels lucky to be selected as Dr Tan's successor and already felt welcome in Sembawang.<br><br>He says a replacement for his position in Moulmein has not been identified yet.<br><br>Mr Khaw says: "Dr Tan is fit, healthy and he can go on for many more years in politics, but in the spirit of party renewal, he decided first to retire from cabinet and soon from parliament.<br><br>"He will of course leave behind a giant pair of shoes and I will not try or make any attempt to fill those shoes. I will be uncomfortable in it, I will walk my own shoes and hopefully in due cause, be able to add some value to the GRC."<br><br>Tentative plans for Mr Khaw's transfer had been afoot for a few weeks, but were not definite until a few days ago.<br><br>Mr Khaw says his immediate priority is to get to know residents better and meet with MPs to plan a campaign strategy.<br><br>He expects some new faces on his team, including at least one female candidate - right now, it's a six-man team.<br><br>Also on the slate might be Dr Lim Wee Kiak, a newly-announced PAP candidate who has been doing grassroots work in Marsiling for the past eight years and whom Mr Khaw says would be an asset to his team.<br><br>Dr Lim says: "This is home ground, this is the place where I grew up and I know very well and most of the grassroots leaders are my friends as well."<br><br>Even though he has not yet faced an election battle, Mr Khaw says he is ready for one should the opposition choose to contest his GRC.<br><br>Mr Khaw says: "I don't care whether it's strong or weak, all opposition, you just have to deal with them as it is. I take battles seriously and I don't take any votes for granted, you have to go and convince the voters, if they are still not yet convinced, why they should support our team."<br><br>Mr Khaw says one of the issues raised by Sembawang residents is healthcare and in view of Singapore's growing and aging population, he is considering the construction of another new general hospital in the north, in addition to Yishun General Hospital.<br><br>It could be located on a site in Woodlands near the MRT station.<br><br>So in the next decade or so, the piece of land might see a full service hospital with up to 500 beds. - CNA/de</div>
