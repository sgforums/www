            <div class='col-md body'>They wanted to increase entry toll charges sometime back as well but held back on that. They must know that Singaporeans going in also spend on other things like food, entertainment, lodging, etc. These activities also inject money into their economy.

            <div class='col-md body'>but still they have locals to think about. if fuel is the main incentives visitors are pouring into msia for, then petrol price will most likely increase, and that is not a good thing for the local economy, putting fuel grabbing visitors' money aside.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kipnosky:</div><div class="quote_body">They wanted to increase entry toll charges sometime back as well but held back on that.

            <div class='col-md body'>the singapore side 3/4 tanks rules prevent singapore from abusing the subsidised petrol - like topping up over there to use in singapore.<br><br>Singapore cars actually use the subsidised petrol to travel around Malaysia only for their hoildays .... So any move to do anything stupid about it will result in instant sharp drop of cars going into malaysia.  Combine with high crime rates and new IR and other development in singapore which is already putting people off to visit malaysia - thus the impact will be great !!!</div>
