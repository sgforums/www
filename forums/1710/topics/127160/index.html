            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : A casino wins on many levels, according to former high-roller Chia Teck Leng.<br><br>First, it is simply a commission earner.<br><br>Second, unlike a gambler, it does not take risks and in fact - always makes sure it wins with a house advantage.<br><br>Chia, former finance manager of Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd, was sentenced to 42 years' in jail.<br><br>He pleaded guilty to cheating four banks out of $117.1 million to fund his high-stakes gambling habit.<br><br>Chia, now aged 45, wrote a paper "Taming the Casino Dragon" while in prison to 'share his experience' and 'lessons learnt'.<br><br>The Home Affairs Ministry is releasing it now as part of the public education on the casino debate.<br><br>Chia gave an example of how much a casino with 2,000 local and 2,000 foreign regular punters can make in the game of Baccarat.<br><br>If a local Baccarat player bets an average of $100, and sits four hours at the table, he would end up playing 48 times and spending $4,800.<br><br>If he goes to the casino twice a week, his annual spending would be $499,200.<br><br>The casino makes 2.5 percent on that, so $12,480 a year.<br><br>For a foreign punter, his average bet could be $2,000.<br><br>Assuming the same play time, he could spend $1.15 million a year.<br><br>The casino gets 2.5 percent at least - regular players get rebate, but the house still gets about $16,128.<br><br>So even without doing anything, the casino gets money every time someone bets, and even when someone steps in - in the form of entrance fees.<br><br>It will make $20 million from 2,000 locals based on entrance fees of $10,000 each.<br><br>The casino will also generate $25 million from the annual potential wins of 2,000 local punters, and $23 million from the annual potential wins of 2,000 foreign punters. - CNA /de</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes... casinos have very sophisticated risk management strategies, such that they calculate probabilities of winning each game at each table... it is in such detail...<br><br>anyway, casinos always run on averages... if they do not have enough of the population coming in, their probabilities don't work so well anymore... that's why sometimes u see casinos offering free cruise trips or accommodation just so u can play at their casinos... they need the huge customer base<br><br>as individual gamblers, we may win sometimes, lose sometimes... but casinos, with the right sample size, will always win on average</div>
