            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : A woman who had been accused of throwing her day-old baby down a rubbish chute walked free on Friday.<br><br>Prosecutors had applied for the charges of infanticide against her to be dropped, which the courts allowed.<br><br>On February 27 this year, a day-old baby girl was found dead in the rubbish chute of a block of flats in Toa Payoh.<br><br>Standing accused of her death was the baby's mother - 23-year-old undergraduate Koh Kailin.<br><br>Koh was charged with the rarely heard of offence of infanticide - which only applies to a woman who causes the death of her child under a year old.<br><br>An autopsy report has since found that the infant had died in the mother's womb at about 5 to 6 months of gestation.<br><br>After Koh gave birth, the body was then placed in a plastic bag and thrown into the common rubbish chute from the 18th floor of the block.<br><br>Koh, who is believed to be a Singapore Management University final year student, was said to be under duress, and not fully recovered from childbirth at the time of the incident.<br><br>On Friday, her neighbours said they have not yet seen her since her release.<br><br>One neighbour said, "My impression of her is that she is very friendly. When we meet her, she will say hi."<br><br>Another commented, "She is like a good girl. I don't think she will do such a thing." - CNA/ms</div>

No one is born freed of the condemnation from a scarred conscience and a badly disfigured self-esteem especially after being deluded beyond hopes by a once-beloved man.<br><br>Hence, I applaud the decision made by the high court in not convicting a victim but to extend grace and mercy to another scarred soul.<br><br>A death of a foetus is one life lost but the purposeful destruction of another human life should not be advocated.<br><br>Let's not judge again on a sentence that has been passed?
