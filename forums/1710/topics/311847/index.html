              <p>Passengers who use Heathrow are being put at risk because air traffic
                  controllers are having to cut corners, a whistleblower claimed last
                  night.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They come under such pressure to keep planes moving that aircraft are put on collision courses, he said.</p>
              <p>In one case a BMI jet landing at Heathrow allegedly came within 20 seconds of hitting one from Air France.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_03/jetsG3107_468x226.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_03/jetsG3107_468x226.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>A whistleblower says air traffic controllers 'cut corners' to ensure planes are kept moving at Heathrow</em></p>
              <p>The BMI service was due to land first but the Air France was given permission to turn into the runway instead.</p>
              <p>The whistleblower said the planes were only a few hundred feet apart when evasive action was taken.</p>
              <p>Heathrow handles 240,000 landings a year and 62million passengers and is at 98 per cent capacity.</p>
              <p>The former controller, who retired through ill health in February, spent most of his 27 years' service there.</p>
              <p>One of his final duties was to compile a report into potential safety breaches last year.</p>
              <p>Last night he leaked the 33-page dossier, which detailed 12 incidents, to the BBC.</p>
              <p>The report said: "A premium on optimum air traffic control performance
                  ... has encouraged controllers to implement inappropriate plans of
                  action and continue with them after it has become clear they cannot be
                  satisfactorily executed".</p>
              <p>The whistleblower later told the BBC: "In some areas we are throwing
                  away some of the safeguards because it is the easiest way of moving the
                  aeroplanes. I believe you call that cutting corners."</p>
              <p>National Air Traffic Services confirmed the whistleblower's report was
                  commissioned by them and admitted some controllers have been given
                  extra training and advice.</p>
              <p>But it dismissed his concerns as "his opinion".</p>
              <p>In a statement, Nats said it had identified 16 incidents where the standard distance between planes had not been maintained.</p>
              <p>There has been only one incident so far this year.</p>
              <p>The company said safety was its first priority and was taking steps to improve performance.</p>
