              <h1>Revealed: The British squaddie who survived the Somme to marry a Russian princess</h1>

              <p>She was a princess from a distant quarter of the Russian empire, buried decades ago in an unmarked grave.</p>
              <p>He was the handsome young veteran of the Somme from a poor family in Yorkshire, forbidden to speak of his love for her.</p>
              <p>Now the extraordinary love story of Helena Palavandova and Lendon
                  Payne, their brief marriage and its tragic ending, has been brought to
                  light by Mr Payne's descendants.</p>
              <p>The couple met in 1923 while Mr Payne was serving in Constantinople and, despite their very different backgrounds, fell in love.</p>
              <p>After they married they moved to the less glamorous surroundings of inner-city Leeds.</p>
              <p>A year after giving birth to their first child, the princess died of tuberculosis.</p>
              <p>Her widower was forbidden to speak about her by his jealous second wife and her grave went unmarked.</p>
              <p>But after researching the story, several of Mr Payne's
                  descendants arranged for the princess to have a proper headstone and
                  this week held a memorial service in her honour at her grave at the
                  city's Harehills Cemetery.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/LendenFitzPayneRPY_468x436.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/LendenFitzPayneRPY_468x436.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>Veteran: Lendon Payne</em></p>
              <p>"We don't know much about this poor woman, only that she died far away
                  from her home country," said Mr Payne's granddaughter Kathe Deutsch.</p>
              <p>"We felt it was important to make a small gesture to commemorate Princess Helena and mark the place where she is buried."</p>
              <p>Born in Georgia in 1898, Helena was one of the Palavandoff
                  family. She was eight when a peasant mob stormed the family mansion,
                  killing her mother. Her father Prince Palavandoff and Helena fled the
                  country at the beginning of the Russian Revolution in 1917.</p>

              <p>She ended up as a student in Constantinople where she met Mr Payne, a
                  soldier from the Royal Corps of Signals and veteran of the Western
                  Front who was helping train the anti-Soviet Cossacks.</p>
              <p>His daughter Mary Deutsch said: "He was a very good-looking man. He liked the ladies."</p>
              <p>The couple communicated in French. But Mr Payne was also a man
                  of few words and it was only when he asked his senior officers for
                  permission to marry that he was told that Helena was a "princess of
                  rank".</p>
              <p>Mrs Deutsch went on: "He tried to extricate himself from his
                  promise because he could not provide the lifestyle that she would
                  expect. She was having none of this."</p>

                  Andrew Payne (left), Kathe Deutch and John Payne, descendants of the
                  princess's husband</em></p>
              <p>They married on May 24, 1923 at the British Embassy in Constantinople and nine months later their son David was born.</p>
              <p>By this time Mr Payne had been posted back to the UK and the newlyweds
                  moved in with his mother, a music-hall singer and dancer, in Leeds.</p>
              <p>The young woman who had become accustomed to the finer things in life was suddenly having to cope on a soldier's wage.</p>
              <p>"Like all married women of the time she was expected to manage a weekly household budget," said Mrs Deutsch.</p>
              <p>"Being completely unused to handling money she quickly found her new life very difficult to cope with."</p>
              <p>Under strain and unhappy, she fell ill and died on March 18 1925
                  at the age of 27. Their son David was looked after by his grandmother.</p>
              <p>He died four years ago aged 80. Mr Payne stayed in the Army,
                  reaching the rank of sergeant major. He remarried and had a daughter
                  and four sons, one of whom, John Payne, attended the graveside
                  ceremony.</p>
              <p>Only after the death of his second wife did he speak of the princess. He died in 1985 aged 88.</p>
              <p>Mrs Deutsch said: "He was a man who never spoke freely about his
                  feelings but I think there was always a place in his heart for her."</p>
