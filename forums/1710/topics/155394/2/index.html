            <div class='col-md body'><strong>50% of travellers have cancelled flights to Bali </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : Travel agents say 50 percent of travellers have cancelled their flights to Bali, while some tourists on the resort island are making arrangements to leave.<br><br>Our reporter spoke to passengers who had arrived on the first Sunday flight into Singapore from Bali.<br><br>Elizabeth Shumann returned from Bali after attending a friend's wedding there, and she is thankful to be alive.<br><br>Just the night before, she and her friends had walked away from one of the restaurants which were bombed in Jimbaran.<br><br>Elizabeth said: "When we got out on the street, it was very empty, but there was police everywhere. And they just stopped randomly to check. So we got checked many times, and when we got back to the hotel at Nusa Dua, they wouldn't let the cars go all the way in. They made us get out on the main road and walk all the way in, which is very far."<br><br>Most of the other travellers were far away from the sites of the blasts and only found out about the bombings from SMS messages.<br><br>"A little bit panic, but not so big as the first in 2001. Look okay," said a French businessman.<br><br>"The atmosphere this morning was fine. The roads were clear and the airport was fine and everything went smoothly," said another traveller.<br><br>Despite the bomb blasts in Bali, there are still passengers who are travelling to Bali.<br><br>Airlines say only about 50 percent of the passengers have cancelled their flights.<br><br>Jim Hock, American tourist, said: "We're concerned that our families will be worried if we went. So I don't think we're going to go."<br><br>James Fundervurk, American tourist, said: "A couple of things have added up for us not to go, and that would be the bomb blasts and the riots in Indonesia because of the fuel crisis."<br><br>"We're attending a friend's wedding, so since the wedding is still carrying on, so I think we should still go ahead," said Kirby Koh.<br><br>As for one satellite uplink service provider, the equipment has to be flown into Bali as soon as possible.<br><br>They are expected to provide support to the many international news agencies that will gather on the resort island over the next few days. - CNA /ch</div>
