            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has urged polytechnic students not to lose the spirit of enterprise that their predecessors had, which was crucial to Singapore's economy in the last 20 years.<br><br>He was speaking at the 10th Polytechnic Forum held at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.<br><br>Students engaged in role play as part of their projects for the forum.<br><br>But Dr Balakrishnan saw a little beyond what they were doing.<br><br>He said the glint in their eyes makes him optimistic they will rise to his challenge and continue the blaze of success left behind by their predecessors such as successful entrepreneur Sim Wong Hoo.<br><br>"I want you to realize that just as we have given you more opportunities to further yourself, don't lose your spirit of enterprise which has always been very strong amongst polytechnic graduates. Because if you do, Singapore will lose. We will lose that buzz, that cutting edge that our society and economy depended on, from people who have gone through the portals of polytechnics - your predecessors in this institution," said Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports.<br><br>Most polytechnic students say they welcome having more opportunities to further their studies, and are quick to add that having a degree won't make them complacent or less enterprising.<br><br>"Having an entrepreneurial mindset comes from within, having a degree or not having a degree doesn't make a difference," said Kesavan Ramani, a student at Temasek Polytechnic.<br><br>"It's always good to get a degree. It helps you gain other experiences as well," said Stacey Henderson, a student at Republic Polytechnic.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan also urged students not to be merely caught in the paper chase, but to pursue their passions.<br><br>The students will be heading to Johor for a three-day residential forum where they will debate topics such as how to engage youth and build the economy.<br><br>- CNA /ls</div>
