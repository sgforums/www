            <div class='col-md body'>Group visited Middle East after cartoons of the Prophet were published<br><br>Feb 8, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>COPENHAGEN - A GROUP of Danish imams and activists visited the Middle East late last year after the publication of caricatures of Prophet Muhammad in a homegrown newspaper, prompting allegations of hidden 'masterminds' behind the current wave of protests across the Muslim world.<br><br>A prominent member of the group, however, denied the existence of such 'masterminds' on Monday.<br><br>Mr Ahmed Abu Laban, a 60-year-old imam of Palestinian origin, instead attributed the sudden explosion of anger to the rapid success of a 'grassroots' consumer boycott against Danish exports.<br><br>Speaking from his office at the Waqfs mosque in Copenhagen, Mr Abu Laban also credited the hardline 'Salafist' television stations based in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, such as al-Majd and Iqra, with a 'big influence' in fomenting the trade boycott.<br><br>'It was the swift and decisive sanctions of the boycott. Keen Muslims responded, and found it was a good chance to show their love of the Prophet,' he was quoted as saying in Britain's Telegraph newspaper yesterday.<br><br>'And the amount of Danish trade in the region is so large that the echo was quickly heard in Denmark. It was a grassroots thing, though nobody is denying the role of the mosques. They have loudspeakers, and the people listen,' he added.<br><br>Mr Abu Laban denied claims from European intelligence and security sources that the banned Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist opposition group, had worked hard to whip up Muslim anger.<br><br>One Danish Muslim delegation was sent to Cairo to meet the secretary-general of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, and the grand mufti of Egypt. Delegates also met the grand imam, Sheikh Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, at al- Azhar University.<br><br>Mr Abu Laban also tried to lead a delegation to Qatar to meet the influential cleric Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, whose religious rulings are considered binding by many Muslims.<br><br>But he said the meeting was called off and denied that Sheikh al-Qaradawi was a hidden hand behind the protests, despite the Qatar-based cleric's call last week for a 'global day of anger' over the cartoons.<br><br>The cleric had been 'too busy' to see the Danish delegation as he was preparing for a major meeting of the 56-nation Organisation of the Islamic Conference, Mr Abu Laban said.<br><br>'The idea of a mastermind is very annoying to me,' he added.<br><br>The Danish imams were sharply criticised by their own prime minister, Mr Anders Rasmussen, for touring the Middle East with a 43-page dossier outlining what they called the racism and Islamophobia suffered by Muslims in Denmark.<br><br>Mr Rasmussen said he was 'speechless', especially after it emerged that the dossier contained three highly obscene images which the delegates said were sent to Danish Muslims as hate mail.<br><br>But Mr Rasmussen may have aggravated the dispute by refusing last October to meet ambassadors from Muslim countries - a decision publicly criticised by 22 retired Danish diplomats, said the Telegraph.<br><br>Mr Abu Laban's reputation is at an all-time low among many Danes after he condemned the consumer boycott on Danish television but told the al-Jazeera channel he was 'happy' about it.<br><br>Mr Abu Laban was keen to stress his moderation on Monday.<br><br>Danish Muslims were not looking for a victory or confrontation, he said. 'The whole story is about dialogue of civilisations,' he said.<br></div>
