            <div class='col-md body'>Another 125 dengue cases have been reported in the last 24 hours.<br><br>This is the fifth consecutive day when the count has exceeded 100 cases a day.<br><br>The number of dengue cases admitted to public hospitals on Friday rose to 85, up from 58 the day before.<br><br>To help track the infection, the National Environment Agency has started collecting blood samples from Sims Avenue residents.<br><br>The exercise involves residents from 93 units in Blocks 830 and 832 in Sims Avenue.<br><br>The Environmental Health Institute had sent out letters to residents asking them to volunteer 5 milliliters of blood sample, and a swab of saliva for the study.<br><br>Over the weekend, officers from the Institute have been going door-to-door to collect the samples from those who have agreed.<br><br>To protect the confidentiality of the residents, the media was not allow to film the process.<br><br>But many residents do not mind contributing to the study believed to be the first to be done here.<br><br>"I found out that our block was a hot dengue spot so that's why we should take dengue test," said one resident.<br><br>"Here many of us had this sickness so better to test. As long as we clear the stagnant water. Four kids and our maid have given blood and saliva samples," said a housewife.<br><br>Just last week alone, 20 people staying in the area were hit.<br><br>The samples will be analysed for antibodies against dengue infection in the last 2 months.<br><br>The study was proposed by health officials who wanted to find out how many people get dengue without showing any obvious symptoms like high fever, body ache and rashes.<br><br>Overseas studies show that between 10 to 90 percent of people infected with dengue may only have a mild fever instead of a full-blown dengue fever.<br><br>Dr Leo Yee-Sin, Clinical Director, Communicable Disease Centre, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said: "We know that dengue virus has 4 different types, Type 1 to Type 4. And having infected with one and having immunity against one does not protect against the other 3. What we're hoping to do from the collection of saliva and blood specimen is we hope to understand a little more the antibodies' reaction to 4 different types."<br><br>With a clearer picture of the population's immunity against dengue, health officials can then work on how to gear up the people's defence against new strains of the infection. - CNA /ch</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WHO says singapore has best defence against dengue, but ironically, has a high number of infection rate.. and the tropical climate supports the caption.<br><br>well, dengue isnt a big joke, esp when its a 2nd infection.. heard it can cause death if 2 times +<br><br>should we say that MOE is too complacent, or Singaporeans rely too much on others and their favourite bo chap attitude?<br></div>
