              turned out to be harmless, but for about three hours on Stevens Road on
              Wednesday morning, a motorcycle box found under a tree got the
              attention of security personnel. <br> <br> Police cars lined up on the corner of Stevens Road and Stevens Close -
              an area occupied by residences and the Israeli Embassy - along with
              vehicles marked “chem-bio radiological defence” and “explosive ordnance
              disposal”.
              <br> <br> The area was cordoned off.
              <br> <br>In a statement later, the police said the articles had been seized
              for further investigation, “with a view to establishing the owners of
              the items”. They declined to reveal who had made the call reporting the
              box at about 8.20am. <br> <br> Residents in the area TODAY spoke to were mostly bewildered by the commotion. 
              <br> <br> “As we were leaving the house this morning (at around 9am), we saw
              police cars parked along the road, but nobody told us what was
              happening,” said one couple living on Stevens Close.
              <br> <br>Upon their return around noon, they asked the officers present what
              had happened, and were told: “Nothing to worry about, you can go home
              now.”
              <br> <br>Others said that police officers had come by to tell them they
              could not drive out for the time being as the area had been cordoned
              off. <br> <br> Another resident, who was driving back home at around 11am, was told she could not enter the area.
              <br> <br> “They told me there was ‘immediate danger’ in the area, so I couldn’t
              drive in,” she said. “So, I had to drive around a bit to kill time.” <br> <br> When approached, officers outside the embassy said “nothing was happening and everything was fine”. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/ra</span></p>
