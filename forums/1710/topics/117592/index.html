            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : More than 200 youths have pledged to be 'Worth Waiting For' - abstain from pre-marital sex.<br><br>They are helping to spread the message to other young people.<br><br>The red band stands for true love, while the white band signifies purity.<br><br>The message? That true love is worth waiting for, so save yourself for marriage.<br><br>And who better to sell those "Worth Waiting For" purity bands and message to the youths than the youths themselves!<br><br>"To spread that message of abstinence from pre marital sex."<br><br>"I will pledge.....because I am worth waiting for!"<br><br>"To tell teenagers that sex can only be done in marriage and to save it for future husbands and wives."<br><br>"It is important for them to wait for the special moment to actually give themselves to the person they love. So it is important to know true love and abstinence. Abstain themselves against sex."<br><br>"Basically, this is also a religion issue, so if he cannot keep to the religion then he is not worth being my huband!"<br><br>The WWF community project is organise by local charity body Focus on the Family.<br><br>And it comes on the back of reports of rising teenage abortions, sexually-transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS infections among youths.<br><br>Most of the 200 youth volunteers have been through the 'No Apologies' workshop, and have taken the pledge to abstain from pre-marital sex.<br><br>Joanna Koh-Hoe, Focus on the Family Singapore, said: "We know that not every single teenager will buy into the message of abstinence, but it is a good way to just promote that it's a good thing, it's a cool thing, it's the in thing.<br><br>"So it's a message that young people love to have and love to embrace but it's just giving them the opportunity to embrace that hey, they can be empowered to save sex until after marriage and there are individuals worth waiting for.<br><br>"Even if they put on this band, it's not something that people should laugh at and look down at, but purity is cool and something that they can be proud of and they can be proud of the fact that they stand up for what they believe in."<br><br>Organisers hope to get 10,000 youths to wear these bands and spread the message of saving sex until after marriage is worth waiting for.<br><br>And with Valentine's Day just around the corner, organisers say these bands make great Valentine's Day gifts too.<br><br>But not everyone buys the idea of wearing his chastity on his wrist.<br><br>"I don't think it's going to work, because people like to have sex! Young people like to have sex!"<br><br>"I think people should concentrate on promoting safe sex versus no sex!!"<br><br>Others, like last year's Singapore Idol finalist Jerry Ong, remain hopeful this is a good start to reverse the trend.<br><br>Jerry Ong, Volunteer with 'Worth Waiting For', said: "I have in substance taken the pledge because I have pledged to abstinence.<br><br>"I believe that it's a difficult task, it's challenging but it's achievable. It is not prudish. The reason being that it's against the flow. And it's daring to be different. I think that's cool and that's pretty hip!" - CNA</div>
