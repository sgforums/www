JetQuay allows me to arrive at the airport nearer to my flight time and to exit the airport quickly upon arrival back in Singapore, which makes part of the travel process far less stressful.'<br><br>It is also 'very nice to avoid baggage reclaim', said Mr Rosenthal, who uses the service four to six times a month.<br><br>There are three tiers of membership: individual, group and corporate.<br><br>On top of the one-time joining fee of $1,000, there is an annual membership charge of $1,000 for individuals, $2,000 for group membership and $4,000 for companies.<br><br>The opening of the 2,000 sq m facility - the first of its kind in Asia - is part of Singapore's strategy to offer a full spectrum of services to travellers, in order to stay ahead in the race to become the region's premier aviation hub.<br><br>The opening of the Budget Terminal last March, at the other end of the scale, was part of the same strategy.<br><br>Mr Raymond Howe, 43, general manager of JetQuay - a joint venture between air cargo handler Worldwide Flight Services, VIP club operator Superior Travellers Services and logistics company Sembawang Kimtrans - has big plans.<br><br>A hospitality veteran, the Singaporean worked for 22 years in resorts and hotels around the world before returning home recently. He was headhunted to run JetQuay about a month ago.<br><br>Mr Howe aims to double daily passenger traffic from the current average of between 30 and 50 now to about 100 in the next few months.<br><br>He is particularly excited about Singapore's two integrated resorts (IRs) in Marina Bay and Sentosa.<br><br>'The opening of the IRs will provide an important market for us to tap on. With just about two years before the 2009 opening, we need to lay the foundation now by increasing awareness.'<br><br>By Karamjit Kaur, Aviation Correspondent<br><br></div>
