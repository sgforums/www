But in 1979, he was executed at the Rawalpindi Central Jail after General Zia-ul Haq staged a military coup.<br><br>Following in her fatherÂ’s footsteps, Benazir Bhutto proved so charismatic and influential both within Pakistan and outside its borders that she was detained several times during the General's military rule.<br><br>She went into exile in England in 1984 and returned two years later, leading mass rallies and calling for the restoration of democracy.<br><br>A plane crash in 1988 put an end to General Zia's military rule over Pakistan. Ms Bhutto seized the opportunity and led her party to an election victory, becoming the first woman to lead a modern Muslim nation.<br><br>Just 20 months later the Bhutto administration was dismissed on accusations of corruption relating to her husband.<br><br>The Bhutto name however still held sway over Pakistanis who elected her to power again in 1993.<br><br>Ms Bhutto was out of office within three years and was later convicted of corruption by a local court while she was out of the country.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <strong>Same as Thaksin when he was ousted by coup de tat while he was overseas in seminar, is Thaksin worse than the Thai military? Is there any economic progress with Thai military? Are the rest of the Thai opposition any better? The opposition, though charismatic to some, are just people with their agendas.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>She remained in exile for eight years, living with her three children in Dubai. Although out of politics, she was not out the public eye, visiting Western capitals often to deliver lectures at universities and think-tanks and meeting government officials.<br><br>It was on 18th October 2007 that she finally made a highly-charged return to Pakistan.<br><br>"I feel very, very emotional coming back to my country. I dreamt of this day for so many months and years. I counted the hours, I counted the minutes and the seconds," Bhutto said on her arrival.<br><br>Her high profile which drew massive crowds wherever she went made her target for death, with the first hint delivered at her homecoming parade in Karachi. A suicide bomber killed more then 140 people died in the attack.<br><br>Shaken but unscathed, Ms Bhutto was not surprised at the attack as she had been warned that she was on the hit list of several suicide squads. But she persisted in her drive to get Pakistan back on the road to democracy insisting,"Democracy is about going to the public."<br><br>Ms Bhutto who had her sights set on becoming Pakistan's prime minister for the third time, vowed to continue with her rallies, even at the risk of losing her life. "To save Pakistan, and to save democracy, because we believe democracy alone can save Pakistan from disintegration and a militant take-over, then we are prepared to risk our lives and we are prepared to risk our libertyÂ” said Ms Bhutto recently.<br>Speaking in Rawalpindi just hours before being assassinated, Benazir Bhutto said, Â“I put my life in danger and came here because I feel this country is in danger. People are worried. We will bring the country out of this crisis.Â”<br><br>The name "Benazir" means unique and without comparison.<br><br>That's how her supporters and the world will remember Benazir Bhutto.<br><br></div>
