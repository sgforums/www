              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed seven more cases of Influenza A (H1N1), bringing the total number of confirmed cases here to 34.
              
              </p>
              <p>All 34 cases, except one who was a close contact of a confirmed case, were imported cases with a travel history.</p>
              <p>So far, 17 patients have been discharged. The remaining 17 patients are still in the hospital and their conditions remain stable.</p>
              <p>The 28th to 31st confirmed cases are related to the 26th and 27th cases (mother and son) who had returned to Singapore on June 9 after attending a wedding in Melbourne. The latest cases had all attended the same wedding in Melbourne but had returned to Singapore on separate flights.</p>
              <p>The 28th case, a 52—year—old Singaporean man (father); and the 29th case, a 42—year—old woman (mother) had returned to Singapore from Melbourne on Singapore Airlines SQ228 at 21:40 hours on June 9. They were seated at row 37. The father had symptoms before he boarded the plane and the mother developed symptoms while on the plane.</p>
              <p>The 30th case, a 16—year—old Singaporean girl (daughter), also had symptoms on June 9 before she boarded the plane, and returned to Singapore from Melbourne on Emirates EK405 at 23:50 hours on June 9. She was seated at row 49.</p>
              <p>All three were not picked up by the thermal scanner as they did not have fever then. All three were fetched home by another daughter of the family who did not go to Melbourne.</p>
              <p>On June 10 and 11, the daughter (case No. 30) went to her secondary school — Bedok North Secondary School — to attend some activities. On June 11, the father went out for work almost the whole day, while the mother remained largely at home. On June 12 night, they called the 993 ambulance and all three were admitted to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).</p>
              <p>The 31st case is a 17—year—old Singaporean who had returned to Singapore from Melbourne on Singapore Airlines SQ228 at 21:40 hours on June 9. She had attended the same wedding in Melbourne. She was seated at row 62, and developed symptoms while on the plane. She was not picked up by the thermal scanner as she did not have fever then.</p>
              <p>On June 10, she stayed at home for the whole day. On June 11, she was out with some friends. On June 12 morning, she went to her school — Raffles Institution (Junior College) — to attend lessons. On June 12 night, a 993 ambulance was called and she was admitted to CDC.</p>
              <p>The 32nd case is a 28—year—old Singaporean man who returned to Singapore from Montreal via New York and Tokyo on Japan Airlines JL711 at 00:30 hours on June 11. He was on the same flight as the 25th case.</p>
              <p>His parents fetched him home from the airport by taxi. He developed symptoms on June 13 morning, and went to a polyclinic with his mother by bus. He was then referred to CDC via a 993 ambulance. Laboratory results confirmed his infection at 15:45 hours on June 13. No contact tracing for flight passengers is needed as he developed symptoms more than 24 hours after disembarkation.</p>
              <p>The 33rd case is a 32—year—old Singaporean woman who returned to Singapore from Phuket on Tiger Airways TR155 at 23:00 hours on June 5. On June 9 morning, she developed symptoms, and went to work.</p>
              <p>On June 10 morning, she sought medical attention at a GP clinic and was given medical leave for two days (from June 10 to 11). She returned home and did not go out for the rest of the day and the next.</p>
              <p>On June 12 morning, she went to the TTSH Emergency Department (ED) where she was given treatment. A throat swab was taken from her for testing. She was discharged from ED on June 12 afternoon with four days of medical leave (from June 12 to 15) as Thailand is not on the list of affected countries.</p>
              <p>Laboratory results confirmed her infection at 20:00 hours on June 13, and she was admitted to CDC2 at night. No contact tracing for flight passengers is needed as she developed symptoms more than 24 hours after disembarkation.</p>
              <p>The 34th case is a 6—year—old Australian girl who came to Singapore from Melbourne with her mother on Emirates EK405 at 23:50 hours on June 12 for a holiday. She was seated at row 28.</p>
              <p>She developed symptoms on June 11 while in Melbourne. She was brought to see a GP by her uncle on June 13 morning. She was referred to KK Women’s and Children Hospital (KKH) via a 993 ambulance. Laboratory results confirmed her infection at 21:15 hours on June 13.</p>
              <p>Contact tracing has been initiated for the seven new confirmed cases. Passengers seated within the following rows who have not been contacted by the Ministry of Health (MOH) yet should call the MOH hotline at 1800—333—9999:</p>
              <p>31 — 38 and 61 — 64 on Singapore Airlines SQ228 arriving at 21:40 hours on June 9 <br>47 — 51 on Emirates Airlines EK405 at 23:50 hours on June 9 <br>26 — 30 on Emirates Airlines EK405 at 23:50 hours on June 12</p>
              <p>All close contacts identified will be quarantined and provided with antiviral prophylaxis.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry reminds travellers to refrain from travelling should they have symptoms within 24 hours of their planned departure and consult a doctor.</p>
              <p>Out of the 34 cases confirmed in Singapore so far, 17 patients have been discharged from hospital.</p>
              <p>The Education Ministry says it has been in touch with all 65 staff and students who had been in contact with two of the patients.</p>
              <p>The 16—year—old and 17—year—old teenagers had returned to their respective schools despite showing symptoms of the flu.</p>
              <p>The students and staff have been advised to stay at home for a week and to watch out for symptoms.</p>
              <p>The affected classrooms will also be disinfected.</p>
              <p>The ministry also advises schools to be more vigilant in monitoring students who participate in holiday activities in school, and says temperature—taking should be taken.</p>
              <p>It also advises parents not to send their children to school should they feel unwell.</p>
