            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: The trial of two teenaged maids charged with murdering their employer, Esther Ang, began at the High Court on Monday.<br><br>Lawyers representing the maids, Siti Aminah and Juminem, alleged that Esther could have ill-treated her maids.<br><br>Esther was suffocated with a pillow and then bludgeoned with a wine bottle in her condominium on 2 March last year, according to a forensic pathologist report.<br><br>Esther's ex-husband, Jack Boon, revealed in court that the victim had gambling problems.<br><br>He said Esther scolded her maids in offensive language, and was a fastidious employer who looked under the table for dust.<br><br>When questioned by Juminem's lawyer, Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim, Mr Boon also revealed that Esther had threatened to fine her maids if they were lazy or broke a glass.<br><br>But Mr Boon also said he was not aware that Esther had ill-treated the maids.<br><br>He said he did not consider making the maids work every day from 6am to 11pm without a single off day or scolding the maids in abusive languages, to be a form of ill treatment.<br><br>Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim said Juminem kept a diary during the course of her employment.<br><br>The lawyer said that in one of Juminem's first entries, she wrote: 'please, god! help my employer to change'.<br><br>Subsequently after a few months, she wrote again: 'My heart is exploding with anger. Please, god! forgive me as I take my revenge'.<br><br>The diary will be submitted as evidence in court in a few days.<br><br>This is the first time that two senior counsels have been assigned to defend maids charged with murder.<br><br>Just last year, an Indonesian maid was sentenced to life imprisonment for strangling her employer.<br><br>The case is being closely followed by the Indonesian media.<br><br>"I just want to say that I think we have a very fair system of judiciary in Singapore and my client would have a fair trial," said Senior Counsel Alvin Yeo, Siti Aminah's lawyer.<br><br>Only one family member of each of the two maids could afford to come to Singapore to attend the trial. - CNA<br><br>DPP asked to defend the maids....
