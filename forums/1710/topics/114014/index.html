            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The Esplanade will come alive with 'The Sound of Music' when the popular Broadway classic hits Singapore's shores this April.<br><br>And it will even feature the original cast who had dazzled thousands worldwide.<br><br>For those who have watched the movie, they will probably be thinking about Julie Andrews and lush green fields just about now.<br><br>But the cast of the musical wants audience to bid farewell to these timeless scenes and approach the stage production with an open mind.<br><br>Actress Jennifer Semrick, who has been playing the role of Maria Rainer for four years, said the "live" performance promised more songs and a broader spectrum of experiences, compared to what is on the big screen.<br><br>"It was changed a great deal for the movie, they could actually do these beautiful sequences with mountains and edit, edit, edit. They actually cut at least two songs, technically they cut three songs and changed one, and then they sort of re-piece it together, and put some of it out of order," she said.<br><br>The content may vary but it is still as popular.<br><br>The musical ran for over 1,400 days on Broadway, and it is packing in the audiences on its current tour in China and Taiwan, despite a language barrier.<br><br>Ms Semrick said: "We were so nervous. As actors we did not know what to expect, the first thing that stuck out was they sang along, they never did that in America!"<br><br>The award winning production will open in Japan, Korea and Malaysia before stopping in Singapore between April 8 and April 30.<br><br>To appeal to a wider range of audience, 'The Sound of Music' will feature Chinese subtitles at the Esplanade.<br><br>The organisers are also looking for Singapore's very own Von Trapp family in a nationwide Sound of Music singing contest.<br><br>So, if you know your "do-re-mis" and if the judges count your performance among their favourite things, you might just win a trip to Austria, or tickets to the musical and its merchandise. - CNA</div>
