            <div class='col-md body'>BANGKOK : The speedy trial of two Thai men sentenced to death for killing a British student may have helped reassure tourists about safety, but it has also raised concern about the kingdom's justice system.<br><br>The trial of the fishermen ended on Wednesday just 17 days after the rape and murder of 21-year-old Katherine Horton on the resort island of Samui.<br><br>Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra had made an unusual public call for the two men to face the death penalty, saying the crime had damaged Thailand's vital tourism industry, which is still rebuilding after the tsunami in 2004.<br><br>The breakneck speed of the investigation and conviction of the two men, who confessed they killed the student after drinking and watching pornographic films, drew criticism from human rights watchdog Amnesty International.<br><br>"In this high-profile case, Amnesty International believes that the speed of prosecution raises concern that the individuals may not have had time to mount an adequate defence," the group said in a statement.<br><br>Amnesty said it was vital all trials involving the death penalty, which the group opposes, meet international standards of fairness.<br><br>But Tanes Petsuwan, a spokesman for the Tourism Authority of Thailand, said he hoped the quick trial would send out a positive message to tourists about the country's commitment to security.<br><br>"After the case happened, there was much action from the level of the Thai prime minister, ordering immediately national police and local police to try to close this case, which I think the police did it quite well," Tanes said.<br><br>"We accept that this might hurt the feelings of tourists from England who plan to visit Thailand in the future. But the reaction happened very quickly, which shows our responsibility," he said.<br><br>John Koldowski, who analyses tourism trends for the Bangkok-based Pacific Asia Travel Association, said the government had moved quickly to control any damage the crime caused to Thailand's image.<br><br>"You can see that they're extremely concerned about the negative image this could generate overseas," he said.<br><br>So far, tourism authorities have recorded no cancellations since the murder and the government still expects arrivals to Samui to increase about five percent to more than one million people this year.<br><br>Tourism accounts for six percent of Thailand's gross domestic product, and memories of the devastating tsunami which killed nearly 5,400 people in the country still linger.<br><br>"It's the last thing you want to have - this series of events, either natural or manmade, with a very dark underside," said Koldowski.<br><br>Despite the tsunami, overall tourism in Thailand has remained strong. Although arrivals fell short of the government's target, the number of foreign visitors rose 10 percent last year to some 12.1 million people.<br><br>While Thailand bills itself as the "Land of Smiles" with sunny beaches, there are regular incidents of foreigners involved in sexual assaults, drug offences and sometimes rape or murder.<br><br>Britain's Foreign Office says nine of its nationals have been murdered in Thailand since August 2004, and urges women to exercise caution amid regular reports of sexual violence against men and women.<br><br>A 57-year-old British man was beaten to death at Christmas in his bungalow in Koh Chang, southeastern Thailand, and just last weekend a 29-year-old woman was raped in the beach resort of Pattaya, southeast of Bangkok. - AFP/de<br><br></div>
