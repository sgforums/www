              <h1>Millionaire lottery winner goes back to job at McDonald's... because he misses his workmates</h1>
              <p>It's not the natural habitat of the millionaire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you visit a particular McDonald's store in Cardiff, you've every chance of being served by one.</p>
              <p>Luke Pittard, 25, won £1.3million on the National Lottery 18 months ago.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/LukeWorkingWNS_468x356.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/LukeWorkingWNS_468x356.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>Despite winning more than £1m on the lottery Luke Pittard decided to go back to work at McDonalds</em></p>
              <p>He celebrated in the usual way, buying a new home and splashing out on a lavish wedding and holiday in the Canary Islands.</p>
              <p>Then he realised that he really missed his job.</p>
              <p>So he asked to go back and couldn't be happier, getting up at the crack of dawn to flip burgers for £5.85 an hour.</p>
              <p>"They all think I'm a bit mad but I tell them there's more to life than money," he said.</p>
              <p>"I loved working at McDonald's before I became a millionaire and I'm really enjoying being back there again."</p>
              <p>Few customers at the restaurant in Pontprennau, Cardiff, realise that a
              millionaire is frying their fries or taking their money behind the
              counter.</p>
              <p>Mr Pittard and his girlfriend Emma Cox, 29, were working there together when he hit the jackpot.</p>
              <p>They hung up their uniforms and settled down to domestic-bliss in a £230,000 home with their three-year-old daughter Chloe.</p>
              <p>But 18 months later, the novelty of early retirement wore off.</p>
              <p>"Lots of my old McDonald's workmates came to our wedding and I had kept
              in touch with them all the time, so I just thought: 'Why not go back?'"
              said Mr Pittard.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/EmmaLukeChequeWNS_468x338.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/EmmaLukeChequeWNS_468x338.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>Luke with his wife Emma and their cheque for over £1.3 million</em></p>
              <p>"To be honest, there's only so much relaxing you can do.</p>
              <p>"I'm only young and a bit of hard work never did anyone any harm."</p>
              <p>The couple earn more each week in interest on their win than Mr Pittard brings home from McDonald's.</p>
              <p>But his wife supports his decision to return to work as a staff trainer.</p>
              <p>"I can totally understand it," she said.</p>
              <p>"We both really enjoyed working at McDonald's and still have good friends there.</p>
              <p>"So it was really familiar for him and something for him to look forward to."</p>
              <p>McDonald's manager Katherine Jones said: "Luke was always a great
              member of our team and when he won the lottery we were all so pleased
              for him.</p>
              <p>"I'm glad he has had the time to enjoy his winnings but love having him here - it's as if he never went away."</p>
