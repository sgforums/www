              <p><em> Ever wondered why we cry, what earwax is for and if we can smell
              other people's emotions? In a fascinating look at what goes on between

              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/028baby_228x272.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/028baby_228x272.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>The human head is formed after only eight weeks in the womb</em></p>
              <p>The construction of a human head, one of the most complex structures in the natural world, takes place astonishingly quickly.</p>
              <p>After only eight weeks in the womb, billions of cells have already
              formed themselves into a brain, highly developed eyes and ears, a
              recognisable face complete with tongue, mouth and nose, a skull and
              organised facial bones.</p>
              <p>Once fully developed, the human skull can be remarkably tough - as was
              demonstrated in 1997 by strongman John Evans on the BBC's National
              Lottery Live show.</p>
              <p>He balanced 101 bricks, weighing 416lb, on his head and managed to keep them there for ten seconds.</p>
              <p>Such resilience is not confined to the skull. The muscles and vertebrae
              in the neck are also very tough, which makes beheading someone far from
              the easiest method of killing.</p>
              <p>It took three blows to hack through the neck of Mary, Queen of Scots when she was executed in Fotheringay Castle in 1587.</p>
              <p>An assistant held her hair to prevent her from moving.</p>
              <p>The result was, as always, extremely gory, given that large arteries and veins, providing succour to the head, were severed.</p>
              <p>Once cleaved from the body, a hairless human head weighs an average
              11lb - roughly the same as a ten-pin bowling ball - and accounts for
              around 8 per cent of our total body weight.</p>

              <p>• <strong> A FUNNY BUSINESS </strong></p>
              <p>The real business of breathing is done in the lungs  -  the head is only a convenient throughway to let oxygen into the body.</p>
              <p>Yet for a structure that has a passing interest in air, the head does
              an impressive number of things with it, from sneezing to speaking.</p>
              <p>One of the most mysterious is laughing. This seems to be the most
              anarchic of all human activities yet giggles, titters, shrieks and
              belly laughs all conform to strict rules.</p>
              <p>Each laugh has its own distinct "signature"  -  made up of short-vowellike notes, not more than a tenth of a second long.</p>
              <p>These are repeated at regular intervals about a fifth of a second apart.</p>
              <p>Once a laugh has started with a particular vowel sound, it tends to stick to it.</p>
              <p>The sound may be "ha-ha-ha" or "ho-ho-ho", but not "ha-ho-ha-ho".</p>
              <p>There seems to be resistance to such acoustic mongrels. Laughter can be
              infectious, as was illustrated in 1962, when three girls at a boarding
              school in Tanzania were stricken with bouts of uncontrolled mirth for
              hours on end.</p>
              <p>Soon nearly half of the 159 boarders were affected, laughing for up to 16 days at a time.</p>
              <p>The school was closed and the children sent home, but this resulted in the condition spreading to entire villages and towns.</p>
              <p>No one died during this two-year outbreak of what appears to have been
              mass hysteria, but there was much agitation, exhaustion and
              interference with daily life.</p>
              <p>Under normal circumstances, we laugh 30 times more frequently when we are with others than when we are alone.</p>
              <p>As to why we laugh, no one knows, but scientists think they have solved
              one riddle at least - our inability to tickle ourselves.</p>
              <p>Self-tickling doesn't work because the brain tends to suppress sensations caused by the body's own movements.</p>
              <p>"This leaves it free to concentrate on its real job, which is to deal
              with unexpected stimuli from the outside world, and means that those
              entirely expected sensations of self-tickling are scarcely registered.</p>
              <p><strong>WAXING LYRICAL </strong></p>
              <p>While people of European and African origin usually have earwax which
              is wet and honey-brown, a genetic mutation thousands of years ago ago
              resulted in most Asian people - as well as native Americans and Inuits
              who have Asian origins - developing earwax which is dry, flaky and
              grey.</p>
              <p>Indeed, it has proved possible to 
              track human migratory patterns, 
              such as those of the Inuit, by 
              looking at earwax type.</p>
              <p>Whatever its colour, this mixture of 
              sweat and secretions from the 
              sebaceous glands performs many 
              useful functions.</p>
              <p>Propelled by our jaw movements, 
              it washes out dirt and dust from 
              the ear canal.</p>
              <p>It also lubricates the 
              skin lining within the canal, 
              preventing it drying up and getting 
              itchy, plus it has anti-bacterial and 
              anti-fungal properties.</p>

              <strong> NOSING AHEAD </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/029nosing_228x261.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/029nosing_228x261.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>Our nose plays a bigger part in our lives than we think</em></p>
              <p>Our noses play a greater part in our lives than we realise.</p>
              <p>Though we may not register it with our conscious minds, we can smell,
              for example, the emotions such as fear, contentment and another
              person's state of sexual arousal.</p>
              <p>Women are better at this than men. Tests show women discriminate more
              reliably between armpit swabs taken from people watching "happy" and
              "sad" films.</p>
              <p>Our ability to smell depends on the olfactory membrane at the back of
              the nasal cavity, which is the size of a postage stamp, but contains 10
              million receptors. (Dogs, for whom smell is much more than
              recreational, have a billion or more receptors.)</p>
              <p>Within this membrane, there are 1,000 different types of receptor cells
              which can respond to more than one smell, enabling us to recognise more
              than 10,000 odours, scents, fragrance and pongs.</p>
              <p>• <strong>LIFE'S ONE BIG YAWN </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/029yawn_228x345.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/029yawn_228x345.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>Yawning is just as contagious as laughing</em></p>
              <p>THE unborn child begins yawning after just 11 weeks in the womb.</p>
              <p>Once born, each of us will yawn an average 250,000 times before we breathe our last.</p>
              <p>The most plausible explanation is that this endless jaw-stretching is a protective reflex that maintains lung inflation.</p>
              <p>It prevents the bubbles in the lung sponge - the so-called alveoli,
              where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place - from
              collapsing.</p>
              <p>Yawning is as contagious as laughing. Research suggests that within
              five minutes of seeing someone yawn, 50 per cent of people will do the
              same.</p>
              <p>Even reading about the subject can provoke an involuntary yawn. Can you feel one coming?</p>
              <p>• <strong> RED FACES ALL ROUND </strong></p>
              <p>ONE facial feature over which we have no control is blushing.</p>
              <p>We might ask why this is limited to the face  -  for example, why do our bottoms not blush when we are embarrassed?</p>
              <p>The answer is that the blood vessels of the face are denser, wider and
              closer to the surface than those in other parts of the body.</p>
              <p>As to why some people blush far more readily than others, this has
              proved much harder to investigate because of the difficulty of
              prompting cheek-reddening under experimental conditions.</p>
              <p>One research project involved showing suggestive material to a series of young females.</p>
              <p>There was not a blush in sight. Yet when they were thanked for their
              help at the end of the abandoned session, they apologised for their
              unco-operative cheeks and blushed scarlet.</p>
              <p>A possible explanation for blushing is that it is a non-verbal means of
              saving face - admitting we are in the wrong before others criticise us.</p>
              <p>This is backed by studies showing that people react less harshly to mistakes when the perpetrators blush.</p>
              <p>• <strong> BREAKING A SWEAT </strong></p>
              <p>The forehead is one of only a few places on the body - along with the
              armpits, palms of the hands and soles of the feet - where we experience
              "emotional" sweating.</p>
              <p>Unlike thermal sweating, which regulates our temperature and occurs
              over most of the skin, this is a reaction to fear, anger or stress.</p>
              <p>Its mechanism is not well understood, though we are so familiar with it
              that the phrase "breaking out in a cold sweat" is commonly used to
              describe acute anxiety.</p>
              <p>One theory suggests that cooling the body in this way allows it to burn
              more energy - as one might need to do in a frightening situation -
              without getting over-heated.</p>
              <p>This is fine if the appropriate response is fight or flight, but
              perspiring profusely only adds to our embarrassment when we find
              ourselves rooted to the spot with horror at some gaffe.</p>
              <p>• <strong>FACING THE FACTS</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/029face_228x264.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/029face_228x264.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>The human face can produce up to 3,000 expressions</em></p>
              <p>Drawing on 43 muscles, we are capable of producing more than 10,000 facial expressions.</p>
              <p>Up to 3,000 have a recognisable meaning to other people, but seven
              basic emotions are shown on the face in the same way in every culture:
              sadness, anger, surprise, fear, enjoyment, disgust and contempt.</p>
              <p>These are innate, not learned; which explains why people who are born
              blind use the same facial expressions for each of these seven emotions
              as sighted people.</p>
              <p>• <strong> SEEING IS BELIEVING </strong></p>
              <p>When our ancestors began walking upright four to eight million years
              ago, the elevation of the head gave an advantage to two of the senses -
              which worked over a long distance: vision and hearing.</p>
              <p>It increased their importance over touch, taste and smell, which work only when we are close to what we are sensing.</p>
              <p>As a result, vision today accounts for about 90 per cent of the information we acquire about the world through our senses.</p>
              <p>Given the importance of our eyes, it makes sense that we produce tears to keep them moist, grit-free and uninfected.</p>
              <p>But what about the tears which flow when we are feeling emotional  -  whether it's very sad or extremely happy?</p>
              <p>Such tears are clearly central to humanity's understanding of itself, but still we understand little about their purpose.</p>
              <p>Some researchers have pointed to the fact that emotional tears are
              different to ordinary tears in their chemical composition, being richer
              in substances such as manganese and protein.</p>
              <p>But the idea that they may somehow help us get rid of stress-related toxins is unconvincing.</p>
              <p>The kidneys seem better equipped for that job and emotional crying
              seems designed to deal with toxins of the soul rather than those of the
              body.</p>
              <p>Whatever its hidden benefits, crying is not always valued in this country.</p>
              <p>We expect the statesman to wipe away a single tear with a
              leather-gloved finger as he places the wreath at the Cenotaph rather
              than work his way through box after box of Kleenex.</p>
              <p>Other cultures are more Spartan still: the Minangkabau people of Indonesia forbid crying altogether.</p>
              <p>But instead of being ashamed of our tears, we should celebrate them
              because the human is the only animal that weeps in this way.</p>
              <p>Just like speaking, journeying to the Moon and the many other
              activities that set us apart from other creatures, our tears are
              special, making us realise what a mysterious and wonderful structure we
              have in the human head.</p>
