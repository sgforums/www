            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Junior Colleges and Centralised Institutes will have a single intake for its first-year students from end of January in 2009.<br><br>The Education Ministry said this was possible as the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board would be taking greater control of the GCE 'O' Level examination from this year.<br><br>On average, Serangoon Junior College loses more than half of its Year One students between the first and second intake. (About 60 percent)<br><br>This has put the school at a slight disadvantage.<br><br>Lim Lay Peng, Head of Department of Pastoral Care at Serangoon Junior College, said: "We have a syllabus to complete, because of the high turnover, we have to spend precious curriculum time going through the students what was covered in the first intake unlike other JCs where their turnover rate is not so high, they do not have to re-teach, they can just continue with the syllabus, they can save time there."<br><br>Time is also saved from not having to plan for two separate time-tables and orientation programmes.<br><br>Under the single intake system, the 'O' level results will be released in early January 2009, with posting results available later that month.<br><br>Students will also have an additional three weeks break before school term starts in late January, compared with the current system.<br><br>Elson Ong, First Year Student at Serangoon Junior College, said: "If you have only one intake you just need to focus mainly on the 'O' levels, then you can spend the most of the Sec 4 pursuing leadership qualities, participating in outdoor activities or maybe going on overseas attachment programmes."<br><br>But some students still prefer the two intake system as it enables them to find out more about junior college education.<br><br>Wilson Heng, First Year Student at Serangoon Junior College, said: "I like the current system because it lets me see if I want to have a JC life or poly life, and it will give me a chance to choose the subjects I want to take for my 'A' levels."<br><br>With the revised school calendar, the JCs will share six common weeks of school holidays with the polytechnics and up to 12 common weeks with the Primary and Secondary schools.<br><br>The Education Ministry said this would allow families with children studying in different educational levels to spend more time together.<br><br>It will streamline the processes for the 'O' Level examinations and Joint Admission Exercise. - CNA/de</div>
