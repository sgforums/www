            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore's most wanted gunman who shook the republic with an execution-style slaying of a 41-year-old businessman on February 15 has been handed over to Singapore authorities by Malaysian police.<br><br>Tan Chor Jin, 39, was flown back in a Singapore Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday evening.<br><br>Tan is alleged to have shot and killed nightclub owner Lim Hock Soon at his home in Serangoon.<br><br>Notoriously known as "One Eye Dragon", the plane carrying Tan touched down at about 6pm.<br><br>Tan was kept behind in the plane until all the passengers had left.<br><br>As he is a wanted, high-profile criminal, he was escorted out of the premises via a restricted route in unmarked police vehicles.<br><br>Thirty minutes later, the entourage - one van and two cars - arrived at CID Headquarters.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia understands Tan will be remanded for about a week and he is expected to be charged in court with murder on Friday.<br><br>Malaysian police say they decided to hand the suspect over to Singapore authorities because they did not have enough evidence to charge him with gun possession.<br><br>Mr Mustafa Abdullah, Deputy Commissioner of Police and City Police Chief of Kuala Lumpur, says: "At the point we raided the room it happen he was in another room. So the gun was in another room. So we don't have enough evidence to prove in court to say that he was in possession of gun at that point of time. So therefore it is better for us, because of that technicality, we decided to hand him over to Singapore straightaway for the murder case."<br><br>Earlier in the Malaysian city state at about 10am, Tan was brought before the Sessions Judge Akhtar Tahir and Senior Deputy Public Prosecutor P. Sarala Pillai to sought the court's assistance to endorse the warrant of arrest.<br><br>Immediately after that, Tan was handed over to Singapore Police, who left in an unmarked car.<br><br>Malaysian and Singapore police had an understanding to facilitate each other in handing over wanted suspects by either country on the condition that the warrant of arrest must be endorsed by a magistrate or a Sessions Court judge.<br><br>Mr Mustafa says police have carried out further investigations on Tan, revealing he is not wanted for any other criminal offence in Malaysia.<br><br>Tan, two other men and three women were arrested after Malaysian police raided a five-star hotel in Kuala Lumpur on February 25.<br><br>They seized six semi-automatic pistols, 203 rounds of ammunition and four kilogrammes of ketamine drugs worth RM50,000.<br><br>Another Singaporean who was arrested along with Tan, Ngoi Yew Fatt, is still detained by Malaysian police.<br><br>He is wanted in Singapore in connection with a murder in Yishun last year.<br><br>Malaysian courts have extended the remand order on the Malaysian man from Johor and the other wanted Singaporean - 42-year-old Ngoi for seven more days to facilitate police investigations into firearms and drug possesion offences.<br><br>The three women detained with them have been released on bail. - CNA/de</div>
