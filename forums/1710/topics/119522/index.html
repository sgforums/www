            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The National Trades Union Congress has called for more effective laws to define employers' obligations for safety at work.<br><br>It says the increasing number of fatal industrial accidents will affect Singapore's reputation for business excellence.<br><br>There were two major industrial accidents in this month alone.<br><br>On Wednesday, an explosion at a warehouse in Tuas killed two men.<br><br>And on the February 12, three Thai workers were killed after inhaling solvent fumes at a Choa Chu Kang work site.<br><br>The explosion that rocked the Hong Huat Hung warehouse shattered the lives of the Lee family.<br><br>64-year-old Lee Lean Seng, one of the company's shareholders, was found dead on the floor of the warehouse.<br><br>His son said his father was planning to take a holiday with them after the Lunar New Year.<br><br>"We didn't go into the mortuary to see his body. We are making funeral arrangements now. His funeral will most likely be on Sunday."<br><br>The other victim of Wednesday's industrial accident is Goh Tua Bak.<br><br>His son said his father had been with the company for over 10 years.<br><br>"The company has contacted us and told us they will take full responsibility for the incident. It's an industrial incident, nobody wanted it to happen."<br><br>The explosion occurred at about 2pm on Wednesday.<br><br>An empty enclosed cylindrical metal tank, measuring 8 metres tall and 3 metres in diameter, had ruptured.<br><br>And the impact ripped the lid of the tank, causing a hole, in the roof directly above the tank.<br><br>In the meantime, neighbors of Hong Huat Hung are working on repairing their premises.<br><br>Parts of their ceiling were damaged as a result of the impact of the explosion.<br><br>The Ministry of Manpower has issued a stop work order to the company and is now investigating the cause of the explosion.<br><br>NTUC has also released a strongly worded statement calling for more drastic action to be taken by the government where industrial safety is concerned. - CNA</div>
