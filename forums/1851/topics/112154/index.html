            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Heng,<br>Just to answer Your Qn<br>1) I am a postop woman, now living in a fully female body. The only regret is that I Cant get pegnant as i no ovaries.<br>2) For Qn 2, Maybe you can go to Nanyang Girl High forum. There is a topic on Introduction To Me. There describe how i decided to be a woman.<br>3) Yah i had to go through psychatric evaluations and assessments. These assessments are very through and difficult to explain to u all as it has many terms. But i will list down briefly. Actually some transgendered do not bother to look for  psychologists for assessment as Thailand hospital do not chech whether if the doctor accept or not. They just give u the op when u say u want it. These patients will mostly regret when "she" found out that she is not suitable and suffer from depression. Maybe they will commit suicide. There are cases like that.<br>For Me, i went through many session of psychatric evaluations and assessments and the doctor had given me the "green light" to do the operation. Therfore, I went to Thailand to do the op when I am 21<br>3) I always want to avoid these decision by depending on the psychological assessment. As I know that maybe one's feeling can tell whether u want to make these decision.I really think a lot before making the decision like financial, the acceptance by friends, family, etc. I was upset during my secondary days. I saw myself weird in the male school uniform and when i started to wear girls clothing, I would feel myself beautiful and I would put on make up. Maybe u will ask me why not be a crossdresser. But I can tell U...Dat time, I aspire to be a woman. In Secondary days, I am obstacised by friends as they think that I am a ah Kwa as I always behaved and talked like a female. Maybe all these factor lead to my decision. Anyway hor, If some ppl are confused abt their gender, U can go consult ppsychologist. It is rather effective. It also help in decisions making.<br>4) Now, my parents accepted me but it took a long time for them to accept. As I think they will say last time I born U a male body and can carry family line and now u are a female.<br>Friends, Some doesnt accept me. I am glad that some good friends accepted me and they know why I wanted to become a female. The society in general in govt sense does not recognised. But of cos, i am allowed to change gender in IRC. As now I am a fully female, I can walk on the street with woman's clothing and they would not look at me in disdain. The only giveaways is my adam apple. The only time is when i get disdain is when I am during Transition period. That is during pre-op period.<br>If u want to know more abt other things, u can continue to write on the forum, Nanyang Girls High</div>
