            <div class='col-md body'>yeah that's ABSOLUTELY true.<br><br>next time i'm either getting those seats at the back.. or the circle seats.<br><br>the main seats in the stall area are appalling. i can so attest to that "everyone stands up when one person from the middle needs to go out".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, most seats in Singapore are like that, don't you think?<br><br>I'm only 6' and I've actually stopped going to the cinemas because I come out with a sore back whenever I go watch movies.  Only a few cinemas have seats which have some legroom.<br><br>Worse are the SBS buses... I think they make seats for hobbits!  I can't even sit straight and have to cram my knees on the back of the seat in front.. much to the annoyance of the people sitting there.  Thank goodness TIBS buses give you slightly more room.<br><br>oh well... wonder if the architect who designed the place was also a hobbit?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yS:</div><div class="quote_body">Source:<br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/forum/story/0,4386,175252,00.html?<br><br>I WAS appalled by the poor seating arrangement at the Concert Hall of the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>More generous seats? Higher ticket prices </strong><br><br>WE REFER to the letter by Mr Munir Shah, 'First-class hall, economy-class seats' (ST, March 5), and Ms Teo Ching Hwa's letter published in the This &amp; That column (ST, March 7).<br><br>The layout of Esplanade's performing venues was designed by Theatre Projects Consultants (TPC) from Britain.<br><br>This also included the seating arrangements. TPC are theatre design consultants with vast experience and an impressive portfolio.<br><br>Accompanying our reply is a response from TPC Design Director Mark Stroomer which, we hope, will shed some light on the design rationale for Esplanade's venues.<br><br>The objective of the design and construction of the Theatre and Concert Hall was to achieve the best possible acoustics, a sense of intimacy and an optimum seating capacity.<br><br>The very positive response from many of the artistes who have performed at the Esplanade and the feedback from our audiences affirm that, finally, Singapore has a performing-arts centre of international distinction that we can all be proud of.<br><br>We do recognise that some aspects of our seating plan may not fully meet the very high standards that Singaporeans expect.<br><br>However, apart from the impact on acoustics, a more generous seating arrangement would have resulted in fewer seats. This in turn would translate into higher ticket prices for performances, as presenters would have fewer seats to sell to recover their costs.<br><br>The design decision that was made swayed towards having enough seats to ensure that ticket prices are kept reasonable. Affordability of the shows was of overriding importance to us and the compromise in seating has not come at great sacrifice because, in comparison to many other internationally renowned venues, Esplanade's seating arrangements are actually considered to be very good, if not generous.<br><br>We thank both Mr Shah and Ms Teo for writing to express their views. We hope that our patrons, including Mr Shah and Ms Teo, would be willing to put up with a little inconvenience to appreciate the other very positive elements that contribute towards a memorable concert or theatre outing and that the wide range of ticket prices, made possible by the seating capacity of the venues, allows for more Singa-poreans and visitors to enjoy performances at Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay.<br><br>CAROLYN TAY (MS)<br>Director, Marketing Communications<br>The Esplanade Co Ltd<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>THE seating arrangements in both the Theatre and Concert Hall at the Esplanade are based on traditional proven designs for drama and orchestral venues.<br><br>The spacing and length of rows are comparable to and improves upon many internationally renowned spaces.<br><br>Modern European opera houses such as Gothenburg and Helsinki, both completed in recent years, have a shorter distance between seats and longer rows than the Esplanade lyric theatre.<br><br>Similarly, classic venues such as Royal Opera House, London; Metropolitan Opera House, New York; and the Garnier Opera House, Paris, have tighter and smaller seating layouts.<br><br>The same can be said of modern concert halls in the United States and Europe having similar or less legroom than in Singapore. Many have rows of up to 50 seats or more.<br><br>There are performance venues that give extra space but these do not in general succeed in creating the excellent acoustics and intimacy that the Esplanade enjoys.<br><br>Going to the theatre is an interactive experience that requires the sharing of reactions and emotions. People need to be sensitive to the proximity of others to create the collective experience that a live performance demands.<br><br>Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay has been designed to international expectations of acoustics and theatrical intimacy.<br><br>The venues bring a great many people as close to the performer as possible in a room with a fine acoustic.<br><br>MARK STROOMER<br>Design Director<br>Theatre Projects Consultants, London<br></div>
