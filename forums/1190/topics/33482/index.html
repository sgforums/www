Read on.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Network Etiquette<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Network etiquette - for NETNEWS, but also applicable to participation in electronic discussion lists and conferences in general.<br><br>AUTHOR:     Linda Littleton <br><br>These are commonly-accepted rules of etiquette for posting to NETNEWS. You shouldn't post anything until you have read and understand everything below.<br><br>Some of this information is adapted from "A Primer on How to Work With the NETNEWS Community" by Chuq Von Rospach.<br><br>(1)  Never Forget that the Person on the Other Side is Human    =====================================================<br>Because your interaction with the network is through a computer,<br>it's easy to forget that there are people "out there".  Situations<br>arise where emotions erupt into a verbal free-for-all that can lead<br>to hurt feelings.<br><br>Please remember that people all over the world are reading your<br>words.  Don't attack people if you cannot persuade them with your<br>presentation of the facts.  Screaming, cursing, and abusing others<br>only serves to make people think less of you and be less willing to<br>help you when you need it.<br><br>If you're upset at something or someone, wait until you've had a<br>chance to calm down and think about it.  A cup of coffee or a good<br>night's sleep works wonders on your perspective.  Hasty words<br>create more problems than they solve.  Try not to say anything to<br>others you wouldn't say to them in person in a room full of people.<br><br>(2)  Your Postings Reflect Upon You -- Be Proud of Them<br>=======================================================<br><br>Most people on NETNEWS will know you only by what you say and how<br>well you say it.  Take some time to make sure each posting is<br>something that will not embarrass you.  Minimize your spelling<br>errors and make sure that the article is easy to read and<br>understand.  Writing is an art, and to do it well requires<br>practice.  Since much of how people judge you on the net is based<br>on your writing, such time is well spent.<br><br>(3)  Don't Use Foul or Obscene Language<br>=======================================<br><br>Language that would be considered inappropriate for a letter to the<br>editor of a newspaper is also inappropriate for NETNEWS.<br><br>(4)  If You Have Nothing Significant to Say, Don't Post<br>=======================================================<br><br>Avoid postings that have no significant content.  A posting of the<br>sort that summarizes someone else's post and adds a statement that<br>amounts to "Me too" is a waste of time for the thousands of people<br>who read the group.  Try not to fall into the trap of thinking you<br>need to respond to each article you read.<br><br>(5)  Be Brief<br>=============<br><br>Never say in ten words what you can say in fewer. Say it succinctly<br>and it will have a greater impact.  Remember that the longer you<br>make your article, the fewer people will bother to read it.<br><br>(6)  Don't Overdo Signatures<br>============================<br><br>Signatures are nice and can tell the world something about you, but<br>keep them short.  Two or three lines are usually plenty.  A signature<br>that's longer than the message itself is considered to be in bad<br>taste.  Generally a signature should beÃ£|no more than four lines.Ã£%<br><br>The main purpose of a signature is to help people locate you on the<br>net, not learn your life story.  Your signature could include your<br>name and e-mail address, but don't include drawings, pictures, maps,<br>or other graphics in your signature -- it's not the appropriate<br>place for such material, which is often viewed as rude by other<br>readers.<br><br>(7)  Don't Quote People Without Their Permission<br>================================================<br><br>E-mail and messages sent to you should be considered confidential.<br>Never post someone's mail to you, unless you have their explicit<br>permission.<br><br>(8 )  Use Descriptive Titles<br>===========================<br><br>The subject line of an article is there to enable a person with a<br>limited amount of time to decide whether or not to read your<br>article.  Tell people what the article is about before they read<br>it.  A title like "Car for Sale" doesn't help as much as "66 MG<br>Midget for sale: Pittsburgh PA".  Don't expect people to read your<br>article to find out what it's about, because many of them won't<br>bother.  Some computers truncate the length of the subject line to<br>40 characters, so keep your subjects short and to the point.<br><br>(9)  Select the Appropriate Newsgroup<br>=====================================<br><br>Some newsgroups are intended for discussions and some for<br>announcements or queries.  It is not usually a good idea to carry<br>on discussions in newsgroups that are designated otherwise.  It is<br>never a good idea to carry on "meta-discussions" about whether a<br>given discussion is appropriate -- such traffic mushrooms until<br>nobody can find articles that belong.<br><br>Likewise, posting to an empty or seldom used group with an attitude<br>of "Hey, folks, here's an empty group we can use for whatever we<br>want" is frowned upon.  This sort of activity reflects poorly on<br>you and your institution.<br><br>(10)  Avoid Excessive Cross-posting<br>===================================<br><br>You may "cross-post" an article to two or more groups at once by<br>listing all of the groups, separated by commas but no spaces, on<br>the "Newsgroups:" line.  Do cross-post your article when you are<br>sure it's appropriate; however, in most cases, posting to more than<br>two or three groups is considered excessive.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>(11)  Personal arguments are inappropriate in a public group<br>=====================================================<br><br>If you're unhappy with what some user said, don't start a personal<br>argument publicly.  Send private e-mail instead.<br><br>(12)  Think About Your Audience<br>===============================<br><br>When you post an article, think about the people you're trying to<br>reach.  Asking chess questions on rec.games will not reach as many<br>of the people you want to reach as if you asked them on rec.games.chess.<br>Try to get the most appropriate audience for your posting, not the<br>widest.<br><br>If your message is of interest to a limited geographic area<br>(apartments, car sales, meetings, concerts), use the "Distribution"<br>feature to restrict the distribution of the message to your local<br>area.  For example, if it only belongs on Penn State's local<br>systems, post to a psu group.<br><br>If you want to try a test of something, don't use a net-wide<br>newsgroup!  Messages in widely-used groups that say "This is a<br>test" are likely to cause large numbers of caustic messages to flow<br>into your reader.  You are welcome to use psu.test to try out the<br>posting software to your heart's content.  That's what it's there<br>for!<br><br>(13)  Be Careful with Humor and Sarcasm<br>=======================================<br><br>Without the voice inflections and body language of personal<br>communications, it's easy for a remark meant to be funny to be<br>misinterpreted.  Subtle humor tends to get lost, so take steps to<br>make sure that people realize you're trying to be funny.  The net<br>has developed a symbol called the smiley face.  It looks like :-)<br>and points out sections of articles with humorous intent.  No<br>matter how broad the humor or satire, it's safer to remind people<br>that you are being funny.  (Turn your head sideways to see the<br>smile).<br><br>(14)  Describe What You're Following Up<br>=======================================<br><br>When you're following up someone's article, please summarize the<br>parts of the article to which you're responding.  This allows<br>readers to appreciate your comments rather than trying to remember<br>what the original article said.  Also, it's possible for your<br>response to get to some sites before the original article does.<br><br>Summarization is best done by including appropriate quotes from the<br>original article.  Ã£|Don't include the entire article,Ã£% since it<br>will irritate the people who have already seen it.  Even if you're<br>responding to the entire article, summarize only the major points<br>you are discussing.<br><br>(15)  Posting a Followup vs. Sending Personal Reply<br>===================================================<br><br>One of the biggest problems we have on the network is that, when<br>someone asks a question, many people have identical answers, and<br>dozens of these identical answers pour through the net.  Therefore,<br>before you submit a followup article, read the rest of the articles<br>in the newsgroup to see whether someone has already said what you<br>want to say.  If someone has, don't repeat it.  If you want your<br>opinion recorded, however, e-mail your answer to the person instead<br>of posting a followup, and suggest that they summarize in a single<br>posting to NETNEWS (see next section).  This way the net will only<br>see a single copy of the answers, no matter how many people answer<br>the question.<br><br>If you post a question, please remind people to send you the<br>answers by e-mail and offer to summarize them to the network.<br><br>And remember, if in doubt, send e-mail.<br><br>(16)  Summarizing Responses to Questions<br>========================================<br><br>When you request information from the network, it's common courtesy<br>to report your findings so that others can benefit as well.  The<br>best way of doing this is to take all the responses you receive and<br>edit them into a single article that's posted to the places where<br>you originally posted your question.  Take the time to strip<br>headers, combine duplicate information, and write a short summary.<br>Try to credit the information to the people that sent it to you,<br>where possible.<br><br>(17)  Advertising Policy<br>========================<br><br>Announcement of professional products or services on Netnews is<br>allowed; however, since someone else is paying the phone bill, it's<br>important that the announcement be of overall benefit to Netnews.<br>Post to an appropriate newsgroup, never to a general purpose group.<br>Clearly mark your article as a product announcement in the subject.<br>Never repeat these -- one article per product at the most;<br>preferably group everything into one article.  Advertising hype is<br>especially frowned upon -- stick to technical facts.  This policy is, of course,<br>subject to change if it becomes a problem.<br><br>(18 )  Don't Break the Law<br>=========================<br><br>Once something is posted onto the network, it's effectively in the<br>public domain.  You should also be aware that posting movie<br>reviews, song lyrics, or anything else published under a copyright<br>could cause you, your company, or the net itself to be held liable<br>for damages, so we highly recommend caution in using this material.<br><br>It's perfectly legal to reproduce short extracts of a copyrighted<br>work for critical purposes, but reproduction in whole is strictly<br>and explicitly forbidden by U.S. and international copyright law.<br>(Otherwise, there would be no way for the artist to make money, and<br>there would thus be less motive for people to go to the trouble of<br>making their art available at all.  The crime of theft is as<br>serious in this context as any other, even though you may not have<br>to pick locks, mask your face, or conceal merchandise.)<br><br>All opinions or statements made in Netnews articles should be taken<br>as the opinions of the person who wrote the article.  They don't<br>necessarily represent the opinions of the employer of that person,<br>the owner of the computer from which the message was posted, or<br>anyone involved with Netnews or the underlying networks which<br>comprise Netnews.  All responsibility for statements made in<br>Netnews rests with the individual posting the article.<br><br>Posting of information on Netnews is to be viewed as similar to<br>publication.  Because of this, don't post instructions for how to<br>do some illegal act (such as jamming radar or obtaining cable TV<br>service illegally); also don't ask how to do illegal acts by<br>posting to the net.<br><br>(19)  Cite Appropriate References<br>=================================<br><br>If you're using facts to support a cause, state where they came<br>from.  Don't take someone else's ideas and use them as your own.<br>You don't want someone pretending that your ideas are theirs; show<br>them the same respect.<br><br>(20)  Mark or Rotate Answers and Spoilers<br>=========================================<br><br>When you post something (like a movie review that discusses a<br>detail of the plot) which might spoil a surprise for other people,<br>please mark your message with a warning so that they can skip the<br>article.  When you post a message with a spoiler in it, make sure the word<br>"spoiler" is part of the Subject line.<br></div>
