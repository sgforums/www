Within 3 months, more Reichens have died then in the whole of World War 2. These deaths are a combination of the factors of civil war, lawlessness, starvation, and the lack of potable drinking water. The nonexistent economy, facilities and infrastructure of current Reichland are also contributing factors.<br><br>Xing Shiana has decided to send a small force of para peacekeeping units which will be depolyed in Reichland, the objective of this mission is to stop the conflict completely and to restore order, humanitarian aid supplies, and a semblance of a normal life to Reichens for reconstruction.<br><br>Xing Shiana has chosen not to take sides with either of the Reichen factions, but its objective is merely to stop the war, and redirect them to solve their political difference through diplomatic channels.<br><br>Please note that will Xing Shiana units will not take part in any combat, when fired upon, they will return fire in a measure that will remove the threat to them. Do not, I repeat, do not try to be funny with them.<br><br>Regards,<br>Xing Shiana</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Clearing The Way</strong><br><br>Sea of Fuchs<br><br>In order to deliver practical quantities of humanitarian aid to Reichland, the sea lanes had to be open in order for the aid to arrive through shipping routes. But the Sea of Fuchs was now a confusing and dangerous jumble of rebel and imperialist submarines playing a deadly game of silent cat and mouse. They attacked anything that sounded vaguely hostile, be it an enemy submarine or a cargo ship loaded with humanitarian supplies.<br><br>The first step of opening the sea routes for humanitarian aid to arrive was to enforce security in the area, and removing the danger from that area was a fleet of seven Alabaster hunter killer submarines.<br><br>They detected the Reichen submarines, a motley collection consisting mainly of a varied types of diesel electric submarines, along with two ageing nuclear attack submarines acquired second-hand from other nations long before the Reichen sonars could even pick them up. It was impossible to tell who was on whose side. But Xing Shiana was supposed to be neutral, so all it mattered was that nobody fired on them. Spread roughly twenty nautical miles apart, the seven Alabasters moved closer to the Reichen submarines, which were spread over an area of roughly a fifty nautical miles. Rebel and Imperialists subs fighting for the control of the all important naval sea lanes that could tip the power at sea, a watery war zone that the humanitarian aid had to pass through.<br><br>One of the Alabasters moved forward of the pack, drawing to about five nautical miles and activating its powerful active sonar, pinging all the subs in the area to let them know that Xing Shianan naval power was in the area, neutral for nowÂ… that was if the Riechens of both sides have gotten word of the Xing Shianan humanitarian mission announcement, and most importantly, agreed with it.<br><br>But apparently somebody did not; three torpedoes were launched, nobody knew if from Imperialist or Rebel, at the lead Alabaster at extreme range, which were deftly defeated when the Alabaster went silent. Now the rules of engagement were changed. The secondary orders were to remove the area of all possible threats if engaged.<br><br>The seven Alabasters did so with extreme efficiency, launching their Mk-1X hypercavation torpedoes at every contact they had. Unlike normal torpedoes, which plowed through the water at most 60 knots, the 1X torpedoes skidded through the ocean at over 800 knots. Having more then 10 times the speed of normal torpedoes, and five times the range, the Riechen submarines were by all practical purposes, stationary as they turned and ran.<br><br>There was no time to react, over 34 Reichen submarines were killed within half an hour. Only five diesel electric submarines made it out from the fray. The entire Reichen submarine force, Rebel or Imperialist, had been virtually destroyed.<br><br>Now the sea lanes were open. It was time to secure the ground.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TO: Reichen Imperial Emergency Committee<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recommendations</strong></span><br><br>1) "Operation Starvation": - rations and supplies should be strictly control with individuals only to receive them with register cards or identification cards issue by Imperial government. Food industry is under imperial government control.<br><br>2) Protection of civilians and private properties: - request civilian volunteers to setup homeguard units and provide adequate arms to them to protect themselves. As rebels should not attack civilians or they will be discredited. Relocate the civilians into one area so as to better protect them.<br><br>3) Security Checkpoints: - Setup security checkpoints. Ensure checkpoints are bunked with armor, obstacles. Need to have proper hardened concrete bunk security house to protect security forces from terrorist attacks.<br><br>4) Intelligence: - Intilligence units proper organised, structured and maintained communications. The Great Republics will maintain high security level on borders to prevent cross border activities and movement of supplies. Civilians should be encouraged in anonymous ways to provide intelligence.<br><br>Hope those recommendations will help the Imperial government win the war.<br><br>FROM:<br>Colonel Steward Wo Guan Jia<br>of the Great Republics Combined Security Forces.
