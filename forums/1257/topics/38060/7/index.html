SENSE war officials indicated that the strikes did not have anything to do with the timing of KaiserÂ’s speech, though they stated that the timing was Â“ironic.Â”<br><br>Interestingly, no antiaircraft fire resisted the massive attack, which inflicted heavy damage all over the nation, among the targets destroyed were the Reichland University, several governmental buildings, communications hubs and power plants, leaving the entire nation without power or communications. Reportedly, military targets in Reichland had been independently sought out by the units conducting the strikes and destroyed with precision weapons to limit civilian damage.<br><br><img src="http://www.madtrimmer.com/tn_Picture1.jpg"><img src="http://www.madtrimmer.com/tn_Picture3.jpg"><img src="http://www.madtrimmer.com/tn_Picture5.jpg"><img src="http://www.madtrimmer.com/tn_Picture7.jpg"><br><span class="small">A sequence of dramatic pictures showing a Reichland APC filled with soldiers being hit by a SENSE smart weapon. </span><br><br>Â“It was surreal,Â” Said shell-shocked housewife Au Tung, Â“Across the street the warplanes or missiles struck and destroyed a camouflaged military barracks the army set up in the junkyard across the road, scattering parts of what looks like fifty, sixty soldiers all over the place, but our buildings were hardly touched. At another street, they killed one soldier standing at the street corner smoking with one of those small missiles that come out of the sky. Boom! HeÂ’s all over the place.Â”<br><br>SENSE war officials have confirmed that due to the success of previous missions in wiping out most of the targets, the amount of firepower launched in this blitz was sufficient enough that even individual military personnel could be considered as targets.<br><br>Some ReichLand soldiers are understandably distressed by this development. Several hysterical soldiers had to be hauled into ambulances from the local asylum following the air strikes.<br><br>Â“Surrender to them now!Â” Screamed one of the blood-splattered soldiers as he was being put in a straitjacket. Â“We cannot win! TheyÂ’re gonna kill us all donÂ’t you see? Listen to their demands! Save ourselves! Overthrow and kill the royalty! They caused all this!Â”<br><br><img src="http://www.madtrimmer.com/1104.jpg"><br><span class="small">Makeshift military camps set up to base troops after the destruction of Reichland military camps were flattened by the SENSE blitz. </span><br><br>Targeting of individual military personnel could be seen all over the nations, with scorch marks, bloody stains, pieces of burned combat fatigues and body parts a common sight all over the nation. SENSE generals have attributed this Â“marvel of precisionÂ” to Xing Shianan cruise missiles.<br><br>The latest assault is a big blow to what is already a virtually non-existent ReichLand military.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Strike of Strikes</strong><br><br>The next night of in FredrickBurg following the attack the previous day later was heralded in with massive missile and shell bombardment, followed by mass bombing runs in which swarms of SENSE warplanes dropped tons of armament into the city centre, knocking every building down to street level. What was once a heavily urbanized city centre with lined with skyscrapers was now a gigantic ocean of rubble twisted steel, and dead bodies.<br><br>But the strike was not finished, SENSE aircraft now started to drop deep penetration precision bombs targeted at the FredrickBurg sewer grid that blasted gaping holes in the ground, into the gigantic holes fell precision fuel air explosives and MOAB which turned the refuge of Jaegers in there into one gigantic thermobaric oven, crushing and burning them where they hid. Napalm and white phosphorus was dropped in large amounts, both by planes and artillery to turn the area into a five kilometre square area of hell on earth. The city centre was now one gigantic blazing crater that could be seen from hundreds of kilometres away, a man-made wildfire in a man-made jungle.<br><br>The heat generated by this incendiary attack was so intense that it created a powerful convection current of superheated air that rose rapidly into the air, created a stiff two knot wind as cooler air moved in to below it. The superheated air cooled and condensed as it rose and fell back as a light drizzle that petered down on the inferno. It was winter in Prussia with temperatures of 5 degrees Celsius, but the ambient temperatures in the city centre and around hovered at forty to fifty.<br><br>Into this hell on earth charged the SENSE armoured units, rolling down the intact streets and into the destroyed city centre, their tracks scrabbling and crushing the loose debris as the machines of the four SENSE nations converged from all directions through the burning pyres that had been a city centre.<br><br>Amazingly, some had survived the hellish bombardment, many of them burned terribly and trapped within the debris- they were the exception. Charred bodies and body parts lay everywhere, carbonised in their grotesque positions. Some of the dying was still moving faintly, cracking their blackened flesh and exposing red flesh poured jellied blood. It was a sight even the battle hardened SENSE soldiers found hard to handle, and they machine-gunned the living pieces of carbon where they lay, the burnt bodies coming apart in flakes and hardened chunks. They had all heard the phrase Â“war is hellÂ” but never thought they would never see such a compatible visual. In many cases, the SENSE tanks could not avoid driving over the bodies, and found that they crunched and came apart into black crumbs under the tracks easily.<br><br>Some of the survivors still resisted, firing at the SENSE armour as they approached despite their own terrible injuries. SENSE troopers watched quietly as a Jaeger burnt across the left half of his body, with his charred left arm generally degloved of flesh and skeletonized, charged a Xing Shianan FCS, firing his rifle with his good arm. A burst from the .50cal ended his misery. The SENSE units had little trouble with the remaining resistance and they were eliminated quickly.<br><br>Some remnant Jaegers still survived in the sewer systems, those that escaped the bombing. But they were killed when sewerage flow redirected by SENSE engineers surged into the deepest tunnel networks and engulfed the Jaegers where they hid, killing those who managed to find refuge from the flood of vile biological and chemical waste with their accompanying toxic fumes. Most of their bodies were washed out along with the flow, but some remained where they were trapped, where they would be discovered some time later by workers involved in the reconstruction.<br><br>It was over, of the 74,000 Jaegers that had hunkered down in the city centre, only twenty four survivors were rescued from the area by SENSE units. The rest of the thousands had been burnt, crushed or drowned in sewerage were they hid. The last of the old regime had been effectively eliminated.<br><br>A few days later, the body of ex-duke Reynard would be discovered amidst the piles of the thousands of bodies that were flushed by the sewer system. He had shot himself in the head. The regime of a dictator was finally over, and Prussia would once again be free.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Victory</strong><br><br>The Prussian-SENSE war was over, and the cost had been great. Millions of people had lost their lives and billons of dollars worth of damage to property had been caused. It would take some time before the scarred landscapes of Prussia, 440mhz and Malaya could be healed of their wounds of war, and already the people were working to get back to the humdrum of peace.<br><br>Prussia now lay completely under SENSE control. The remaining Jaegers having surrendered or fought to the bitter end. Lacking the leadership of the late Reynard, they were a disorganized, scattered bunch which were mercilessly hunted down by SENSE units and the SENSE-friendly Prussia post war militia. Most of the Jaeger high commanders committed suicide while the lower ranked Jaegers tried to resist, but it was futile. They were killed, pounded to dust wherever they posed a security threat by overwhelming firepower which was overkill for their strength. But no SENSE trooper wanted to do unnecessary footslogging to root them out. Nobody wanted to be the last man to be killed in this war. The Jaegers had ceased to exist as an organization.<br><br>In the streets, the official Prussian surrender was met with much celebration on the streets by the liberated Prussians as they tasted their first breaths of freedom. SENSE MPs had a hard time controlling the public persecution the family members of the Jaegers and generally anybody related to the old regime. Many were publicly humiliated and some were even executed via street justice. After years of repression under the Grand Duchies, the people could finally turn their resentment against their former masters, and they did it ruthlessly, with only SENSE MPs in the way to limit the lynching. Humanitarian aid started to arrive in the country to be distributed where it was needed, and the rebuilding of Prussia, under SENSE control, begin.<br><br>Prussia was now a democracy, able to elect its own government but with its security basically maintained jointly by the SENSE nations that had taken part in the war. Prussia could maintain a small self-defense force, made up mainly of poorly trained troops equipped with second-hand, outdated equipment. Pacifism would be the way of the Prussian now. The people elected in opposition leader Hans Dober of the Democratic Prussia Party as their president and government. Under the old regime they had been banned and jailed, with Hans having done over 15 years of jail time as a political prisoner.<br><br>The war had cost a lot; Prussia had lost a good part of its younger generation, with the SENSE countries suffering too, but to a lesser extent. The true number of people killed would never be known, but some have tried to put a figure on them:<br><br>Prussian/SENSE War Combatant Casualties<br><br>Prussia         : 2,500,000 dead, 4,500,000 wounded<br>Eziiumi Shi : 120,950 dead, 190,460 wounded<br>Shingapooru: 70,800 dead, 120,000 wounded<br>440mhz: 25,020 dead, 56,230 wounded<br>Xing Shiana: 1,067 dead, 5,340 wounded<br><br>Force Involvement<br><br>Most infantry: Eziiumi Shi and Shingapooru<br>Most armor: Eziiumi Shi<br>Most Airpower: Xing Shiana<br>Largest Navy: Xing Shiana<br><br>Least infantry: Xing Shiana<br>Least Armor: Xing Shiana<br>Least Airpower: Prussia<br>Smallest Navy: 440 mhz<br></div>
