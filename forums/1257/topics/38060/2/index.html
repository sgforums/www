            <div class='col-md body'><strong>440 mHz steps up arms production</strong><br><br>Back at the mHzen War Department ...<br><br>Colonel Motive walked slowly into his office. The sight of a familiar blue file caught his face. A report from the War Factory.<br><br>Motive opened the file and read it's contents. The War Factory wants to recall all cheftains back to put it out of service. Reason given: Cheftains outdated.<br><br>Motive thought: "yeah ... we've been using the cheftains for a while. It ought to be scrapped ... "<br>Another sentence caught his attention. Proposed metal from scrapped cheftains be used to strengthen the armour of the reserved T-72s and T-90 tanks. Motive searched through his table for a pen. Signining on the dotted line found at the end of the page. Motive closed the file and called for his secretary to get the file sent back to the War Factory<br><br>"there goes the cheftains, through my 30 years of serving, the cheftain have served us well ..."<br>Motive was full of nostalgia. Motive looked out of his window that overlooked the deployment bay of the tanks. A<br>M-1 Abrams rolled past him in full glory. The armour still pretty much shiny.<br><br>"must've been fresh out of the Factory ... "<br><br><strong>SENSE holds out at phase line Alpha after the counteroffensive to throw the Prussians off balance</strong><br><br>Twilight<br><br>Wong sat in front of the bonfire with his comrades and the soldiers of XSAF. While both parties were exchanging jokes and talking about anything and everything under the sun, Wong was looking aimlessly into the burning pile of wood, holding onto his tin cup of hot cocoa that he got from the supply tent.<br><br>WongÂ’s HK MSG-90 was on his lap, he refused to be apart from his rifle no matter what happens. It was already 2147 hours on WongÂ’s digital watch. Wong placed his cup on the floor beside him and straightened up.<br><br>Â“Hey Wong! Where are you going?? Sit down and relax Â… Â“ one of his comrades said.<br><br>Â“No, I got to keep watch, the enemy might strike back anytime.Â”<br><br>The look on WongÂ’s face left the greenhorn private speechless. WongÂ’s eyes gave the look that no one could ever impersonate. His eyes tell many battles that he had gone through and many thousand young lives gone in just in an instance. Wong was conscripted when the war in Malaya began. He had been through literal hell, crawling under flying lead and running through flying soil and flying shrapnel. The many scars on his body and a cross scar across his left check tell the many dangers and peril he had gone through. Wong walked away with his rifle slung over his soldier. There was silence at the bonfire as everyone seated there looked at Wong walking away. Among them, they knew that they couldnÂ’t say anything about him. His battle experience was at least 10 times of theirs and the amount of hell he saw couldnÂ’t be compared with what they had gone through.<br><br>Wong walked to the knoll that overlooked the road that the Prussians had retreated earlier on. Dead bodies could be see strewn all over the place and dark shadows formed over the craters that the artillery fell on. Wong looked up into the sky, the moon was much happier than before. Wong liked the night; he seemed to have an affinity with the darkness. WongÂ’s thoughts began to run, he remember the times where he would wait for his parents to sleep, then he would sneak out of the house in the middle of the night and take a stroll in the woods that was located about 50 yards from his house. He would then come back before the sun rose and couldnÂ’t wake up until the late afternoon the very next day. He often did this and his parents were very much worried that their son was suffering from some kind of sickness.<br><br>Wong laid out his bipod and went on prone. He took out his NVG and scanned the place. Everything seemed pretty normal. Suddenly there was a rustle in the bushes nearby. WongÂ’s heart beat faster. Wong reached slowly for his USP pistol in its holster and pulled it out slowly, he then took aim and the direction of the sound. A dark figure emerged from the bushes; it was Chan, his subordinate.<br><br>Â“You dickhead! DonÂ’t you ever do that again! I could have very well shot you!Â” Wong whispered loudly with breath coming out with a considerable amount of force. Chan noticed that the leaves that were near his face moved. Must have been using quite some air there.<br><br>Â“Sorry captain. I saw you leaving the bonfire so I followed you.Â”<br><br>Chan was carrying a RPG-7 tucked under his arm with his AR-15 rifle slung over his shoulder. Chan survived the battle of the bluff in Malaya. The top finally decides to pull the 101st division out of the bluff to incur any more casualties. Chan was one of the divisionÂ’s bazooka men. The division already had a turnover of 150% with all of its junior officers replaced. Chan was the lucky one that survived through the end. Chan was sent to the town of Webding to relieve the 74th division of its duties. Wong didnÂ’t leave; he wanted to guard the town till it was completely safe.<br><br>Â“Captain, what are you going to do when this war is over??Â”<br><br>Wong looked at Chan with bambi eyes.<br><br>Â“ Â… I miss my wife and kidsÂ” was the reply that came out of WongÂ’s mouth. Chan was speechless.<br><br>Â“Why didnÂ’t you leave with the rest of your division when we came to relieve you??Â”<br><br>Â“I didnÂ’t want to Â… I have to duty to do for my nation.Â”<br><br>The spirit and energy that accompanied those words struck Chan to the marrow. He didnÂ’t know what to say to Wong. Chan proned with Wong a meter or so away from him. Chan didnÂ’t know why the heck he followed Wong out but he didnÂ’t mind accompanying this young man of 23 who had seen much thunderstorms. Suddenly Wong jerked, he looked through his NVG to spot an unusually shaped bush, which was pretty large, hidden behind a group of large trees. Wong caught movement around that bush and saw the reflection of a pair of eyes.<br><br>Â“They are here!Â” Wong whispered<br><br>Chan was non-chalant. He lagged and finally his eyes grew wider.<br><br>Â“What??!! But we just drove them out today!Â” Chan whispered in shock.<br>Â“You have not seen the resilience of these Jaegars, theyÂ’ll be right under your noses before you even can say deoxyribonucleic acid!Â”<br><br>Wong looked through his scope and spotted a Prussian scout creeping forward. Wong found the forehead Â… Â“boom!Â”. The Prussian fell. Suddenly the unusually-shaped bushed move. It was a aquanix! Chan position his RPG-7 on his shoulder and Â“fhoom!Â”. An the streak of light homed in quickly at the side of the aquanix and sent pieces of burning metal into the air. Wong peered through his NVG. Must have been the remainder of the Prussian troops that escaped earlier on into the woods. Wong was thinking Â… how the hell did they manage to sneak an aquanix out?? The Jaegars always surprise him with their eccentric tactics and maneuvers Â…<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Newsreel, SENSE-Prussian war update</strong><br><br>This is what has happened so far in Malaya, after the fall of Webding, the Prussians sent several regiments after the retreating SENSE forces to chase them into The Borderlands of 440Mhz, only to be thrown back a massive counteroffensive of SENSE units. Prussian forces have retreated back to their lines.<br><br>Currently the war in Malaya is taking a predictable course. The Borderlands of 440Mhz straddles the north of Malaya, with their 304km borders defined by a long stretch of highlands. Beyond that, the Borderlands of 440Mhz is a long, narrow nation that straddles this border, the generally terrain being relatively flat plain, perfect tank country.<br><br>Though there are still substantial SENSE forces in the form of Eziiumi-Shi, Shingapooru and Xing Shiana in the west of Malaya, which are rushing east to the main battles being fought, most of the Prussians coming in from the east have diverted north in an attempt to invade 440Mhz, the reason being that the country could be used as a massive staging point for any SENSE attempt to retake Malaya. With 440Mhz out of the picture, SENSE would have a lot of problems deploying into Malaya. After which, Prussia could drive east and concentrate on taking Malaya without worrying of a flanking SENSE attack from the north.<br><br>In this attempt to take 440Mhz, the Prussians have swung three of their five armies north to take Webding, a strategic town that straddles a pass in the highlands between Malaya and 440Mhz. Leaving two of their armies to hold off the SENSE forces coming in from the west. The battle for Malaya has been split into two fronts, one on the 440Mhz front, know as Phase Line Alpha, a rough stretch of flat land at the 440Mhz border that guards the Webding exit, where three Prussian armies face off against SENSE lines which had collapsed back following the fall of Webding to strengthen the defense. 440Mhz and now deploying Xing Shiana forces are the defenders here.<br><br>The other battle fought in Malaya is a region of dense forest and bayou terrain (called the Bog) in the western front that has come to be known as the Bog War, neither sides making much progress against each other in the swampy and dense terrain. Two Prussian armies face off the SENSE army made up of those that had retreated from coast of Indo Barbi, back through Kechi Barbi and into the Bog along with up with SENSE forces in the west that had been moving east to hold off the Prussians.<br><br>At Phase Line Alpha, the Prussians had sent an invading shock force of armored infantry (mechanized infantry supported by tanks) to punch a hole in what they though was a stretched SENSE line to open up the way for the less mobile units to pour though into 440Mhz. However, the assault had been beaten off by a counteroffensive the SENSE forces had made with fresh units 440Mhz had rushed straight out of the factories and the boot camps, along with ultra rapid deployment Xing Shiana light units that made it there in record time. The lines now stand as they were before the Prussian incursion, with the Prussians strengthening the position at Webding and the SENSE forces getting ready for a big push down south back into Malaya.<br><br>On Prussian front, Eziiumi and Shingapooru armies have slowed down into glacier like advances after the nice, even terrain of Pronamdy Coast ended and they had to fight their way through rough, heavily wooded terrain strongly defended by the Prussian Home Guard. Though not making great progress, the incursion into Prussia has managed to split the Prussian war effort, forcing them to divert their resources to defending their country instead of putting more pressure on the backpedaling SENSE forces in Malaya.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Battle for Webding. Defense of Phase Line Alpha</strong><br><br>Ordeal<br><br>Wong leaned back on the wall of the shop house that was badly destroyed in the invasion of the Prussian troops. Though they had driven them back, Wong knew at the back of his head that the reinforcements stationed in this town would not be a match to 3 divisions of Prussian armour and soldiers stationed at the outskirts of Webding. Ready to rush in any moment.<br><br>Wong scanned the surroundings, several mHzen troops huddled around the protect them from the rain that fell on earlier. The weather was terrible.<br><br>Â“bunch of amateurs Â… must be fresh out of BMT Â… this kind of weather mean nothing Â…Â” Wong thought.<br><br>Minutes seem like hours and WongÂ’s eyes grew heavier and heavier. Suddenly an explosion jerk him right out of where he was. Wong scrambled to his feet and ran for cover. Peering through the corner of the wall in which he was hiding behind, Wong caught sight of the PrussianÂ’s aquanix and several soldiers marching along the lumbering tank.<br><br>Â“What?!Â” Wong exclaimed. Â“we just drove them out hours ago and they are back again!Â”<br><br>Wong got pretty worried about the whole situation. The Red Alert signal was given and soldiers scrambled to their positions. Leopard II rolled into the town center and fire a well-placed round at the side of the aquanix, leaving it in flames and sending Prussian soldiers scrambling for cover. Indeed the armour of the aquanix was no match to the firepower of the Leopard II though the feared AT squads of Prussia could really punch a hole in the armour of MLF. Wong notice a group of Prussians flanking the side of the Leopard II. The Leopard II was gearing up for another shot at an incoming aquanix further up. Wong recognized the familiar PO-1 panzerfaust that caused so much damage to MLFÂ’s armour divisions. Wong ran up the building that was nearest to him and got a view that overlooked the right flank of the Leopard II. True enough, the AT squad was setting up their position to take out the Leopard II. Wong had to do something quick, he took aim at the forehead of the one holding the P0-1 and delivered the bullet straight in between the eyes of the Prussian. The rest ducked, hiding from the view of WongÂ’s sight. Wong kept vigil while the Leopard II continue to pound 3 more oncoming aquanix tanks. Wong took out two more Prussians who foolishly tried to retrieve the P0-1. The Leopard II began to labour forward. This signaled Wong to move out with the tank. Wong scrambled down and jumped on the back of the tank, outrunning the remaining AT squad and taking all of them down. The Leopard II lumbered forward, joined by another platoon of infantry that took cover in a nearby house.<br><br>The Leopard II managed to squeeze into a street and lumbered forward to join the rest of the armour the west of the town. Suddenly Wong was thrown of the tank. Stunned and shaken, Wong found his rifle and ran behind a wall, the Leopard I was hit by an panzerfaust.<br><br>Â“damn these panzerfaust!Â”<br>Wong dashed towards the alley that gave the view to the tank, Wong leaned against the wall and took out a flash. Pulling the pin he threw the grenade in. Â“phoom!Â” went the flash. Wong twisted his body and found 4 Prussians leaning against the walls. He took them out slowly, all with a well-placed shot in the head. Wong was notorious for his accuracy with the rifle. So far, no one could be found in the army who could match his accuracy.<br><br>Wong dashed back to where he was, the platoon that was with him were no where in sight. Wong got pretty annoyed. Wong heard gunfire a distant from where he was. Wong rushed to the scene of battle. Wong joined the mHzen troops that was holding back an oncoming wave of Prussian troops. The PrussianÂ’s G3 MG sent the mHzen troops ducking for cover. Casualties started to rise for the mHzen soldiers. They only inflicted a substantial amount damaged on the Prussian soldiers. They were too numerous. The PC gave the order to fall back, an order that one in war would not like to give at all. The soldiers retreated back reluctantly, still holding strong on their position. Finally they reached the town center and took up positions there. MLF set up m209 MG positions that criss-cross and cover the road that they just came in. As more comrades began to fall back, the MG took their aim. The sight of the first Prussian sent a wave of bullets that punched deeply into the enemyÂ’s oncoming line.<br><br>Wong ran into the building that was directly opposite the road and set up his position there. For 1 hour the MLH held their positions strongly, no allowing any Prussians to get past that road. Just then, the sight of an aquanix tank sent shivers down the spines of the mHzen troops. They didnÂ’t have AT weapons with them now and the 5.56mm caliber of the m209 tickled the body of the aquanix as it lumbered forward. Wong knew there was no hope already, this sight of the aquanix meant that the Leopard II division had been wiped out. The PC screamed at the top of his voice in the midst of the firing.<br><br>Â“Fall back! Fall back to the bahn! WeÂ’ll hold them there!Â”<br><br>Wong scrambled out of the house and joined the retreating soldiers to take up positions at the bahn that was only 1 km away from the borders of 440mHz. They finally reached the bahn and took up positions all around, anticipating the Prussian to appear any moment.<br><br>Â“guys, listen up, no matter what weÂ’ve got to hold this even if this meant fighting to the very endÂ” the PC grunted.<br><br>Everyone was anxious, they knew that their chances of getting out of this alive was slimmer than ever. But everyone of the soldiers was willing to lay down his life for his country to serve to the very end. WongÂ’s thought started to run wild, he finally admitted in his whole life he hasnÂ’t felt as scared as he is feeling now. The shape of the aquanix began to take shape as it emerges from the corner the road. MG positions started to pound the tank with all hope of taking it down if possible. But they knew that they are literally throwing an egg onto a rock and expecting the rock to break. As the aquanix laboured closer and closer, WongÂ’s thoughts started to run again.<br><br>Â“they could have very well fired on us now Â… why didnÂ’t they ? Â“<br>Wong then realized that the Prussian were out to intimidate them. With odds of 1:20, the Prussians grew arrogant and decide to flaunt their firepower to the mHzen troopers. Wong took aim at the bobbing heads behind the tank and managed to take a Prussian down. Just then, the roar of thunder filled the air, Wong looked up into the clear blue sky and hope appeared right before his eyes. The MAF have come to rescue them. MK-84 bombs sent the aquanix into flames and inflicting heavy casualties on the troopers who were behind the tank.<br><br>Suddenly a rumbling sound could be heard behind them, it was a familiar AGS tank of the XSAF. They came just in time! Their very own T-72s could be seen behind them with army trucks carrying reinforcements from the base. The counteroffensive began and the battle rage on for the whole day and through the night. Finally the Prussian troops pulled back, leaving the combined SENSE forces directly on Phase Line Alpha with itÂ’s captured territory retaken back from them. The mHzen incurred heavy losses in the defense of Phase Line Alpha and the top is doing nothing about it and only sending in small streams of replacement divisions. If the next wave of attack occurred anytime during the next 2 days, it could mean disaster for the SENSE troops as the defense that spread over Phase Line Alpha was thin. A single massive push could be a gap for the Prussians to stream into The Borderlands of 440mhz with no way of counterattacking back. This defense line was critical. Wong knew it.<br><br>The sound of peace and silence comforted Wong as he said there staring blankly into the ground. He wanted out and out NOW! Even the most experience veterans break down. Wong couldnÂ’t take it any longer. It was too much for him to take Â…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>mHzen War Department sends in classified weaponry to the Line</strong><br><br>Ordeal II<br><br>Wong sat in the tent, which was set up 10 meters away from the T-72 deployment bay. The activity on Phase Line Alpha was pretty much packed and rushed but he managed to find some time off to relax from all the action and combat. He had earlier on retreated from the front of Phase Line Alpha to rest and recuperate from all his injuries. As Wong sat there sipping his cup of hot cocoa, he saw through the doorway of the tank, soldiers running up and down, tanks and artillery rolling here and there. The guys up front are digging foxholes to guard the road that exits Webding. The topÂ’s final plan of defense was to retreat into the mountains and set up defensive posts there.<br><br>440mhzÂ’s mountainous borders proved to be a chore for any unfamiliar army that goes in it. The many curves and turns opens up to another dangerous terrain, which permits only a tank or a certain number of troops to pass through. It was certainly peril that lay there but for the mHzen forces, it meant an added advantage to sabotage the enemy and to throw confusion into their midst.<br><br>Wong continued in his deep thought when finally a familiar engine sound woke him out from his deep meditation. He looked out of tent doorway and spotted the Leopard II driving past his tent.<br><br>Â“Finally they bring in more tanks, Â… Â“ Wong thought.<br><br>About 36 Leopard II drove past his tent during that time, followed by 25 trucks, full of mHzen soldiers. The top was finally pouring in more and more troops onto the Line most probably because of the revelation that they received about their borders being threatened. The tent curtain, which was down at the left shuffled. Wong looked up, it was Chan. He took a cup from the table nearby and poured himself a cup of coffee.<br><br>Â“Hey Cap Â… you heard about the news recently? TheyÂ’re digging trenches for the Leopard II to be stationed in. The want to fortify the position of the Leopard II to use them as fortified cannons. Utilizing the LeopardÂ’s 120mm cannon and two mounted M60 GPMGs Â…Â”<br><br>Â“Smart move, but be warned of the panzerfaust squads, those idiots can really pack a punch. How are they going to do it??Â”<br><br>Â“Tank trenches are spread all over the line with a distance of 25 meters from one another. I heard that more weaponry is coming in. Apparently it seems that the army has much more equipment than we imagine Â… MRLS and Phalanx 20mm mini guns. The top is also pouring in ICVs to get our troops in safely.Â”<br><br>Wong keep silent. He didnÂ’t know that the army had such a diverse array of weaponry and armament in the MLF, and he thought he knew the armyÂ’s equipment from the inside out. Since when did the army have M26s MLRS  and Phalanx mini guns? Wong was indignant. The army had already had many types of combat troopers. They had light crack infantry (LCF) and crack troopers (CT); honestly, Wong didnÂ’t know whatÂ’s the difference until the war began. The LCF was meant for built-up areas, in clearing out buildings and houses. Instead of being armed with the common AR-15 rifle, the LCF was equipped with MP5s and desert eagles. Not much of firepower but when it comes to close range, these troops could really pack a blow. The CT was all-rounded but specializes more in open field combats and reconnaissance purposes.<br><br>The current situation was pretty desperate for the mHzen War Department. They were down on fuel, ammunition and soldiers. Defending Phase Line Alpha became a huge problem for them. They could not dispatch A10s and F-22s to support the defense at Phase Line Alpha due to the lack of fuel and could not provide artillery support due to the lack of ammunition among the artillery divisions. Soldiers were not properly trained and the War Department didnÂ’t want the risk of soldiers dying foolishly in the war.<br><br>Wong and Chan sat at the table, enjoy the silent communion between them. Both of them hardly have any moment of peace and silence up till now. Though it could be said that the rumbling of tanks and trucks up and down didnÂ’t give the peace and quiet we all imagine to be Â… both of them took advantage of cease fire to cool down and take a break from all the action.<br><br>Back at the War Department<br><br>Colonel Motive was staring into General WavelengthÂ’s eyes<br><br>Â“Sir! We need to put more equipment and soldiers on the Line. The Prussians may push in any moment!Â”<br><br>Â“I know that! But do know that weÂ’re shorthanded.Â”<br><br>Suddenly the phone rang. Wavelength answered it Â… although the phone conversation last only 10 minutes, it brought a smile to WavelengthÂ’s scruffy face.<br><br>Â“It was the General of XSAF, they decided to pour in fuel and ammunition for our army to support Phase Line Alpha. C-130 transport is on its way here. 3 more hours and all administration should be complete.Â”<br><br>Motive stared at Wavelength in unbelief. Unable to comprehend or digest the information that was pass on to him just only.<br><br>Â“I want you to increase the amount of M26s and phalanx mini guns and put them on the line. WeÂ’ve got to defend the line at all cost. Tell the 156th, 89th, 103rd and 35th artillery divisions to start pounding on the enemyÂ’s position. Forward the pictures taken by our scout planes and sent them to the forward observers on the line and also to the division commander (DC) of the artillery divisions. Give the order on neutralization. We wonÂ’t want our ammunition to run out too fast in this operation.Â”<br><br>Â“Sir Â… what about the War Factory??Â”<br><br>Â”Tell them to increase their production rate. Increase the workersÂ’ wages by 10% as incentives. We shall call this Operation Gateway Â…Â”<br><br>The top didnÂ’t have any intention of initiating an all-out to take out the Prussians. Though MRLS and more tanks, equipment and men are being sent out to the line, General Wavelength have no intention of revealing the armyÂ’s current strength to the Prussians. They were playing on the defensive until more SENSE troops could be sent to the line to be organized into the counteroffensive thatÂ’ll will push the Prussians out of Webding and back into Kechil Barbi. But for now, the mHzen forces have to play the defensive role in this war. No risk could be taken until the mHzen forces have more support from other SENSE nations.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The small numbers of Xing Shianan forces being deployed in the Malayan theater increase many times overnight as the massive airlift of the Ultra Rapid Reaction force starts</strong><br><br>Hangug, Borderlands of 440Mhz.<br><br>The residents of Hangug, unused to much bustle and activity in their lifestyle, watched the proceedings with much interest. The sleepy, sprawling, sparsely populated mHzen city of just 400,000 residents located near the bordering Highlands with slacking as itÂ’s traditional pastime was quite surprised when mHzen troops turned up in force one day.<br><br>The residents of the city had already expected war to come to their doorstep, given their proximity to Phase Line Alpha, and had taken the necessary precautions; the taping of windows, the stockpiling of essentials and such, but life for them during these times in general was still idyllic and slow-moving, belittling the urgency of the situation.<br><br>All that changed when the military moved in, they dug fortifications, piled sandbags and emptied strategic buildings of their protesting residents to fortify. The usually vehicle-free streets were now chocked with MLF vehicles and troops moving south to reinforce the last bastion of defense on which the sovereignty of their nation rested.<br><br>But more drastic changes were to follow. A sprawling area of virgin forest at the outskirts of the city about five kilometers long and a kilometer wide was blasted and bulldozed in just two nights, treating residents nearby to a scene of barren, flattened dirt on which combat engineers managed to lay perforated pieces of steel in record time. It had taken 36 hours of non-stop work involving as much engineering manpower that could be mustered from both the military and civilian sectors to create do this, and the purpose soon became apparent.<br><br>Just hours after completion of the military deforestation, massive military transports aircraft started to arrive, trundling down onto the improvised airstrip, delivering their loads, and taking off in rapid intervals. The pilots stopping just long enough for their cargo to clear before taxing off and taking off again.<br><br>They were the C-130s and C-17s of the Xing Shiana Ultra Rapid Reaction Force. Dropping off supplies and most importantly, troops and armor. The C-130 Hercules came in heavy with Xing Shianan infantry and supplies, while alternating C-17s Globemasters carried in 4 AGS tanks and supplies a piece. Weighting a quarter of a million kilos laden with cargo, the massive C-17s left any civilians who managed to catch a glimpse of them behind the tight security awestruck.<br><br>The airlift had strained the XAF to the maximum, having to get its entire fleet of transport aircraft up and running at maximum efficiency to make the transport of the Ultra Rapid Reaction Force possible. The turnover rate was high, aircraft arrived back in Xing Shiana after their seven hour mission just long enough to receive new aircrew, fuel and cargo before trundling off into the skies again. The stress on the airframes where brutal, but it had to be done. In the past few weeks, Xing Shianan reinforcements had been trickling into the Malayan theater slowly, but now that will quickly become a torrent. Under air superiority, the transport aircraft kept up their brutal routines until mechnical failures grounded them, but the job was more then done when that happened. Over two full battalions worth of the Xing Shiana army had been deployed into 440 Mhz.<br><br>And that was not all, with the Xing Shiana Navy fighting to keep the Sea of Fuchs open, Rapid Reaction reinforcements on transports from the sea consisting of heavier units then the Ultra Rapid Reaction force will soon be able to deploy in the Malayan theater, giving the battered SENSE forces a much needed shot in the arm.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tension rises as supplies continue to pour into Phase Line Alpha. mHzen War Department pushes reinforcements into the Line, building up firepower and ammunition. </strong><br><br>Overload<br><br>0843 hours<br><br>Wong woke up to the hustle and bustle outside his sleeping tent. Sleepy and dreary, he shuffled outside to them came, only to be greeted by the sight of moving tanks and soldiers and trucks carrying a lot of equipment. Wong scrutinized everything, most of the tanks and soldiers were from the Xing Shianian Army. Finally back-up has arrived for the mHzen forces. The sight of the AGS tanks moving in between mHzenÂ’s Leopard II and T-72s beguiled his desire for battle. Wong went and took a bath in the make-shift toilets a little off from where he was. Dangerous, but he needed the refreshment.<br><br>Changing into a new set of uniform that he got from the logistics tent. Wong grabbed his MSG-90 and went off to the supply tent to grab some ammo and rations. Walking out of the tent, he caught sight of a truck starting up. Running up to the driver he shouted in the midst of all the noise<br><br>Â“Hey! Where are you going??Â”<br><br>Â“Hangug!Â” replied the driver<br><br>Â“Can you drop me there?Â”<br><br>Â“Hop on!Â”<br><br>Wong ran to the back of the truck and jumped in. The truck moved off steadily, rocking to and fro due to the uneven road that was hastily build, leading to the city of Hangug. After a 20 minute drive, the roofs of building began to appear slowly over the horizon. Wong straighten up a little to catch a better glimpse of the city. ItÂ’s been a while ever since he saw a city that was pretty much intact, and with residents. The cityÂ’s air was much fresher than the air at the Line. Birds were flying in the air and the clean streets appealed to Wong. A sense of peace filled his heart and finally he learnt how to appreciate cities before they are gone. He was trying to digest every single detail, face and feature so that in his memory it will live forever.<br><br>At the back of his head, he knew that thereÂ’s a possibility that he may never see this city again. The driver pulled up to the city hall, stuck his head out of the window and said<br><br>Â“Here ya go Cap, you gotta get off here, IÂ’m going to the DZ to load supplies.Â”<br><br>Â“Thanks. Good work kid.Â”<br><br>The sharp features of the driver etched itself into WongÂ’s mind. Beautiful kid, he estimated the driver to be not more than 20 years old. Wong move to the back of the truck and jumped off. The solid ground that he landed on cause a inflow of peace and tranquility, causing all the horrible memories of battle and combat to be flushed out of his mind. For once, Wong didnÂ’t take notice of the no.4 he was in, the USP that was in its holster hanging from his right waist and the MSG-90 that was slung nicely over his right shoulder.<br><br>Wong walked across the street to the saloon that was directly opposite him. The moment he stepped into it, eyes were set on him as though he was a celebrity. Wong then realized that he was still a soldier and the saloon didnÂ’t expect any mHzen soldiers to visit them. Wong became embarrassed<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t worry! IÂ’m here for a drink only!Â”<br><br>The reassuring statement of Wong reverted the saloon to the state it used to be before he stepped in. He walked slowly up to the counter and took a seat, placing his rifle against the counter table below his high chair.<br><br>Â“and how can I help you sir?Â” the bartender said politely.<br><br>Â“whisky Â…Â” Wong replied.<br><br>ItÂ’s been a while since he drank, that was how many eons ago, as it seems to him. The wine was served elegantly in front of him. The touch of the cup sent a fresh new wave of peace into WongÂ’s heart, he wished he didnÂ’t have to go back to the Line. Wong brought the cup close to his mouth, the coldness of the fluid was heavenly and the bitter-sweet taste of the whisky brought back many fond memories where he would sit around the table with he comrades and share about their lives. But those were the days, all of his comrades were either missing in action or killed in combat.<br><br>Â“so Â… Captain. What do you think of the armyÂ’s decision to reinforce the Sea of Fuchs is to you?Â” the bartender asked while cleaning a glass cup.<br><br>Wong looked up, and frowned. He didnÂ’t understand a single thing the bartender was saying, as though the bartender was speaking German to him.<br><br>Â“HavenÂ’t you heard? The MN has sent out 2 aircraft carriers each carrying the AV-8B harrier II and F-117 Night Hawk individually and a considerable amount of destroyers, cruisers and submarines to support the Xing Shiana Navy.Â”<br><br>Â“No, I havenÂ’t heard of that.Â” Wong replied<br><br>Â“I thought all army personnel knew about that.Â”<br>Â“Not all Â… Â“ Wong replied.<br><br>His involvement in the defense of Webding has isolated him from the outside world without any form of media to pass on information to those who were initially sent to Webding. Wong finished up his last sip and left the saloon. Walking out into the open, he caught sight of a MLRS, up close. Never in his whole entire life in the army has he seen one of these behemoths. He had heard of them but never see them up close or being used in the army. Only the elite armour divisions had these, but it wasnÂ’t a big hoo-ha thing. The War Department intended to keep this weapon as classified until the time permits it to reveal its firepower.<br><br>Wong stood there awestruck by the sight of the MLRS. Followed by it, was a Phalanx 20mm gun. Wong had seen these, it was mean as AT weapons but only once in his whole entire army life. At that time the army still didnÂ’t have much of these in services. The War Factory was busy producing other stuff so the Phalanx didnÂ’t gain the recognition. An ICV drove behind the line. Wong ran up to the driver.<br><br>Â“Hey private! Would you give me a lift to the Line?Â”<br><br>Â“Hop on! But there might not be enough room so youÂ’ll have to squeeze.Â”<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s alright, itÂ’ll do fine.Â” Wong replied.<br><br>Running to the back, the ramp opened to the containment area for the infantry. Wong paused as partake in the silent communion between the infantry on board and him. The facial expressions shot words at Wong, each telling him the determination, spirit and passion to defend their country. Wong hopped on to join this band of infantry and the ramp closed up behind him. The ride was much smoother than ride into Hangug, though he had to tolerate the musky smell of perspiration and the lack of seating space. The ICV moaned to a halt, opening up the ramp which lead to a fresh breeze of air into the humid containment unit. WongÂ’s eyes flinched, there were more and more equipment around than before he left for Hangug.<br><br>Â“Not bad, they are pretty efficient in moving things up here.Â” Wong thought.<br><br>The sight of so much equipment and weaponry was indeed a sight to behold for Wong. With the Xing Shiana forces on the Line along side with the mHzen forces, the possibility or defending the Line and organizing a counteroffensive that will push the Prussians out of Webding increased steadily. Hope was before his eyes. All around, the diversity of vehicles left Wong to slow decipher the armoured vehicles that was stationed all over the base.<br><br>Apparently the holding bay wasnÂ’t big enough to hold every single vehicle that was sent to the Line, and with more to come from XSAFÂ’s supply planes and more soldiers and tanks from the mHzen bases. Things were heating up on the Line, not only on the SENSE side but also on the Prussian side. Artillery divisions are being airlifted to Hangug with 2 howitzer divisions already on the line and 3 more to come.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>War Department decides to bring in new T-95s. </strong><br><br>Colonel Motive found a blue file under the stack of documents he was reading through.<br><br>"Ha! another one from the War Factory? What's with the people in the WF??"<br><br>Colonel Motive opened up the file and began to scanned through it's contents. Scrutinizing every detail and with pictures that came along with it.<br><br>"War Factory proposes that the new T-95s be brought into the Phase Line Alpha. Recall T-72s back to scrap and use parts to maintain the T-95s. T-95s promises greater firepower with it's 152mm smoothbore gun and mounted 12.7mm and 7.62mm coaxial MGs"<br><br>Colonel Motive paused.<br><br>"I hate the War Factory when they do this. The worse thing is, it's in the middle of a critical situation."<br><br>Colonel Motive read on.<br><br>"War Factory promises to commit all available manpower and resources on this project. 163 T-95s are combat-ready and estimated 300 more on the way when T-72s are recalled back."<br><br>Colonel Motive was indignant. The M1A2 Abrams are already sufficient enough for the MLF's firepower compared to other SENSE nations. But the moment was critcal, the M1A2 Abrams are stationed in Boylestug which is all the way on the other end of the country. Way too far from where the Phase Line Alpha is. Transportation of the M1A2 is way too troublesome and General Wavelength didn't want to put it into action first though the War Department is slowly transporting the Abrams over to the Line slowly. The first batch of Abrams will arrived in a weeks' time. Too much time taken, the Prussian may pour in any moment. Colonel Motive read on.<br><br>"T-95s can deploy immediately when document gets back to us. Estimated 3 hours for all current T-95s to reach Phase Line Alpha."<br><br>The MLF has 196 T-72s on the Line. Would he risk removing at least 25% of the armour division's firepower if he signed the contract? Motive decided to trust in the War Factory though he knows that he's taking a big risk by endorsing the proposal. He took a pen and signed on the dotted line at the bottom of the page.<br><br>"here's to superior firepower ... "<br><br>Colonel Motive called for his secretary and gave her the file.<br><br>Back at Phase Line Alpha.<br><br>Wong was puzzled. Why were the T-72s moving back in the direction of Hangug. He didn't know what was going on. A T-72 drove past and the gunner was on top.<br><br>"Hey! Where are you all driving the tanks?" Wong shouted<br><br>"The T-72s are being recalled, they are going to bring in the new T-95s!"<br><br>Wong stared at the gunner. The Line was already on the brink of collapse and the War Department wants to recall the T-72s??!! Wong didn't know what was going on. All he knew was that the Line's defenses may be in serious trouble if the new T-95s didn't reach here in time ... The holding bay seemed more empty now, with more T-72s rolling out. It seems as though the war was over and the MLF is returning, but that wasn't the case. Wong remembered the Leopard II fortified out in front. He knew he could trust the Leopard II, in all his service the Leopard II has proved itself worthy of battle.</div>
