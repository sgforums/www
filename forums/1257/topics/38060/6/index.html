            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Offence of FrederickBurg, Day 2<br><br>0325HRS Â– The Zenbu Koogeki Army, the Shingapooru Army and the Eiizumi-Shi Army sends in its Combat Engineer Divisions to clear mines and booby traps to clear way for invasion.</strong><br><br>Under the night cover, combat engineers quickly went to clear the mines and booby traps in Prussia with Mammoth MK-X Mine Clearing Tanks (Mammoth MK-X MCTs) of about 1000 units.<br><br>The tanksÂ’ ability to work in night with thermal imaging helps to protect itself from any enemy attacks and mines sensory systems in these tanks help to clear safe pathways for friendly units.<br><br>To work faster, MICLIC rockets is used to clear the mines by about 300 units of mobile MCRL (Mine Clearing Rocket Launchers) known as the Shovel. The Shovels carries and shoots MICLIC rockets of C4 or plastic explosives to clear mined areas big or small. The best thing of the Shovels is not only its mine clearing effectiveness but also in addition, killing infantry with its C4 explosive rockets by shooting them into an area of 10 metres radius per rocket.<br><br>The infantry engineers all use thermal goggles as well as night vision goggles with metal detectors fixed to their barrels of their carbines, which can be extended to become a metal detection tool. All these equipments on the engineers quick help them to spot a mine and diffuse them or detonate them with small satchel charges.<br><br>One of the best mine clearing arsenal is from the air. SENSE aircrafts have missions to fly into mine areas and drop tactical plastic explosive bombs (PEBs) of weigh about 2,000 pounds on the mine area, blowing up any mines in the area and they also provide air support for the engineers too.<br><br>Â“Mine laying can be one of the most desperate strategies that really can kill enemies. But it can also ruin the lives of the people living there in amidst of a mine area in the future by blowing up their limbs and also body into pieces. Laming their post-war people for life. IÂ’ve already heard reports of Prussian civilian children blowing up there when they thought the mines were toys.Â” Commented the Speaker for The Great Republics War Department.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lion on the Doorstep</strong><br><br>The 8th Squadron, which had been out ahead on reconnaissance, returned to the 7th AAD several short. They had finally discovered the Prussian positions on the outskirts of FredrickBurg. In three hours of fierce fighting, the 8th Squadron had inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy for the loss of five humvees and six casualties, non of whom were fatal. One humvee and two AGS tanks were seriously damaged and to limp back, one MBT had thrown a track and was towed back by another of its number. All in all, it was a successful mission.<br><br>The 7th AAD has overrun the Prussian defence line, 40 miles from the Prussian capital after the ex-Duke announced that he was going to take part in the defence of FredrickBurg himself, causing Prussian commanders worried for his safety to draw thousands of troops from the line away to reinforce the area the Duke was Â“defendingÂ”. Ironically allowing the 7th AAD to overrun and penetrate the line in just one attack, burying over 12,000 Prussian conscripts in the process with only 4 loss of life on their side.<br><br>From the 8th Squadron recon run, the 7th division knew that Ex-Duke Reynard had retreated into the city with his Jaegers after seeing the 8th Squadron, mistaking the 24-vehicle force for a massive XSAF attack. In his wake he had put thousands of mines, booby traps and untrained conscripts on the outskirts that he hoped could slow down the SENSE advance.<br><br>The 7th AAD had no intention of being lured into a tough city fight, nor had any intention of going in to fight the Prussians on their terms. They called down airpower and artillery on the Prussian conscripts, in a massive, three-hour bombardment of SENSE guns and rockets, plus aircraft and attack choppers, the explosions of which Ex-Duke Reynard thought erroneously in his lack of combat experience that was the sound of his mines and booby traps when it was the sound of his conscripts dying by the hundreds.<br><br>When the bombardment had lifted, the 7th AAD, supported by flights of loitering Peregrines high above which they could call in within thirty seconds, plus additional XAF airpower further away, advanced on what was left of the Prussian defence line, the FCS tanks decked out with newly installed level 5 armour modules, affording them the heaviest protection ever. Also affixed on the forward tanks were mine ploughs, bulldozer blades that dug into the ground ahead of the tank and pushed mines out of the way. But there were few mines left to be uprooted this way, most of them had been destroyed in the bombardment, along with the booby traps.<br><br>The remainder of the Prussian conscripts, the few which survived the bombardment, look out of their trenches to see the REAL XSAF cavalry assault, and cursed as one man their ex-duke who had cowardly retreated with his fanatic and lapdog Jaegers (who were more interested in listening to his every order instead of contradicting him) who provided most of the firepower in the area after seeing the 24 vehicles of the 8th Squadron. They resisted with whatever they could, and realized that their antitank weapons could no longer penetrate, nor disturb seriously in any way the level 5 armoured AGS.<br><br>The 7th AAD did not dismount its infantrymen to take the trenches that would have led to unnecessary loss of life on their side, but instead moved in with their dozer-blade equipped tanks and started burying and machine-gunning the Prussians in their trenches, some of them attempted to resist at this point, with equally futile results. One Prussian conscript, Private Nicky, fired his PO-2 Panzerschreck point blank an AGS bulldozing his position, blew himself into steaming bits along with his weapon, but generally failed to do anything more then to superficially scorch and scar the armour of the light tank. The pieces of the faceless private, one of whom had been withdrawn from the Prussian line to reinforce the ex-DukeÂ’s position, died along with thousands others of Prussian conscript.<br><br>The 7th AAD had captured the city outskirts and defeated the Prussian perimeter defence in just thirty minutes of battle, killing over 15,000 Prussians and taking 4,000 prisoner. The soldiers of the 7th AAD were treated to an amazing sight as civilians started streaming out of the suburb buildings, waving white flags and dragging with them mines and bobby traps they had disabled, along the bodies of Jaegers they had murdered, to welcome the SENSE troops warmly. The 7th AAD advanced three kilometres into the suburbs of FredickBurg without any resistance, the civilians having removed it before them. Murdered Jaegers with kitchen knives sticking out of their back or executed with their own weapons littered the streets in a surrealistic display.<br><br>7th AAD losses so far: none.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The ex-duke loses his Plan to use the Prussian Noncombatants</strong><br><br>To: Any Prussian Forces in FredickBurg<br><br>General Address via radio.<br><br>Regarding your Future<br><br>Do not cooperate with the ex-Duke for his regime is finished! Stop this senseless losing right now, you are fighting against men and equipment far superior to you both in quality and quality. We are not here to attack you, we are here to dispose him from his oppression and mindless sacrificing of your futures to fulfil his ends.<br><br>Already the rest of Prussia has been liberated from his oppression; do not give your lives for a dying regime. Do not take his orders and save the lives of your men and your families. Fight instead for the new regime that will be set up that will give your families and children a true future rather then fighting for this Duke, who pawns you away by putting your children and loved ones in trenches while he and his hardcore people stay behind protected.<br><br>To achieve this future, do not cooperate with whatever orders you have received and surrender immediately to SENSE forces, remove all your equipment and leave your rifle unloaded and dissembled on the ground before approaching SENSE forces with your hands in the air. You will have just taken your first step toward liberty.<br><br>All the best, may you make the wisest choice.<br><br>Col. Tommy Rex,<br>7th Advanced Armoured Division<br><br>Over 300,000 conscripts abandoned their positions and started moving towards SENSE forces to surrender in the hours following the address, along with hundreds of thousands of civilians. Thousands of booby-traps and mines were also disabled and Jaegers murdered and removed by the Prussians, who decided finally, that they had enough to this useless ex-duke who kept making them die for this ambition and mistakes. They were evacuated towards the nearby towns of Fook, Atung and Gontz which had been turned into SENSE humanitarian areas.  FredickBurg was now a ghost city, devoid of civilian live safe for the SENSE forces and Reynard and his hard core Jaegers which occupied the city centre. The ex-dukeÂ’s plans to mix Jaegers forces in every civilian household to use civilians as human shields along with thousands of conscripts to defend himself had totally fallen through.<br></div>

Sherry Tan, an infantrywoman of the 7th AAD. Â“And ordered them to strip themselves before they approached, but they refused.Â”<br><br>In accordance to SENSE surrender demands, all surrendering must strip themselves at a distance to any suitable amount of clothing that makes it possible to discern that there are no hidden weapons of any sort.

Interrogation of the captured Prussians revealed that their targets had been the SENSE command tent.<br><br>Â“It was a crazy mission.Â” Said Alawho Ackbar, one of the captured Jaegers, during his interrogation.

That was about to change.<br><br>Task force Bakker, originally slated to handle the Reichland theater, was now bolstered by the arrival of Task force Greg Paul and Tyrant King into their area after the last of the Prussian navy had wiped out in a climatic final battle. One task force alone outnumbered and outgunned the small Reichland navy several times, now they had three.<br><br>The first action of the stepped up action against Reichland started with submarine action, as the SSN-1701 Alabaster submarines, already proven themselves deadly against the Prussians, moved up ahead of the task forces to engage any Reichland submarines that may be lurking around. It didnÂ’t take long for them to root out and destroy the small Reichen diesel electric subs, which had been sent on patrol by the Reichland high command to detect and engage the SENSE naval elements. They were badly outclassed and all destroyed before they got anywhere near to finding their objectives. ReichlandÂ’s entire submarine force of five diesel electrics was decimated.<br><br>The task forces in position, the combined might of the nine Arsenal ships launched an amazing total of over 480 missiles in just five minutes, followed by another wave of 300. The cruise missiles, arcing into the sky from their launch cells, nosed over and engaged in a supersonic flight towards the small country, the first wave targeting targets already hit in the original assault.<br><br>As the missiles descended on the nation, they were met by a barrage of antiaircraft fire that rose into the night sky to meet them. Some were destroyed or intercepted, but they were just too small, too nimble, too fast and too many for them to be shot down with regularity. Most of them found their way through to their targets, driving Reichland military engineers and workers striving in the recent days to repair the damage nearly insane as they damaged the targets again, and even killing some of them as they were caught in the explosions of warheads and dispensed submunitions. All of the airfields, almost repaired to completion, were again damaged badly, denying the well-hidden, surviving 30 percent of the Reichland air force the use of them.<br><br>But the first wave served a purpose of destruction, but one that of distraction as well. As every air defense radar lit up in the nation to meet the invading cruise missiles, the second wave, fitted with HARM mission modules, detected these powered up radar emissions and dove into onto their locations, exploding their warheads just twenty feet from impact, scattering high speed, tungsten cubes into their targets, shredding radar, equipment and crew-<br><br>Within seconds, the entire Reichland air defense radar grid was knocked out before the Reichen commander could receive the battle report. Air defense batteries and missiles opened up randomly in an awesome display of firepower, but it was futile as they could no longer see what they were shooting at. Several more waves of cruise missiles and naval air strikes started picking them out along with targets all over Reichland, unthreatened by the wild antiaircraft fire. The bombardment decimated what was already a battered small military force.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Shooting of Prussian Commander Sparks Mass Defection of 2000 Jaegers</strong></span><br><br><strong>FredrickBurg, Prussia (XNN) - Over 2000 Jaegers surrendered to SENSE forces amidst much suspicion and wariness from their captors following an incident related to the attempted suicide bombing. </strong><br><br>Reportedly, high ranking intelligence Jaeger Officer, Rudolph Heinz of Prussian Secret Service feared the consequences of reporting the failure of the suicide bombing due to his lack of effort to understand SENSE surrender protocols, and hence the ability to properly prepare the Jaegers involved in the mission. It has been reported that the failure of the suicide bomber Jaegers was mainly due to their inability to conform to SENSE surrender procedures, leading to them being gunned down by SENSE troops. Rudolph Heinz had allegedly falsified a report and was executed by the ex-duke himself when the deception was uncovered from watching XNN reports.<br><br>Â“It is indeed fortunate that Heinz took this minor oversight.Â” chuckled Col. Tommy Rex about this incident. Â“It saved a lot of lives.Â”<br><br>The execution of Rudolph Heinz reportedly sparked off major dissentient amidst the Jaegers ranks, particularly those who had been under HeinzÂ’s command. Over 2000 of them defected to SENSE in the hours following the execution, the logjam of new prisoners taking over five hours to clear due to the new security measures which involved the Jaegers stripping to their underwear and made to craw over one hundred meters over metal detector strips and chemical explosive sniffers to verify that they had nothing remotely dangerous on them.<br><br>Shivering in his underwear in a SENSE detention area, one of the defected Jaegers, Feldmarschall Von Losen gave reporters his reasons on why he left ex-duke Reynard.<br><br>Â“That guy is @#%^ nuts.Â” The Feldmarschall said. Â“We stick to him through thick and thin and suffer monstrous difficulties for him to resist you guys and whatÂ’s the first thing he does when one of us makes a mistake? He shoots that guy in the head, a completely ungrateful person not worth fighting for.Â”<br><br>Feldmarschall Von Losen also said that he now saw why the removal of the old regime was needed.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s about time, IÂ’ve seen what a monster Duke Reynard can be. Sure, what Heinz did was not right but he was terrified, under a stressful situation! ReynardÂ’s actions prove to me that heÂ’s completely self-absorbed and deluded about the current situationÂ… he still expects us to resist and fight when we have no food, or water and little ammunition.Â”<br><br>Von Losen reported a different picture of the Prussian Jaegers in FredrickBurg, saying that they were a Â“brutalized, demoralized and terrified remnantÂ” of the Prussian army staying behind to fight only because of the tyrannical and oppressive grip of the several hard-core fanatical high ranking commanders surrounding the ex-duke himself.<br><br>Such a picture directly contradicts the picture ex-duke Reynard attempts to portray in his daily TV addresses to the nation from within what he calls Â“Fortress FredrickBurgÂ”, showing the Prussian Jaegers as a determined, fanatical bunch with high morale that would Â“repel the foreign invadersÂ”, calling on the populace of Prussia to resist the SENSE invasion of Â“The fatherland.Â” These calls however have gone unhindered as SENSE continues to jam these broadcasts and the rest of Prussia is involved in massive celebrations of their liberation as they burn effigies of ex-duke Reynard and destroy all memorials of the old regime.<br><br>Â“The Jaeger in FredrickBurg as a fanatical force ready to defend the Duke to the death is nonsense.Â” Von Losen said. Â“Given a chance most of them would put a bullet straight into his head as he had done senselessly to so many of those who had served him so devotedly, itÂ’s time for him to go.Â”<br><br>As most of the defecting Jaegers were from the intelligence units, SENSE command has commented that this could mean a intelligence coup providing vital information on the remaining Prussians in FredrickBurg, but stated that they would Â“verify all information carefully and to its entirety.Â”<br></div>

TheyÂ’ll have to stop their vehicles in the ranges or theyÂ’ll be killed if they exceed the ranges as they are 'too close for comfort'. They'll be killed one way or the other as we regard them as enemies for violating the procedures at the 'Freedom Points'." Continues the Speaker for the SENSE War Council, Jiang Ren Hua.<br><br>"All refugees or defectors have to declare themselves as civilian refugees or military defectors. Our Combat Medic snipers will then give them each an anesthetic shot from a position. To make sure the anesthetic doesnÂ’t accidentally kills the refugee or defector, all allergies to any anesthetic must be reported the troops at the points by clenching their fists with their hands up. TheyÂ’ll be dealt with carefully."  Continues the Speaker for the SENSE War Council, Jiang Ren Hua.<br><br>"The refugees and defectors shot will go to 'sleep' and carried away to Â‘Liberating HousesÂ’ safe away from the point, where they will woke up tied of their limbs, search of their bodies of any weapons, and scanned of their faces and finger prints of the Prussian Citizen Database and other relevant databases to see what is their position in Prussia. Check they are a civilian or a defecting soldier. They will be release to refugee camps if they are civilian refugees while military defectors will be regarded as POWs and sent to POW camps where they all will be treated humanly and will be restricted to their camps.Â” Ends the Speaker for the SENSE War Council, Jiang Ren Hua.<br></div>

The Xing love to fight, traditionally.  All real Xingans love the sting and clash of battle.  The Xing Empire loves a winner.  Xingans will not tolerate a deserter. Xingans despise a coward; Xingans play to win.  That's why the Xing Empire has never lost and never will lose a war.<br><br>You are not all going to die.  Only two percent of you, right here today, would be killed in a major battle.<br><br>Death must not be feared.  Death, in time, comes to all of us.  And every man is scared in his first action.  If he says he's not, he's a condemn liar.  Some men are cowards, yes, but they fight just the same, or get the stuffing slammed out of them.<br><br>The real hero is the man who fights even though he's scared.  Some get over their fright in a minute, under fire; others take an hour; for some it takes days; but a real man will never let the fear of death overpower his honor, his sense of duty, to his country and to his manhood.<br><br>All through your Army careers, you've been complaining about what you call "waste-our-time drills."  That, like everything else in the Army, has a definite purpose.  That purpose is instant obedience to orders and to create and maintain constant alertness!   This must be bred into every soldier.  A man must be alert all the time if he expects to stay alive.  If not, some Prussian gun will sneak up behind him with a sock full of dung!  There are four hundred neatly marked graves somewhere in Koln, all because one man went to sleep on his job--but they are Prussian graves, because we caught the losers asleep!<br><br>An Army is a team, lives, sleeps, fights, and eats as a team.  This individual hero stuff is a lot of crap!  The bilious lie mongers who write that kind of stuff for the Saturday Evening Post don't know any more about real fighting under fire than they know about milking cows!  Every single man in the Army plays a vital role.  Every man has his job to do and must do it. What if every truck driver decided that he didn't like the whine of a shell overhead, turned yellow and jumped headlong into a ditch?  What if every man thought, "They won't miss me, just one in millions?"  Where on earth would we be now?  Where would our country, our loved ones, our homes, even the world, be?<br><br>No, thank goodness, Americans don't think like that.  Every man does his job, serves the whole.  Ordnance men supply and maintain the guns and vast machinery of this war, to keep us rolling.  Quartermasters bring up clothes and food, for where we're going, there isn't a lot to kapo.  Every last man on K.P. has a job to do, even the guy who boils the water to keep us from getting the Prussian diarrhea!<br><br>Remember, men, you don't know I'm here.  No mention of that is to be made in any letters. The Xing is supposed to be wondering what on earth has happened to me.  I'm not supposed to be commanding this offensive, I'm not supposed even to be in FredrickBurg.  Let the first losers to find out be the condemn Prussians.  I want them to look up and howl, "Ach, it's the condemn 7th AAD and that son-of-a-gun Tommy Rex again!"<br><br>We want to get this thing over and get the dodge out of here, and get at those deep purplÂ’ ravinÂ’ Reichs!!!  The shortest road home is through FredrickBurg and KaiserLautern!  We'll win this war, but we'll win it only by showing the enemy we have more guts than they have or ever will have!<br><br>There's one great thing you men can say when it's all over and you're home once more.  You can thank goodness that twenty years from now, when you're sitting around the fireside with your grandson on your knee and he asks you what you did in the war, you won't have to shift him to the other knee, cough, and say, "I shoveled fertilizer in Xing Shiana."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mother of All Bombs</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/images/moab_030311-d-9085m-007-s.jpg"><img src="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/images/moab-test-030311-06-s.jpg"><br><span class="small">Nickednamed the "Mother Of All Bombs" the MOAB was used against the Jaegers trapped in FredrickBurg.</span><br><br>Silence had gripped the shattered city of FredrickBurg for the good part of the day now, for everybody from SENSE trooper to Prussian Jaeger knew that the end to this short-lived peace was near. For the two days since the last of the ReynardÂ’s regime had been trapped within the city center along with the ex-duke, SENSE had been moving more units to amass on the encirclement. Tension had built up to a point to which it was almost palatable, and SENSE troopers spoke in hushed voices and scurried around quietly and carefully as they suspiciously glared down the broken streets towards the city center, waiting for the moment to attack.<br><br>The early evening of winter crept in, and the ambient light lowered as the sun sank low on the horizon. FredrickBurgÂ’s electric supply no longer existed, destroyed long ago in the bombardments. Soon it would be darker then Â“three inches up a goatÂ’s buttÂ” as their commanders had briefed them. Night would be a crucial advantage for the SENSE troops, for one of the many items the Jaegers were low on was night vision equipment. But still no order came, and the battlefield remained as it was.<br><br>Just as the blue skies were starting to give way to black, several black, airborne blobs appeared far on the horizon, and soon took the form of Xing Shianan C-130s transport aircraft as they neared. They had flown all the way in from Xing Shiana, on a mission of express delivery which was about to take a spectacular turn. The flight of Hercules loitered on the city outskirts as both sides down below eyed them, one side with anticipation, the other side with dread.<br><br>The lead Hercules broke formation and turned for the city center, flying high above the range of small arms fire that was now the Jaegers only anti-aircraft defense, dropped its rear cargo ramps open as the crew moved to get their ominous cargo overboard, a cylindrical, 30 foot long object. The crew undid the locks securing the cargo, armed it and looked at the various messages they had scrawled on it for the recipients below before they rolled it right off the aircraft.<br><br>Falling from the plane at 12,000 feet, the 9-ton Massive Ordinance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) had been manufactured in Xing Shiana and rushed to Prussia just for this mission. There was more then ample warning for the Jaegers down below as they watched the object freefall the 4,000 meters down towards their positions. They ducked into their foxholes, scrabbled for cover, and generally hunkered down wherever they could, waiting for the inevitable.<br><br>Nothing could have prepared them for it, not all the shelling, air strikes and missiles SENSE had thrown at them so far, the XAF MOAB fell to an attitude of fifty meters and detonated the nine tons of explosive within its body, in a sudden firestorm that utterly obliterated anything within 200 meters, the massive blast cooking and crushing the Jaegers wherever they hid. Charred body parts and twisted metal that were once a company of 240 Jaegers lay smoking within the 200 meter crater, carved by the bomb into the heavily urbanized city center. What was once a street of seven-story high-rises was not nothing more then a pile of broken and burning debris.<br><br>And that was just one bomb. The rest of the XAF Hercules made bombing runs for the good part of an hour, dropping over 12 precision guided MOABs all over areas identified to have the heaviest Jaeger activity. The incredible blast could be heard and felt all the way to SENSE lines, which were holding out safely over two thousand meters away. There was no way to run, nor to hide from the MOABs, all the Jaegers who were within its effect of influence either died where they were, hunkered down and hoping for the best, or left scattered amidst the smoking debris with terrible injuries. Over 2,500 Jaegers had been blasted to oblivion by the gigantic smart bombs.<br><br>SENSE artillery started to fall now, in shell and rockets, blasting the small five kilometer square pocket of Jaeger territory with explosions and submunitions, in a combined barrage of guns and rocket launchers from four SENSE nations that rained an incredible rate of over 200 rounds a minute into the city center without pause for three hours. Air strikes dropping FAEs and cluster munitions and napalm into the area en-masse continued after the shelling stopped, dropping more death onto the trapped Jaegers as they were pinned down where they were, being blasted and blow without having a chance to fight back.<br><br>As the thirty minute air strike lifted, SENSE rockets sent in a barrage of tear/vomit gas into the city center, making sure living conditions were unbearable for those caught in there, unfortunately for the trapped Jaegers, only one in three had the possession of a gas mask. The rest lay writhing in their positions, treated to the full effects of the vile fog that sealed their eyes painfully shut and caused them to purge what little was in their empty stomachs.<br><br>In the meantime, SENSE ground units were still told to hold.<br></div>

Â“We have reduced their capacity to wage war on SENSE nations to almost nothing.Â”<br><br>Xing Shianan air strikes consisting of cruise missiles and planes had begun in earnest over Reichland in the recent days, attacking what Tan called Â“targets of military interestÂ” in the nation. Explosions and smoke was observed all over the nation in the two air raids so far, both of which lasted about two hours.<br><br>Matteus Tyrannous Tan brushed aside comments made by Emperor Andreas Kaiser of ReichLand that the attacks were Â“utter contempt for the soveriegnty of ReichLandÂ” and would seek legal recourse for those who died in what he deemed a Â“barbaric act of violenceÂ”.<br><br>Â“What does the Kaiser think war is?Â” Said Tan as he spoke on the EmperorÂ’s statements that Reichland was a neutral country following its pullout from the war, stating reasons that reflected on the hopelessness of PrussiaÂ’s situation. Â“You canÂ’t just turn war on and off like some switch to your own twisted desires, and think you can quit amicably just because you are not winningÂ… and expect us to leave it at that. There will be consequences to pay. Any talk that Reichland is neutral because it had pulled out from the war on ITÂ’S terms is baloney!Â”<br><br>Tan stated that Reichland was an active and strident supporter of Prussian Germanic Ambitions, and a threat to regional safety due to its Â“contemptuousÂ” ambitions.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s typical of Germanic Â“honorÂ” the way they fight war.Â” Said Tan. Â“They only fight when they are winning and expect to pull out on their terms when they cannot finish something they started. These people cannot face up to the consequences of their actions, but it wonÂ’t stop those consequences from finding them.Â”<br><br>Finishing the press briefing, Tan announced SENSE intentions for Reichland:<br><br>Â“Like ex-duke ReynardÂ’s regime in Prussia, Andreas Kaiser is going down as well, for the safety and freedom of all.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To SENSE Council Secretary:<br><br>IT has been brought to our attention that the XSAF has plans for an offensive into our borders.This is clearly a breach of international law.Especially so when ReichLand has announced that it would stay out of the war in Prussia.Is this some territorial  ambition i think that is going around in SENSE?Is the basic laws of humanity to be forgotten and left to rot for the sake of Xing shiana here who has territorial ambitions?NO!We Reichens will stay out of the war and make good our promise.But we will only fight if out basic means for peaceful coexistence has been breached,which is,a SENSE invasion into ReichLand.<br>For the sake of Peace and humanity,We do not wish war with either side.But yet,we can't let the deaths of innocent go unaddressed.We shall let SENSE debate this issue over while Reichen Military will gear up and wait for an invasion that hopefully never comes.<br><br>-Andreas Kaiser,Emperor of ReichLand<br></div>
