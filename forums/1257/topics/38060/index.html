            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Starting Fires</strong><br><br>Based from what we have gathered through our eint network, the Prussian involvement in the entire Malayan war was nothing more then a ruse to destroy Pax Dominia (which had been his mortal enemy to start with) by using SENSE.<br><br>When Prussia had first arrived into SENSE, it had tried hard to assume control by being the Delegate, and using it's new found powers to destroy Domina. As we can see through his threats on other SENSE nations in his drive to be delegate. When that failed, and Xing Shiana got the post intead, Prussia fell back to plan B, which was to kill with a borrowed knife.<br><br>Xing Shianan SIC has already been aware of these plans from the start, but waited for more intelligence to come in via the eint network before it could be sure. What happened next was that the Prussian commanders in the Malaya knowingly sent their troops out into apparent ambushes and deathtraps in which they would tak heavy losses, followed up by a falsified document they "captured" from Malayan forces saying that Dominian forces had been leaking vital information on battle orders to them.<br><br>That's because when suspisions arose that Prussia was up to something in Malaya, Xing Shianan, 440Mhz and Shingapooru forces which were involved in the Malayan war, shared all of the classified information on battle plans, excluding that of Prussia's with Dominica, including critical ones. Dominica never had any knowledge of Prussian plans, as their battle orders were all covertly intercepted by the Shiana SIC, though it made it look like Dominica had gotten the plans.<br><br>This gave Prussia the impression that Dominica had gotten the plan, and hence would be able to shoot itself in the foot many times with its "elite" troops and blame it on "leaked" information from Dominica, information which it never got.<br><br>Also, 440mhz, Xing Shianan and Singapooru forces, despite having shared their battle orders with Dominica, found that not in one instance was any of these compromised. Hence one can only come to the conclusion that Dominica was innocent from the start.<br><br>Xing Shiana exposed Prussia's plan during a private meeting with it, and would be willing to let the matter rest as long as Prussia shut up with it's cries to ask SENSE to destroy Dominica. After all, all the troop losses and military disasters have been self-inflicted and SENSE had not suffered anything so far. And that would be that.<br><br>Unfortunately, Prussia showed it's utter contempt for SENSE once again and threatened to drop a neutron bomb that would destroy twice the size of Malaya unless SENSE relented. This was the Prussian plan C. The Xing Shianian forces knew through eint, the SIC and basic physics however that such a bomb was impossible and instead Prussia intended to use over 50 much smaller neutron devices to drop all all major cities and later move in the aftermath in to claim that Malaya would be its to lay stake to.<br><br>Such a frightening plan would have come to if not for the early warning that eint could give. Unknown to Prussian command, the plan already had been compromised from the moment they entered SENSE. Xing Shiana had sent in SOF troops, and Eiizumi-Shi, their incredible spy-assasins undercover on several missions.<br><br>Firstly, to help evacuate Dominican citizens just as the Malayan war started by covertly sneaking them out through apparently normal channels and then switching their records with that of prominent xenophobic Prussians, hence when the planned reprisal against Dominican civillians for their "betrayal" happened in Prussia, they ended up unknowningly sending their own people into their pre-prepaired concentration camps.<br><br>Secondly, to make sure the insane neutron bomb plan never works, Eiizumi-shi spy-assains and Xing Shianan SOF splinter cells managed to infiltrate Prussian installations and sabotage the neutron bombs so that while they would appear to function, they would not work on doomsday. And they did not.<br><br>Thirdly, XAF was ready responded to the already compromised Prussian "sudden strike" in force in an engagement that drew first blood with their XF-35 Bobcat, a next generation ATF and inflicted terrible losses on the incoming Prussian bombers (carrying the dud neutron bombs) and their F-22 escorts for only one of the XF-35 damaged and two F-16s lost. The bombers that got through finally dropped three neutron bombs over 440Mhz and Singapooru foces and thanks to the work of the spec-ops, SENSE now has three Prussian neutron weapons in hand, which it might shortly return.<br><br>As a final act to all this, the incredible Eziiumi-Shi spy-assasins managed to capture the Prussian commander responsible for the strike and make him radio back that the strike had gone off sucessfully, Xing Shianan SOF sabotaged Prussian sensors to give false reports, and SENSE troops dug out of sight to complete the illusion that SENSE forces have been destroyed in the area. Giving Reynard the false impression that he could send his Prussian troops into Malaya and walk over.<br><br>What has happened however, is that SENSE troops are now over there stronger and more reinforced then ever before, and know every location and movement of the Prussian forces as they reenter, (who are moving blind into Malaya), and are ready to teach them what a little COMMON SENSE can do.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>An FCS tankie in the opening hours of a strange new war</strong><br><br>Sgt. Daniel Ong was having the ride of his life.<br><br>His FCS Main Battle Tank was tearing down the rough, shell torn terrain at over 80kph, mobility unheard of for any conventional tank, but the FCS linkless polymer tracks moved the 40 ton tank over the terrain with little noise or complain. The ride was surprisingly smooth and relatively quiet, something that Daniel never quite gotten used to. The FCS was built to be stealthy, with itÂ’s strangely angled form and lack of noise. The powerpack sounded more like a giant vacuum cleaner rather then the noisy engines he was used to in his previous conventional mount.<br><br>Little about the FCS was conventional, it was operated by a two man crew which sat slung low and protected deeply in the hull. While the automated turret mounting its advanced 140mm gun sat above, the various sensor mounts and optics on it rotating freely, following the head movement of the crew and updating the view as they saw through their augmented reality visors. In this way they observe the outside world mainly by their tankÂ’s sensors, and of course, the eint, allow response time and situational awareness far in excess of any other conventional system. But this was what the FCS was about: the future.<br><br>Despite all the high technology, Daniel has reason to be worried, his force of 10 FCS tanks, along with 30 other MBTs from SENSE allies were facing off over 200 enemy MBTs, which as they can already see via the eint, approaching relentlessly.<br><br>Â“Okay, this is the place.Â” The driver radioed to the other conventional SENSE tanks as he brought the FCS to a halt, Force Integration meant that the entire Xing Shianan FCS units could all work without any words spoken over the radio, eliminating confusing radio chatter so common in the heat of battle, however, communications between them and conventional systems had still to be done the old fashioned way. The two men crew of the FCS served the interchangeable positions of commander, gunner and driver, with duplicated controls for both positions. Now Daniel was the commander and gunner, while his crewmate served that of driver and gunner as well.<br><br>Daniel was sure that his little tank force had not been detected yet, as he did not observe the Prussian tanks responding to the SENSE tank force run towards their firing positions through the eint. He decided to take a look for himself, he extended the sensor probe, and peeked over the ridge he was taking cover behind. True enough, the enemy tanks were approaching steadily, commanders unbuttoned. They were not expecting trouble. It was not surprising, considering that a few SENSE intelligence coups had made sure the Prussians thought that all SENSE forces in Malaya had been eliminated.<br><br>Daniel smiled thinly; the Prussians had come to Malaya after their abortive neutron attack of which failure they were still not aware off. They had come to Malaya to claim it like kids rushing to open a toy chest on Christmas morning, but Daniel and other likeminded SENSE troops were determined to make the Prussians find not toys in their ill-appropriated toy chest, but rattlesnakes.<br><br>Behind him, the rest of the conventional SENSE tanks, a mixture of Singapooru and 440Mhz M-1 variant and other western tanks finally arrived. The have had a hard time keeping up with the mobility of the FCS. Daniel knew that they were also good tanks and tankers, but the Prussian tanks they were facing were no pushovers. They were Prussian Leopard 3 and AWT1 tanks, sporting gigantic 200mm smoothbore cannons and advanced composite armor, as well as an EMP shockwave generator to counter incoming missiles or shells, of which the R&amp;D assured him that would not work well in real life. It was time to see if they were right.<br><br>Â“Get ready, pick your targets.Â” Daniel radioed to the other tanks. To avoid detection to the very last moment, they had to remain behind the ridge they were on the outskirts of the coastal town they were holding until the order was given to engage. They would then have scant seconds to aquire, lock on and engage the targets. It meant that for the conventional tanks, they had to rely on eint to locate where their targets are until the very last moment before they could switch over to their conventional sights and engage. No problem for the advanced fire control systems of the FCS, but it would be more of a challenge for the conventional tanks. Daniel picked several tanks out as his target, he had no lack of them as they were outnumbered 5 to 1. Target info sharing via eint made sure there was no target acquisition overlaps by any of his units.<br><br>Daniel observed the advancing tanks through his sensor probe. Any time nowÂ… he observed the relaxed Prussian commanders unbuttoned in their turrets as the tanks advanced. One of them was even smoking; he finished a stick, flicked it over the side of the turret and prepared another one.<br><br>He never got down to doing it, his head jerked back as it deformed on the forehead, spewing a violent blast of blood and brain tissue. The tank commanderÂ’s body failed violently, arms jerking violently and legs propelling his lower body in and out of the gore-splattered hatch as the torso arched skywards and begin trembling violently until life was simply gone and what was a man minutes ago collapsed and slumped over the blood soaked turret.<br><br>It was the work of a 440Mhz sniper and his PSG-1, apparently nobody had told him not to shoot till DanielÂ’s tank force had started shooting. Now they had lost the initial surprise as the Prussian commanders ducked down and started to order their tank full forward, shocked at the presence of SENSE troops of Malayan soil.<br><br>Â“Engage! Engage! Engage!Â” Daniel called through the radio. His FCS surged forward exposing just the turret over the ridge as the rest of the tanks in his force did the same. He acquired the target he had picked earlier through the eint and slewed the turret over to it, selecting SABOT ammo as he did. Even as he did, his driver was already acquiring another target and targeting it with secondary sensors, in hunter-killer mode. Daniel depressed the button for the range finder.<br><br>A pencil thin beam of laser light from his tankÂ’s range finder bounced off the target, an advancing AWT-1 and returned. The range came in at 981 meters. The fire control computer computed over 30 different variables from range, wind conditions, humidity to barrel wear as it ordered the autoloader to load a 140mm APFSDS shot into the gun. Within a second from Daniel depressing the laser range finder, the ready to shoot light flashed orange. Daniel depressed the trigger.<br><br>In a 40 foot muzzle blast that annihilated some shrubs planted by boy scouts two years ago, the insulated carbon-carbon tungsten penetrator left the gun tube, propelled by expanding electrically ignited chemical plasma gases that allowed it to have over twice the muzzle velocity as conventional guns. The penetrator dart shed it sabot fins, pulled away by the sheer air resistance as the dart, 30mm in diameter, lanced through the air burning white hot from air resistance at nearly two miles per second.<br><br>Less then half a second later, the penetrator dart reached the AWT-1 just as the Prussian gunner was loading his own shell. The field untested EMP shockwave defense fired, and completely failed to work as the penetrator but only succeeded in scrambling the electronics of nearby units. The shot hit the turret, burned through the alternating layers of composite material, breaking up as it went before entering the turret as white hot metal spall, ricocheting around inside the turret, shredding the crew in rapid, progressive fireworks of gore as some pieces touched the 200mm ammunition-<br><br>The AWT-1 exploded like a plastic toy as its ammo brewed up, flinging the massive turret and itÂ’s gigantic 200mm gum 40 feet into the air. The multi-million dollar tank continued to brew up like a miniature mottled volcano.<br><br>Â“Good shot!Â” his crewmate called. Daniel had no time to admire the sight, just four seconds had passed since he started the engagement. As he acquired his next target, the gun controls were slaved over to his crewmate as he engaged the target he has acquired while Daniel was engaging his. The target of his crew mate, a Leopard 3 tank exploded from another direct hit. Daniel reassumed gun control and fired at his target, also another Leopard 3, it was a hit to the engine compartment and the crew started to bail out into an environment Â“aliveÂ” with SENSE arty shell fragments.<br><br>The Prussian tanks had taken grievous losses in the opening rounds of the engagement, but now they started to return fire. A 440Mhz Challanger exploded as a sabot smashed through itÂ’s frontal armor. The Prussian 200mm guns had fearsome firepower and could defeat even the impressive Chobhamm armor of the Challanger at range. It was time for the SENSE engineers to come up with a new amour package for their conventional tanks, Daniel though grimly. A Singapooru Abrams, with advanced modular armor attached, moved up and avenged the destroyed SENSE tank with a HEAT round to the turret side of an AWT-1.<br><br>The SENSE tanks had inflicted serious damage on the Prussian armor, but there was simply too many of them. Charging full speed ahead, the Prussian tanks ignored their mounting losses and approached the SENSE positions, their fire got more accurate and SENSE the tanks started taking losses.<br><br>Clang! A round bounced off the turret front of his tank as Daniel ordered it into reverse and tried to target an AWT-1 that had come out of nowhere. Â“Zulu! Zulu! Zulu!Â” His crewmember announced over the radio that signaled the order for a fighting withdrawal and disengagement. The tanker zig zaged the FCS as Daniel tried desperately to reset the fire control computer, which had gone out from the shock of the hit. Another round from the AWT-1 clanged off the front. The shock inside was tooth jarring. In the midst of his panic, Daniel noted detachedly that the advanced composite modular armor of the FCS could stop the Prussian 200mm smoothbore.<br><br>Â“Stay still so I can shoot the sucker!Â” Daniel shouted to his crewmember. The driver cringed and held the tank still for as long as he dared as Daniel used the manual override and targeted the tank manually. He fired as the AWT-1 did. This time the Prussian tank missed overhead by a meter, Daniel did not.<br><br>Even as the AWT brewed up, the driver kicked the FCS into full retreat and they backed out of the coastal town at full throttle. The advanced sensory suite and ambidirectional transmission of the tank powerpack meant that the FCS could drive backwards as fast and as it could forward. Daniel noted the fire control computer had stated up again. As SENSE forces pulled out under the cover of XAF air power, the Prussians did not follow.<br><br>The little SENSE tank force finally came to a halt about twenty minutes later at their predestinated fallback position. It was a quiet ride, they had lost good many men back there in that town. But it was not in vain. They had taken out over sixty Prussian tanks for fourteen of their own, and from what he had gathered over eint traffic, the defending SENSE infantry and other units aquitted themselves as well. They had taken the edge and momentum out of the Prussian forces, sapped enemy morale by turning their dreams of an unopposed parade into Malaya, turned it into a nightmare of blood and crushed any far-fetched notion that SENSE was going out without a fight.<br><br>But they were still losing ground in Malaya, and unless they received some backup soon, it looked like the war was going to one big backpedal.<br><br>Daniel sighed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kechil Barbi, Malaya<br>The Sixth Day of encirclement<br><br>Sgt. Isaiah Lim had heard about the opening battles on the coastal plains of Indo Barbi, SENSE forces had acquitted themselves well in those fights, giving back over thrice as hard as they took. But technology, valour and morale were insufficient to hold out against the force of sheer statistics, outnumbered 3 to 1; the SENSE forces were forced to withdraw with a dwindling supply of ammunition, armour and antitank missiles. They had slowed the Prussian juggernaut, but not stopped it.<br><br>While the landing Jaegers had been slowed, the Parajaegers had managed to drop successfully into Malaya, thanks to their F-22 escorts, which took crippling losses from the SENSE air force while defending the transports. From eint, Lim knew the Parajaegers main objective was to capture and secure Kechil Barbi against any SENSE incursions for the Prussian land forces.<br><br>But of course, unaware of the failure of the neutron bomb scheme, the Prussians had come in blind and not expecting trouble in what they though was a country devoid of life, and they had to be shown some COMMON SENSE . The Prussian paratroopers had strolled into KB expecting an empty city to secure, but gotten a hail of man-made death from SENSE troops which had been waiting all this while to turn the city into a giant death-trap.<br><br>Shocked by the sudden turn of events, the Prussians had hunkered down in the city in whatever areas they had captured and waited for their backup, the Prussian land forces, to arrive from their beach landings. What the paratroops had no way of knowing of course, is that COMMON SENSE had managed to slow the invasion, allowing SENSE troops like Lim to besiege the Prussians in the city. The terrible fighting had gone on for six days by now, and the losses on both sides were mounting. But time was not on SENSEÂ’s side, as Lim knew that while the Prussian land invasion had been slowed, it was not stopped, and was grinding itÂ’s way slowly here as it went.<br><br>Lim poked his SAR-21 OICWS around the corner and scanned the broken, shell-torn moon-lit streets of Kechil. The electronic sight of the gun was set on thermal, and rendered everything in an artificially coloured view, representing minute difference in temperature, which it fed back to the Land WarriorÂ’s eyepiece. Using the OICWS, Lim could look at shoot around corners without exposing himself.<br><br>Lim had no visual contact with the rest of his team, but they were well linked up with the invisible web of technology. Scattered as they were across the little patch of street that was their battlespace, the Land Warriors were connected to each other via wireless a LAN and the eint network. Lim knew the exact real-time position of his team mate, backup units, positions, assets, supporting units and the enemy all via a sophisticated network of Force Interaction technology that gave him situational awareness unheard of in conventional troops. Decked out in technology, the Land Warriors represented a new way to wage war, war that was fought now with information and intelligence rather then just weapons of ever increasing firepower.<br><br>Â“Okay, theyÂ’re movingÂ” Number two radioed to him on a microburst-encrypted communication channel. Lim saw the information on the position of the enemy on his situational display as his number two saw it. With the Land Warrior FCS, Lim could see whatever relevant friendly forces could see.<br><br>Â“I got him.Â” Lim said as he braced his OICWS against the corner, viewing the gun sight though his augmented reality visor. He would be shooting around the corner now. The electronic eye of the OICWS could pick out minute variations in temperature, and now it could see the Prussian Jaeger, despite his best attempts to move through the rubble undetected. Probably a forward scout, Lim thought. True enough, the OICWS picked up more Jaegers creeping down the street behind the scout, using the night as cover. Under the electronic gaze of the Land Warrior system, they might as well be strolling in broad daylight for all the good it did. Lim smiled thinly.<br><br>Â“Take them out.Â” Lim said quietly as the streets opened in a panoply of gunfire to the advancing Jaegers, shooting from around cover without exposing themselves, the Land Warrior took down several of the enemy with the first salvo. The Jaegers dropped under cover and started firing back, for all the good it did. Lim glanced at his situational display and immediately got the enemy game plan: They were going to lay down suppressive fire while the other half of the squad attempted to flank their positions. It time to move to make sure this plan did not come to fruition.<br><br>Â“Move out.Â” Drawing out new positions for his squad with his finger on a PDA like device attached to his wrist, Lim got to his feet and started moving. There was no need to shout new direction or pass orders down the line anymore, tactical plans could be updated and changed on the fly, and passed along to your team instantly; such was the way of information warfare. The Land Warriors moved back about a block away from their firing positions and waited.<br><br>It wasnÂ’t long before their electronic sensors confirmed what they could already see coming through the situational display. The flanking squad of Jaegers reached their previous firing position under suppressive firepower and started to run storming position drills. It was a flawless execution of training, tactics and disciple on the side of the Prussians, except the Land Warriors were no longer there-<br><br>Â‘Give them hell!Â” Lim said as he fired his OICW on semi auto, knocking a confused Prussian off his feet. The Prussians, confused by the lack of enemy and the sudden fusillade of fire that had descended from nowhere, dropped to cover and started firing back randomly in conventional suppression tactics. The Land Warriors, with their advanced sensors and situational awareness, could pick their enemies off one by one with accurate and devastating firepower.<br><br>Bullets started to clip and whine around his position. Lim ducked back behind the broken wall he had chosen as cover, propped his OICWS over it and popped back some return shots, seeing fully what the gun saw. Apparently two or three Prussians in defilade had figured out his firing position through his muzzle flashes. There was no reliable way to hit them from here, no point wasting ammo.<br><br>Â“Two-three, grenade them.Â” Lim sent the order to his team member as he activated the laser range finder on his OICWS and painted the enemy position, instantly the Land Warrior system got the range and bearing, extrapolated with data concerning the relative position of LimÂ’s team member, and sent the updated range and bearing reading to his OICW. The trooper readied his weapon from behind his cover, moved the gun to the correct firing angle and bearing, and pulled the trigger for the 40mm grenade launcher.<br><br>The firing process did not end there; the Fire Control System in the OICW calculated average gun shake caused by natural human movements, fed in range data and firing mission profiles into the 40mm grenade before triggering the shell when the gun reached the average range of the calculated tremor movements. All this happened within microseconds of pulling the trigger.<br><br>The 40mm grenade fired, arcing through its pre-programmed flight path, spinning as it went. Spinning steadily at roughly fifty times a second as a counter within the warhead counted down. Set to airburst at a certain range, the grenade sailed over the Prussian position just as the counter clicked zero. The grenade exploded, sending metal fragments sleeting fatally into them, killed by incredibly accurate miniature artillery from a trooper that had never even seen them.<br><br>Lim noted with satisfaction as the three red dots that represented the Prussians in defilade blinked off. All around, Prussians that were exposed were taken out by direct fire from the 5.56mm module of the OICW while those who thought they were safe behind cover soon found themselves extremely exposed to the smart 40mm OICW grenades coming in relentlessly. It wasnÂ’t too long before the Prussians squad was in full retreat, beating feet back where they had come from, the Land Warriors gunned down a few more before deciding there had enough of shooting fish in a barrel. The Prussians had not even gotten a chance to take a clear look at their strange and new enemy, that did not fight war on terms they new.<br><br>A sharp gun crack snapped Lim out of his thoughts as a call of Â“Man down! Sniper!Â” came through the radio. But with Land Warriors, such a call was more of a refrain then a panicked cry. While most conventional troops would drop to cover and stay there under sniper fire, Land Warriors acted differently, a scan with their electronic sensors revealed the Prussian sniper position within moments of the sniper call, and a sharp, return crack of gun fire ended the entire drama. The shattered head of the sniper dripped blood eight stories down as the forward part of his torso hung loosely over the window he had been shooting out of.<br><br>Â“YouÂ’ll be fine.Â” The team medic said to the Lancer that had been shot by the sniper. Multiple layers of advanced ballistic materials that made up the armour protection of the Land Warrior had stopped the 7.62 bullet that would have torn out a liver in an unprotected soldier. Â“Have some water.Â”<br><br>Lim smiled as he ordered his squad into new positions. Despite their tenacious hold in Kechil Barbi, the Land Warriors had proven what the simulations had shown along, and today the small squad of six Lancer Land Warriors had defeated 22 Prussians paratroopers with no loss. And there was still time for more, young the night was.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>March into Kechil Barbi<br><br>FeldWebel Rick Kessler sighed.He was part of the 2000 Jaegers marching in Kechil Barbi.Grand Duke Reynard had promised a smooth ride in the securing of this new territory.Many of the Jaegers were dissapointed not to see action.Afterall,they were the best the Prussian Army had to offer.<br>They had already reached the center of the city when the unmistakable sound of machine gun fire mows the first line of Jaegers down.Surprised,Rick cursed and sweared,but he have a job to do-Drive the dirty Sense Oppressors out!He ordered his squad to storm the buildings,all around him,he could hear the fire of the Prussian's G36 rifles in action.<br><br>Marx,one of the Jaeger under Rick's command snuck up and lobbed a grenade into a department store.Then ,Rick led the charge.The first two Jaegers dropped dead and for the first time,Rick saw the enemy,Eiizumi-Shi soldiers.These fearsome soldiers were masters in hand to hand,and given the terrain,the JAegers were at a disadvantage.As Rick was processing his thoughts,his squad were already in close combat with the Eiizumi-Shi soldiers.It was 8 vs 4 with the former being the Prussians."AArgh!" one of the Jaegers kneeled on the floor with a bayonet skewered through his throat and pinned to the wall.Rick turned to his left and one of the his Jaeger's was coughing blood on the floor,his body twitching as he dies slowly.One of the E-S soldiers advanced towards Rick with a bayonet,Rick promptly shot holes in him with his G-36.The small battle was turning for the worse for the ES as the Jaegers teamed up on the ES soldiers.Now it was 2 Jaeger to 1 ES.When the last of the ES soldier surrenderred,Rick promptly shot him in the head with his USP Expert.<br><br>"The ES troops may be masters at hand to hand,but then with thier skills,they have become warriors,lacking discipline.The Prussians worked as a team,giving them the advantage over the ES because Prussians are Soldiers,not warriors!"<br><br>Rick was still musing over this when his Leutnant approach him.<br><br>"Rick,Shingapooru troops are here as well.We hold 40 % of the city,But i am afraid we are encircled.The Grand Duke has ordered us to stand our ground."<br><br>"This can't get any better"Rick thought.<br><br>Rick went to sleep knowing that the day ahead,they can expect fierce assaults by the combined ES and Shingapooru troops. Rick awoke to a start,the 440Mhzens are calling Arty upon them again.It's timing always fixed at 5am that the Jaegers jokingly named it the "wake up call".<br><br>It was the fifth day of the encirclement.The jaegers had lost 231 men while 107 men are wounded seriously.His mission for the day was simple,attack and hold the Red Leaf factory.5 platoons would be involved.He counted his squad,Mark had become one of the 231,a dagger to his heart.<br><br>Kechil Barbi had become Stalingrad.<br><br>"CHINNK CHIINKKCHINNK........"Enemy machine gun fire have inflicted haevy casualties on the Jaegers,but they were determined to get that factory today!As they neared a grenade landed amidst them but only a dull thud was heard.Where the grenade landed,a Jaeger was on it.Everybody sprinted past the dead Jaeger who gave his life out of respect.<br><br>"Pratatatatatta"Rick's G36 punched holes into two Shingapooru Soldiers.In another corner of the factory, a squad of Prussians are fighting another squad of ES soldiers.A Jaeger collapsed on the ground from a damaged lung.Another's ribs were crushed.An ES soldier's hand was held by two Prussians while another stabbed at him with a bayonet in the heart.A Prussian uses his superior bulk to withheld a ES soldier while the other slowly stepped on the ES's throat ,suffocating him slowly.In 2 hours,the factory was taken by the Prussians.The bloodlust in them growing stronger with every passing day in the city.Both armies had become murderers.Rick had personally killed two ES soldiers with his bayonet.Rick had been a Mrtial Arts expert too.<br><br>As Rick rested in the factory and waiting for more orders,he thought,"We may be the best of the Prussians,but if help doesn't come soon,we shall all be heroes,6 feet under!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Kechil Barbi, The Last Extraction</strong><br><br>Lim observed his number two quietly as the trooper said a Hail Mary at liftoff. He was not catholic, nor particularly religious to start with, though several in his squad were. However, being the witness to many a violent death in the fierce urban battles of Kechil Barbi, some through electronic sensors, some with his own eyes had made him reprioritize that area of his life. He felt that need now stronger then usual, to find something to live for in these times where life could come to a sudden and hideously painful halt at any time.<br><br>As the chopper convoy flew in to the LZ, Lim identified his sudden need to be religious from the fact that this was one mission that gave him the jitters. His 10-man team of Lancer Land Warriors operated on information warfare, using that to choose the battlefield and engagement on their own terms. With their vastly superior situational awareness, they could respond to the enemy and outsmart and outmaneuver him much faster then any conventional, shell shocked and bullet burned field commander could in the field. Land Warriors could choose their fights, avoid trouble and give it. But now the mission they were on went quite deeply against their recommended operating structure. They had to launch themselves knowingly into danger; there was no way about it this time- they were going in.<br><br>Â“Three minutesÂ…Â”<br><br>The long delayed Prussian land forces had finally reached Kechil Barbi, after taking beating from SENSE air power and hit and run raids on their long trip in. SENSE units involved in the encirclement of the Prussian Parajaegers in the city had seen that coming well in advance and had launched one final, determined attack to weaken the Prussians within the city before pulling out. It was a picture perfect retreat, except for one little detail:<br><br>One mixed squad of twenty Xing Shianian Lancers and Shingapooru infantry had gotten cut off during the chaos of the final battle, and missed out on the SENSE retreat. Now besieged in a shell torn building that was once a cheap budget hotel, they were fighting for their lives, turning off armored and infantry attacks with rapidly dwindling ammunition. It was an Alamo that Xing Shianian Command had sent LimÂ’s Land Warrior squad to rescue the trapped SENSE troopers from.<br><br>This meant that the Land Warriors had to come in, drop into an area swarming with enemy in full view of them and hold the fort until the besieged troopers could be evacuated. It was the kind of mission that made LIM nervous, for this time the Land Warriors had much less control over their engagements then their previous encounters with the enemy. It was going to be hairy.<br><br>Â“Two minutesÂ…Â”<br><br>A flight of three AUH-X1 Advanced Utility Helicopters flew past them on the starboard side, those small but incredibly versatile choppers, unofficially and affectionately called Â“The FoxÂ” by those who served with them had been keeping the trapped troopers alive by providing constant gunship support by spraying the Prussian positions with minigun and rocket fire, defty dodging the ground fire with their incredible agility and resisting those that connected with their armor.<br><br>The UH-80X Black Hawk Lim was on was more of a workhorse then a dancer, acquired from the Americans, the Xing Shiania military had customized it quite to their own needs, mainly by giving it a more powerful power plant and reducing the vulnerability of the chopper to ground fire. Three Blackhawks were involved in this operation, two empty ones to extract the trapped troopers, and one for LimÂ’s squad. SAM or serious anti aircraft fire was not too much of a concern yet, for extensive jamming and wild weasel raids had greatly reduced the Prussian anti air capability, though Lim knew all it took would be just one missile or well-placed shell to end their mission real quick.<br><br>Â“One minuteÂ…Â”<br><br>Lim tensed at the signal from the pilot, they were almost at the drop zone. Already they could see fresh palls of smoke rising ominously from the patch in the destroyed city where the desperate battle was still raging. Tracers started to lift lazily up into the night sky, seemingly unthreateningly slow at first, but increasing to frightening speed as they neared the chopper convoy. But they were too far out to be at any risk of getting hitÂ… yet.<br><br>Â“Twenty seconds!Â”<br><br>The Black Hawks swooped in low and fast over the city, catching the attention of less small arms fire but providing those they flew past with an easier shot, bullets started to whine and connect with the choppers, though it was largely ineffectual, for the Black Hawks had been well protected against small arms. Unless of course, they got a lucky hit that managed to find an intake or an unprotected area that skewered something vital. Lim tried his best not to think about that.<br><br>LimÂ’s chopper would be going in first, to drop his squad, while the other two Black Hawks circled, providing suppressive firepower with their side mounted 5.56mm miniguns. Lim held on as the chopper sunk rapidly and flared, blowing away anything not heavy enough to take the downdraft. Lim could actually see Prussian infantry taking cover as the sudden dust storm blasted over their positions as the gunners in the Black Hawks opened up and poured streams of 5.56mm minigun fire of over 3000 rounds per minute at Prussian positions. Lim looked in amazement as one Prussian soldier literally came apart under the attention of a burst of minigun fire, splattering viscera and gore over the street. Lim turned his attention away; he had to be focused. Dispensers on the sides of the choppers popped smoke grenades to screen the insertion, shrouding the gore of the splattered Prussian in man made fog. It was time.<br><br>Â“Go! Go! Go!Â” Lim shouted to his team as they threw their pre rigged ropes over the side of the Black Hawk and moved over the sides, sliding down the ropes using their hands and legs to control the descent. There was no time for rappelling, trying to get out of a rappelling rig in the midst of a firefight was suicide, it had to be done the dangerous, and old fashioned way.<br>Lim realized that the pilot has hovered the chopper much higher then usual when the rope slide down was much longer then any he had ever made. He could feel his jump gloves start to burn through from the friction and was getting concerned when he felt his feet touch the ground. Contact.<br><br>While the regular Prussian and SENSE infantry were likewise blinded by the smoke, the Land Warrior thermal viewers burned right through the fog. It was time to take the offensive before the smoke dispersed and Prussians started shooting at targets they could see.<br><br>Â“Engage! Engage!Â” Lim gave the order to kill as much enemy in the area as possible. Using their thermal sensors and situational awareness display, the Land Warriors poured a fusillade of devastatingly accurate rifle fire and 40mm grenades at Prussian positions as they moved to cover. The Prussians fired back randomly, trying to create a crossfire in which the Land Warriors would be caught. But it was too late; the Land Warriors found cover well in time and started shooting back from around it.<br><br>It was LimÂ’s job to make contact with the trapped squad. He exploded a 40mm round over a Prussian hiding behind a car that was covering his run to the ruined hotel in which the trapped squad was in and got to his feet, running as fast as he could. Despite the random fire, some bullets were getting close, the close ones cracking and the further ones whining past. The smoke had dispersed enough for the Prussians to start shooting aimed shots, though most of their infantry covering the LZ had been killed by the Land Warriors and it was going to take them some time to realize that, and even more to send replacements to shoot at them. Lim was counting on that. True enough, the Prussian fire in the area had slackened.<br><br>Lim made it to the entrance to the hotel. He didnÂ’t have to look for a welcoming committee for a few filthy, weary and unshaven SENSE troopers were already waiting there for him, weapons drawn.<br><br>Â“Evac team.Â” Lim said to all of them.<br><br>Â“About bloody time.Â” One of the troopers grunted. Â“LetÂ’s get out of here.Â”<br><br>Lim didnÂ’t have the time to engage in small talk, he called down the choppers and led the troopers to the LZ, the SENSE soldiers taking pause to fire at the Prussians and rush from cover to cover as they approached the three Black Hawks which had come to rest invitingly in the LZ, firing madly away with their miniguns at any Prussian that dare reveal himself, keeping much of the Prussian firepower pinned down.<br><br>They didnÂ’t waste time, the Black Hawks were sitting ducks on the ground, evident as a LAW rocket missed a chopper narrowly after a Land Warrior spotted the shooter and shot him just in time, the jerk of the bullet enough to cause the shooter to miss. More SENSE troopers opened up on the Prussian, and he was now quite surely dead.<br><br>The SENSE soldiers piled unceremoniously into the Black Hawk, many of the injured troops ignoring their pain as they contorted their injured limbs and bodies, the Black Hawks started to lift off, and Lim started to push the side doors shut to prevent small arms from coming into the chopper. It was a textbook extraction; the Land Warriors had dropped into a fierce firefight, defeated the opposing force and secured the area, extracted every member of the trapped squad, all without taking so much as a scratch-<br><br>A bullet came through just in time to beat the closing ballistic side door into the cabin of LimÂ’s Black Hawk and thudded into the cabin, sparking wildly and throwing up a tuff of insulating fluff and that floated around the cabin wildly. At the same time, the side gunner of the Black Hawk located the shooter and sprayed him with minigun fire, the dead Prussian doing a crazy jig and coming apart as the bullets tore through him.<br><br>Â“ Is everybody okay?Â” Lim shouted into the cabin, which despite the din of the rotors and engine, seemed deathly quiet.<br><br>Â“ Yeah we areÂ…Â” One of the Land Warriors started to reply and trailed off when they noticed that number two had slumped over in his seat, the catholic rosary held limply on arms that rested on his lap. The right side of his Land Warrior outfit stained deep with blood.<br><br>The bullet had come through and stuck number two in the neck, unprotected by body armor while he was saying his Hail Marys, and he died right there and then. Despite all the high tech equipment the Land Warriors used, such things like that would happen. Killed by a random shot.<br><br>Â“This is one, one, we lost number twoÂ” Lim radioed quietly.<br><br>As the Black Hawks flew home, they sat quietly, looking at the limp cadaver, decked out in its high tech gear, soaked in blood and slumped over in the seat, still clutching the rosary in its dead hands.<br></div>

Over 120 planes were involved in the sucessful strike, at a loss of about XAF 15 aircraft.

Or was it the signal to begin the sabotage operation? This they will never know, but they shall soon find out, for the signal was the message to begin sabotage operations to key military installations and facilities, pathing a easier invasion for ESA and SHA forces. Major shore artilleries are disabled, minefields are located and channelled back to ESA HQ, and radar defense has been knocked out, giving Xing Shiana pilots the element of surprise in knocking other military installations that Dominian agents were unable to destroy.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mhz Ground Snipers earn their keep in Malaya...</strong><br><br>0400 hours<br><br>Wong looked intently at his digital watch under the dim moonlight. It was 4 in the morning and here he was on the bahn waiting for the enemy. The earlier attack on the town that the mHzen was holding left mHzen forces pretty much crippled and morale was low. The mHzen forces suffered heavy casualties with a odds of 1:3 compared to the Prussian troops. Wong lost alot of his close friends. Those he had know for quite a long time, those who eat, drink and sleep with him were all gone.<br><br>Wong was sent out with a few others from other divisions as a small strike force to engage the enemy before the main strike force comes to take them out. Wong looked intently at the road that the bahn overlooked. Wong turned to look at the unusually shaped bushes that were situation on nearby knolls. He knew that his snipers were in position. Wong's grip on his HK MSG-90 felt as though he was holding an ice block. The moon wasn't too happy that particular night, not giving Wong the visibility he required.<br><br>Wong checked his rifle. Everything was in place. Wong had his radio as a headset to communicate with his CO's division which was hidden in the woods along the road.<br><br>0433 hours<br><br>Wong's eyes grew heavier and heavier. It seems as though his body is malfunctioning. Suddenly, Wong heard the sound of twigs breaking and dry leaves cracking. Wong's heart was filled with adrenalin. The trap! He thought, someone has stepped on it. Wong looked through his scope, he could see dark figures sneaking in the dark. Wong used his NVG to take a better look. The scruffy design of the uniform of the soldiers told Wong that it wasn't his own guys. The Prussians were here!<br><br>The top sent a message intercepted from the Prussians that the main strike force of the Prussians were passing through that road. Armoured divisions were flanking the town from the other side. Wong had to hold this division back or else the town could be in critical condition. With the possibility of it being overrunned. Wong knew he had to rely on his comrade who were also fighting on the other side of the town. Wong whispered into his headset.<br><br>"the octopus is in the pot! i repeat, the octopus is in the pot!"<br><br>Wong looked through his NVG again, a large force had appeared, ghost-walking on the road that he was overlooking. Wong estimated around 300 men were there with more to come behind. "foom!". The trail of smoke and light went past his eyes. The rocket hit directly in the middle of the division, killing at least 30-40 of them and shrapnel injuring a few others. Wong took aim and fired and simultaneously, other snipers situated at positions overlooking the road fired. A few Prussians were down.<br>1 minute ago The Borderlands of 440mhz 0445 hours.<br><br>Wong had already taken down 40 men if he counted correctly. Wong thought, the flanking should have already taken place and his CO's division should be pushing the Prussians forward. Giving the rest of the snipers a better view. True enough, Wong could see more and more Prussians scrambling forward to find cover. Instead getting hit by enemy fire. Wong had barely escaped from a bazooka that was fired 10 metres from where his was. The Prussians was too disorganised to figure out where the snipers were. Anyway the rifles had flash suppressors on, which gave the snipers added stealth advantage. Wong looked intently into his scope, peering at the mount of bodies that had already piled up, he could see the reflection of a pair of eyes, Wong took aim. "boom!" ... true enough a body flew back. Suddenly the firing ceased. Wong saw his own guys walking out through his scope, checking every body that was there and shooting in the head to make sure they're really dead. Wong saw the signal from his CO at the road. Wong stood up and straigtened, so did other snipers. The day's battle was done at this end of the town. Now it was up to his other comrades to stop the armoured divisions of Prussia at the other side of the town ...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Prussia Schemes... </strong><br><br>Grand Duke Reynard Adelbert sat in his office.So far,Pax Dominia had not been crushed.The invasion of Malaya has been slowed.The only comfort is that in every conflict,the Prussians have always been the better men.At least the Prussians are gainning ground....slowly.<br><br>Reynard had not counted on SENSE nations to react so quickly to his invasion.The first wave had met fierce resistance and had only won because of thier numbers though Prussian troops are considered to be one of the best in the world.There was no problems in killing Shingapooru and ES and even 440mhzen troops.But the Xing Shiana forces proved to be a tough nut.It has technology higher than that of Prussia's.But Prussian scientist has been testing a new weapon and might yet turn the tide against the SENSE into a tidal wave.Reynard was still worried however,he heard in Kechil Barbi,that 22 Prussian Jaegers was killed with no loss on the Xing Shiana land warriors in one skirmish.Even the Jaegers has problems dealing with the Xing Shiana!<br><br>Jaoquim Ribbentrop walked into the office.<br><br>"Your Highness,the new weapon system is ready."<br><br>Reynard smiled,Malaya would be in Prussians hand soon afterall.[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay a little update on how the war is going...<br><br>In a bold attempt to tie up Prussian forces in Malaya, SENSE nations have launched a sudden invasion of Prussia from the a 20 km length of beach in West Prussia called the Pronamdy Coast. 5 million Eiizumi-Shi and Shingapooru soldiers doing most of the land work while the Xing Air Force (XAF) provides air support. Pax Domina finally enters the war by sending SOF troopers into Prussian soil on spec. ops missions. Currently the SENSE task force in Prussia has advanced about 15 km into Prussia, with fierce fighting all the way. The attack on Prussia will mainly be the responsibility of ES, SH and Dominia<br><br>The situtation in Malaya is still as tenacious for SENSE, though the Prussians had taken a slight pause after capturing KB, they are expected to start the invasion afresh soon. Though ES and SHA has been providing most of the backbone of SENSE forces in Malaya, that will now change as 440Mhz and Xing Shiana move in more forces into Malaya. The 440Mhz military and the XSAF will now be taking a more active role, having used the time bought by the Eziiumi-states to deploy their forces in Malaya.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Battle for Webding grows desperate for the MLF</strong><br><br>1046 hours.<br><br>Colonel Motive walked into General Wavelength's office with a grin on his face. The scent of black coffee filled the room as General Wavelength was brewing his special thick coffee which he liked the way it is.<br><br>"sir, our forces stationed in the town of Webding have held back the oncoming Prussians with minimal casualties. Though our armoured divisions suffered badly because of the Prussians P0-1 panzerfausts which cost us 63% of our challengers and cheftains that are stationed there."<br><br>"Good work. Send word to the CO over there that reinforcements will be provided in another 3 days time. 3 divisions will be sent over to relieve them of their duty."<br><br>"yes sir."<br><br>Colonel Motive walked out of the room leaving General Wavelength to enjoy the scenery outside his window.<br><br>1055 hours<br><br>meanwhile, the battle over a critical bluff left the MLF crippled and disorganised as the Prussians continue to pound the oncoming mHzens with lead, artillery and rockets. Cpl Chan crawl under the oncoming artillery and flying lead to his platoon commander.<br><br>"Sergeant! what the heck are we supposed to do now?!"<br><br>Flustered and in pespiration. The sergeant gave Chan the looked he never ever wanted to see. "i dunno" was the thought that ran through Chan's mind. He crawled back under heavy enemy fire. Pretty much anxious at the situation and annoyed at the incompetence of his platoon commander. The bluff was overlooking a dense forest that gave the MLF good cover over forward observers and enemy snipers. The thick canopy that formed over their head blocked out most of the sunlight, giving the mHzen troops lousy visibility. Chan's platoon had lost about 150 men to the earlier barrage of artillery. Chan hugged a tree as he heard the oncoming squeal of artillery. Soil flew into his face and trees fell. Chan opened his eyes, pretty much glad that he didn't get hit.<br><br>Chan looked around, at his rather blur comrades as the squatted there shivering in fear and chanting prayers. Chan was at a lost what to do, his whole world seem as though it had already collapsed. Suddenly, Chan noticed a rather familiar face that was left on the ground, with all it's entrails coming out of the neck, it was his PC. Must have been killed during the earlier barrage. Chan cringed at the sight of it. He started to raise his voice.<br><br>"come on guys! let's retreat for today! wait for support to come!"<br><br>Chan took lead as he ran away from the bluff as flying lead flew over his head. Eyes lit up as they looked at this lone hero running away, they knew they'll get into serious trouble for retreating like that, but who cares, they didn't bother. Slowly one man stood up and started running, followed by groups of twos and threes, followed by the rest. Though a few were gunned down, Chan managed to get most of the survivors to a safe place and in relief Chan threw his equipment on the floor and fell flat on his back, exhausted at the day's long battle.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Battle for Webding.</strong><br>Heinz looked about his surroundings,he was comfortably sitting in one of the 50 Aquanix that the 2nd JAeger Cavalry Brigade are sending against the MHZEN and the newly arrived XSAF AGS.And mixed among the Aquanixs are approximately 4000 Prussian troops of the 305th Regiment.<br><br>"Alright boys,move out and advance in caution.Infantry,i want the 6th,5th and 7th platoon to each occupy the police station,train station and post centre immediately after arrival.The rest,search and destroy mission.Jaegers,disable all the forces Roger and out!"<br><br>The FeldMarschall's orders were clear.<br><br>20 minutes later,Webding came into full view.<br><br>There are firefights all over the town now,it's been two hours since Prussian forces entered Webding.The MLF were no push-overs.They were good soldiers in every right.But the Prussians has got discipline and tactics on thier side.<br><br>So far,the Prussians has captured and secured the train station and Post centre with a staggering loss of 5 Prussians to 1 MLF.55% of the town is in Prussian control now.The Police station has been surrounded by MLF and the 7th platoon was trapped there.Efforts to break through the line has been futile.<br><br>Heinz smiled,in front of his aquanix was what was once a machinegun position.<br><br>"Blue squadron,move and deploy at police station,friendlies encircled in PS."<br><br>"Roger that" Leutnant Heinz commanded his Blue Squad to the police station.<br><br>The Police station was now within Blue squad's range,approximately 50 feet ahead was a MLF platoon trying to storm the police station.<br><br>"open fire on bogies 12 o'clock"<br><br>HE and Mg fires from the aquanix ended the short lived charge.<br><br>Suddenly,one of Blue squad's tanks blew up in flames.Two challengers came into view.The disciplined Jaeger squad quickly set to half speed weaving in and out of the line of sight of the challengers.One of the challengers then took a hit to it's track and another hit from Blue 5 ended the challenger's service life.The other tank was taken out by a Prussian infantry squad with the feared Po-1 Panzerfausts.The escaping crew was shredded by G3 rifle fire.<br><br>Blue 2 burst into flames and seconds later blue 7 became twisted metal also.A XSAF AGS came into view..<br><br>"Fire!"<br><br>Only two shots hit the AGS.The first one was a failure because a "clang" was heard ,the second one by Heinz hit and it penetrated,but the AGS still turned Blue 3 and 4 into scraped metal.Blue 6 exploded with a hit to it's engine.<br><br>Then the AGS stopped firing.One of the earlier mentioned infantry squad had flanked the AGS and had fired a PO-1 at it,it was a lucky shot though,for it hit the power pack of the AGS.<br><br>The police station was secured.<br><br>5 more hours later,the city hall of Webding flew the Prussian Tiger(the flag is called the Tiger because it has a Tiger in the background.)<br><br>In the midst of chaos,the Prussian 214th Regiment had manged to snuck up behind and attacked the enemy's rear leaving only a small opening for it to flee rather than trap them and continue fighting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Battle for Webding, SENSE side.</strong><br><br>Webding, Malaya<br>SENSE sector<br><br>Â“Hey, youÂ’re pretty exposed there.Â” The mHzen corporal observed, crouching just behind the turret.<br><br>Â“True enough.Â” Staff Sergeant Tan Xiao Yang noted, her FCS Armored Gun System was dug into the rubble of a partially destroyed building, with the gun tube just barely clearing the mound of broken concrete and twisted steel. Calm and quiet as the scene was before her, Yang knew that the enemy was coming, and soon.<br><br>Her presence in armor had risen the eyebrows of several of the foreign SENSE soldiers around, but was a sight barely worth attention to a Xing Shianan, unless some of them considered her attractive of course. Compulsory military training for both genders in Xing Shiana from the age of 15 had made sure that the gender demographics in the Xing Shianian military was pretty much 50-50, though more of the females took up non direct combatant roles in the military, Yang had been one of the minority. When she had driven in a few hours ago in the small, 9 tank force to reinforce the SENSE armor in Webding, the MLF troopers had spent quite a bit of time huddling up into groups, and talking excitedly as they view her from a distance going on her routines around her tank. Bunch of immature pigs, Yang had wanted to say then, but realized that the average age amidst them was only 19.<br><br>Nobody doubted the quality of Xing Shianan female soldiers, entry qualifications in the military were strictly based not on affirmative action or quotas or all the other stuff the politically-correct militaries of other countries were so caught up in. In the XSAF, it went strictly by ability, where only the best person for the role got the role, irregardless of race, language, religion, and in her case, gender. Combat Xing Shianan women were tough, independent, knew how to take care of themselves and every bit as respected as their male counterparts, as any person who tried to get funny with them quickly, and painfully realized. Harassment was virtually unknown. They were tough.<br><br>Â“You better go now, itÂ’s gonna be Showtime soon.Â” Yang said, waving at the corporal as he scrabbled over the loose debris back to his foxhole. A nice guy, Yang observed, he had come over to share a hot meal with them. The first they had had for a while- almost any kind of food was better then the supposedly Â“improvedÂ” MRE field rations.<br><br>Yang hauled herself onto the low hull of the AGS, and dropped down the open hatch into the crew compartment. Her crewmember was already there, drumming his fingers on the control yokes on his side of the duplicated controls.<br><br>Â“Not a bad looking guy,Â” The tanker said to her in that crass style she had gotten used to. Â“Maybe after all this we can ask the rest to arrange a little something for you two?Â” He laughed as he buttoned up his hatch.<br><br>Â“Shut up and get to work Dill.Â” Yang snapped. Though he was competent tanker and teammate, Yang had never quite gotten used to DillonÂ’s relentless ribbing of whatever she did and endless supply of senseless jokes. They had trained together since day one and she had learned to tolerate these nuances, he was just one of the many people in the unit she considered her brothers and sisters, perhaps even much closer then her actual family. Over the years they had gone through virtually every military training hardship together and had learnt to depend on each other. She trusted him with her life, as he did hers. It was pure comradeship.<br><br>She counted almost as much on her little tank to keep her safe in battle as well. The AGS, essentially being the light tank variant of the larger FCS MBT, came in far lighter at only 15 tons, but shared almost all the features of found in its bigger brother. It was a good light tank, the most advanced in the world. More then just a mobile, protected space, it was a hotbed of advanced technology that linked it up to countless other units in the large invisible technological web of Force Integration. They fought their war as much with advanced communications and information as they did with their advanced 120mm ETC main gun.<br><br>Prussian artillery started to fall in the form of shells and rockets. Pounding the SENSE sector of the town with a man made storm of explosions and flying metal. Several rounds fell in YangÂ’s section, rocking the 15 ton tank steadily. Yang could hear and feel the shrapnel pinging off the armor. Yang knew she had it easy, the mHzen infantry must all now be huddled in their foxholes, slit trenches or whatever shelter they could find. It would be pure death to be caught in the open. The Prussian artillery bombardments never lasted, the MLF counter battery fire always found them soon enough if they stood around and cooked off too many rounds. The Prussians would shoot off a salvo or two, and then scoot before the superior MLF arty found them. Sure enough, the Prussian bombardment stopped as abruptly as it had begun. They were coming.<br><br>Â“Get ready, enemy contact estimated in 2 minutes, 2 minutes.Â” Dill glanced at the situational display. Her force of 9 AGS had been arranged mixed with the MLF conventional armor to provide overlapping zones of fire over the street to provide maximum firepower to bear on the advancing Prussians. She read the situational display again; she would be facing about 50 Prussian Aquanix amphibious light tanks and more mechanized infantry.<br><br>The Prussian Aquanix light tanks outnumbered SENSE armor, which was made up of her 9 AGS and 7 other MLF conventional MBTs, at about 3 to 1. Their infantry, some of which certainly were anti-tank units, would make things worse. Due to the need to be light because of their amphibious nature, the Aquanix tanks had weak armor, a vulnerability the Prussians tried to reduce by adding add-on modular armor. The 120mm low recoil main gun of the Aquanix would be a concern though, for it stood a fair chance of penetrating the armor of the SENSE tanks, including the level 3 protection package her tank had been fitted out with.<br><br>Â“Contact! Contact! Weapons free!Â” Came the call over the radio from armor commander in one of the MLF Challangers. The Prussians were now within visual range.<br><br>Yang had seen the Prussians from over twice as far as the MLF tank commander, thanks to the advanced sensors on her tank, and had been tracking one all along. Target information sharing through the wireless network made sure that everyone knew who was shooting at what to make sure there were no over-engagement of targets and the wasting of ammo.<br><br>Â“LetÂ’s see where you can hideÂ…Â” Yang whispered as she depressed the rangefinder button with both thumbs, she got the range, saw the ready to shoot light, and pulled on the trigger to send a HEAT round on its way.<br><br>At the command to shoot, the electrical electrodes in the120mm ETC cannon fed a sudden surge of power to the plasma burner installed in its breech. The resulting plasma arc generated evaporated the propellant energetic chemical liquid, transitioning it violently into a plasma whose gases have a lower molecular weight than conventional powder gases, in turn, generating higher and constant pressures possible in normal gun tubes. The reduction of gas masses to be accelerated together with the projectile allows higher muzzle velocities to be reached in any conventional weapon of similar caliber. Riding on rapidly expanding plasma gases, the HEAT round exited at over three times the speed of sound.<br><br>Though speed has little bearing on how well a HEAT warhead works, as opposed to a dart penetrator, the flatter trajectories generated by the greater speeds made gunnery computing simpler and reduced error margins. Yang saw the HEAT round as a white streak on her thermal view as it blasted its way to the target.<br><br>Eight hundred meters downrange, the 120mm HEAT round found its target, a Prussian Aquanix tank. The shaped charged warhead of the High Explosive Anti Tank shell exploded, discharging an extremely fast ever-elongating stream of stream of copper particles and gas into the armor of the tank at pressures in orders of hundreds of kilobars per square inch. Pressured far beyond its physical strength, the armor material of the tank flowed apart fluidly away from the path of the HEAT jet. A tenth of a millisecond later, the jet of warhead material entered the crew compartment, blasting copper particles and explosive gases within, exacting hellish overpressures. The hatches of the tank blew out moments before the entire thing exploded like a plastic toy.<br><br>Â“Good shotÂ…Â” Dill said absentmindedly as the main gun was slaved over to his target while Yang acquired another target in the hunter-killer mode that allowed them to engage and destroy targets twice as fast as tanks lacking that ability. The small tank rocked back from recoil again, it was another hit, another Aquanix lay burning somewhere down the range.<br><br>YangÂ’s next victim was a Prussian IFV; she speared the crosshairs over the boxy profile of her target and fired a HEAT, which exploded it and stopped it dead in its tracks. She cringed inwardly as she saw burning Prussians start to bail of out their battle taxi that had become a sudden inferno in a very small space. The human torches stumbled out of their broken ride, swinging their arms madly until mHzen snipers and their own troops ended their misery with a few well-placed shots. Such was war.<br><br>A HEAT round impacted on the mould of rubble that was the cover for their AGS, throwing up a shower of debris that pattered their little tank. Dill had already acquired the antagonist responsible for the shot and fired, narrowly missing over the engine compartment of the enemy tank. The Prussians crewing this tank were pros, they never drove straight and bobbed and weaved their tank in and out of, in front and behind mounds of rubble. An mHzen Chieftain beside their AGS blasted a round at it, and missed again as the savvy tank commander ordered his tank to sudden turn and head for cover behind a building. Just before it disappeared behind the building however, it fired and the Chieftian burst into flames.<br><br>Â“Crap!Â” Dill swore. The Prussians were getting real close now, the infantry dismounting under suppressive fire and starting to fight. It was going to be a close-quarter, slugfest.<br><br>Â“Time to move.Â” Yang backed the tank out from behind the defilade, crunching stones with their polymer tracks as the 15 ton tank backed up. The fight was getting really intense now, with the streets alive with the cackle of rifle fire and the occasional deeper thump of a larger weapon going off. Yang moved the tank back to the second firing position, perfectly coordinated with the rest of the SENSE armor without even having to speak a word. It was just one of the advantages of fighting with information.<br><br>Â“Woah!Â” Yang flinched as a Po-1 rocket zipped by, clipping the AGS turret and sliding along in a shower of sparks before riding off into a building behind, exploding the concrete there. Â“Infantry AT fire getting hot, using the fifty cal.Â”<br><br>While driving her tank backwards, Yang thumbed the selector for the remote controlled, turret-mounted machine gun. Another reticule blinked on in her visor, and following her head movements wherever she looked. Up on the turret above, the .50cal machine gun went through the same motions, mechanically taking bead at whatever Yang was looking at. She turned her attention to some Prussian AT infantry chasing her tank down the road and trying to get a shot off with their Po-1s and sprayed a burst of .50cal as a disincentive, three of them fell and the rest dodged for cover. Yang backed her tank away and out of sight behind a building, planning her next move.<br><br>The battle for Webding was growing desperate, SENSE was fighting with itÂ’s back to the wall, giving the Prussians incredible resistence all throughout the town, fighting for every building room by room, corridor by corridor. Tanks scuttled in and out of sight of each other around and behind buildings, trying to snap in shots in the brief moments they saw their targets. As the massive street fight grew into its second hour, it became clear that SENSE troops were on the verge of breaking.<br><br>Caught up in the fierce fighting, Yang noticed a new text message blink on in her situational display it was from high command.<br><br>Â“WTD ALPHAÂ”<br><br>Yang swallowed, that was the general order for all SENSE troops to retreat out of the town to phase line alpha. She could see why; on the eint, it was clearly obvious that SENSE forces in Webding were in impending danger of being encircled by the Prussians as they poured more men into the battle, so much that they were starting to flow around the SENSE forces and box them in.<br><br>Â“Okay, weÂ’re gonna try to hold off them off while the infantry withdraws.Â” Yang radioed to the remaining SENSE armor. She drove her tank from behind the building she had taken cover down the street at full throttle, spraying the startled Prussian infantry with .50cal fire. Several rockets fired hastily in response by Prussian AT infantry all missed. Yang popped smoke, which effectively blinded the Prussians but not themselves, thanks to their electronic sensors. Dill blasted a window containing a Prussian AT team while Yang swung the .50 cal in wide arcs, firing at the Prussians on both sides of the street. The Prussians started to scramble from the street, giving SENSE infantry a chance to withdraw.<br><br>Yang saw a Prussian tank appear from behind a destroyed Challenger in front of them, with several others following behind as the smoke cleared enough for the Prussians to see them as well. Judging from the way the lead tank drove, it had to be them savvy tank crew she saw earlier. Dill managed to hit the Prussian tank this time with a sabot and the crew was no more. While all this was happening, Yang had already acquired the closest tank behind while all this was happening and fired the moment the gun controls were slaved over to her. The other Prussian exploded spectacularly as well flinging the turret 40 feet into the air.<br><br>Yang felt cold panic when she realized that they were facing off against over three more Prussian tanks down this street. She backed her tank into reverse just as a shot wanged off the turret face of the AGS.<br><br>Â“Shoot the jokers!Â” Yang shouted unnecessarily to Dill as she move the AGS back, weaving the tank like she had seen the now-dead Prussian tank crew did. A Prussian shot came crashing into the AGS and she heard the scream of metal and composite as they failed under the assault. Several areas on the graphic representing her tank on the AGS flashed red and yellow, indicating internal damage. But excellent redundancies and internal damage control systems had made sure that the AGS was still functional. Dill exploded one Prussian tank with a sabot and Yang nailed another in rapid succession. Dill killed the last Prussian tank engaging at them with a quick shot to the engine using a HEAT round.<br><br>It was time to retreat, Yang backed the tank into reverse and started down the street back to join the retreating SENSE forces when she noticed that in the heat of battle she had neglected several threat indicators on her situational display that were now going to be a large problem.<br><br>They were a Prussian AT squad that had managed to flank her tank, and were now readying a shot to her side. She hit the controls for the .50cal and swung the gun over to the side, maybe she could cut the swine down before they could get off a shot-<br><br>It was too late, the Prussians snapped off a shot with their Po-1 and retreated behind cover as Yang sprayed after them with the .50 cal. The rocket struck the rear of the hull and exploded. For a moment the AGS continued to back off, as if nothing happened, but then Yang knew the tank was disabled when she saw that the schematic representing the engine on the damage display was dark, indicating the engine was destroyed. The tank ground to a halt, powered only by auxiliary systems.<br><br>Â“Okay, letÂ’s get out of here.Â” Yang said calmly. Â“Initiate non recoverable drill.Â”<br><br>As friendly forces could not recover the disabled AGS, all sensitive material onboard had to be destroyed to avoid such high technology falling into enemy hands. And that could be achieved by the means of self-destruct incendiary thermite charges planted in all the sensitive equipment of the tank that would burn out enough to melt steel, leaving the highly classified advanced technology nothing more then slag for the Prussians to find. Yang popped smoke to cover their escape and unbuckled the bottom emergency escape hatch. Just before they exited, she flipped the plastic cover off the button to activate the thermite charges and hit it.<br><br>Arid sparks and smoke announced the successful self-destruction of the sensitive technology as the thermite charges burned like mini flares within the tank. Yang lowered herself out of the abandoned tank and moved off with Dill to run to friendly lines, covered another AGS, which had thankfully come up to give them covering fire as they retreated. When they were clear, the AGS pumped two HEAT rounds into the rear of the knocked out AGS to demolish it further. Not much luck; it didnÂ’t catch fire or blow up much, though nobody would be using it for a long while.<br><br>Back safely in friendly lines, Yang followed the chaotic retreat back, she felt strange without the order and information the FCS provided her with. Without her technological mount, she was just another faceless and clueless SENSE trooper in the field. She watched from the back of the three toner truck on the rough ride rear as a Prussian flag was risen on the town hall. WeÂ’ll be back, she promised.<br><br>The AGS had acquitted themselves well, losing only two of their number disabled to 18 destroyed enemy tanks, with YangÂ’s tank taking seven of those kills. Besides tanks, an assortment of countless other enemy vehicles also fell to the AGS. The mHzen armor had also done well, though they were now only left with three functional tanks, from the original seven.<br><br>However, now with SENSE lines in Malaya scattered and spread perilously thin, there was no doubt about it. SENSE lines had been breached in Webding and unless the gap was plugged, the rest of Malaya will fall soon, and the doorstep of The Borderlands of 440 mHz was just a mere fifty kilometers away. Even as the situation unfolded, COMMON SENSE commanders were collapsing the lines back, trying to consolidate a serious defense to buy more time for more SENSE reinforcements to arrive.<br></div>

Wong closed his eyes in fear and anxiety. Tears nearly streaming down his eyes. Train of thoughts ran through his mind. Was it his last battle? Was he going to meet his maker in any time? Is this the end of the mHzen nation? The Prussian army was closing in on the borders of 440mhz.<br><br>Wong said his last prayers before attempting to act hero and take as many men with him as possible. He gripped tightly on the handle of his HK MSG-90 rifle. Wong straigtened up. Wong snuck to a window overlooking the town center where most of the Prussian army will be passing through.<br><br>Wong looked through his sniper scope and scanned out the forehead of a Prussian. Wong took aim ... "boom!". The Prussian feel. Other soldiers scrambled for fire, the familiar "sniper!" warning scream could be heared from where Wong was. Soldiers dashed for cover, hiding behind the town statue, behing fallen walls, running behind burning tanks and trucks. Wong followed his scope on a running Prussian ... "boom!" ... the Prussian fell like Goliath.<br><br>Pretty much to Wong's suprise, the Prussians still have not discovered his well-concealed position, which was hidden nicely from their sight. No one could make out where he was. Wong grew braver, Wong started to stick his muzzle out a little for a better shot. Suddenly, bits and pieces of stone flew in front of his face. The sound of bullets riocheting off the wall was distinct which told Wong the bullets wasn't too far off from him. They've found his position! The enemy's G3 was pounding on his position!<br><br>Wong squeeze into his helmet ... he didn't know how he did it but he managed to. Wong hugged his rifle tightly. Suddenly the defeaning blast of a cannon could be heard. He felt the building shake and followed by the floor slanting to one side. Wong opened his eyes wide, his view of the world was pretty much slanted too. Wong knew that the enemy's tank fire had hit the building's foundation. Wong knew he could be under the rubble any moment.<br><br>Wong decided to be hero for the last time, he snuck to another opening and took aim. Despite the heavy MG fire wong peered through his scope and zoomed on the CO. "this is it!" Wong thought. His life was coming to an end, he'll take the CO with him. "boom!" went the rifle. Wong flew back because of the recoil. Something was different, the sound of the rifle was seemingly louder and more resounding. Wong scrambled to his feet and stuck his eyes over a hole in the wall. The enemy's tanks was in flames. "what!? that wasn't suppose to happen, this ain't MOHAA!".<br><br>Suddenly another blast resounded, sending flying pieces of scrap metal off another of the enemy's tank. Prussian soldiers scrambled for cover, bewildered at the power of a HK MSG-90 rifle that could destroy two tanks.<br><br>Wong looked intently through the smoke and fumes that were emitting from the burning tanks. Rumbling sounds could be heard. Wong caught sight of a tank that didn't seem Prussian ... it was a Leopard II! Wong's eyes lit up, beside it he could see the very familiar no. 4 of mHzen forces. At the other road leading to the town center, cannon fire sent Prussian troops scrambling toward Wong's position. Wong caught sight of XSAF's FCS Light Tanks and troops pressing in on the enemy. Wong's heart began to pump faster and faster. A hope was ignited in his heart! Wong took aim through his scope and took down several Prussian troopers.<br><br>Suddenly the roar like thunder filled the air. Wong looked up ... and recognized the familiar B-22 and B-2 bombers from the MAF. The B-22 and B-2s sent tons of explosive on the captured territory of Prussia. They didn't stand a chance. Everything went chaotic for the Prussians. Wong quickly jump through the opening of a wall that was adjacent to another building and managed to make it out in time before the building he was in collapsed. Wong made his way down to join in on the oncoming MLF and XSAF. For 4 hours, both parties engaged in a battle where no one budged. Casualties were heavy for both sides as the battle raged on. Finally a broke through came where A-1 Warthorgs from MAF dove in and dropped napalm on the Prussians. The terrified Prussian troops fled, leaving their weapons and equipment behind to be burnt by the napalm. MLF's armoured division was holding off the Prussians where a gap in the Prussian defence could mean the defeat of the whole Prussian army in town of Webding. While XSAF was flanking the Prussian from their left, MLF Leopard II division flanked the Prussian from the right, leaving them with only the back to escape from.<br><br>MLF's cheftain division pushed on, leaving the Prussian running like rats being chased by a scowling cat. While the Prussians were fleeing, the MLF's Leopard II and XSAF flanked them, leaving them with more casualties.<br><br>The order came through ... stop the attack. Both XSAF and MLF's Leopard II halt right where they were including MLF's cheftain tanks. Bewildered, the Prussian troops continued their retreat, pretty much relieved that the enemy didn't press on. But their joy was short-lived. As the continued to flee, an explosion in front of them left several troops badly maimed. The rest at the back halted in their tracks. Artillery was coming down on them! The squeal of oncoming artillery left the Prussians stunned and suddenly soil flew right into their face.<br><br>Captain Onslaught peered through his binoculars from the town's clock tower. The smoke and dust that slowly rised into the air told him that the Prussians were pretty much dead. They finally managed to drive them out of Webding!<br>2 hours ago The Borderlands of 440mhz Colonel Motive strudded into the room with a face as long as papaya. General Wavelength knew that the news that he carried wasn't as good as the black coffee he was sipping from the china cup in his hand.<br><br>"how was the counter-offense Colonel?"<br><br>"success General! we managed to push the Prussian all the way back to Kechil Barbi."<br><br>"then why the long face??!?"<br><br>"sorry General, my wife scolded me when i got back home yesterday."<br><br>General Wavelength's eyes rolled.<br><br>"fine, put 5 more Leopard II divisions on Webding with 2 divisions on M-1 Abrams in it. Organise your troops and push the Prussians out of Kechil Barbi. Sent another 2 more M-1 divisions to flank the side of kechil barbi and put 4 divisions of MEG(mHzen elite guards) 5 km away from the Leopard II's position. Get them to press in no matter what."<br><br>"yes sir!" Colonel Motive grunted.<br><br>He did a 180 degree turn and marched out of the office. While Colonel Motive was walking through the door, General Wavelength spoke through his breath.<br><br>"oh Colonel, please don't give me that face if the news isn't bad next time, it really ruins the taste of my coffee"<br><br>Colonel Motive halted at the door with his eyebrows up.<br><br>"erh .. yes sir!"<br></div>
