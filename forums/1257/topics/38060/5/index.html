            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mobilization takes place in 440mhz and 220mhz</strong><br><br>Re-entry<br><br>Wong woke up to a bright and sunny morning. Cool weather, fresh air and the bird were chirping outside his bedroom window. Everything seemed normal, oblivious to what happened last night along the Prussian Straits.<br>Finally he was able to take a break and go back to his normal life as a musician, playing in the band with his band mates, of which, by some strange fate, all survived the war. Wong was thankful, his band mates didnÂ’t get killed in the war against Prussia but all of them had accounts of when they met death face to face, but lived to tell the tale.<br><br>Looking out of his bedroom window, he heard the rumbling sound of a familiar engine sound of the A-10 Warthorg.<br><br>Â“Training exercise early in the morning huh, not bad.Â” Wong thought.<br><br>Even right after the war had ended, the mHzen War Department pushed for its soldiers to be better-trained and more well-equipped with the latest Land Warrior technology that has been recently acquired from Xing Shiana. Soon after the first Warthorg had passed by, another A-10 passed, and another, and another, followed by a huge fleet of Warthorgs. Wong smelt something fishy, the MAF would not organize a training exercise en masse, not when its pilots are well trained and experience, not when the war was over, there was certainly something going on that he didnÂ’t know.<br><br>Wong brushed that thought aside, he was going back to the army base to find out. Getting out of his bed, he carried on with his usual morning routine of bathing, washing up, eating his breakfast and going out to the mailbox to collect the mail. Everything seemed so fresh when he did his routine for the first time in uncountable years, or maybe months. After his breakfast, Wong walked out to the mailbox. The sight of a mHzen War Department letter didnÂ’t make his day any better. Wong cringed.<br><br>Â“What good can come out of this letter?Â” He thought.<br><br>He was right, nothing good did. It was a letter of mobilization from the War Department. Prussia had decline the surrender terms set by the SENSE nations that resulted in SENSE taking action against the already much-weakened state of Prussia. An invasion into Prussian soil was impending and the War Department wants to put its soldiers on standby, ready for deployment any moment when the SENSE War Council gives the signal to invade Prussia.<br><br>Â“Shit these idiots!Â”<br><br>Not only was Wong referring to Prussia itself, but also to the mHzen War Department, but orders were orders. A soldier cannot disobey an order from the top, it would literally be mutiny. Walking back into his cottage in fury and rage, Wong took out his bag pack and starting to pack in the necessary clothing and equipment. Finally he took out the thing he could be without in battle, his trusty HK MSG-90 that has served him so well.<br><br>Â“Well, here we go friend, itÂ’s gonna be another long battle.Â”<br><br>Throughout his time in combat, Wong have developed very intimate feelings for his rifle, which he now calls his wife. Though the standard issue of the mHzen snipers are the PSG-1s, HK MSG-90 are becoming more and more popular among the mHzen snipers, not only because itÂ’s lighter in weight, the stealth that comes along with it exceeds the PSG-1, which launches used shells around 10 meters away, increasing the possibility of the position of the sniper being found.<br><br>Shunich Air Base<br><br>Things were getting pretty heated up in the air base since the War Department gave the Â“I love green teaÂ” red alert signal. Though it was a little on the lame side, the WD didnÂ’t want to take risk at having its military activities being dished out by Prussian counterintelligence. Tanks rolled into the air base after 8 hours of traveling across the country to Shunich. The new variant of Leopard II and T-95s were finally combat-ready and fully developed, alongside with the M1A2 Abrams.<br><br>A-10s and F-117s were also flying in and out of the air base, pilots warming up for an impending air strike against Prussia. The decision of Prussia was going to cost both SENSE and Prussia much loss. Nevertheless, this tyranny had to be stopped, someone had to do it and who would be up to the job than the valiant soldiers of SENSE nations.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SENSE pre-empts Prussia at Leight</strong><br><br>The 110th Armoured Calvary Regiment had been rushed at full speed to Leight, but they had no time to rest. It was time to catch the enemy off balance before he could launch an attack. Rushed from Malaya, the 110th ACR tore through the streets of Leight at 70kpg, past startled civilians as they watched the armour roll by. Hot on their heels were three company of Lancer AGS.<br><br>Opposing them would be the 67th Jaeger motorised Brigade and 9th mechanized regiment, roughly 15,000 Jager Infantry in armoured transports with roughly 400 Aquanix light tanks plus the 640 regular infantry and the 60 MBTs of the 9th mechanized regiment approaching Leight. Facing them would be about 600 Xing Shianan infantry and 140 FCS MBTs, plus 48 Lancer AGS.<br><br>The best chance for SENSE to take the battle to the Prussians before they brought it to sense. There were far more Eziiumi-shi and Shingapooru units in Leight, but they lacked the mobility to actively move forward to engage the Prussians in the open before they reached Leight. That would be the job of Xing Shianan armourÂ…<br><br>Â…and airpower. Streaking low overhead, seventeen now notorious Xing Shiana Bobcats blasted out of nowhere to drop cluster munitions and engage the Prussians with Mavericks. When they ran out of bombs and missiles, they made several cannon passes before disappearing over the horizon, disappearing as fast as they had come, popping flares and chaff. Following the first attack, XAF Falcons and JSFs started coming in, dropping FAEs and crisscrossing the advancing Prussians with missiles. 440Mhz arty opened up at that time too, sending hundreds of shells to beat at the Prussians as they approached.<br><br>The Prussian commander had expected SENSE airpower and arty to be a problem, and had hence spread his units out to minimise losses, it worked to an extent, for the initial SENSE strikes only knocked out fifty tanks and took 220 men out of action.<br><br>Such a dispersed formation was good for advancing under artillery and airpower, but it was bad for resisting an armoured pre-emptive punch. By spreading themselves out, they had provided the advancing formations of Xing Shianan armour the ability to break through, using their superior mobility and range to pick off the advancing Prussians as they came into range, using their mobility to keep out of sensor and weapons range of the Prussians. Spread out, the Prussians lacked tactical strength and were unable to advance under the fire of the Xing Shianan armour, much less advance close enough to see them. Several more Prussian tanks and infantry carriers died. With holes punched in their forward formations, the advance started to break down.<br><br>It was time to take the initiative, the Xing Shianan armor advanced in concentrated wedge formation, charging forward, releasing salvo after salvo of shells and missiles as they went. The dispersed Prussian tanks were unable to concentrate their fire effectively and ended up getting isolated and destroyed. Knowing that the current strategy was not working, the Prussian general ordered his units back out of FCS range before they got routed and organized them to a more concentrated formation. The advance had stopped; the battle now on the tank-country plains of Leight. The FCS ACRs, sastified with their success and to avoid overreaching themselves and getting cut off, stopped the armoured punch and withdrew, creating a new phase line that the Prussians would have to get through before they could reach Leight.<br><br>The Prussians had taken moderate losses and were less 120 tanks and 720 men, but they were far from over. The first battle of the Leight plains had just been concluded.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Peregrines of Dreamland</strong><br><br>Â“Â… and we will not tolerate this SENSE assault on our Germanic brothers, we sha-Â“<br><br>Millions of Prussians and Reichens were confused when the broadcast of Andreas KaiserÂ’s propaganda speech announcing military support for Prussia cut off abruptly. Though many did not know it, the television station broadcasting the speech had ceased to exist.<br><br>Pulling incredibly tight gees and swooping low over the ground flying map of the earth at nearly the speed of sound, twenty XS-1 Perceus Peregrines of the Xing Shianan Airforce easily penetrated the Reichland radar umbrella and attacked their targets simultaneously with cluster munitions, disabling major radar installations, AA sites, communications centers and the television station, crippling the air defenses of the small nation. The Peregrines swooped into dizzying maneuvers before heading on to their secondary targets, dispensing their last loads of cluster munitions over all the major army bases in the country. Their mission accomplished, the small aircraft swooped up and hit the afterburner to accelerate on their escape trajectories before supercruising back to friendly lines. It was a picture perfect attack and an extremely successful combat debut for the Peregrines, much to the delight of their controllers.<br><br>Following the Peregrines closely was a wave of supersonic cruise missiles from the Arsenal ships of task force Bakker, targeting airbases and army bases. Their captains having received the same message from SENSE high command, before receiving their fire missions.<br><br>TOP SECRET<br>FR:SENSEHC<br>TO:ALL SNBG SHIPS<br><br>NO PEACE WITH REICHLAND<br><br>ENGAGE IN UNRESTRICTED SEA, AIR AND LAND WARFARE AGAINST REICHLAND FORCES<br><br>STOUT HEARTS. SENSEHC SENDS<br><br>The missiles came in about two minutes after the Peregrines, the delay giving the Reichen soldiers in the army bases to leap out of their bed, struggle into their uniforms, throw on their boots and grab their rifles to rush outside only to be shredded into hamburger by the exploding submunitions and the missiles themselves. The cruise missiles coming in over the airbases released their cluster munitions over the airbases, before crashing themselves, adding to the mayhem already caused.<br><br>A Reichland Airforce was quick to respond, their pilots scrambling into their advanced F-22 fighters and taxing out to respond to the air attack. As they taxied onto the runways, they realized fatally to their surprise that the submunitions dispensed there by the cruise missiles had been fused not to explode on impact but to act as mines. In the darkness it was impossible to see the submunitions and avoid them, let alone taxi and takeoff. In airstrips all over the small nation, the first fighters to be scrambled soon turned into fireballs of exploding fuel and weapons on the runway, effectively blocking them and preventing them from being used. As the fire control crews fought to control the blaze and clear the debris off the runway, the preset timers in the submunitions ran out and they detonated simultaneously, scattering body parts of airbase crew unlucky enough to be caught in the explosions and pock-marking the runway with hundreds of uneven craters.<br><br>Now the SENSE airpower came, clouds of SENSE tactical fighters, consisting of wings of Xing Shianan Raptors, Bobcats, JSFs, Falcons and Hornets, along with Shingapooru Hornets and Intruders, laden heavy with fuel and bombs and missiles. They swooped low over the burning nation, dropping more bombs on the airbases, scattering cluster munitions over the parked or attempting to taxi Reichland aircraft, sending fireballs of jet fuel and exploding weapons into the night sky. A bomb dropped by Shingapooru F-18 homed onto a pilotÂ’s barracks, killing the aircrew of twelve high performance Riechland aircraft.<br><br>Power plants soon fell victim to the SENSE fighters, followed by military industries and follow-up strikes on already ravaged military bases. The Reichland sky was alight with burning wrecks and shoulder-launched SAMs fired by panicked infantrymen, the major air defense elements that would have made a different mostly been surgically removed by the Peregrines earlier.<br><br>But the Reichens were not all finished; they had two flights of about twenty F-22 fighters up on combat air patrol when the strikes started. They were heavily outnumbered but fought bravely, costing Shingapooru twelve aircraft for seven of their own before they were set upon by arriving Xing Shianan Bobcats that shot down eleven of them, chasing them off. The surviving two F-22s being destroyed when they attempted to land on the damaged airstrips.<br><br>Operation Dreamland to pre-empt the threat of Reichland airpower had been a costly mission, causing SENSE twenty two aircraft, with two of them being priceless Bobcats. But the damage had been done. All of ReichlandÂ’s airbases had been put out of action for some time, their runways seriously damaged and rendered unusable to their aircraft. The attack had destroyed over seventy percent of the Reichland airforce, most of them parked and unable to take off, in addition to decimating their already small land forces. Power to the small nation was largely cut off, in addition to several crucial bridges that would make movement amidst the country when it came to military or civilian, problematic. The communications throughout the country had been severely damaged, lowering response times. Worse, their radar umbrella of several high performance radars had been destroyed, forcing them to rely on their less capable mobile systems. If Reichland wanted to help Prussia, it would take them several months before they could launch any aircraft, and more before they could build up their ravaged air forces.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Killing Fields</strong><br><br>Promandy, The Leight Plains, Prussia<br><br>The Prussians had regrouped to a formation more suitable to armored warfare and pounded back on the 110th ACR and Lancer AGS Easy and Able companies which were forced to give ground after fierce fighting that had cost them moderate casualties amidst their infantry and two tanks plus five armored gun systems. In return, the Xing Shianan armored cavalry had inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, knocking out over two hundred tanks plus inflicting moderate casualties on their infantry. But the Prussians simply outnumbered them too heavily and they were forced to give ground before they got swarmed.<br><br>But along came more SENSE airpower called in by the armored cav. which chewed up the Prussian advance badly. Caught out in the plains, they could do little but scuttle around, searching for the little cover there could be, the dismounted Prussian troops took heavy casualties from cluster bombs and batteries of 440mhz and Eziiumi-shi artillery started laying down a contunious, pre-ranged barrage mixed in with Xing Shiana batteries firing smart SFW rounds that sought out armored targets and blew them apart as they ran. Within twenty minutes, one entire brigade worth of advancing Prussians had been badly brutalized.<br><br>At that juncture, the Xing Shianan armored cav. stopped their withdrawal and advanced, this time supported by Apache helicopters and more support aircraft in the form of 440mhz A-10s. Advancing with missiles streaking out from helicopters and Warthogs, the 110th ACR and Lancer AGS rolled forward at full speed, engaging and taking out whatever Prussian units that came into range, the IFVs firing their 30mm chainguns, spraying the dismounted Prussian troopers with shrapnel from their air bursting shells while the tanks advanced forward, using their main guns and machine guns as they went, shooting up any enemy that presented themselves.<br><br>Prussian casualties started to mount quickly as they attempted to reorganize and return fire while the XSAF armored cav. pushed onto their formations, punching a hole in them and leaving a trail of knocked out units and dead Prussians in their wake. Most of the Prussian armor was knocked out, leaving the AT infantry as the only means of anti tank capability, and the Prussians found that their weapons were largely ineffective against the Xing Shianan tanks unless they managed to get a shot in behind where the armor was weaker. Save for that, they soon found that their weapons either bounced off the FCS armor as if fired from peashooters or exploded to no effect. However, several FCS were disabled as they rushed through the Prussian formations, as the AT infantry concealed inside knocked out APCs managed to pop out and get a shot into the thinly armored rear engine compartments as they drove past. Most of them were cut down by 30mm and machine gun fire from the IFVs and tanks before they could get off a second shot.<br><br>Seeing there was no way they could win this engagement, nor seize the initiative in his area of operations, the Prussian general ordered a general retreat. The Xing Shiana amour chased them for a long time, keeping out of range and harassing them as they fled back to where they had come from, before being satisfied with the days results and leaving the fleeing Prussians to the artillery and air units. The Xing Shiana armor finally stopped, having moved over seven kilometers into what was once Prussian territory. The 110th ARC and Lancer AGS Easy and Able companies had knocked out over three hundred and fifty enemy tanks, nearly eight hundred enemy armored troop transports, and killed thousands of enemies, either by shooting them or running them over. They were now low on fuel and ammo and waited at their positions for the rest of SENSE to catch up.<br><br>But there was little time to rest, the enemy was caught off balance and SENSE generals wanted to push it. Leight and Konl were the last towns of the Promandy area and now the 110th ACR and Lancer AGS companies were the first sense units to push beyond Promandy. They soon found themselves joined up with hundreds of SENSE armored units and mechanized infantry, along with artillery units being moved up to support them. After so much glacier-like movement for SENSE in invading Prussia, things were going to move a lot faster now. Prussia was now firmly on the strategic defense.<br></div>

The SENSE coation will hit "several hundred" targets in its ongoing air campaign on FrederickBurg, the chairman of the SENSE Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a life press conference just five minutes ago as huge explosions in FrederickBurg filled the skies with smoke and fire.<br><br>The explosions reverberated throughout the city and planes and cruise missiles could be heard streaking through the air.<br><br>Anti-aircraft fire lit up the skies in all three cities as Prussian forces tried to ward off the attacks.<br><br>SENSE officials said one of the weapons to be used was a new, 2000-pound bomb designed to limit collateral damage for optimal use in an urban environment.<br><br>Video shots of gun camera footages of targets getting destroyed, were shown at the press conference, among the targets hit were the Prussian Presidential Palace, which as been partially leveled and set ablaze, it is unclear if Prussian Dictator Reynard had been occupying the building at the time. Other targets hit also included several targets of military importance.<br><br>Â“The strike is aimed at military targets,Â” Matteus Tyrannous Tan Xing Shianan representative to the SENSE war council said during the conference. Â“With due consideration given to avoiding excessive collateral damage. This is an operation aimed at toppling the current regime from power, and not an attack on the Prussian people.Â”<br><br>However, it has been reported that Dictator Reynard has ordered his elite core of Prussian Jager guards, estimated to be 160,000 in strength, to occupy civilian buildings and use them, and their civilian occupants as human shields.<br><br>Â“This shows how desperate the current regime is.Â” Tyrannous Tan said. Â“They are on their last leg and are willing to try anything to keep their hold on to power.Â”<br><br>The SENSE military operation in Prussia has been named Operation Prussian Liberation, an operation whose main objectives are liberating the Prussian people from their oppressive regime, disarming, toppling and bringing the current regime top justice and finally to help reconstruct post-war Prussia into a pacifist regime that is has sensible and peaceful ambitions.<br><br>Tyrannous Tan also said that coalition ground forces already have traveled 100 miles inside Prussia from the Promandy area and coalition warplanes have flown more than 9,000 sorties against Prussian targets.<br><br>Eziiumi-shi defense sectary Yao Ni Ming said there are clear signs that the regime of Prussian Dictator Reynard is "starting to lose control of their country" and their confusion is growing.<br><br>"They're beginning to realize, I suspect, that the regime is history," he said.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>440mhz's forces pour into Prussia and moves on to Promandy.</strong><br><br>Holiday<br><br>The Prussian invasion was certainly no joke for any greenhorn or new-timer. It was certainly an operation to be reckoned at. With the massive inflow or armour, troops and constant air strikes, PrussiaÂ’s future was bleak. It has to surrender now, but its psychotic leader refuses to do so.<br><br>The mHzen War Council has brought in M1A2 Abrams and from the West Coast of 440mhz through Mingug. Forces are mainly consisting of Crack Trooper Land Warriors (CTLW); armour consists of the M1A2 Abrams and MLRS, M26. 220mhz wasnÂ’t directly involved in the war due to its rather newly established armed forces and government but it has aided 440mhz in terms of fuel, ammunition and medical supplies.<br><br>Pouring in through the Prussian coast that was taken over by the Xing Shiana Navy, the MLF flowed in like water. Air support came in constantly, ensuring that no oncoming Prussian force would launch a surprise attack on them that is in terms of the A-10 Warthogs and Apache Longbow helicopters. The 121st Abrams division was already moving onward to Promandy to join the rest of XSAFÂ’s armour and troops. Alongside with the 121st was the 3rd CTLW battalion.<br><br>As more SENSE backup came in mainly in the form of 440mhzÂ’s massive inflow of reinforcements, the Prussian defense was placed in a dilemma. Technology of both the MLF and XSAF outdated the Prussian conventional way of fighting, with no way of bringing in newer technology for its army due to its weak economy.<br><br>Sergeant Joe was sitting in the commanderÂ’s hatch of his Abrams, moving up the dune of the coast, which he just landed on. Wong was moving alongside an Abrams, joined with other CTLW of the 3rd CTLW battalion. Major fighting was about to take place as soon as they reach where XSAF is.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SENSE forces move on to take out Prussian defense line</strong><br><br>Payback<br><br>Joe was sitting comfortably in his hatch, enjoying the night breeze that was blowing directly into his face. Everything went smooth, little resistance from the coastline until where he was, with small pockets of Prussian soldiers putting up some resistance along the way with futility.<br><br>0121 hours<br><br>It was only another 3 more kilometers before they reach where the XSAFÂ’s forces are stationed. Wong was sitting in the ICV, catching up on some sleep. The ride from the coast was smooth and the CTLW didnÂ’t have to do much along the way, leaving all the jobs to 7.62mm GMPG of the Abrams to eliminate any resistance along the way.<br><br>0204 hours<br><br>The Abrams pulled up alongside a XSAF AGS. Finally the MLF have joined up with the XSAF. ICVs unload troopers and they quickly formed up, gearing up for the night battle. MLF was intending to use the night as cover for both the Xing Shiana and the mHzen forces, utilizing their Land Warrior technology against the conventional Prussian soldier. This time round the SENSE forces have the upper hand in combat.<br><br>Things were pretty much differently organized in the MLF, instead of sending in divisions, the War Department has decided to split soldiers into squads of 8, enabling them to work with one another more efficiently. The night would provide excellent cover for the SENSE troops, using thermal visions; the SENSE forces would be able to pick up any heat changes in the environment that indicates the presence of an enemy. On their OICWS, individual troopers would be able to know where exactly their comrades are even without visually seeing them.<br><br>Things were heating up; squads organized themselves and reported to the battalion commander. For every 4 squads, an individual Abrams would be attached to them, to provide backup and support for the squads in case of enemy tank fire.<br><br>0254 hours<br><br>Squads were beginning to move out. Wong was placed with a squad of veterans who was involved in the defense of Phase Line Alpha. The night was pretty silent; the engine of the Abrams was seemingly loud. The squads were positioned 150 meters away from each other with the Abrams as the center. For 2km of travel, there was no resistance at all, but the mHzen troops didnÂ’t want to get complacent, for every 10 meters they would check through their thermal vision to pick up and enemy forces.<br><br>WongÂ’s squad reached a small village that was abandoned. The houses looked terribly morbid in the middle of the night. The Abrams moved slowly into the village, proceeding cautiously.<br><br>Wong adjusted the knobs on his MSG-90, which was now fitted with the OIC system. Looking through his thermal scope, he didnÂ’t expect to pick up any heat changes, but things took a change this time round. Scanning the surroundings, Wong picked up a heat change from a house window that was diagonally to his right, shaping out an obvious human that seemed to be holding an object that looked like an anti-tank weapon, Wong burst into full alert, speaking into his headset, Wong radioed the tank commander.<br><br>Â“Alpha 2, Alpha 2, this is Hawk, do not proceed any further, AT position 20 meters up ahead, I repeat, do not proceed any further,Â”<br><br>The tank moaned to a stop, leaving the engine sound rumbling. Wong looked through his scope again, picking out the shape through his thermal vision; the figure didnÂ’t move an inch.<br><br>Â“Alpha 2, IÂ’m gonna check that out, hold your position and keep your eyes wide open!Â”<br><br>Wong radioed the rest of the squads.<br><br>Â“Chendol, Ice Kachang, Kopi Ping, AT position located 175meters bearing 30 degrees, 30 meters bearing 345 degrees, 200 meters bearing 290 degrees from your position individually. Dao Suan going in to take out AT position, hold your positions until all-clear.Â”<br><br>Wong signaled his squad to provide cover for him while he moves up to a wall to take the AT position out. Crawling on the ground, Wong found his position 30 meters up ahead. Putting his rifle round the wall, Wong noticed that the figured had move to the second floor of the house.<br><br>Â“Alpha 2, this is Hawk, proceeding to take AT position out.Â”<br><br>Wong crawled to the end of the wall and stuck a quarter of his torso out, not wanting to reveal his whole body. The street was totally dark, giving him the perfect environment to cover him. Wong peered through his scope; position his crosshair on the head of the figure. Wong felt weird, he had never tried aiming at someone who was totally featureless with the exception of the thermal shape that appeared on his head eyepiece. Counting on his experience, Wong decided to take the shot.<br><br>Â“puikÂ…Â”<br><br>A suppressor reduced the bullet to lower than mach speed. Looking through his scope, the thermal figure disappeared, leaving the environment view in WongÂ’s scope pretty much the same as before.<br><br>Â“Alpha 2, coast is clear, I repeat, AT taken down.Â”<br><br>Â“Hawk, this is Chendol, enemy movement spotted 300 meters from where you are. Fall back, I repeat, fall back.Â”<br><br>Â“Hawk, this is Kopi Ping, enemy movement spotted 325 meters from where you are, fall back.Â”<br><br>Wong switched his OIC to a scale map that gave him geographical view of the surroundings, with the eint network provided the vital information. Pockets of read dots could be seen about 250 meters from where he was, progressing on steadily. They were outnumbered, with about 100 Prussians against them, but they didnÂ’t have to fear anything. No tank movement was observed.<br><br>Â“I better move back to where the rest areÂ… Â“ Wong thought.<br>Crouching and moving quickly, Wong got back to his squad in a matter of seconds.<br><br>Â“Chendol, Ice Kachang, Kopi Ping, this is Hawk, get your squad snipers to set up positions and engaged first.Â”<br><br>By then, the Prussian was already 250 meters from where they were. The snipers got to their positions in a matter of seconds and each radioed back.<br><br>Â“Snipers, this is hawk, OTOT (own time own target)!Â”<br><br>Looking at the map again, the red dots began to disappear one by one, by the time the Prussians reached visual distance from the Abrams, they were left with only 30 men. The CTLW took them out quickly without suffering any casualties; the Prussians didnÂ’t even know what hit them. Bad visual was the main factor that leads to the annihilation of this Prussian squadron. The CTLW was seeing things through their thermal vision, picking out every single Prussian that was coming on them. Flash and muzzle suppressors concealed the CTLW nicely in the night.<br><br>Â“Hawk, this is Sniper Gamma, thermal visual negative.Â”<br><br>Â“Hawk this is Sniper Beta, thermal visual negative.Â”<br><br>Wong looked at the map again, indeed, all the red dots were gone.<br><br>Â“Gentlemen, all-clear, proceed with caution.Â”<br><br>The Abrams rolled on into the night, moving on to the Prussian defense line.<br></div>

The Prussians helped them as well, who were drawing their troops back in a hasty, disorganized retreat from southern Prussia to add in the final defense of FredickBerg. Southern cities started to be liberated by the hour. Earlberg, Hamin, Kobarton, Aftun and Mesir were liberated by the end of the second day of the advance. The Prussian army was running.<br><br>Hot on their heels were the SENSE armored units, especially the XSAF 7th Armored Division, which used the advanced mobility of their units to overtake the fleeing enemy, taking pause only to let their engineers blast holes through whatever minefields they encountered with rocket trailed explosive hoses. Many of the Prussians unable to move out in the hasty retreat were left behind to provide token resistance in their cities or towns, firing up all their ammunition before they surrendered.<br><br><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/oasis/niagara/37/17.jpg"><br><span class="small">Blown off turret of destroyed Prussian ATW-1. Though dangerous with a 200mm gun, the ATW-1 was badly outclassed by the FCS MBT.[/b]</span><br><br>Hoping to avoid such nonsense after they observed such behavior, SENSE units counterattacked with an array of propaganda leaflets and loudspeaker hails calling for surrender and warning that such behavior would entail receiving overwhelming and likely fatal firepower in a fight which result was already clear from the beginning. When that received no response, SENSE artillery started dropping tear and vomit gas onto their positions, before a second hail to surrender was given. Many usually gave up at this point, scrambling out of their positions covered with vomit and tears. Those who stuck to their positions were overrun and killed. In one instance, a mix of over 10,000 Prussian regulars and homeguard waiting in an anti tank trench to fire antitank weapons and stick improvised antitank charges onto the weaker sides of an advancing ACR of XSAF tanks as they drove over found to their horror that the Xing Shianans had no intention of letting that happen and buried them alive in their trenches with FCS MBTs fitted with dozer blades.<br><br>Thus the advance continued.<br><br>Daniel was one of the many tankers involved in this operation, the high speed ride across Prussian territory mainly unopposed with armed helicopters buzzing above him and armored vehicles of all kinds from FCS tanks, AGS to humvees moving alongside in some crazy race of heavy metal that tore down the cold Prussian countryside leaving chewed dirt in their wake. The supply units barely had time to catch up. The Xing Shiana tanks had an engine speed regulator that limited them from breaking speed limits during peacetime driving that limited their speed to 70kph. It was almost always the first thing the crews removed when they had a chance to, peacetime or not.<br><br>DanielÂ’s tank was doing 110 kilometers an hour.<br><br>Â“Yee haaÂ…Â” His partner said as their tank rolled over a two-foot thick log as if it wasnÂ’t there, the splintered log was cast aside from the spinning tracks only to be chewed up by several more rapidly advancing armored vehicles. The high speed transit, despite all the advanced technology to improve reliability and reduce field maintenance in the FCS systems, had to be clocking overtime in system wear and tear.<br><br>But it was such technology that got them this far in the first place, the XSAF amour had been assigned to catch the fleeing Prussians. They had already left the 440mhz Arc Royal armor about fifty kilometers behind, which were moving in slower and picking out stationary pockets of resistance.<br><br>Â“Tallyho, whoaÂ… there they areÂ…Â” Daniel called, leading the XSAF armored units as they crested a hill, brining their prey into view. Despite having seen them from a long distance away on his situational display, Daniel wasnÂ’t quite prepared for what he would see. Right before him snaking their way slowly down a narrow road in valley cutting through the country hillscape was a long column of hundreds of Prussian military vehicles, a retreating convoy caught in the open.<br><br>Â“Engage!Â” Daniel said as he exploded the lead tank of the column with a sabot round, halting the columnÂ’s advance behind the 60-ton roadblock as metal grinded on metal in a chain reaction of bumper-to-bumper collisions that resulted in a colossal logjam. The last vehicle, another tank, was also taken out by an anti-tank missile from a friendly IFV, sealing all chance of escape and creating a nice kill zone.<br><br><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/oasis/niagara/37/11.jpg"><br><span class="small"><strong>Destroyed Aquanix tank, taken out by an AGS 120mm HEAT</strong></span><br><br>The Xing Shianan amour engaged everything in the trapped column, raking it with machine gun fire, tank shells and anti-tank missiles. Attack choppers swooped in, spraying the motorcade with cannon and rocket fire. The Prussians stood no chance, there was little return fire, and not that it did any good. It wasnÂ’t long before they were waving whatever pieces of white material they could find.<br><br><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/oasis/niagara/37/oilfir13.jpg"><br><span class="small"><strong>The retreating Prussian army used whatever transport they could find, including civillian cars filled with loot they took from the cities as they fled. </strong></span><br><br>DanielÂ’s ACR plus air support elements had knocked out over 150 tanks, 200 armored personnel carriers and 980 plus other assorted Prussian vehicles, in a turkey shoot that lasted twenty minutes. They spent the rest of the day taking prisoners and doing a body count while waiting for supply elements to catch up for resupply. They tallied 560 prisoners and 1,200 plus dead, many of them killed in their vehicles, death coming onto them even before they could respond.<br><br>Day three of the advance, the deepest SENSE elements, the 7th Advanced Armored Division (AAD) had moved over 350 kilometers into Prussia, just 170 short of FredrickBerg.<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SENSE General Noncombatant Caution</strong><br><br>(As displayed in airdropped leaflets and broadcast over the airwaves)<br><br>Noncombatants are not the target of SENSE campaign to liberate Prussia, great care has gone into targeting and very much done to avoid unnecessary loss of civilian life. If you are a Prussian noncombatant, do everything in within your ability to leave the areas of battle and head for the closest SENSE Humanitarian Areas. Should circumstances arise that you are unable to leave the battlefield, stay indoors at all times and avoid contact with combating forces. At the closest opportunity, attempt to make contact with SENSE force once the fighting has died down if you desire evacuation to the Humanitarian Areas.<br><br>Do not, under all circumstances actively cooperate with Prussian troops or allow them to use your residence for military purposes. Doing so voids your protection from harm under SENSE, and your safety cannot be guaranteed. Put as much distance from Prussian troops as possible. It may also be useful to note that SENSE will not tolerate anybody taking cynical advantage of their troopÂ’s objectives to protect civilians to compromise their tactical situation or safety. Such activities can include the deliberate functioning as human shields to limit SENSE troops while exposing them to maximum risk from Prussian military hiding behind these willing shields. Individuals who take advantage of this shall and will be treated as valid combatants. Once again, this is not your fight.<br><br>Hang on and be brave, for the hour of liberation is near, soon the oppressed peoples of Prussia will once again live under a regime who does not steal their lives and futures for their own selfish ambitions, once again, the people of Prussia will breathe the free air.<br><br>Let COMMON SENSE prevail.<br><br>Dar Lar Par<br><br>Second Sectary of Information for SENSE Forces In Prussia<br></div>

Eiizumi-Shi Spy-Assassins most probably kill these men as in the way these men were killed IÂ’ve seen. Though our ninja troops did try to chase some of ES Spy-Assasins discovered, we didnÂ’t manage to catch one. IÂ’m sorry to say our martial arts skills were not as good as them.Â” explained the Shogun.<br><br>Â“There are also major sabotaging bombs that killed some of these men. In Prussian military trucks and other vehicles, even in camps. Some soldiers were poisoned to death by poison in their water. These has cost dearly on Prussian forcesÂ’ morale as well as ZKAÂ’s morale.Â” Continued the Shogun.<br><br>Â“Under the command of the Great Leader of Zenbu Koogeki, Yamashita, he declared that for the safety of ZKA troops in Prussia.  We are already withdrawing our troops from Prussia. Our troops will be totally withdrawn from Prussia in about an hour. IÂ’m sorryÂ…Â” The Shogun finishes his speech to the Prussia reporters as his bodyguards pushes away the surrounding reporters and leaves for chopper on a helipad and is leaving back to Zenbu Koogeki.<br></div>
