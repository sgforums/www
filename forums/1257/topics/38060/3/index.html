Wilhelm shouted.<br><br>One Hour later after relentless XSAF barrages.<br><br>Wilhelm rested under a palm tree.Things do not look good,only 75% of the invasion force made it.Albaster subs had sunk several transports and Arsenal barrages made it all the more hard.<br><br>A company runner came to Wilhelm<br><br>"Leutnant,your orders are to move with the army to take the oil industries of Mingug now!"<br><br>Soon enough,The Prussian army disappered into the forest of 440MHZ.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Situation grows desperate for mHzen War Department</strong><br><br>Frantic<br><br>MHzen War Department<br><br>Colonel Motive barged into General WavelengthÂ’s office. Giving Wavelength a shock and resulting in him spilling the black coffee he was drinking onto his well-pressed and stiff uniform.<br><br>Â“C-O-L-O-N-E-L Motive! You know very well you should knock the door before you enter! There goes my black coffee and there goes my uniform! IÂ’ll have you court-martialed for this inso Â…Â”<br><br>Â“Sir! ThereÂ’s no time to court-martial me! The Prussians have slipped past the XSN and have attacked the city of Mingug! We have to divert our forces there immediately!!Â”<br><br>Â“This is not another one of your scare-the-general jokes right?Â”<br><br>Â“Sir! IÂ’m serious!Â” Motive stared at Wavelength with his eyes open wide.<br><br>Â“Okay, okay, donÂ’t give me that kind of look, ruins my facial features. Divert the oncoming M1A2 Abrams convoy to the city of Mingug. DonÂ’t worry about Phase Line Alpha; I trust my Leopard II and my T-95s. Get the 15th, 27th and 53rd crack troopers into Mingug ASAP. Utilize all our CH-47 Chinooks, donÂ’t worry too much about the Chinooks; push them to their limits. Airlift the 34th, 78th and 111th howitzer divisions over the Mingug immediately. Issue the Order Of The Day. Send in ICVs for urban battle, weÂ’ve got to defend the city at ALL cost. What the heck are the Prussians up to anyway? IÂ’ll put you in charge of this, anything that requires authorization, youÂ’re the man. Dismissed!Â”<br><br>Â“Yes sir!Â”<br><br>Colonel Motive rushed out of the room to make the necessary preparations. The Prussians are flanking the west border and 440mhzÂ’s future looked pretty much bleak. That day was a day of rush and confusion for the mHzens. Shunich Air Base that was located 2km east from Mingug was full of activity. C-130s landed and took off, leaving behind tanks and equipment for the air base personnel to sort out. That very day, a total of 476 M1A2 Abrams, 150,000 soldiers, 243 artillery pieces and 112 ICVs were airlifted into Shunich that day. The War Department is sending in at least 100,000 soldiers the next day with 150 or more Abrams and 100 more artillery pieces to fortify the city of Mingug.<br><br>The MN is diverting its cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers and submarines immediately from the Sea of Fuchs to intercept the Prussian inflow of troops and ships.<br><br>Phase Line Alpha<br><br>Â“Captain Wong Tze Ong! Are you here?Â” bellowed the voice in the middle of the camp.<br><br>Wong heard his name being called and walked out of his tent.<br><br>Â“Yes! IÂ’m here!Â”<br><br>Â“Captain, order has been given for you to be sent over the defend the city of Mingug. You will leave immediately to join the 15th crack troopers division.Â” Said the pilot of the Chinook.<br><br>Wong looked at the piece of military paper, with an Â“Order Of The DayÂ” title printed on the top of the paper, centered nicely on it. The contents were orders from Colonel Motive himself with reasons given for the order. Wong stared blankly at the piece of paper after reading its contents. The Prussians are pressing in really hard. Even now as the read the city of Mingug lay in danger of being overrun. If this really happens the fate of 440mhz would be bleak.<br><br>Â“Captain, you have half and hour to complete all the necessary administration before the Chinook leaves. Please be notified that I would not wait for you if youÂ’re late and if you donÂ’t report to Mingug, you could be court-martialed for cowardly retreat.Â”<br><br>Wong frowned; the attitude of the pilot was pissing him off. He wanted to take out his USP and shoot him in the head. In all sanity, Wong didnÂ’t do that. He walked back to his tent and grabbed his bag from below his bed. Throwing in all his equipment in a mere 5 minutes, Wong proceeded to the DCÂ’s tent to report out of Phase Line Alpha. Signing the registry, Wong walked back to the Chinook and boarded. Along with him were other soldiers that were called out of the Line to partake in the defense of Mingug.<br><br>Wong canÂ’t believe that to War Department is drawing out so much manpower out of the line. This meant the weakening of the LineÂ’s defenses. Wong looked out of the window behind him. The people on the ground became smaller and smaller until they were only minute objects moving on the ground. The Chinook moved steadily away from the base.<br><br>1453 hours.<br><br>Wong finally got off the Chinook after 3 hours of ride. His legs were aching from the long sitting. Wong looked around, the movement of vehicles and soldiers was large-scale. It was indeed a sight to behold.<br><br>Â“Okay gentlemen, please report to that green colour tent on the left of you immediately. Come on, move it, donÂ’t take your time!Â” blurted one lieutenant.<br><br>The soldiers shuffled their feet over to the registry tent and check-in. When it came to Wong, the sergeant at the counter looked at him.<br><br>Â“Captain Wong? YouÂ’re required to hop on the next truck to the beach of Mingug. They need your services in the bunkers.Â”<br><br>Â“Ah Â… okay.Â” Wong replied. Â“ThatÂ’s fast, things must be heating up over there.Â” He thought.<br><br>The truck ride was bumpy for Wong. He never liked these types of rides; the ICV was more appealing to Wong. As they drew closer and closer to the beach, the sound of artillery was becoming more and more distinct. The battle was raging on. The truck dropped them near the bunker where battle was hot, Wong was rushed immediately to the bunker and the PC was introduced to him.<br>Â“You Wong? Good, good, we needed people like you. Shoot good! Bad Prussians coming on me beach, me not happy. You take care them, okay you?Â”<br><br>Â“Eh Â… yes sir.Â” Wong replied.<br><br>Though the PC spoke in terrible English, Wong managed to decipher the hierogram words that were coming out of his mouth.<br><br>Â“Extreme helicopter guy, havenÂ’t seen one like him in a while.Â” Wong thought.<br><br>Wong proceeded to the bunker where the fighting was fierce. MG was pounding on the incoming Prussians and Phalanx were firing on the LCVPs that were dropping troops off the beach. Wong began to set up his position and got everything ready in record-time, the fastest he had ever went. Wong looked through his scope and began picking off Prussians Â…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Battle of the Fuchs Sea</strong><br><br>Despite the SENSE naval disaster at the Prussian Straits, cutting off supply lines for the SENSE troops in Prussia, things went much better for them at the Sea of Fuchs, with the massive Prussian 1st  Heavy Fleet engaging the Xing Shiana Navy (XSN) Task Force Tyrant King guarding the convoy lines for the Sea of Fuchs.<br><br>It was the first time in regional history that a 21st century information-warfare naval fleet engaged a conventional surface fleet, with numerous aegis cruisers, destroyers, frigates and heavy cruisers and several Virginia class SSNs on the Prussian side versus the XSN task force half its size, consisting mainly of advanced Alberto-class stealth frigates, Tom Holtz destroyers, two Trex Osborn-class carriers and three Imperator arsenal ships, with a screen of five Alabaster class SSNs as submarine support.<br><br>The battle showed quite clearly the superiority of the form of 21st century warfare over conventional forces. Due to the vastly increased intelligence and situational awareness awarded by the eint network, every move the Prussian fleet made could be analysed and countered long before they even showed up on radar, and even longer before the Prussians knew what was before them. The fiendishly low radar, infrared and sonar signatures of the angular XNS ships also greatly diminished the little forward warning the Prussians had. The Prussians knew the task force was somewhere out there, but were groping around in the dark trying to locate their elusive prey, which the XNS already had itÂ’s eye on the jugular of their tiger opponent.<br><br>The first indication of enemy presence the Prussian 1st Heavy Fleet had was when ADCAP-D Torpedoes from the XNS Alabasters came upon the Prussian Virginia SSNs, who despite there own advance-ness were badly outclassed by the XNS advanced submarines, their stealth and sonar outfits outclassed, their own ADCAP torpedoes outranged over two times by the Xing Shianan weapons, launched from the ultra-stealthy Alabasters from long range. The Prussian return snapshots all fell short, the Xing Shianan torpedos found their mark, sending four Virginias to the bottom with all hands and damaging two. Effectively eliminating the Prussian submarine force in the area in just twenty-five minutes. And all this was the work of any one Xing Shianan sub, the XSS Alabaster, registry number NCC-1701. Slipping through the gap created by the sudden removal of the Prussian submarines, another Alabaster SSN, the XSS Bethlehem, scored a bonus for the XSN by taking out an Aegis cruiser with an extremely long range shot with a ADCAP-D.<br><br>XSN carrier airpower followed, blasting out of the sky with heavy jamming support from EW JSFs. The stealthy X-35s JSF and XF-35 Bobcats, utilizing the electronic chaos created by their EW supports to the maximum, dodging the confused aegis SM-2s fired blind from the remaining aegis cruisers and splitting the sky above the Prussian fleet with into a pyrotechnic display of advanced anti-ship munitions and stealthy smart bombs, of which sheer number overwhelmed the automated, but one-generation-behind defences. Desperate Prussian anti aircraft fire filled the sky with a spectacular display of tracers and exploding radar fused rounds, dashing two JSFs and a Bobcat to the sea, but the damage they had taken was far worse then they had given, one heavy cruiser lay wreathed in smoke and fire from aft to stern, while several smaller ships had been either destroyed outright by the attack or were badly damaged. Another aegis cruiser had been damaged, while another had expended its magazines futilely in a mad rush to stop the XSN airpower. That left the Prussian Aegis cruiser capacity at three and a half ships, down from their original five.<br><br>And then things got worse, barely had the air attack departed when the advanced cruise missiles launched from the XSN arsenal ships arrive en masse. Naval warfare had never seen anything quite like it before; the cruise missiles consisted of two types, and were a defence nightmare, one type was stealthy, small, fast, nimble and flying unpredictable paths before homing in onto their terminal patterns, firing their final stage rocket motors to accelerate them to incredible velocities, punching through the hulls the Prussian ships with sheer velocity and a tungsten shaped nosecone before exploding their small warheads within.<br><br>The other type was larger, slower and more reminiscent of conventional cruise missiles, some flying in to dump smart sub munitions where were essentially mini smart bomblets to detonate on the fragile radar masts and other vulnerable exposed systems. Others carried full warheads which they crashed kamikaze-style into their targets. Worse, others were simply drones that carried extensive jamming equipment, dumped chaff and flares, and employed used radar reflectors that were so strong that they blinded what Prussians radars that were trying desperately to make some sense of the confusing picture from the overwhelming assaults. The air defences of the fleet fired and fired away until they either ran out of ammunition or overheated and destroyed their barrels from the constant firing. They stopped some, but not anywhere near enough to take serious damage. Over five thousand warheads rained down on the Prussian fleet in a short space of ten minutes.<br><br>Left with just twenty five percent of his ships functional, with all damaged to some extent, the Prussian admiral, in his disabled and rapidly sinking heavy cruiser, ordered every antiship missile fired off in the general direction of the Xing Shiana fleet off whatever platforms that were still working in the decimated fleet. Eighty missiles lifted off from the Prussian fleet in the general direction of the XSN task force. The seeking missiles found nothing on their onboard sensors, ran out of fuel, and fell into the sea, far short of their targets.<br><br>Undeterred, the last thing the Prussian admiral did before going down with his flagship was to order the surviving ships onward at flank speed in the direction of the XNS task force (based on outdated intelligence, their actual foe being more then 50 nautical miles away from their supposed location.). And to engage the XNS fleet the old fashioned way with their guns if need be.<br><br>It never came to pass, now with their Aegis cover destroyed and their sensors more or less disabled, the survivors of the Prussian fleet steamed at full throttle on their erroneous bearing to do their final battle. They didnÂ’t get far, sailing into a death trap of torpedoes and missiles. In just two hours, the Prussian 1st Heavy Fleet, seventy-eight ships crewed by 15,120 Prussian sailors, ceased to exist. The 8,200-odd Prussians who survived the annihilation of their fleet clung on through the night in the warm tropical waters to their life rafts and life preservers while the sharks picked away at their number. By daybreak, when the decimated SENSE fleet steaming in full from the defeated at the Prussian Gulf to regroup in the Sea of Fuchs, passed the area, there were only about 3,100 survivors left to pick up. Seventy-six ships destroyed and over twelve thousand lives lost in the brief naval battle that left only two damaged submarines (one of which would be written off in dry dock due to unsalvageable structural damage) to limp home to tell of the disaster, which like the Battle of Midway, would be hushed up and with the Great Leader being told of a great victory at sea instead. All the XSN lost in that battle was three planes along with their aircrews. All thirty-five XSN ships in the task force emerged unscathed, the closest enemy fire having landed being 50 nautical miles away.<br><br>But the Prussians had not given their lives away completely in vain, for the naval mismatch ultimately ended up tying down the XSN task force in battle, while a Prussian invasion force snuck on behind in a daring bid to land troops on the western back door of 440mhz. Arsenal ships and XAF airpower pounded the force, and destroyed the single Aegis cruiser defending the invasion force. But they were moving out of reach and it was too late. Despite inflicting terrible casualties on the landing Prussians, they managed to struggle on land in significant numbers. The invasion fleet was utterly destroyed shortly after, as they attempted to return to Prussia, costing 6,000 more Prussian lives. But their mission had been completed.<br><br>The sakes in the Malayan campaign had just grown higher, Prussian forces, on limited supplies and ammo had landed on 440mhzÂ’s back door. Unless SENSE finds some way of responding quickly, they would face the loss of 440mhz, their staging grounds, and along with it the whole of Malaya.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Massive Xing Shiana Strategic Bombing Campaign starts</strong><br><br>The workers at Kaiser Shipyards Industries were disgruntled, they been working brutally long hours for wages that were mere fractions of their original salaries, barely enough to make things meet. And salaries were just one of many negative ways this confounded war had on their lives, the economy of Prussia was deflated, thanks economical sabotages and attacks on their homeland, and all the Grand DukesÂ’ promises of economic reserves obviously went only to the armies, or did not exist at all. The currency was virtually worthless and wallets had to be stuffed full of notes at ridiculous denominations just to make things work at all. The Grand Duke didnÂ’t seem to care, launching only more and more costly military operations and telling the people to hang on, all this because of some forsaken country called Malaya that the Grand Duke insisted on claiming. Most of them felt that Prussia should have cut their losses long ago when the Neutron Bomb, which would have allowed them to claim Malaya bloodlessly, failed. But the Grand Duke was adamant and now Prussian blood was being poured into some land that didnÂ’t seem one bit relevant to them.<br><br>What were relevant to them were the grossly inflated currency, their gutted, once-proud economies and the pestilence and filth spreading in their once clean land. What also bothered them incessant SENSE air raids, which seemed to be employed nothing more then to scar their cities and keep them indoors. And worse, the Great Duke had insisted on shifting air defences into the cities to Â“protectÂ” civilians, but it was those military things that SENSE was after in the first place, and the populace took the brunt of the collateral damage, which while limited with high tech Xing Shiana weapons, were more then balanced out by the much less precise iron bomb Â“surgicalÂ” strikes of the Eziiumi-Shi and Shingapooru air forces, which seemed a lot less concerned about civilian casualties.<br><br>And any outcry from other countries was limited, few sympathized with Prussia, whom many perceived to be a psychotically demented expansionist nation a serious threat to any nation it turned its ambitions to. After all, who would trust a country that schemed to frame its own Â“alliesÂ” in a plot to play one side against the other in SENSE, and later even tried using weapons of mass destruction in a fail attempt to backstab their allies over their apparent Â“incompetenceÂ” to fall for the Prussian tricks? They were suffering for the ambitions of their leader, which sat comfy in some secure place stocked obscenely full with food and luxuries that the suffering civilians could not even afford with a monthÂ’s war wages.<br><br>The SENSE air strikes over Prussia had demoralized the populace, reminding them of the Grand DukeÂ’s inability to protect them and his own lack of concern them, and made them resent the military, who seemed to get all the benefit from the civilian populace. Grand Duke had claimed that they were fiercely patriotic; yes they were, to great Prussia who stood for values of the civilized human being, not some leader who was increasingly being perceived as being a arrogant war monger using these patriotic feelings to spin them on a path of destruction for his own ambitions. Little of them saw any reason for claming Malaya, much less spilling so much blood for it. The dictator was driving their great country into the mud, and they were the ones to suffer for it. And the air strikes were just one of the many afflictions the Grand Duke had called upon them and his country with his blind ambition.<br><br>And the air strikes were to get worse.<br><br>Easily dodging the defence umbrella using eint and technology to exploit gaps, the first flight of low observable B1-B Lancers from the XAF 144th Tyrannosaurs screamed overhead, temporarily jolting the workers from their resentful duties. Forced to suddenly work overtime in the shipyards to rush Prussian warships to replace those lost in the Sea of Fuchs, the workers had their fate sealed by their changed work schedules as multiple JDAM warheads came down to level the Kaiser Shipyards Industries complex during a time in which, by right and all humane labour laws, they should not be working. The last B-1B, laden different with a load of FAE bombs, releasing them into the flaming complex, the massive overpressure blasts created by these fuel aerosol bombs akin to small tactical nukes crushing any survivors with expanding rings of compressed air as solid as steel and suffocating any who escaped by depleting the oxygen in the surroundings in the firestorm and baking their lungs with the hellish air. With 1,500 Prussian shipyard workers dead in the strike, and the major military shipyards of Prussia flattened and destroyed. The committed XAF campaign of massive strategic bombing with their neigh undetectable bombers commenced.<br></div>

Your peoples lives are at stake. Your economy is breaking up, there is nothing for your people to stay in Prussia. Be realistic. They ARE humans.<br><br>As regards to the reporter, they is something known as FOREIGN TALENTS. Canny Pubsinger is a national of the Republic of Psychotic Accountants working for GR-TV, not RES or RSH citizen. And war correspondents are not afraid to die in war since they're war correspondents.<br><br>As for god sakes, war is not solely military, there are other aspects to be looked at. This is TOTAL WAR. Never heard of it? Better read your history books and knowledge on your National Education.<br><br>There are facts that:<br>1) YOUR ECONOMY IS STRUGGLING = High unemployment = Unhappy people with no money to buy food but there's no food to buy. YOUR COUNTRYÂ’S OVER-TAXATION meant there is no enough money for your people to buy goods from your industries or even food.<br><br>2) THERE ARE DAILY UNION STRIKES IN YOUR NATION<br>Stikes = Riots = Rioters rampaging properties. This indirectly cause social instabilities that can adversely affect your economy, causing investors to lose interests and confidence in your country and will leave. Moreover, you're at war.<br><br>3) YOUR AGRICULTURE IS WORST OF ALL SENSE which indirectly causing starvation among your people. Who will be happy and patriotic with empty stomachs? Who would want a leader who does not fill their stomachs?<br><br>4) YOUR WOODCHIP INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE MAIN BLOODLINE FOR PRUSSIAN ECONOMY BUT WAS RUINED. That causes your economy to be struggling.<br><br>5) If my news report was a PROPAGANDA, your speech of having two years of supplies and having lot of reserves is also PROPAGANDA for your people.<br><br>6) Since your economy is bad, your currency will also be inflated and your "lots of reserves" will be reduced to "lots of worthless reserves".<br><br>7) Fight the war by myself? Can, but I think this is one of your ploy to destroy your enemy one by one. Cannot handle the stress of so many people attacking you?

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A/C-130 Spectre Gunships Move into action, along with SENSE airpower</strong><br><br>With eint alerting them of an impending mass of enemy troops outside the strategic city of Koln, seven A/C-130s of the XAF 23th Mud Movers departed from Hangug, flying west under heavy escort by Bobcats and Raptors running CAP and wild weasel. That was not all, several squadrons of XAF Falcons and Falcons XLs were also deployed, having arrived at Hangug barely two days before. A flight of 440mhz A-10s tank busters accompanied.<br><br>The XAF Falcons and Falcons XLs went in first, hugging the ground in an attempt to evade defences, splitting up at the last moment before dropping their loads of cluster bombs and FAEs on the Prussian formations, attracting SAM fire from the few anti air launchers the Prussians had, which were promptly taken out by High Speed Anti Radiation Missiles from Wild Weasel Bobcats waiting for such a moment. The SAM cover decimated, the mHzen A-10s winged in and started picking out armoured units, crisscrossing the skies with Maverick trails and GA-U8 avenger rounds, taking out any tank that was not under cover. The body count started to rise.<br><br>The SENSE forces had not gotten away free however, as four falcons and two A-10s had been lost in the opening moments of the strike to ground fire. A shoulder fired SAM trailed a smoking A-10 as it disengaged after a pyrotechnic run with missile, cluster bomb and cannon knocking out fifteen tightly packed together tanks before burning out and falling out of the sky, leaving the damaged Warthog to limp home.<br><br>The Prussians did what they had learned to do from a long time after seeing so many of their buddies die under SENSE airpower. They took cover in any place they could, waiting for the SENSE planes to run out of ammo. It usually worked, but they had reckoned without the A/C-130 Spectre gunships.<br><br>It was such a time when the Spectres started working, when the enemy air defence was broken and the enemy in chaos. Loitering too high for infantry fired weapons to reach them, the Spectres ferreted out targets with their onboard sensors and triangulated fire on targets they could not directly see using the eint. Pouring a unrelenting, computer controlled stream of 20mm, 40mm and 105mm fire onto the Prussians for the good part of an hour. The man-made meteor storm descended upon the Prussians mercilessly, exploding vehicles and killing men, the Spectre crews seeing them come apart under the emotionless eye of their sensors.<br><br>When one Spectre ran out of ammo, which it did after a while, it would disengage, land at the Koln military airbase while the other six kept up their fire. In this way, the Prussians were Â“treatedÂ” to a flight of 6 Spectres at all times (with the occasional strike with SENSE fighter bombers raining bombs, cannon shells and napalm), raining down blistering fire. When the entire thing was done and the Spectres departed after three hours of terrorizing the Prussian forces, the forested area had been virtually denuded of vegetation. Over 650 Prussian vehicles had been destroyed and many times that number more of personnel killed. The amassed Prussian forces now scattered and demoralized. Time and time again had showed immortal how much a role air power and superiority could make or break an conflict, and SENSE air superiority was starting to pay big dividends.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Situation in Mingug grows desperate for mHzen forces.</strong><br><br>1236 hours: Retreat off the beachhead.<br><br>Wong sat in the ICV with the survivors of the beachhead. He stared at every single soldier in the ICV along with him, their faces tell the tale of defeat and failure. The mHzen troopers were pushed back by Prussian strength and determination in this battle. The ride of the ICV was smooth, at least. Wong recalled back the moment where the retreat call was given, though he wanted to fight on, he knew that it was impossible to, for he would be captured and taken POW or killed by the Prussians. Wong wanted to live to fight another day, he didnÂ’t want to give up at that moment, and there was still hope to come.<br><br>The ICV pulled up in Mingug.<br><br>Â“Alright troopers! Get into your defensive positions now! ThereÂ’s no time to waste, those bloody Prussians may pour in any moment!Â” shouted the PC.<br><br>Wong climbed the cityÂ’s clock tower that was overlooking the road coming in from the beachhead. But there was something bigger awaiting the MLF than the force coming in from the beachhead. Oblivious to all, the MLF didnÂ’t expect the Prussians to come in by Mingug Mountains. The War Department predicted that the terrain of the mountains would be too treacherous for the Prussian to move through and movement of tanks and equipment would be almost totally impossible.<br><br>But the Prussians did what was called the impossible, they move through the Tomgug Forest onto the Mingug Mountains with full force. Aquanix tanks, equipment and soldiers alike. Never would the MLF stationed in Mingug think that the Prussians would attack from two sides, instead they reinforced the road coming in from the beachhead, with artillery pointing in the direction of the road.<br><br>Wong scanned the horizon of the road with his scope, heat could be seen rising, which meant that the tanks were very near. He looked down from his clock tower onto the road and caught sight of several M1A2 Abrams moving in the direction of the road. WongÂ’s heart squeezed, he was praying hard that the Abrams would be able to hold off the beachhead attack.<br><br>Wong look through his scope again, he caught sight of the tip of the tankÂ’s barrel. TheyÂ’re coming!<br><br>Â“They are here! I see them!Â” Wong shouted from the clock tower to the PC.<br><br>Â“Observed fire! Own time own target! Fire at will!Â” shouted the PC.<br><br>Barrages of artillery began their pounding on the road. Wong looked through his scope again; the barrage was working against the Prussians. Many of the Prussian soldiers began running for cover, but as much as the mHzen artillery pounded, the Prussians continued to push on harder and harder. M1A2 Abrams began their first contact with the first Aquanix tank they saw rolling in. The 120mm HEAT shell pierced through the thin armour of the Aquanix tank and left in burning in flames, leaving no survivors in that shot. Suddenly through the smoke, a rocket homed in on the left tracks of the Abrams.<br><br>Â“Boom!Â”<br><br>The Abrams was left immobile with its left track gone. The panzerfaust squad has struck again. The Abrams behind the immobile one moved back a distance, in fear of being struck by the panzerfaust. Through the smoke and fire from the destroyed Aquanix, another Aquanix emerged from it and fire a round on the immobile Abrams, but the Aquanix round bounced off the armour of the Abrams, leaving only a scratch on it. Indeed the firepower of the Aquanix was no match for the DU armour of the Abrams. The Abrams fired a round on the Aquanix, putting it out of service. Stunned crewmen immediately open the hatch and crawled out, only to be taken out by the GPMG on the Abrams.<br><br>Wong was viewing this scene through his scope. Suddenly, smoke rising from his east caught his attention. Wong noticed a trooper running in from the direction and communicating with the PC. From his face, Wong knew that the news he carried wasnÂ’t pleasant, neither was the reaction on the PCÂ’s face. The PC took up the receiver and made a call.<br><br>In a matter of seconds, Wong could see M1A2 Abrams moving east from where he was. Wong knew it wasnÂ’t any good. He picked up his radio set and radioed the PC.<br><br>Â“Hey! WhatÂ’s going on down there?Â”<br><br>Â“The Prussians are attacking from the east of the town, we donÂ’t know how did they flank us from the beachhead. They canÂ’t possibly had gone through the Mingug Mountains, itÂ’s impossible!Â”<br><br>Wong paused and went into deep thought. Train of thoughts began to run through his mind, suddenly Â…<br><br>Â“YES THEY CAN! Divert forces over there immediately. Put MRLS on the east!Â” Wong shouted.<br><br>Wong knew that the Prussians were capable of the impossible, and going through the treacherous terrain of the Mingug mountain wasnÂ’t impossible for the Prussians at all. Wong had seen them in battle many times, and on many occasions the Prussian tactics and maneuvers was something not to be reckoned with. Wong prayed harder at that moment, praying that the immediate counteroffensive will hold back the Prussians at the east. Wong looked through his scope and managed to pick of a few oncoming Prussian troops.<br><br>The situation grew very much desperate for the mHzen troops. Soldiers kept pouring in from the beachhead and the battle at the east wasnÂ’t going well for the MLF. The incoming Prussian force that flanked the city had already taken 15% of the city, which proved to be bad for the mHzen forces. At the road leading in from the beachhead, neither side made any progress, the MLF crack troopers and M1A2 Abrams were sticking to their position strongly, not budging at all. Their pre-dug trenches for both tank and soldier proved to be an added advantage for the mHzen forces, if not for the trenches, the Prussians could have very well overrun the city in no time.<br><br>Wong continue to pick Prussians off, aiding the mHzen front. On several occasions, Prussians could have entered the trenches if not because of Wong.<br><br>2147 hours<br><br>The battle raged from early afternoon all the way to the night, finally their effort paid off, the Prussians withdrew back for the night, though in the east side the Prussians had already gained 25% of the town, the attack ceased for the night, allowing the soldiers of both sides to rest and recuperate.<br><br>Wong keep his equipment and went down the clock tower, the PC was sitting at the corner of the stairs and scanning through the map of Mingug under the dim light of his flashlight.<br><br>Â“PC, whatÂ’s your plan now? The Prussians are coming in strong. If we donÂ’t do anything, weÂ’ll be overrun in no time.Â” Wong said.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve radioed the WD (War Department), they told us to hold on a little while more, reinforcements and supplies will arrive shortly.Â” Replied the PC.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t trust the WDÂ’s Â“shortlyÂ”, I tell you, by the time reinforcements and supplies come, the city will be gone!Â”<br><br>The PC looked at Wong, he didnÂ’t know what to say next. The atmosphere was tense, the PC sighed. Wong scrutinized the surroundings, troop morale was low and the injured had no place to rest, all available space was already taken up. Wong turned to look at the PC.<br><br>Â“Look at me! If we donÂ’t do anything immediately, weÂ’ll be gone! Listen, I have an idea that might work well.Â”<br><br>Wong sat down beside the PC and started to tell him of the ingenious idea he had to wreck havoc in the Prussian force Â… if this works, the MLF might me able to push the Prussians our of Mingug and back into their ships Â…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SENSE launches an unconventional mission to liberate Koln without causing excessive damage to the Home "Guard" because they were mainly innocent civillians...</strong><br><br>Koln, Operation Just Liberate<br><br>Â“This is going to be hairy, I wish we had the FFARs.Â” Buns, nicknamed for her hairstyle, commented, as she checked her weapon status for the fifth time in twenty minutes.<br><br>Â“Relax sister, weÂ’re going for target their vehicles.Â” The pilot said.<br><br>The fighting had gone down and dirty in Koln, despite the initial air strikes and Spectres doing crippling damage of Prussian regulars, the Prussians had still managed to pour another Regiment of Home Guard made out of young children and infirmed civilians too old for regular service against the SENSE defence in Koln. Not willing to risk the lives of regular troops for civilian Â“camo-clownsÂ”, as Buns called them, the SENSE resistance had been light, just enough for friendly forces to sabotage most of the supplies and pull out. It was time for a little hand-of-god action.<br><br>Â“Anytime now.Â” The pilot said again, unnecessarily, they could already see it coming from the eint.<br><br>Screaming down on the town of Koln, SENSE MLRS systems 90 kilometres away rained down hundreds of missiles in a rocket saturation attack. These rockets did not carry payloads of death, but scattered thousands of Jabberwocky payloads all over the small of city-town and scattered long life smoke CS (tear gas) warheads in a sudden hail of munitions that lasted thirty seconds.<br><br>SENSE had knew that Prussia, thanks to eint, would resort to the use of civilians Â“Patriotic Home GuardsÂ” who were in reality recently (as recently as two days ago) drafted conscripts who were barely trained with their obsolete weapons and had little inking of basic military skills whatsoever. Thrown in mainly as cannon fodder to draw attention away from the regulars, who would be the ones doing most of the shooting back. SENSE generals had decided to try their best not to harm these people if possible.<br><br>That was where Â“Just LiberateÂ” operations like these came in, to break the back of the Home Â“GuardÂ” through the targeted destruction of their regular military oppressors by surgical firepower. And Fiona Â“BunsÂ” Lee now found herself involved in one such operation.<br><br>The jabberwockies scattered all over the town city scrambled and jammed communications, as well as fire control radars for the recently installed antiaircraft weapons the Prussian regulars had installed. Multiple rockets spreading CS gas all over the city-town would be more then enough to disable any personnel on the ground which had no access to gas masks, the regular military personnel should have them, but probably not the camo clowns.<br><br>Â“Pop upÂ…pop upÂ…now.Â” The pilot said as he eased their AH-64D Longbow Apache over the tree line they had been taking cover behind. Already having the location of all nearby antiaircraft sites uploaded via eint into their fire control computer, it was Buns job to make sure all the 16 Hellfires her Longbow carried found their targets.<br><br>Finding the targets on their own using their mast-mounted longbow radar was not an option; there was just too much interference from the jabberwockies for it to burn through. Thankfully, Buns found that the eint based target acquisitions were perfect, and every target was where the network said it should be.<br><br>Â“Hellfire away!Â” Buns didnÂ’t waste time cutting lose with the missiles, as did the rest of the flight of 16 Longbows in strike team. 16 times 16 missiles found 210 targets all over Koln, aimed at the recently installed antiaircraft installations.<br><br>They still had some left, as a gas-masked Prussian antiaircraft gunner reminded her when he opened up blindly into the fog of CS gas, not aimed at anything he could see but nevertheless missing close to her Longbow and giving her a scare, Buns silenced that 20mm position with a burst from her bushmaster chaingun, but her job here was already done.<br><br>Â“Still wish I had the FFARs, could have gotten more frags.Â” Buns commented over the radio, as the pilot drew the Longbow away and back to friendly lines, Â“Mark that sixteen kills today for me.Â”<br><br>As the Longbows departed, the feared Spectre gunships moved in again to finish the job, blasting fortifications, regular personnel and any remaining AA sites at a distance with amazing accuracy without touching nearby civilian structures (contrary to a misconception of the Prussian leader, the XAF actually had more then enough surgical accuracy to pick out enemy targets from friendly during a close quarters battle on the ground) from with the 105mm Howitzer, just in case any AA units managed to fire through the smoke and jamming. None did, the surprising non-lethal MLRS strike had effectively disabled the hastily constructed Prussian defence.<br><br>SENSE troopers that have vacated Koln just a few hours earlier soon found themselves moving in and moping up the confused, disorganized Home Guard. The regulars having fled the city the moment the found out that their antiaircraft guns could not work due to the jabberwockies, leaving the armed civilians behind, who were effectively disabled by the CS gas. The disabled Home Guard was rooted out by the reoccupying SENSE troops, disarmed, and sent to the rear to join up with one of the ever increasing numbers of Prussian refugees voting with their feet and moving to the SENSE humanitarian areas of Prussia.<br><br>Koln was reoccupied by SENSE, and the useless supplies the Prussians had captured only to realize that they were of no value were decked as mocking vehicle obstacles neatly on the exit road from Koln towards the Prussian lines, a little reminder of that attempting to profit from using civilians pawns for as propaganda to drive up support does not pay well in an operation that ultimately cost the Prussians over 650 hard-to-replace-given-the-bombed factories vehicles 3,900 regular casualties, mostly from SENSE airpower. Frustratingly, SENSE ground casualties were comparatively light (89) as they avoided confrontation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>mHzen guerilla tactics created pandemonium among Prussian troops in Mingug, causing them to lose 20% of controlled territory.</strong><br><br>Â“I saw flies in the sky!Â”<br><br>WongÂ’s heart pumped faster and faster, he felt as though he heart could break down and collapse anytime. Wong looked at the Prussian troop that just passed by him, followed by another, and another, and another. The dark gave Wong the necessary stealth and cover he needed to run from the Prussians. Weary and tired from the dayÂ’s battle, the mHzen soldiers took rest, not knowing that the Prussians would strike at night. Artillery was falling all over the place. The MLFÂ’s armoured divisions were firing on their own troops, so were the Prussians.<br><br>The battle grounded overlapped, resulting in soldiers from both sides being scattered all over the 50% territorial control the Prussians had. Wong looked at the surroundings; no Prussians in sight, he slowly crept out. Earlier on he briefed the PC on what was to happen, thankfully, every single mHzen trooper was briefed on the plan B. The plan to wreck havoc among the Prussians.<br><br>The main idea wasnÂ’t to come head on with the Prussian strength, Wong knew very well that the Prussians outnumbered them in infantry and also in tanks, though the mHzen Abrams pack much more firepower than the Prussian Aquanix. Crack troopers will be split into small groups of 5 and 6, with a RPG-7 in each squad. The squads will then perform guerilla warfare, striking and running away. In this way the squads can flank the Prussian force here and there, throwing them into confusion and not knowing where the enemy is coming from. Wong prayed that this would work. Amidst the night invasion, Wong got separated from his squad in which he was assigned to. Wong prayed hard that his squad would survive in this plan.<br><br>Wong spotted a high-rise house opposite him, which was badly damaged in the artillery barrage, which was still falling all around and outside the city.<br><br>Â“Bloody War Department, donÂ’t they know that they have their own troops in this town!Â” Wong thought.<br><br>He knew that the WD had called for unobserved fire, taking the risk of hitting their own men in this barrage. Wong realized that the WDÂ’s promise of reinforcements were nothing more than mere pep talk. He knew that the WDÂ’s logistics are pretty much tight up and the possibility of reinforcements arriving in the next 2 or 3 days is like asking the Prussians to retreat out of Mingug and Webding.<br><br>Wong looked around, no Prussian in sight; he ran across the street and climbed the building. Wong wagered that the Prussians would not figure out that he would hide in this building, which seemingly could collapse any moment. Would maneuvered the holes in the stairs and on the 4th floor until he came to a small opening which gave him good view of the town center. He didnÂ’t want to give away his position so easily, Wong wanted to last all the way to the end, so he waited for the artillery to fall before taking shots, in this way his gunshots would be covered up by the exploding artillery. If he was lucky, Wong could take out a whole squad of Prussians in one artillery fall, he trusted his skill.<br><br>Wong was lucky, no sooner when he finished setting up his position, a squad of Prussian soldiers came by.<br><br>Â“Come on, come on Â… Â“ Wong whispered.<br><br>He was waiting for the artillery to fall. Wong was lucky; in a matter of seconds he could hear the next incoming artillery.<br><br>Â“BOOM!Â”Â… Â“Pham Â… pham Â… pham Â… pham Â…Â”<br><br>The Prussian soldier fell one by one, not knowing what hit them, but even if they didnÂ’t it was already too late for them to find out. All over the town, small squads of mHzen troops carried out their plan B.<br><br>Corporal Joe hide in the dark corner of the alley, which gave him good view of the main city street. His comrades were hiding behind him, with the bazooka guy just behind him. Amidst the artillery, Joe could hear the familiar engine sound of the Aquanix, the Prussians are near!<br><br>Â“Patience guys, wait for the right moment Â… Â“ Joe whispered.<br><br>Â“Corporal, tell that to the croakroach crawling up my ass Â… Â“ the bazooka guy whispered back.<br><br>Joe looked back and stared at the bazooka guy in disbelief, in the midst of combat he could still crack lame statements. Joe wanted to laugh, but he wasnÂ’t in the mood too. He would have, if they chatting around a table, then everyone could enjoy this fellowÂ’s joke. The bazooka guy was a professional comedian before he was conscripted into the MLF, even a normal conversation, this fellow could break out a laughing disease. It was natural in him. Joe could never understand how this guy can crack jokes in the middle of combat, in which they could die any moment.<br><br>Two squads of Prussians behind it followed the Aquanix; Joe knew there was a chance of his whole squad getting killed in this plan, but they were briefed earlier on, strike on when the artillery falls. Joe had confidence in his squad mates. The Aquanix revealed its side, giving the bazooka guy the perfect opportunity to strike.<br><br>Â“Now!Â” whispered Joe.<br><br>The bazooka guy took aim and waited for the artillery to fall.<br><br>Â“BOOM!Â”Â… Â“Fhoom! Boom! Â… TatatatatamÂ…Â”<br>Joe released his finger from his trigger, by which then, his whole magazine of 30 rounds had been emptied on the Prussian troops. The drop of perspiration fell slowly down his cheek; sending cold shivers down his spine. Joe turned back and look at his comrades; all of them were still alive. The plan went well!<br><br>That very night the mHzen forces gained back control of up to 70% of the city.<br><br>Meanwhile, on the eastern side of the city where Prussian Wave B attacked Â…<br><br>Sergeant Rocco looked at his night vision screen in his Abrams tank. The Leopard III was without movement and fire was seen burning. No sign of movement there. Up above, Rocco could hear his gunner emptying 7.62mm rounds on the scrambling Prussians.<br><br>Â“HowÂ’s it going up there sonny?Â”<br><br>Â“Very well Sergeant! I just sent the Prussians my regards!Â”<br><br>Rocco grinned, though this minor battle was a victory for this Abrams, it doesnÂ’t mean he can hold off Wave B forever. MG positions behind him continued to pound on the oncoming Prussians, increasing their casualties bit by bit.<br><br>Rocco took hold of his radio Â…<br><br>Â“Hold on guys! IÂ’m sure we can hold of the Prussians until back up arrives!Â” was it that came through the radio set of Private Douglas at his m249 MG. Douglas, fired ruthlessly on the oncoming Prussians, he knew he had to defend this town.<br><br>In the beginning of the war, patriotic soldiers willing conscripted into the army, willing to fight for their home and land. But as time passed and battle raged on, the soldiers grew tired and weary. They had seen enough of battle and deaths before their eyes. Each individual fought neither for country nor the government, but for one another. Each one saw the importance of protecting their own friends and those who fight alongside them. Though morale was low, the spirit of comradeship was high among the soldiers. One would watch the back of the other fighting alongside with him, even if it meant dying in place of that comrade.<br><br>Many mHzen soldiers witness their own comrades using their own body as shields against enemy fire or oncoming shrapnel, and each was willing to lay down his life for the his comrade, knowing that they would not be around if not because of their comrade who died for him. Even for those whom no one has taken his place of death, the willingness to die for the person next to them was high, all wanted the war to end quickly and go home. No one wanted this to continue dragging on.<br><br>That very night, the MLF inflicted heavy casualties with their guerilla warfare tactic. Throwing the Prussian Army into confusion and chaos. The death rate were at the odds of 1:10, Wong was right, the plan worked perfectly well against the Prussians, but this will not work forever. He had to think of another plan to outwit and outplay the Prussians. Everyone learns through mistakes, and like it says, once bitten, twice shy. The Prussians would not be foolish enough to fall into the same trap again. The Prussians Wave B still could not break through the eastern side of Mingug, while the Prussians attack from the northern side have lost 20% control of the city, leaving them with only 30% now.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Full Power the of Xing Shiana Military Finally Shows up In Force in the War </strong><br><br>Of all the nations in the region, the geographical features of Xing Shiana made it the most isolated and distant nation, separated from the rest of SENSE nations, with Eziiumi-Shi being the closest across hundreds of kilometers of ocean.<br><br>This traditionally meant that getting the full might of its military across to any hotspots in the area would be difficult for Xing Shiana. Due to such circumstances, the Xing Shianan military had always placed a great deal of focus of getting its forces quickly to potential battlefields a good way across the region.<br><br>When the Malayan war with Prussia had started, safe for Xing Shianan airpower, Xing Shiana numbers in the theater of operations had been relatively small, compared to the forces of the other nations in the fray. Having only one naval task force in the area and along with some deployed ground units that had been involved in the original conflict with Malaya. They had been sufficient to defeat the Malayan army, but the Prussians were another matter. The Xing Shianan forces in the Malayan theater had used their considerable advantage in technology to engage the Prussians with great success, but without the numbers, they were at a strategic disadvantage.<br><br>From day one of the conflict with the Prussians, the Xing Shianan transport units had moved quickly to redress the balance, with the air transport squadrons working nearly to breaking point to transport Xing Shianan ultra rapid reaction forces as a stopgap measure. Their efforts paid off, Phase Line Alpha was now reinforced with substantial XSAF infantry units, light artillery units, along with over 250 much needed AGS light tanks. Airpower had also been deploying constantly into the Malayan theater, turning what was initially just air superiority into overwhelming air superiority.<br><br>But that was just the beginning of things. The successful naval engagement by Task Force Tyrant King showed the vast superiority of the 21st century naval strategies and equipment over the conventional enemy, and most importantly kept the Sea of Fuchs firmly under SENSE control that allowed two additional, much larger, naval task forces that had been prepared in record time and had been sailing towards the Malayan theater since the first day the Prussian turned their coats.<br><br>They were Task Forces Bakker and Greg Paul, whose main objectives were to greatly redress the balance of numbers in the Malayan theater. Sailing into the Sea of Fuchs without incident following the elimination of the Prussian Navy, they, along with Task Force Tyrant King now made the already strong control of the Sea of Fuchs undisputable for a long time.<br><br>But even more important, along with Task Forces Bakker and Greg Paul came hundreds of advanced RO/RO transports, carrying great numbers of advanced technology troops, armor and other ground support units. It was the Xing Shianan Rapid Reaction Land Force, and they were moving in to complete their 14-day transport mission.<br><br>The Xing Shianan forces Malaya knew they had the advanced technology, training on their side, but they had also wanted the numbers. Now they would have all.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>mHzen forces pushed into the corner by the Prussians in Mingug. </strong><br><br>Trickle of Faith<br><br>Â“Fhoom!Â”Â…<br><br>The RPG-7 flew right at the side of the Leopard 3 and blasted the tracks out of place, putting the Leopard 3 out of service. Dazed Prussians opened their hatch and crawled out, unknowing of the fate that awaits them.<br><br>Â“Tatatatatatatatam!Â”<br><br>Private Douglas had just emptied his whole box of 5.56mm on the crawling Prussians, sending them on their way.<br><br>Â“Chan! Get that box of ammo here now! I need them!Â” Douglas screamed.<br><br>Chan jerked his head to the direction of Douglas<br><br>Â“Doug! IÂ’m busy!Â” Chan shouted back.<br><br>Douglas frowned. He ran out from his position to the ammo stock and grabbed as much ammo as he could, labouring back to his MG position. Fixing in the ammo round, Douglas pulled his trigger on a squad of oncoming Prussian troops, sending them running for cover.<br><br>The mHzen forces have already been fighting through the night and early morning the next day and the Prussians keep coming in numbers. The guerilla warfare that was carried out earlier on worked, but that didnÂ’t stop the Prussians from regaining control of the town and pushing the mHzen forces back.<br><br>Wong looked through his scope; he could see Prussians streaming in, non-stop.<br><br>Â“Damn these Prussians, donÂ’t they ever give up!Â” Wong thought.<br><br>Picking off several Prussians, Wong heard the PC giving the retreat call.<br><br>Â“Soya bean! Soya bean!Â”<br><br>That was the signal code for retreat; the mHzen was at the losing end, with more Prussians streaming in like a rushing river.<br><br>Â“Hey PC! CanÂ’t we hold them off for another moment or two? DonÂ’t you know that theyÂ’re low on ammunition and fuel, which makes them more desperate to take this town!Â” Wong shouted.<br><br>Â“Yeah Cap, I know that! But we canÂ’t stay here any longer, I was given the order to pull you guys out!Â” the PC replied.<br><br>Wong didnÂ’t understand what was that for but he complied to the PCÂ’s demands, grabbing his equipment and rifle, he joined the retreating mHzen troops. Suddenly, he fell, thinking that he had tripped over something, Wong tried to get up, but his attempts were futile. He discovered that he had difficulty moving his leg, and then came a burning sensation at the back of his thigh, Wong feared the worse. He turned to look at his leg; he had been hit!<br><br>Â“Medic! Medic!Â” Wong shouted.<br><br>Several of the retreating mHzen soldiers began to help him up, one taking his rifle and equipment and the two others lifting him up to their shoulders and pulling him out as fast as they could in the midst of Prussian fire.<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t worry Cap, weÂ’ll get you out of here ASAP, then weÂ’ll get you some medical attention.Â” Said the private who was supporting him on the left.<br><br>Finally, the reached about 1km from where they, reaching the Fullerstug Line in which the War Department had drawn for no apparent reason. MG positions were set up and troops got ready for the last leg of defense.<br><br>Â“Sarg! Why didnÂ’t we hold them back there? We could have pushed them off?Â” shouted one private to his PC.<br><br>Â“Orders from the top, donÂ’t ask too much!Â” the PC replied.<br><br>Wong lay there with his belly flat on the ground, breathing in the dust and the musky smell of the soil filled his nostrils while a medic was attending to his wound. From a distance Wong could hear the engine sounds of the Leopard III coming in from the direction theyÂ’ve just retreated from. Wong thought, if they couldnÂ’t hold them off back there, what makes it possible for the mHzen forces to hold of the Prussians here? 70% of the town is already in their control, with no sign of hope for the mHzen forces, each individual was ready to fight to the end, surrendering to the Prussians would be no difference from shooting themselves in the head.<br><br>Wong was helped to a tree.<br><br>Â“Cap, you gotta rest, IÂ’ll get you out of here ASAP.Â” Said the medic.<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t bother medic, IÂ’ll fight alongside with our comrades, canÂ’t bear to see them carrying the burden themselvesÂ… Â“ Wong replied.<br><br>Wong crawled towards his rifle in pain, picking it up into his arms; he crawled to the line to join the others. Wong looked through his scopeÂ…<br><br>Â“IÂ’ll rather die then give in to you bloody Prussians!Â” Wong whispered under his breath.<br><br>The first sight of the Leopard IIIÂ’s turret sent the mHzen troops into full alert.<br><br>Â“Hold your ground men!Â” shouted the PC.<br><br>The battle-weary and outnumbered mHzen forces in Mingug were certain that this battle was their very last, they couldnÂ’t bear to see the Prussians desecrate their country.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>CheckÂ…</strong><br>Mingug, 440mHz<br><br>The Prussians had launched their daring operation to bring 440mHz to itÂ’s knees by sending one of their strongest fleets to tie down the SENSE task force in the Sea of Fuchs, while their landing fleet moved on behind, but still they had landed with serious losses, in a landing that cost them 62 thousand casualties thanks to the much faster then anticipated annihilation of the Prussian fleet that was supposed to tie down the Xing Shianan naval task force, and the subsequent redirection of the XSNÂ’s attention towards the landing force, that was defended by only a Aegis cruiser. Under a hail of firepower, they had barely made it onshore, taking 25 percent casualties from their invasion force of 250,000 troops and 2 regiments of armour worth 290 tanks.<br><br>But such grievous losses were least of their worries, with SENSE holding airpower of the seas, it was impossible to maintain a supply lifeline to the invasion force, not to mention they had lost quite a bit of their precious supplies during the disastrous landing. There was no way they could complete their mission unless they captured the nearby city of Mingug.<br><br>Despite all the objections that the Prussian generals had raised against the daring plan for the backdoor invasion, conceived by the Grand Duke himself, the self-styled leader, who had a keen study of German battle tactics in World War 2, was convinced that this could work if they managed to accomplish what the Germans failed to accomplish during The Battle of The Bulge; to capture enemy supplies and utilize them to support their mission.<br><br>That was what made the city of Mingug important to the Grand DukeÂ’s plan. The Prussian troops had brought along a large load of ammunition, but fuel was going to be a problem. A problem that was already serious in the entire Prussian armies due to the SENSE strategic bombing of their industries, and relentless air attacks on their supply lines. Mingug was a city built on an extensive oil industry, and if the Prussians could capture them, they should have no problems with supply. Fail to do so, and the entire invasion force would grind to a halt as they ran out of fuel, and almost certainly lost.<br><br>The Prussians had made their best speed towards Mingug, but once again, they had reckoned without the SENSE Xing Shianan eint network, which cost them all their element of surprise. The SENSE generals could see what was coming from a long way off and had managed to rush forces to the defense of Mingug. Dragging what was supposed to be a swift Prussian victory into an increasingly desperate urban war of attrition where they were running low on ammunition, and most importantly, fuel.<br><br>But the mHzen defenders were not having it any better either, badly outnumbered by the desperate Prussians, they had been taking heavy casualties and losing ground as they tried their very best to stall for time, waiting for SENSE reinforcements (of which they were not even sure of if any were planned) and the Prussian supply problems to catch up with them.<br><br>The Prussians, running almost dry, had struck as hard and as desperately at the mHzen defense as possible, trading blood in an attempt to get their fuel, throwing everything they got at the enemy and advancing with scant attention to casualties. And the mHzen forces were caught off balance by such desperate tactics, taking heavy losses and forced to withdraw. Frustratingly, almost insanely frustrating for the Prussians, the much needed oil industries lay on the far eastern side of the city, which meant that they had to fight all the way through it in order to get to them.<br><br>But they had been making progress, despite their serious losses. And now the mHzen forces were on their last leg, badly depleted and pushed all the way back almost out of the city, defending just a scant 150 meters of city between them and the oil industries. The desperate and with the sent of much needed victory Prussians moved their forces for the last final push which involved the most effort they had every put in ever since this entire sorry urban fight started.<br><br>Outnumbering the mHzens, who lacked the support of their vaunted artillery, the Prussians attacked to put the final, desperate K.O punch to the enemy defense to break through to the salvation of their army. Infantry poured against infantry lines and tanks charged down the last defended streets. The mHzen defense would stand no chance, unwavering against the odds; they made their last stand.<br><br>But in that final massive attack, the Prussian forces were like a boxer that had overextended himself in attacking his opponent, leaving himself vulnerable. As the masses of Prussian infantry and what armor that could be coaxed to charged down towards the depleted mHzens, it was the very moment the SENSE generals had waiting for, and the exact thing they hoped the Prussians would try.<br><br>Screaming down out of the sky at the exposed Prussians, SENSE airpower that had been absent in all this while came down of out nowhere in the form of mHzen A-10s, the first few dropping Rockeye bombs on the exposed Prussians, the Rockeye canisters split apart midair, releasing hundreds of submunitions all over the place-<br><br>-The Prussian lieutenant commander leading the morale-boosting attack, running while waving his pistol like he had seen in his childhood propaganda films, realized that his forces were utterly exposed the moment the A-10s appeared, and he opened his mouth to scream for them to break up and take cover. He had managed to form half the order when the submunitions blanketed him and his troops in a pyrotechnic drumbeat of smoke and explosions.<br><br>Â“Good hit, good hit, theyÂ’re out of action.Â” One of the A-10 pilots said.<br><br>Out of action was a gross understatement; the largest piece of all the 210 Prussians killed by the Rockeyes was the lieutenant commanderÂ’s headless torso. That was just the beginning, more A-10s screamed in, dropping loads of FAEs, napalm and more cluster bombs on the stunned Prussians. Tanks exploded as the Warthogs engaged them with cannon and mavericks, tearing through the armoured columns like harvesters through a wheat field. Lacking any serious anti-air weapons, what Prussians that were alive and had the presence of mind to fire at the A-10s found their weapons ineffective against the well-protected aircraft.<br><br>The mHzen A-10s had attacked some distance away from friendly lines as they ran the very real risk of hitting friendly ground units, which, just minutes ago preparing for their last battle, were now cheering the aircraft on like spectators at a sports event. The Prussians closer to the mHzens who had escaped death as the A-10s dropped behind them found no respite when Xing Shianan attack choppers, a swarm of numerous AH-64D Longbow Apaches and AUH-X1 Little Foxes arrived from apparently nowhere after a long map of the earth flight from Hangug, the Apaches hovering and dodging up and down behind the ridge of the hill and engaging the forward Prussians with their Hellfires, Folding Fin Aerial Rockets (FFAR) and 30mm chain guns, while the Little Foxes dodged in, using their hellacious speed to strafe the Prussians with their 5.56mm minuguns and 2inch FFARs in attack runs so accurate and precise that rained spent shells on the mHzen position, but sprayed the Prussians with minigun fire. And that was not all, the AC-130 Spectres, fresh from their mission over Koln just a day ago, had turned up in force in the skies above Mingug to rain even more death on the Prussians.<br><br>The results were no short of devastating, what was a determined, advancing Prussian mass assault of infantry and armour had been transformed into a scene of dead bodies, body parts and twisted metal, while the survivors either lay dying or were now running away in any direction as long as it involved taking them further from the enemy. In just a few short minutes, the attacking Prussians had over 5,500 men and most of their armor out of action, turning the mass attack into a rout that continued to take casualties as they were harassed by SENSE airpower. SENSE airpower continued to arrive unopposed, now attacking Prussians positions within the city and outside with crippling effect. Enemy anti aircraft return fire was ineffective.<br><br>Then came a strike of thirty-five B1-B Lancers of the 2nd Albertosaur bomb wing, which approached, unnoticed by the Prussians until they started carpet bombing the stunned Prussian armies, guided by eint in dynamically updating bomb runs that followed the desperate enemy as they scrambled to get out of the way. More crippling casualties piled onto of crippling casualties.<br><br>Driven by airpower all over the area, the entire Prussian invasion force, now down to 55,000 men and just over fifty tanks, were driven from all their areas in and outside the city a general and chaotic rout towards the center of the city, where they all started to band up. Brutalized, demoralized and disorganized, the surviving Prussians lost all military instinct and banded together in the city center like cornered animals, in a mass collection of 55,000, not an army but shell-shocked men who took cover wherever they could find, stayed there at all costs and fired at anything they perceived to be a threat, better judgment clouded by clear panic. Some shot at shadows, others at their own people. Casualties from fratricide started to mount.<br><br>Check.<br></div>
