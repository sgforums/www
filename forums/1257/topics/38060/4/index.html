            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Â…Mate</strong><br><br>Mingug, 440mHz<br><br>As the Prussian invasion force was broken up in and around Mingug and routed to the city center, things were about to get much worse for them.<br><br>After a two week sail from Xing Shiana, Task Force Bakker had finally arrived, escorting the military RO/RO transports carrying the one of the two Xing Shiana rapid reaction task forces. The transports unloaded the force at the very beach the Prussians had invaded 440mHz from, the beach still strewn with Prussian dead and wrecked equipment from their disastrous landing. Xing Shiana troops were finally starting to deploy in numbers.<br><br>One of those landed elements was the 110th ACR, each numbering 190 advanced FCS MBTs along with twice that much mechanized infantry units, they tasked with delivering the final moves into the Mingug affair. Covering the rough 40km of terrain they needed to travel way faster then conventional units, the 110th ACR reached Mingug within 40 minutes.<br><br>As the FCS tanks crested the hill overlooking Mingug, they started to engage anything that looked vaguely dangerous, setting aflame many abandoned Prussian field camps, field command HQs and what little supplies they had left behind. What Prussian armor that was left was badly outnumbered and outclassed, not to mention they were short on ammo and fuel. They were rapidly put out of action within three minutes of engagements with no damage to the FCS tanks.<br><br>SENSE artillery also started to fall on the besieged Prussian city center, in the form of recently rushed in 440mhz from the east, and Xing Shianan smart artillery from the west. Arsenal ship land attack warheads also started to arrive as the Prussian infantry, trapped in the center, had no way to respond. The less accurate but regular and blanketing 440mhz artillery kept them pinned down and unable to move while the less numerous, while surgically accurate SFW (Sensor Fused Weapon) warheads from Xing Shiana tube and rocket artillery picked out their positions and destroyed them where they stood. The Arsenal ship warheads did likewise. The artillery operators also dropped tear and vomit gas warheads into the Prussian sector occasionally, blanketing the area with a vile fog that nobody wanted to be in. It was a hellish mixture. The Xing Shianan units watching the battle on their situational displays saw the numerous red symbols representing enemy units blink off one by one until there wasnÂ’t really much left at all. Up above, the loitering AC-130 Spectres continued to add to the mix.<br><br>When the bombardment finally stopped, the 110th ACR moved into the Prussian sector with little resistance, the tanks shooting up or rolling over whatever survived to shoot back. Most of them chose to surrender instead, staggering out of their battered shelters disoriented and covered in vomit, raising their hands to surrender en masse. Not long after, SENSE troops in the form of Xing Shianan units and freshly arrived mHzen reinforcements filed into the city in strength, some of them moving off east to further strengthen Phase Line Alpha on the other side of the nation.<br><br>Operation Frankfurter, a daring operation to cease 440mhz by a high-risk back door assault was all but finished. In an operation that involved 250,000 Prussians when they set sail, fewer then 27,000 would return to see Prussia again.<br><br>So it was, with the back door of 440mhz sealed and the sea denied to the Prussians by the further reinforced Xing Shianan Navy. And with the Operation Frankfurter stopped, the lines in Malaya were roughly as they had been before, with the battle at phase line alpha and the stalemate of the Bog. But things were different for the SENSE now, with the Task Force Bakker landings into 440mhz to further strengthen an already formidable SENSE line at Phase Line Alpha and the Task Force Greg Paul landings on the west coast of Malaya sending Xing Shianan forces to the Battle of the Bog. After getting the war off to a start of backpedaling and fending off overwhelming numbers, Xing Shiana had finally managed to get its weight into the war. The tide was starting to turn.<br><br>Checkmate.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Things shapen up for the MLF in the country and Mingug. </strong><br><br>Retaliation.<br><br>The miraculous and timely arrival of the XSAF saved the remaining mHzen forces out of certain death. With most of the Prussians out of action and badly destroyed, a ray of hope flickered for The Borderlands of 440mhz. Trucks rolled in and out of Mingug, carrying in fresh supplies of rations, medical supplies and ammunition while trucks rolled out, carrying the injured and the dead bodies of mHzen soldiers who died valiantly fighting in the face and danger and defending their very own homeland.<br><br>Reinforcements of mHzen crack troopers were airlifted in by Chinooks to further strengthen the defense of Mingug, making sure that the Prussians would not pull a fast one on them again. Town trucks pull the wreckage of mHzen tanks out of the city to bring them back to the War Factory to be repaired if possible or scraped for parts, while fresh new batches of M1A2 Abrams rolled in from the Shunich Air Base. Things were beginning to shape up for 440mhz as fuel and ammunition stocks piled up, giving the MLF sufficient supplies of fuel and ammunition to administer justice against the Prussians.<br><br>The mHzen LCT (Light Crack Troopers) were brought in to clear out any remaining Prussians that may be lurking in certain corners of Mingug, in which they successfully flushed out many hiding Prussians with their skills and lightning-fast reaction and flexibility. When the LCT was brought in 2 days after the battle ended, they flushed out a total of 243 Prussians hiding all around the city, either alone or in small groups. Though the Prussians had lost the battle of Mingug, their determination to carry on fighting for their so-called Fatherland and psychotic leader was futile against the elite LCT. Being brainwashed by the propaganda wasnÂ’t too appealing to the mHzens. They knew that the Prussians functioned on fed-in energy and mental strength while the MLF was a bunch of conscripted troopers who didnÂ’t want any part in the war at all. The desperate attempt of the Prussians to take over the oil industry of Mingug ended in disaster and the Prussian army incurred heavy losses in this risky attempt to enter by a back door.<br><br>Though being brainwashed and taught to fight till the very end, there was still a certain handful of right-minded Prussians who willingly surrendered to the will of the LCT when discovered. A total of 124 Prussians surrendered during the flush out.<br><br>0840 hours: Checkmate +3<br><br>Wong woke up to a bright and sunny morning. Cringing his eyes, he struggled to stare at the morning sky, which wasnÂ’t too bad yet. Crawling out of his foxhole, Wong noticed the serenity of the surroundings, though pretty much battered-up, the quietness was something he didnÂ’t experience for a long time. Everyone was still sleeping in their foxholes, with a few sentries patrolling the area. Though the Prussian presence in Mingug was eradicated, the mHzen troops didnÂ’t want to take a chance of being complacent. The war was finally at itÂ’s brink of collapse and the SENSE troops were in full swing and the mHzen troops were pumped up, fighting for the day where theyÂ’ll finally be able to throw down their arms and go home, back to their own towns, friends and family.<br><br>Though the presence of the Prussians army was no more, small reconnaissance squads were sent out to scout out the area to be sure that no Prussians were hiding in the woods nearby.<br><br>1143 hours: Team Go-There scouting outskirts of western Mingug.<br><br>Sergeant Joe looked at his watch. 11:45am. He sighed. His team was place on reconnaissance duty that day and they had to wake up earlier to scout out the area. Sitting in the commanderÂ’s seat of his new M1A2 Abrams, Joe took a deep breath.<br><br>Â“Ah! Air never smelt so good!Â” Joe remarked.<br><br>Â“Hey Sarg, you better keep your head low, some crazy fanatic Prussian might put a bullet in your head!Â” Private Chan who was walking along side the Abrams shouted in the midst of the engine sound.<br><br>Â“Come on, I can close my eyes and sleep and IÂ’ll wager that nothing will happen.Â” Joe replied.<br><br>Noticing that his cigarette pack had dropped out of his pocket onto the turret, Joe bent over to pick it up.<br><br>Â“Shoom!Â”<br><br>Joe fell back in his hatch.<br><br>Â“What in the world was that!Â” exclaimed Joe.<br><br>He picked up his radio set and radioed Private Chan outside his tank.<br><br>Â“Hey Sarg, you were one piece of lucky shit there! That Prussian could have blow off your head! DonÂ’t worry, heÂ’s down, we took him out!Â” Chan replied.<br><br>Joe popped his head out of his hatch and sat back in the commanderÂ’s seat.<br><br>Â“Next time Sarg, you out to watch what you sayÂ… how much did you say you would wager back there?Â” teased Private Chan.<br><br>Â“Shut up private and get back to your line! Â“ exclaimed Joe<br><br>The whole squad burst into laughter.  The whole reconnaissance squad was pretty much relaxed though they face danger of being attack by guerilla groups of Prussians, their intuition told them that the Prussian presence were pretty much out of Mingug and around it. They were right, out of 50 reconnaissance squads that were sent out, only 2 of them encountered Prussian resistance in their area of patrol.<br><br>Royal PrussiaÂ’s fate was sealed after the surprise counteroffensive by the combined effort of SENSE forces. Even if they tried to pull a fast one on SENSE, their ability to do so would be pretty much hindered by the strengthening of the mHzen forces in Mingug and Webding, bringing them all the way back to square 1. Attempting another invasion on Mingug would mean that the Prussians will face the same strength of mHzen forces when they first attacked, but even greater, with added defenses of Mingug and a greater amount of mHzen soldiers and tanks, including the presence of a considerable amount of SENSE troops in 440mhz, not to mention Xing ShianaÂ’s air support alongside with mHzen own MAF. With the MAF back in action and kicking, the Prussians would be facing a behemoth if they ever try to attack again. Game over for them<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Endgame</strong><br><br>Webding, Malaya<br><br>Yang clutched the controls of her replacement AGS as the light tank surged south past shattered buildings that were once the outskirts of Webding. She felt strange, after so many days of fingernail-biting conflict, of retreating north into 440Mhz and holding out there, it felt strange to be driving south at all.<br><br>But the fortunes of war have changed drastically for SENSE in the past few days. The determined resistance and sacrifice of the battered SENSE forces in Malaya had bought enough time for reinforcements to arrive. After the retreat from Webding, Yang had managed to get acquire a new AGS from the airlifted reinforcements after hers was knocked out in Webding. After which they had spent the rest of their time under hellish conditions in Phase Line Alpha, defeating wave after wave of Prussian attacks. And their efforts showed off, hundreds, if not thousands of tanks and dead Prussians littered the Phase Line, defeated by just 120 Xing Shianan AGS and 300 mHzen armour, with just a tenth as much infantry and support units as the Prussians.<br><br>But their losses had been grievous as well, about twenty-percent of the AGS had been knocked out, about half of that number non-recoverable, fighting with level 4 armour, which while enough to turn off a Po-1 Panzerfaust or Aquanix Light Tank 120mm round, could not quite stop the 200mm guns of the Prussian MBTs. Only three tank crew losing their lives, a testament to the toughness and survivability of the AGS. Yang counted two holes from 200mm sabots that went right through her tank, yet it kept on functioning. The SENSE light armour relied on intelligence and speed afforded them by their technology rather then brute force to defeat their stronger foe, and it worked.<br><br>The mHzen conventional armour fared less well however, losing over half of their tanks in fierce all out battles. But they still gave three or four times as hard as they got.<br><br>But it was the SENSE airpower that saved the day, inflicting serious casualties on the Prussians attacking them, turning many a Prussian attack that looked to be on the brink of success into a whimpering defeat, chasing them back with their tails between their legs. Day after day of brutal combat drew on, but the SENSE defence only got stronger with time, thanks to the relentless airlift.<br><br>The final death knell for the two Prussian armies trying to take Phase Line Alpha came after the sudden defeat of the Prussian invasion force in Mingug and the arrival of large numbers of Xing Shiana reinforcements and even larger numbers of Eziiumi troops. After the shock defeat of the Prussians in Mingug, who were on the brink of success in their daring mission, the SENSE reinforcements had rushed in across the country to link up with Phase Line Alpha. With large numbers of fresh armour, infantry and support units, SENSE prepared to break the line and take the fight to the enemy.<br><br>But they surrendered.<br><br>Yang drove down the streets of Webding cautiously, keeping her sensors wide open. Even as the unending lines of Prussians with their hands behind their head filed past, she was always mindful of the fact that a few die-hards might still remain, some of which might try to shoot a Panzerfaust into the side of her AGS.<br><br>But none of them turned up, though she didnÂ’t know it for a while, SENSE took 120,000 thousand prisoners in the Webding area that day, three depleted armies of 660,000 once-proud Prussian troops.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Endgame</strong><br><br>Kechil Barbi, Malaya<br><br>The same scene of endless lines of demoralized, broken Prussian P.O.W streaming to the rear being played out all over Malaya greeted Sgt. Daniel Ong as he drove his FCS MBT tank into the Malayan capital. Victory.<br><br>He had been one of the lucky ones, only fifteen of the original twenty FCS his tank company had started out with remained, the rest being disabled in the fierce fighting in the Battle of the Bog.<br><br>Following the retreat from the costal plains of Indo Barbi and they city of Kechil Barbi, DanielÂ’s tank company had fallen back with SENSE units to the west while the Prussians chased them before additional SENSE units being rushed from western Malaya moved up to stop the Prussian advance in a costly stalemate fought in swampy areas known as the Bog.<br><br>The swamps were impassable to both sides, and the only way of moving was to gain control of a few dirt trails which ran through the dense jungle swamp. Daniel has spent most of the war fighting here against the two Prussian armies assigned to take the west of Malaya while the other three enemy armies headed north to pound Phase Line Alpha in a bid to invade 440mHz. It was difficult terrain, and difficult fighting that favoured neither side.<br><br>Faced off with a numerical imbalance of 1 to 3, the outnumbered SENSE troops had fought a hard battle, making the Prussians pay for every yard gained with a knocked out tank. The rough terrain made it difficult for armour on both sides, but the advanced sensors and intelligence of the Xing Shianan tanks gave them a crucial advantage that allowed just 40 tanks to knock out over 300 Prussian armoured units, with only five losses of their own, most of them because they got stuck in the swamp and had to be destroyed and left behind. No FCS crewmember lost his life in the Battle of the Bog.<br><br>But the regular SENSE units didnÂ’t fare as well, they took a beating as well as giving one to the enemy. Bloated bodies and knocked out vehicles of both sides lay everywhere. However SENSE could not maintain this battle of attrition, as the numbers were not on their side. Knowing this, the Prussian commanders pushed forward with all they can, ignoring the heavy losses in strength, morale and supply cost by the SENSE defence, airpower and tropical disease. But it almost worked, the SENSE units in the Bog was whittled down to almost nothing and on the verge of breaking, that was, until the SENSE reinforcements arrived from Task Force Greg Paul.<br><br>Daniel had remembered that moment, when enemy tanks advancing in the midst of a Prussian attack that was on the brink of success started exploding. A glance to the situational display told him that the cavalry had comeÂ… literally. Armoured Calvary Regiments from Task Force Greg Paul had landed on the SENSE controlled west side of Malaya, and rushed straight into battle. Daniel whooped, as their strength grew tenfold with the arrival of the Xing Shianan ACRs, and the Prussians knew it was over.<br><br>DanielÂ’s unit, along with the newly arrived armoured cavs. routed the Prussian armies, breaking the stalemate of the Bog in thirty minutes of fighting in which six Prussian armoured regiments of 870 tanks lost over 200 tanks fighting the 190 tanks of two Xing Shianan armoured cav. regiments supported by airpower. The enemy was routed at full speed, but the superior mobility of the Xing Shianan armor chased them down along with the airpower, and killed them in staggering numbers as they tried to run, the Xing Shianan armoured units overtook, broke through Prussian lines, and started spreading panic in the rear as they shot up anything that was Prussian, along with the airpower sowing more destruction. Before the day was over, the SENSE forces had killed over 800 Prussian tanks and thousands of troops, in addition to capturing over 11,000 POWs which had been cut off when the Xing Shianan armour rushed through their lines.<br><br>The surviving Prussians withdrew hastily to Kechil Barbi, where they took more losses from arsenal ship bombardments and air strikes. But additional blood spilt was not necessary. Before the SENSE generals could give the go ahead to storm the city, the Prussian armies in Malaya threw up their arms and surrendered. The war in Malaya was over, of the nearly 1 million Prussians that had landed in five armies to take Malaya when the war started, only 250,000 would see their homeland again.<br><br>But Daniel knew that more was to come. While the Prussians were defeated in Malaya, Prussia remained a threat to regional security and stability with its untrustworthiness, territorial ambitions and insane regime, despite being so badly battered. Now with the Malayan war over, SENSE finally could get down to making the world a far more safe and sensible place.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Declawing of the Tiger</strong><br><br>Malaya was finished, but Prussia was not. Unfortunately for regional security, not every country shows restraint in wielding the nuclear, biological and chemical nightmares that slept silently in their underground bunkers, and Prussia was one of them.<br><br>When the war had started, Prussia had tried to use 50 neutron weapons on SENSE troops in a surprise attack on Malayan soil to cripple the SENSE response to their impending invasion. Only excellent intelligence and the dangerous work of special operations forces from Xing Shiana and Eziiumi-shi prevented the plan from coming to fruition. That was fine for then, but now it was the time to truly finish the job and make sure the Prussian Tiger was truly declawed of its weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>Moving in undetected, and unopposed, Eziiumi-shi F-117 Nighthawks and Xing Shianan B1-B Lancers carried out precision night strikes on the hardened installations that held the Prussian weapons of mass destruction. Laser guided concrete penetrating bombs dropped from the bombers blasted their way through the reinforced concrete of the Prussian nuclear weapons installations before exploding inside, destroying and burying Prussian nuclear warheads and their assorted weapons crews, nuclear technicians and scientists in the facility. Arsenal ship cruise missiles added to the mix of destruction.<br><br>The biological and chemical weapons facility received a few Mother-of-all-Bomb FAE drops from passing C-130 planes. Some of the precision guided, massive fuel air explosive weapons were dropped through holes left from previous deep penetrator bombs whose yields were specifically calculated just to breach the concrete without destroying whatever was inside, exploded within the structures with forces equivalent to small tactical nuclear weapons, destroying and rendering inert with the incredible heat and pressures whatever biological or chemical weapons that were in there, The Prussian crew, technicians and R&amp;D scientists involved in internationally banned weapons research were conveniently immolated along with their work as the installations went up in pyrotechnic displays that burned throughout the night. As added precaution against any dispersed agents that escaped the destruction of the installations, several more FAEs were dropped around the area, truly transforming the area to scorched earth. The results were quite a spectacle.<br><br>The Prussian weapons of mass destruction were truly and well destroyed, along with most of the people involved in them and years of research and work. If the Tiger wanted to resort to desperate means to win this war, it had to do so with conventional means now.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>440mhz War Department takes steps incorporated technology with firepower for increased efficiency in combat. </strong><br><br>Field Of Flowers<br><br>The war all over Malaya had pretty much subsided. With the Prussian threat diminished and almost zero, everything was back to way it was before the war, or at it was so. But even though the war was over, the marks and scars left behind were vivid and clear. Webding and Mingug were clear examples of the scars that were left behind. Ruin and in shambles, it would take the people of both cities to get back to their lives the way it was before, but determined and willed, the people of Webding and Mingug set back to work in rebuilding their own town.<br><br>Even as the country falls back into the state of peace, minute Prussian threats are still evident all over Malaya, not only in Mingug, but also in the outskirts of Webding where fanatical Prussian soldiers retreat and hide to fight another day. Passing patrols have been attacked and even casualties, after the war kept rising due to this guerilla tactics the fanatical Prussian soldiers adhere to.<br><br>Responding to this guerilla threat from the defeated Prussian fanatics, the War Department has sent out its LCT (Light Crack Troopers) to scout out the outskirts of Webding. Equipped with Kevlar and body armour, the chances of incurring casualties in this squads are minimal with the protection from the body armour which prevents bullets from penetrating through, thus increasing the survival rate of these soldiers and increasing their veteran status and experience in warfare.<br><br>Such was the case around the outskirts of Webding where the elite LCT flushed out a substantial amount of Prussian fanatics that hid in the woods that surround Webding. The War Department did not want to progress the operation further into Kechil Barbi. They figured out as much that the Xing Shiana forces would take care of any remaining Prussian fanatic who would attempt to act hero and try guerilla warfare on the Xing Shiana forces.<br><br>Complacency wasnÂ’t part of the mHzen governmentÂ’s dictionary anymore. Steps have been taken to ensure that the MLF are properly trained and even after the war was over, the Basic Military Training policy have been reviewed time and again by the War Department to ensure that the mHzen troops are properly trained, well-equipped, educated in warfare tactics that will enable each individual to be a leader when the need arises and this increase the survivability rate of each battalion right down to a single squad.<br><br>Technology has also been incorporated at a larger scale in the MLF, MAF and MN to increase the flexibility of the Armed Forces. The M1A2 Abrams, Leopard II and the newer T-95s have been equipped with the state-of-the-art technology to give them a step ahead of the enemy who might come against them with brute force. Technology trade between 440mhz and Xing Shiana have taken place to give each other a more on-the-level footing when working together, not only in combat exercises but also the real thing itself. The M1A2 Abrams, Leopard II and T-95 tanks have been equipped with technology same as the XSAF AGS tanks which places the MLF on a better footing in warfare. Thermal sensors, hunter-killer mode give the MLF much better flexibility in warfare.<br><br>Not only has state-of-the-art technology been incorporated into each individual tank, the technology of the M1A2 Abrams was taken and fused into each Leopard II and T-95. The technology was such that, the tank is built in a way to increase the survivability rate of the crew when hit. Ammunition for the tank is placed away from the crew and in armoured sliding doors. In situations where the tank is being hit, the chances of the ammo blowing up into the crew compartment is lower. The M1A2 includes a Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer, and Improved Weapon Station, position navigation equipment, and a distributed data and power architecture, embedded diagnostic system, and improved fire control system, in which all of these features are also incorporated into Leopard II and T-95 tanks.<br><br>With the all these upgrades going on in the War Factory, the government has unofficially taken the step to incorporate a technological twist into the MLF in which troopers and tanks would be fighting not only a conventional war but also a technological war, which incorporates speed, firepower and mobility. Cased depleted uranium armour of the Abrams is also used to upgrade the Leopard II and T-95, which gives them more protection.<br><br>All these steps were taken to improve the firepower, strength and durability of these tanks with the thought of crew survivability. Such was the way of developments of the MLF tanks that the variants are called the Leopard II-D and T-95/D individually. Not only were technological improvements made among the tanks, soldiers of the MLF are not spared from this. Incorporating thermal vision and night vision for the MLF, the War Department has obtain Xing ShianaÂ’s Land Warrior technology, which gives soldiers a cutting edge above any conventional trooper in the field.<br><br>Royal Prussia is not a country to be reckoned with, even though with its proposal of peace, the SENSE nations cannot take chances at slacking even with the annihilation of this threat, which has savaged the land of Malaya and 440mhz for so long.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>History of The Xing Empire</strong><br><br>The Empire of Xing is located in the isolated continent of Eurasia, land of the Tyrannosaur. Eurasia was a virgin land devoid of human life until Chinese settlers, fleeing the persecution of the Chinese Qin empire (which was forming at that time), embarked across thousands of li of dangerous oceans before come ashore Eurasia at around 220 BC. In the first Eurasian epoch, the epoch of feudal kingdoms (221 BC- 500 AD) Eurasia was a collection of hundreds of small, xenophobic feudal town-kingdoms which kept mostly to themselves and only made contact only when absolutely necessary or to conquer each other. This warring states period of Eurasia went on for seven hundred years, with the smaller states being swallowed up, until 550AD, where 32 major empire states were left, ending the feudal period and starting a period known as the Second Age of Empires, The Age of Kings (500-2002 AD).<br><br>Eurasian battle tactics were an extension of typical myriad of Chinese tactics, with an added focus on firepower and weapons technology. Their states born of war, most Eurasian national logos had always mentioned firepower.<br><br>The Age of Kings was marked by arms races, conquest and Byzantine politics. By the late AoK period, towards the last part of the 17th century, only a few states were left. Shiana, Wena, Xianwena, Xuan, Xian being some of them. These states had a long history of mistrust and warfare.<br><br>Despite the conflict, trade flourished. Eurasian sea junks ran trade routes in what was to be the SENSE region in the future long before the European clippers and galleons discovered the area, trading in silk, spices and Tyrannosaurid teeth. The large numbers of immigrants which were attracted to the opportunity that Eurasia presented were shunned by most of the states due to their generally racist and xenophobic attitudes, the exception being the state of Shiana, which openly embraced them, which led to a rich, multiethnic culture and opened Shiana to a large influx of new ideas, which allowed it to surge ahead of the other Eurasian states while they were trapped behind their closed minds and doors. Relations with other nations were non-existent with the Eurasian states, except for Shiana, which had close ties with the Eziiumi nations.<br><br>The state of Shan was a rouge breakaway from the state of Shiana, never recognized as a sovereign state by the later. In 2002 AD, along came a person known to the Shianan as Xing Shi Wang, which through some political maneuvering reunited the two states into Shiana under the first empire ever in Eurasian history, the Xing Empire. All nations or states under the Xing empire would have the empireÂ’s name added to its name, and hence Shiana became Xing Shiana, starting the Xing period (2002- )<br><br>In 2003, Xing Shiana, along with several other pioneer nations, formed the alliance of SENSE. Recent military successes in the Malayan and Prussian campaigns have convinced some other Eurasian states, lagging far behind in military technology, that coming under the Xing empire would be beneficial both in economy and security. Two states, Wena and Xinawena, have come under the banner of the Xing empire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Xing Shianan Representative to the SENSE war council rejects the Â“GrandÂ” DukeÂ’s Â“appealÂ”</strong><br><br>To the Grand Duke of Prussia (whatÂ’s left of it), regarding your letter of appeal:<br><br>Siao! (Nuts!)<br><br>Prussia, with their notions of terrotorial ambition, lack of regard for human life with their WMD, and attempted concentration camping of Domina people are THE NAZI GERMANY! I impore other SENSE nations to respond accordingly to these ridiculous demands for so-called peace by the Prussian Â“leaderÂ”, if anything has been clear, it is apparent that the Prussian wants out to moment things get too hot for him to handle and heÂ’s losing the war, on preposterous humanitarian justifications. Contradicting, this compassionate leader didnÂ’t seem to think twice about dropping neutron bombs on his allies at the drop of a hat at the start of this war. This latest appeal is nothing but sweet-talk in a desperate attempt to save his own crumbling regime.<br><br>Allies of SENSE, I urge you all to pay no heed to this Â“appealÂ” to stop to war. Unless there is an unconditional surrender, and we are sure that any risk of territorial ambitions of the Prussian leadership and the willingness to commit unspeakable atrocities in achieving this ambition are utterly and totally snuffed, we cannot and will not stop this righteous crusade to rid the region of despots such as the current Prussian regime. The region shall not know security until the Prussian Tiger has been tamed, declawed, detoothed, chained and caged. LetÂ’s not fear this upcoming task we have ahead of us now, for when Prussia is allowed to grow strong again, how much more of our men must die in another one of their treacherous schemes to acquire what is ours? As we do not relent with the devil, we must not relent with the Prussians, they must surrender unconditionally, or be destroyed.<br><br>Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the SENSE Expeditionary Force!<br><br>You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of liberty loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers in arms on other the Prussian Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the Prussian war machine, the elimination of Duke tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Prussia, and security for ourselves in a free region.<br>Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle hardened. He will fight savagely.<br>But this is the year 2003! Much has happened since the Prussian triumphs of months ago. SENSE has inflicted upon the Prussians great defeats, in open battle, man to man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned! The free men of the region are marching together to Victory!<br>I have full confidence in your courage and devotion to duty and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full Victory! Good luck! And let us beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.<br><br>Regards, Matteus Tyrannous Tan<br><br>The Xing Shianan Representative to the SENSE war council<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Killing Straits</strong><br><br>Prussian Straits<br><br>It had been apparent from all the time-stalling and bargaining the Prussian leader had no intention for an unconditional surrender and disarmament, it was time for SENSE to act again.<br><br>The Prussian straits had been closed off to friendly forces since the day the Prussian 4th High Seas Fleet had routed the SENSE fleet in a naval disaster that had cut off sea-borne supplies coming in to the troops of Pronamdy, it was thanks to the overworked transport elements of the XAF that the invasion force was kept out of serious supply trouble. But still, if a renewed offensive was going to be supported, the Prussian Straits had to be open to SENSE forces again. It was time for a rematch, this time with a much larger force of the Xing Shianan Task Force Greg Paul and Shingapooru 1st Central Fleet.<br><br>How times have changed. Now SENSE had the larger, plus more advanced fleets in battle.<br><br>And Captain Ravi Kuman of the XSS Alabaster knew that full well, it had been a busy 12 hours for those not involved in lying down and keeping still and quiet while the submarine was on ultra quiet mode. Inching about 450 feet under the dark waters at a 3 knots. Tension hung in the air, almost palatable to all those on the submarine. The ultra quiet had been called about half a day ago, after they had reached their lurking positions following a two day, 15 knot dash. The Alabaster had been involved in the battle of the Fuchs Sea, and scored amazingly well there, killing four enemy submarines and damaging two other. Now rearmed and supplied, she was ready for more action.<br><br>The XSS Alabaster, registry number NCC 1701 was the first of her era, a new class of submarines to replacing the small fleet of seven ageing Los Angles 688I subs they had managed to acquire mothballed from the USN a few years back. The Alabaster class was developed indigenously and introduced to the fleet just a year and a half ago, with ten ships in service. And five of these Alabasters were now screening a large area ahead of the SENSE fleet entering the Prussian Gulf.<br><br>The Alabaster was a small submarine, just 95 meters in length and crewed by forty-five, giving high priority to automation and digitization to reduce required manpower. The form of the triple-hulled submarine was smooth, with no abrupt angles with a design that employed computer-calculated mimicry of the bodies of fishes to reduce drag and the possibly of cavitation in rough areas that would compromise stealth. The propulsion system dispensed with the traditional screw and instead relied on pump jet technology, a setup that sucked it and expelled water for propulsion more akin to a jet engine then a prop that was far quieter.<br><br>And that stealth was now enhanced by the implementation of the ultra quiet drill, a procedure in which all non-essential equipment that would generate noise was turned off, everything that might rattle, fall, break or otherwise make noise secured, and all crew not necessary in the operation of the ship lie in their bunks and make as little noise as possible. Crew working moved about moved silently and carefully, and spoke to each other with hushed voices. The only item on the menu during ultra quiet was sandwiches, which didnÂ’t cost too much noise to prepare, and could be consumed quietly. The Alabaster was a black hole of silence in the ocean, as it crept forward silently, listening intently for anything out of the ordinary.<br><br>But too much stealth could be a drawback, for the ocean was a bath of natural acoustics, noise sources caused by biologics (biological entities) or seismic activity. And one of the methods that involved hunting an overly stealthy submarine would show up as a hole of silence in the waters that moved about occasionally. The Alabaster countered that by actively masking its acoustic hole with a carefully moderating recording of ambient ocean sound levels being emitted via the subÂ’s smart skin. The smart skin of the AlabasterÂ’s outer hull was a marvel of technology, containing Conformal Acoustic Velocity Sonar (CAVES) arrays and various other sensors, dispensing with the maintenanceÂ–intensive traditional hull sensor arrays that required extensive rigging. The advanced skin of the submarine acted as one gigantic underwater sensor for it, acting as passive and soars, and even a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) array, giving the Alabaster unrivaled sensor ability and coverage which was further enhanced by its more conventional systems like the towed array.<br><br>The mission was simple, infiltrate the Prussian straits ahead of the SENSE fleet, and take out any Prussian targets that presented themselves, with subsurface targets as priority. It was a mission Ravi was confident the Alabaster and her crew could accomplish, with spectacular results.<br><br>Ravi was told to expect the Prussian 4th High Seas Fleet and possibly more, plus a rag tag addition of whatever Prussian ships from badly pounded fleets that no longer existed. But save for the Prussian annihilation at the Sea of Fuchs, the Prussian subs were still relatively intact, and that was all Ravi was told. Force Integration and information sharing was starting to catch on the surface navies, but it was another underwater. Besides having regular updates on battle situations and intelligence through the radio, the subs worked on a lot less ready information then surface units, technology not yet being able to transmit the required amount of data to underwater sources efficiently. The Xing Shianan subs had to rely mainly on their advanced sensors and their Commanding Officers, which had to make the best of whatever information they received from the surface.<br><br>But that was probably why Hunter Killer SSNs like Alabaster worked along, though sometimes they did work in packs. On this mission though, the Alabaster was going in with a sister sub, the XSS Bethlehem some seventeen thousand yards abreast on the port side.<br><br>Â“Conn sonar, we have new contacts, bearing 010 and 005, designate Masters 22 and 23,Â” The sonar operator reported. Â“Range 68,000 yards, looks like we found our Prussian subs.Â”<br><br>Ravi grinned. He had been tracking the noisy Prussian surface elements for a long time now, which was streaming around at flank speed heading out to engage the SENSE fleet which they had detected on coming in on their radars. But his main targets were the Prussian submarines. It was time to move into action.<br><br>The Alabaster carried Mk 96 ADCAP-D torpedoes, which had twice the range of the Prussian Mk 48 ADCAP. In addition to superior speed of eighty knots, the Prussian weapons did sixty at best.<br><br>But it was no time to be complacent, the Alabaster currently had the advantage, and Ravi intended to use it to its full advantage. At his command, the Alabaster increased speed and started making maneuvers to gain more sonar information on their targets.<br><br>Â“Conn sonar, we have addition contacts, bearing 015 and 013, designate Master 24 and 25. Masters 22, 23, 24 and 25Â…Â” The sonar operator paused. Â“They are Prussian Virginia SSNs sir, blade count indicates theyÂ’re doing about twenty five knots, headed straight our way.Â”<br><br>The Prussian submarines were moving along with the surface fleet as they charged down the Prussian Straits towards the Alabaster and Bethlehem, using the noisy surface fleet to mask their own sonar signatures. It worked, to an extent. But had they known about the capabilities of the Alabaster class sonar abilities, they would have been better of lurking around on ultra quiet. They never got a chance to learn that tip. The noise of the surface fleet drowned their own capable sonar suites and they never heard the Alabasters already targeting them.<br><br>Another twenty minutes passed, the fleet was about 40 nautical miles away from them, well within the ADCAP-DÂ’s 80 mile range.<br><br>Â“Generate firing solutions on Masters 22 to 25.Â” Ravi said. Â“Rig ship for depth charge. Prepare tubes one through four for electrical firing. Open the muzzle doors when ready.Â”<br><br>At that command, the TMA operator worked to compute the optimal firing solution while the weapons crew primed the ADCAP-Ds for the firing. The tube was pressurized to outside pressure and the muzzle doors open, exposing the weapons to the outside sea. The torpedoes would be fired electrically, swimming out of the tube on their own power rather then usually being launched nosily out via compressed air. They were just a step away from firing.<br><br>Â“Firing solution ready.Â” The Target Motion Analysis operator announced.<br><br>Â“Very well, match generated bearing and fire tubes 1 through 4.Â” Ravi gave the order to shoot. The Otto fuel engines of the torpedoes came to life, powering their pump jets and they swam out of the tubes, spearing at a leisurely rate of 20 knots through the waters of the Prussian Straits.<br>Â“Tubes launched sir, units are running normally.Â” The weapons operator said.<br><br>Trailing a fine guidance wire, the ADCAP-Ds swam towards the approaching fleet with a combined speed of 45 knots. It took about the good part of an hour for the units to meet the fleet, traveling over 40 nautical miles. They had not detected it until it was too late.<br><br>Â“Torpedoes have acquired targets.Â” Reported the weapons operator. The ADCAP-Ds had found the enemy submarines with their own sonars and no longer needed to be guided by AlabasterÂ’s fire control system via their guidance wires.<br><br>Â“Cut the wires, shut the outer doors, and reload tubes one through four.Â” Ordered Ravi.<br><br>The ADCAP-Ds powered up to full attack speed and bore down on their targets at over eighty knots. The Prussian Virginias detected the now-extremely noisy torpedoes, got off hasty snapshots down their bearing with their own weapons, and turned tail to run, zig-zagging and popping off decoys and gas generators in an attempt to fool the torpedoes homing on three times their speed. It was futile; the ADCAP-Ds ignored the countermeasures entirely and bore straight into the hulls of the Prussian subs.<br><br>Â“Conn, sonar, multiple explosions, bearing 010.Â”<br><br>They could hear the sounds of the dying submarines as they strained their reactors, their rapidly spinning screws trying to fight the downward pull of water it entered their ruptured hulls. It was futile. Not too long later came the screeching of steel as the viselike grip of the Prussian Straits crushed the pressure vessels of the Prussian subs as they sank below their crush dept. Their desperate return snapshots, fired in the thick of their own fleet all fell short. Worse, one found a friendly target, a destroyer, and destroyed it.<br><br>Ravi was satisfied, another four more kills for the Alabaster. The Bethlehem scored a few minutes later, downing another three submarines, two of them the ones Ravi had damaged in the Sea of Fuchs, their damaged screws making the noise of a gravel truck as they tried to run from the torpedoes. The two Alabaster subs spent the next few hours sowing panic amidst the Prussian fleet as they fired torpedo after torpedo at them, going for the anti-air elements like the Aegis cruisers, effectively removing them. The Prussian fleet launched anti-submarine helicopters and pinged the area with active sonar on full, but the submarines were already moving away, having done their part. The Prussian fleet had lost its submarine and aegis support, and it was to get worse.<br><br>As they headed towards what they could see on their radar as the SENSE fleet consisting of Shingapooru fleets, they came under missile attack and air attack from the undetected Xing Shiana Task Force Greg Paul hiding some distance behind the Shingapooru fleet. The Prussians had been lured into a trap. Lacking their aegis systems and outranged by the Xing Shiana missiles and aircraft, plus Shingapooru carrier aircraft. The Prussians tried their best to make it within their own missile launch range, charging through the kill zone of cruise missiles and planes, fighting all the way. It was useless, the Prussian 4th High Fleet plus the rag tag additions were set aflame. Losing over two hundred ships without even making it halfway near enough to launch their own weapons, so effective was the SENSE attack that they took not a single casualty. As they sailed past what was once the Prussian fleet, they picked up survivors. There were not many, so sudden was their destruction that few had chance to abandon their ships. The firepower being put out by SENSE forces five times what was used in the Battle of the Sea of Fuchs. Only 360 Prussian sailors were rescued, a staggering 43,000 plus Prussians lost their lives in the last desperate attempt to stem the tide. The Prussian navy was finished.<br><br>The Prussian Straits now belonged firmly to SENSE, the Pronamdy supply line reopened again. Fresh numbers of supplies, troops and instruments of war started to pour in within twelve hours of the naval victory, and their number rapidly grew.<br></div>
