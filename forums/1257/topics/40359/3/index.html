            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Message to SENSE War Council</strong><br><br>From: George Wong, Prime Minister of Singabolah<br>To: SENSE War Council<br>Subject: War on Reichland &amp; Prussia<br><br>Gentlemen,<br>Over the past few days we have seen massive mobalisations by various nations in SENSE, most recently from Reichland, following the unprovoked attack which killed the Crown Prince.<br><br>Gentlemen, I come to you not to appeal for either Reichland or Prussia, but for peace. For the last ten years, the region has known nothing but strife and suffering. Thousands have died, in misguided attempts by nations trying to assert dominance over others. Their crimes are indeed terrible, I agree, but the countries involved in these imperialistic adventures have already been punished enough.<br><br>I understand the torment that the nations under the Prussian military jackboot must have experienced, but do not forget the horrific veneagnce unleased upon them. Prussia was completely crushed by that great alliance of nations which now presides over this council. Let the blood shed by their soldiers to liberate the occupied territorites be a testament to that great alliance.<br><br>My friends, I know that I speak as a mere upstart, for Singabolah is but a small subordinate power in this region, not having experienced fully the horrors of war. But if that is any qualification to speak, I will take it. So far, Prussia has not attempted to attack us in anyway. All they desire is peace and brotherhood among all nations. Who are we to deny them that? Their power has been greatly reduced, and they pose no threat to us. The actions they have taken are the rights of any sovereign nation.<br><br>And has Reichland tried to harm us either. Their recent activation was due to our own babarity, when we showed the world how vengeful and how unable we are to comprehend how foolish the consequences of our actions can be. We haved carved out the very heart of their leadership, mudered his son. What more revenge could we ask for?<br><br>I propose, gentlemen, that we deploy and hold for a defensive campaign. With our larger troop and equipment numbers, as well as our superior firepower, we can well afford to absorb a first strike. They on the other hand, will lose not only massive amounts of men and machinery, but also the moral high ground. Then, we take the war to them.<br><br>Please consider these proposals, gentlemen. Although I will only have marginal power to affect the ultimate descision, I trust that you, the esteemed members of the Council, will choose the best course of action for SENSE to take.<br><br>Yours Sincerely,<br>George Wong<br>Prime Minister, Republic of Singabolah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Reply to all Germanic Nations in SENSE region </strong><br><br>Do not attempt to distance yourself from the crimes of the Prussians, cowardly and despot leader Andreas Kaiser. It was your country that pledged military support for Prussia during the war (only to pull out after Xing Shiana pounded your country into the dust) and harbored those who had committed terrible atrocities in 440mHz and against the rest of SENSE following the war. In doing so you have sealed your own fate by abetting and abiding those who have committed serious crimes against humanity. Do not attempt to deny these accusations, they are written all over your country and people in blood.<br><br>The death of your son is deserved, you are now paying for the children you have helped take away by supporting Prussia. And more justice shall find the Germanic people for their crimes against other and they shall pay bitterly for their just desserts.<br><br>I propose a war of annihilation against the Germanic states if they do not surrender unconditionally to SENSE forces and resist. Let every man, women, child and animal be put the sword, for they have stained themselves to be an accursed people.<br><br>Bartan Chen<br>440mHz defence minister.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Xing Shiana Speaks</strong><br><br>As far as Xing Shiana and most members of the war council is concerned, the current Germanic states are now considered as hostile regimes. While we would still extend humanitarian aid to their civilians where we can, we will no longer tolerate the existence of this regime.<br><br>Singabolah, while well meaning, lacks experience in knowing the true nature of the Germanic regime we are now facing, experience we have learned from fighting, and defeating the enemy, sometimes on his own terms. The current Prussian regime holds little regard for Â“brotherhoodÂ” with us, and is only waiting for the time to come when it is right for them to arise again and bring tyranny and oppression to the people of the region. The Xing Empire understands the lack of experience Singabolah and other new nations have in the Germanic regime, and hence has ignored and forgiven their misguided rudeness and anti-Xing Shiananism, and misplaced sympathy with the Germanic regime.<br><br>The incursions carried out by Xing Shiana had been carefully considered, and only resorted to when it has become apparent that the Germanic nations had no intention of recognizing Xing Shianan authority and power in this region, for they knew that this was one nation that would not be fooled by itÂ’s apparent new Â“soft pacifistÂ” exterior when it comes to dealing with SENSE. Make no mistake, the Germanic regimes have no sincere intentions to be at peace with SENSE, and are only awaiting for the right time to strike. At that time, while I am certain that SENSE will always prevail, allowing them the first strike would mean that some of our people will inevitably have to die from the Germanic first attacks. At as an organization, we take care of our own first. We as SENSE will not, I repeat, will not fail and lose our people because of our soft stance with a covertly hostle and militaristic Germanic regime. Better them then us. The Germanic regime has no intentions of brotherhood with SENSE, they are a racist and fascist, who describe themselves in their own literature (which they distribute to their people), as the superior race in the region.<br><br>That is why The Xing Empire has opted for a tough stance with the Germanic states. Their supposed speeches of peace and brotherhood with SENSE are entirely incompatible with their racist and Aryan supremacy leanings.<br><br>The Xing Empire is a multi-ethnic sovereignty with a healthy mix of Chinese, Indians, Irish and other minority people, many of which have fled from oppression in their original homelands and come to The Xing Empire for the very reason they know that it is a nation which will protect them and give them a future by being a strong and sensible nation which is eternally vigilant to anything that might threaten them and their allies. In these days, the militaristic, racist Germanic nations have proven themselves to be the antitheist of The Xing Empire, and this great nation has always triumphed over this degenerate foe of a regime, as will it do now.<br><br>Make no mistake. It is those brave pilots who launched themselves straight into the heart of Reicheland to send the Emperor a personal message from the Xing Empire who are the true heroes of freedom and true peace. A peace not built on insane and blind tolerance to those who are blatantly hostile to us, but a real peace in which everybody can have a future undisturbed by the reckless ambitions of the Germanic regime. Those brave military men and women who have planned and carried out this raid in a bold strike for freedom have earned their rightful decorations and are Xing Empire heroes.<br><br>Let Duke Ryan and Emperor Andreas get this message loud and clear from Xing Shiana: The game is up, it is time for you all to completely disarm and remove yourselves from the regional scene. For the Xing Empire will no longer tolerate the presence of such a regime that goes against everything this great nation stands for, freedom, equality and a future for all, that all men are created equal. For this time the strike was from an unarmed supersonic aircraft that led to the unfortunate, but deserved death of the Reichen Crown Prince, the next incursion will not be so restrained.<br><br>The endgames for the regimes are here.<br><br>Matteus Tyrannus Tan<br>The Xing Empire Representative to SENSE<br></div>

The most warning they had was a slight scrape in the gravel behind them.<br><br>Â“Tango down.Â”  Was the refrain over the encrypted LOSIR network.<br><br>Sixteen Reichen perimeter guards were now dead.<br><br>The dark clad figures that had caused their demise looked inhuman and robotic in their high technology equipment. They were the special ops of SENSE, the elite of the elite. The twenty men involved in this operation had come ashore following insertion from a Xing Shianan submarine 48 hours ago, and made their way up to the capital via the Lautern river, that ran through the city to the sea. The men had not eaten or rested since they had left the submarine, but a combination of superb physical conditioning and training and Â“goÂ” pills kept them sharp.<br><br>They were a multinational mix of Xing Shianan and 440mHz soldiers. This would be first mission the mHzen deep cover special ops, trained by Xing Shiana following the war, were on. The operatives were all decked out in Xing Shianan technology, from the improved spec ops Land Warrior system they were using to their futuristic XMP-5A Objective Individual Assault Weapon, essentially a miniaturized OICW on submachine gun caliber.<br><br>The operatives split out into two teams of ten each, and entered the base. Blue team cut the fiber optic communication and power cables leading into the base, plunging the base into darkness and creating the a black hole of information from which the Reichen garrison would take a while to figure out what was happening. That was the point where the clock really starts ticking and all the hours of preparation for this mission is distilled down into a few nerve-wrecking minutes.<br><br>0 seconds<br>Blue team fans out and holds the perimeter, making sure nobody gets in or out. Red team approaches the main building. Three guards found and neutralized.<br><br>25 seconds<br>Red team enters the main building in pitch blackness.

Seven more Reichens personnel are neutralized.<br><br>55 seconds<br>Red team makes their way to basement 4, subsection 6, having known the route in a building they had never been as well as the back of their hand thanks to advanced Xing Shianan pre-mission virtual reality simulation. Five more guards are neutralized in the process. Red team locates package. Up above, Blue team is involved in a quick firefight with confused Reichen responding units that leaves over twelve Reichens dead and many more wounded, having never spotted their adversary.<br><br>2 minutes 30 seconds<br><br>Exfiltrate, mHzen and Xing Shian spec ops regroup as one team and leave the compound with the package before additional Reichen units can arrive. Claymore mines set on perimeter will later claim four more Reichen personnel. They approach the river, and start making for the coast.<br><br>5 minutes 45 seconds. Xing Shianan cruise missiles arrive at the base, exploding submunitions and FAE warheads strike main facility in the area, along with secondary targets. 80 percent of base facilities destroyed. Final mission body count: 68 Reichen personnel liquidated and 122 wounded. SOF suffers zero casualties. A textbook perfect package retrieval.<br><br>51 hours later<br><br>Spec ops make it back to Xing Shianan submarine waiting off the coastline, the mission is declared a success and the men of the SENSE special operations finally get to rest after over ninety hours of non stop adrenaline.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Statement to "Accidental" Un-Humane Missile Hit on<br>Humanitarian Mission from SENSE Organisation</strong><br><br>"The recent missile hit on humanitarian mission launched by Reichen and Singabolah was unfortunately, a mishap due to Singabolah's and Reichen's error to know international territorial rules and others." says Speaker for SENSE Organisation, Lim Bah You.<br><br>"Though Singabolah and Reichen did contact SENSE War Council, but the main decision lies with <strong>SENSE Humanitarian Council</strong>, in which they had the power to stop War Council actions temporary for humanitarian purposes. The Humanitarian Council lies within the General Councils of the SENSE General Assembly too. Not only that, the transportation aircrafts <strong>did not enter SENSE airspace, but individual airspace of the SENSE nation, Xing Wena, in which they didn't get approval permission to enter.</strong>" continues Speaker for SENSE Organisation, Lim Bah You.<br><br>"Finally, from Xing Wena Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Velocis Rapper, said that <strong>the humanitarian mission aircrafts are able to get out from Reichland by the international airspace to Singabolah, why the heck Xing Wena's airspace to Singabolah? </strong>He says their warships had to fire at them for violations of airspace, as they may be spies. Moreover, there is hostilities between the Xing Empires and the Germanic Empires." ended Speaker for SENSE Organisation, Lim Bah You.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Xing Wena Offical Reply</strong><br><br>The reason their radar detected no ships in the area is simply because the Xing Empire fields a stealth navy, but they already knew that full well. In our current defense condition, XWN ships will not reveal themselves to enemy sensors.<br><br>What has happened is however, repeated low probability of intercept radio messages on multi-bandwidth has been beamed to the aircraft, telling them to buzz off or get shot down. But we got no response, and neither did we receive any radio message from the flight. This indicates two possibilities:<br><br>1.)	Flight 30Â’s radio system was not functional or too lousy, hence they were unable to communicate with SENSE ships.<br>2.)	Their long range communications had been dilebrately sabotaged by the Reichen regime themselves to make sure those planes would be shot down to build up sympathy for themselves.<br><br>The data following on the shoot down has been sent to an SENSE independent and impartial accident investigation team and has been verified authentic. We do not know what my have transpired on the Reichen side, but this is clear: We warned them repeatedly to buzz off or get their butts cooked.<br><br>Additionally, the SENSE war council have informed Singabolah government days before the incident that virtually all airspace outside Reichland has been declared no-fly to Reichen aircraft, leaving several corridors through which their refugee transports can safely commute, and told Singabolah to forward this information immediately. Either the message never got across, or the Reichens have chosen to ignore it for whatever reason. But the fact remains. They were in the no-fly zone for a good part of their flight, warned repeatedly, and were allowed over a good five minutes to respond before the crew in the fleet made the justified decision not to risk an unknown contact and to blast them into steaming bits all over the sky.<br><br>By the way, the planes that have been shot down have been awarded as Â“killsÂ” to their respective ships and crews told to keep up the good work and vigilance.

Prime Minister Wong has accepted complete resonsibility for the Reichen lives lost in the horrific tragedy.<br><br>"It was completely our fault... we did not respond in time to warn Reichland of the immediate danger... we should have provided escorts... we beg the forgiveness of the People of Reichland... we, Singabolah, can no longer hold our heads high, for we are barely above the level of mudskippers in a longkang..."<br><br>At this point, the distraught Prime Minister had to be led away to recover. In the meantime, a Spokesperson for the Office of the Prime Minister of Singabolah took to the podium for an immediate press release.<br><br>"The nation of Singabolah is deeply saddened by this terrible tragedy. That these innocent people were under the protection of the Republic of Singabolah makes it doubly more shameful. We take full liability for this accident, and offer our sincere apologies to Reichland for allowing this mishap to take place."<br><br>The most shocking news came, however, when the Spokesperson announced that Prime Minister George Wong would tender his resignation as PM tonight at 9pm.<br><br>"Due to personal reasons, Prime Minister Wong will step down as PM. We express regret over his resignation, and would like to thank him for the many years of faithful service that he has rendered to Singabolah."<br><br>In the meantime, the highest government post in Singabolah will be filled by Deputy Prime Minister Brigader General (NS) Lee She Lang, who will be sworn in tomorrow in Parliment.<br><br>"Do not worry, ladies and gentlemen, that no significant power gap will develop. Everything is under control," he assured.<br><br>When asked to comment on the Xing Wena action, the Spokesperson declined to give any clear statement.<br><br>"Now is not the time to assign blame... we are, of course, regretful over their actions... but, if in their position, I'm sure that our men would have done the same. We are not here to judge them."<br><br>The Spokesperson asked that future flights bearing refugees be allowed through the blockade.<br><br>"We are now appealing to their sense of honour, please permit them to cross. Your quarrel is only with their government. Why do you make their people suffer?"<br><br>When asked whether Singabolah will send its own planes or provide armed escort for future flights, the Spokesperson replied that it was too early to make hasty decisions.<br><br>"Nothing is definite yet. This being a delicate situation, we must tread carefully."</div>

"Singabolah is now asking for permission from the rest of the Security Council to allow Singabolah transports and and armed escort fighters to overfly the quarantine zone to evacuate refugees from Reichland. We are asking for this because we had made a promise to the Reichen government before the war to evacuate all non-combatants from Reichland.<br><br>"Please do not mistake our intentions. We are with the Allies body and soul, and would gladly commit our soldiers to help put an end to any tyrannical regime. But the word of a Singabolan is worth more than his life, and we will get every last woman and child out of Reichlnd."<br><br>PM Lee hopes that the SENSE War council will give approval for the missions. "It would be better if this was sanctioned by the Council. However, we are prepared to protect the good name of the Republic of Singabolah, if need be."<br><br>The Prime Minister also asked for Xing Imperial ships to restrain from firing on Singabolan aircraft. "Singabolah is not going to war with you. All we wish is to get those poor people out of there, before hell breaks loose.<br><br>"Now that we have announed our stand, we hope to prevent any further incidents," he said, referring to the tragedy several days ago in which three Reichen military transports bearing refugees bound for Singabolah were intercepted by Xing Wena naval units in the Sea of Fuchs.<br><br>Singabolah Airlines, the national carrier of Singabolah, has pledged aircraft to the humanitarian course. "We will render whatever neccessary assistance to the government to aid in the smooth evacuation of civilians from Reichland," a Spokesman for the airliner was quoted as saying.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Sea of Fuschs</strong><br><br>It was an odd collection of aircraft, at any rate. Six Boeing 747s bearing the colourful red and white markings of Singabolah Airlines and twelve RoSAF F-16XLs approached the SENSE no-fly zone around the Sea of Fuschs. They were all squawking green on thier IFFs, and as added protection, were holding a loose non-threatening formation lest they may be mistaken as military aircraft.<br><br>A RoSAF E-2C Sentry was up as well, lingering around the boundary between Singabolan territorial waters and the no-fly zone. The object of its unwavering attention was the Xing Empire fleet ahead of the formation. Convoy upon convoy of aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates and landing ships lay anchored off the coast of Prussia. Their decks bristled with AIM-7 Sea Sparrows, and their radar dishes swung around, searching for any sign of a possible intruder.<br><br>The flight of Singabolan planes porceeded to climb to 5000 ft, where they would easily light up the radars of the ships. Then, carefully, the lead F-16XL pilot eased back the throttle on his sleek delta winged fighter slightly, before proceeding to perform a lo-yo-yo manuver above what he thought was the Xing flagship. The rest of the formation held cautiously back.<br><br>Banking, he could already see VTOL X-35 Bobcats scrambling off the deck of the carrier. He made another pass over the behemoth, waving to the deck crew as he did so.<br><br>It appeared to the Singabolan pilot that the Xings had not entirely been expecting Singabolan aircraft to approach them for behind- not entirely their fault, though, as much of thier attention was now focused on the bombing campaign in Prussia. The F-16XL continued circling the carrier lazily, but the pilot was worried. He knew that if he were Prussian or Reichen, he would have been shot out of the sky even before he got a visual of the carrier.<br><br>The F-16XL was suddenly rattled by the jetstream of a Bobcat thundering close by. The tiny jet shook and shuddered as the larger X-35 began shadowing it from behind. It had probably been on CAP when it spotted the Falcon.<br><br>The Singabolan pilot chose this moment to punch up communication with the flagship. "Xing Shiana Navy, this is RoSAF Fighter SF1-22. Our squadron is escorting a flight of 747s into Reichland to commence evacuation of civilians. We request permission to enter no fly zone, over."</div>
