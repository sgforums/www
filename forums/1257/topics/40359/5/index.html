            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Raving Opposition Leader Screams for Extradition of Reichen Refugees</strong><br><br>10 May, 2009<br><br>Singabolah City, Singabolah (XNN)------ In a fiery, emotional speech in Parliment today Opposition MP Francis Siow Ting Tong demanded the immediate extradition of Reichen refugees in Singabolah.<br><br>"We have put up with their bloody nonsense for too long orready," he roared, foaming at the mouth. "First they riot, and now they are turning our ally against us! Everyday, we pay our hard earned money to support these chao buggers, and all they do to repay us is sit there and kiao kao yoh lum par! This is getting out of hand. I tell you, the People of Singabolah can not tahan this type of people anymore! Those Reichen pai kiahs have overstayed their welcome and its high time for them to balik kampong!!!" For emphasis, Siow began to pound the podium repeatedly.<br><br>According to him, letting Reichen Empress Sharon into the country was a mistake.<br><br>"Wah lau! What kind of idiot does Lee think he is?! Any how go and mm tzai si!? This time, sure kio tio goo lan wan!"<br><br>Siow was referring to the fact that Singabolah would be in for it if she offended her benefactor Xing Shiana.<br><br>At this point, Mr. Siow elapsed into a series of fits and had to be forceful removed from the building. Speaker of Parliment Abdullah Tamboogi then took to the mike to state that Mr. Siow's comments did not reflect the official policy of the Singabolah government. "Siow should not be taken seriously at all... in fact, we have reasons to believe that he is suffering from Tourette's syndrome, and should therefore be medically unfit to be a Member of Parliment."<br><br>"SEE??!!! Look how the government uses its police state against me!!!" shrieked Siow incoherently as he was dragged out of the exit.<br><br>Siow's speech echoed sentiments shared by many Singaboleans among recent days. "I think it would be best if we stopped acting too friendly with Reichland," university student Chao Mug Ger, 22, said cautiously to several reporters today. "I mean, seeing the current political climate, it would be unwise to go against the rest of SENSE."<br><br>On the subject of the refugees, Chao said, "I have nothing against them. I would prefer them to stay if they don't cause trouble."<br><br>Many of the interviewed, however, either refused to comment or said that they couldn't be bothered.<br><br>"Aiyah, all this is so far away," said unemployed worker Johari Salleh, 29. "Relac lah, brudder!"</div>

Janice was one fierce soldier. She was just 24 and quite a good looking babe.But she can really pack a punch,that's why she was assigned to be a personal guard to Empress Sharon.<br><br>"But Frau Janice,your men can't be armed!Our Special Forces will ensure the safety of Empress Sharon." The official was firm,pity he did not know what he was getting himself into.<br><br>"My DUTY is to do everything to ensure the Empress's safety," Janice pauses before taking a Usp Expert out of her holster and pointing it to the Singabolan offcial. "and anyone stopping me from getting the Empress's personal safety uncompromised will have to eat a bullet,JA?"<br><br>The trembling offcial signed the papers almost immediately.<br><br>"Vielen Dank!(thank you very much!)"<br><br>"And please ask Herr Jayapapaya to send more guards to us.Danke!"</div>

"Those SENSE infidels are condemned by God,they are stupid,they are stupid(dramatic pause)......and they are condemned."<br><br>When asked about the initial assessments of the Reichens on the SENSE military,he replied," Our initial assessments,as usual,is that they will all die!Well,most of them."<br><br>A reporter from the Singabolah Times asked the minister," Sir,what do you think of SENSE hostility?" The reply was ," They will die like the dogs they are on the walls of Kaiserlautern."<br><br>And with that the minister rushed off to another meeting.His parting words were," And Lastly,i would like to confirm that Xing Shiana is not worth an old Shoe."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>You win.</strong><br><br>From: Lee She Lang, Prime Minister of Singabolah<br>To: Andreas Kaiser, Emperor of Reichland<br>Subject: Alright, you win.<br><br>Your Highness,<br><br>After careful consideration of your request, the Government of the Republic of Singabolah has agreed not to commit Singabolean forces in any general invasion of Reichland.<br><br>As it stands, only Xing Shiana and 440 mHz actively support war on Reichland. Shingapooru has openly declared neutrality, while Pax Domainia remains undecided. Singabolah, as you know, will not partcipate unless the majority of the Council agrees on such. Therefore, we we feel that there are insufficent votes (two for, one against, two absentations) to warrant complete SENSE War Council committment to a war on Reichland, and have decided to withdraw all Singabolah contribution to the war effort.<br><br>Instead, the Singabolah Armed Forces divisions and air wings currently based in Prussia shall remain there to protect her in case hostilities commence after the 72 hour deadline. In addition, a further three divisions will be deployed to Prussia to reinforce the Singabolean prescence there. You can be assured that we will not allow foreign power to violate Prussia's sovereignty.<br><br>You must realise, however, that we can afford no direct opposition against Xing Shiana. Should they proceed to invade Reichland, we will not intervene. We will only act if Prussia is directly threatened.<br><br>Yours Sincerely,<br>Lee She Lang<br>Prime Minister,<br>Republic of Singabolah</div>
