            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Situation in Singabolah</strong><br><br>Within thirty hours of the first entry into Reichland, some forty sorties had been flown and around 13 000 Reichen civilains airlifted. A massive fleet of civil and military aircraft had been requitioned for the formidable task; from Singabolah Airlines Boeings to C-130s right down to Piper Warriors of the Youth Flying Club. They clogged all available air routes into the country, landing at whatever airstrip that had not been cratered by runway denial munitions.<br><br>The operation was progressing quickly. However, the population of Reichland (excluding all able-bodied men, who had opted to stay and fight) went well into the millions, and even if all the aircraft in the world were to be to Reichland, they still would never be able to whisk all of them away in the short span of time left. It is near impossible to carry out large airborne evacuations; it consumes too much fuel and saves little. It also carries political reprecussions as well, as the Israelis found out went airlifting Fashalas out of Ethiopia.<br><br>If only Prussian and Reichen aircraft could be released to help in the evacuation, then thier task could have been much easier. However, Foreign Minister Jayapapaya had advised Emperor Kaiser not to let any Reichen aircraft participate in the airlift, as they did not want a repeat of the Filght 30 incident. Prussia's air force had also been completely grounded. Despite its apparent willingness to help, SENSE panners were suspicious that Prussia would attempt to assist its Teutonic sister state should war break out.<br><br>The mission of the rescue workers was further impeded by the refugees that they were sent to evacuate; most were adamant to go and insisted on staying and fighting to death. Occasionaly, some patriotic Reichens would add to the confusion of the moment by breaking out into rousing renditions of 'Reichland Uber Alles' at irregular intervals. It took some coaxing on the part of the Singabolan pilots and crew to convince them to board the planes.<br><br>There were tearful seperations and farewells, as men saw their wives and children off, most likely for the last time. It was a heart rending sight, affecting even the surliest Singabolan Ah Beng on the rescue flight.<br><br>On departure from Reichland, the aircraft would turn and make for the Sea of Fuschs, where they passed through the Xing Shianan naval cordon unmolested. Much waves and friendly smiles were passed between the two sides, but the Singabolans were worried that the Xing Navy would 'accidentally' illuminate them on radar and send several SAMs streaking their way. They seemed very prone to making mistakes these days. As a guesture of goodwill, the Singabolan escorts carried only four Sidewinders each for self-defence, and allowed themselves to be herded by XSN X-35s through the blockade.<br><br>Upon arrival in Singabolah, the transports disgorged their human cargo, who were quickly ushered into buses at the airports. These brought the Reichen refugees to camps that had been hastily erected outside major cities to accomodate the massive influx of refugees. While not exactly five-star hotels, the camps were made as comfortable as the budget allowed. Each could hold up to two thousand internees. On arrival at the camps, the refugees were briefed in English and German on the current situation and the camp regulations. Thoroughly bewildered, they given their sleeping and food allotments before being released.<br><br>Most began immediately preparing to set up camp, or took advantage on the free handouts being offered by aid workers. A massive donation drive in Singabolah had taken place, but the results were quite disapointing, most Singabolans being a miserly bunch and suspicious of helping the tradional enemies of SENSE. Disgusted by their inactivity, several prominent members of the society had stepped forward to offer finacial help and goods. The work of these philantropists did not go to vain; suddenly, medical supplies, clothes, food and other sundry items were available to the refugees.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Singabolan government had made its decision. The 32nd Division, spear head of the Singabolan armoured forces, and the 21st Division, consisting of semi-elite Singabolah Guards units, would be deployed to Prussia to participate in an invasion alongside the forces of Xing Shiana, 440 and 220 MHZ, and Shingapooru should a war on Reichland be declared by the War Council. They would also stay for the subsequent peace keeping operations that would follow the fall of Reichland. In addition, a squadron of F-16Cs would be flown into provide air support to the Guards and the tankees. Singabolah would also provide behind the lines support, along with 440 MHZ.<br><br>When the Reichen refugees saw this, many were disgusted with the Singabolan government's apparent double standards. They were especially unhappy that they were now being incarcerated by enemies of their country. Rumbles of discontent rippled among the camps.<br><br>Meanwhile, ethnic Germans in the capital Singabolah City had emerged to stage peace rallies; these gatherings were quickly suppressed by Singabolan security services.</div>

Jayapapaya, Singabolah Foreign Minister<br>To: Andreas Kaiser, Emperor of Reichland<br>Subject: Empress Sharon<br><br>Your Highness,<br>You have my word that the Government of the Republic of Singabolah will do everything within its power to ensure that the Empress Sharon arrives in Singabolah safe and unharmed. You must realise, though, that whatever extraction operation we mount must be clandestine and carried out in the utmost secrecy, for I fear that the possibility of her being used as a political bargaining chip against you is too great a risk to be ignored. In addition, you would understand that should she be compromised, it would put my country into a somewhat difficult position, as it would be interpreted as collaboration with the enemy. Our General Staff is currently hard at work formulating a plan, but please understand that there are no 100% garauntees. Some situations are beyond our control.<br><br>In the meantime, please prepare Her Majesty and two attendants of her choosing for departure. If you would want any other member of the Kaiser family out of Reichland, we would be glad to assist you.<br><br>However, I'm afraid that this will be the last service that we can undertake for you, as war is imininent. I hope that you can understand this as well.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>J.B. Jayapapaya<br>Foreign Minister<br>Republic of Singabolah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Reichland</strong><br><br>At 11pm that night, another seemingly routine Singabolan humanatrian mission crossed the no-fly zone into Reichen airspace. It consisted of two Boeing 767s, a C-130 and two Republic of Singabolah Air Force F-15SI Eagles flying escort. To the uniformed or curious observer, nothing seemed overtly suspicious. However, upon closer examination, some details on the nature of the true mission would be revealed. Like how the Hercules was in actual fact not a Hercules at all, but rather a Spec Ops MC-130E Combat Talon for covert insertion/extraction work, and how the Eagles carried two extra drop tanks than usual, ECM pods and AN/ALQ-184 radar jammers.<br><br>Upon reaching the Xing Shianan naval blockade, the flight leader and the captain of a Xing Shianan DDG exchanged pleasantries before being waved through. A X-35 haloed the flight, carefully monitoring the activites of the rescue planes.<br><br>Little did the pilot know that he himself was under the scrutiny of another. An E-2C Sentry was orbiting the boundary between Singabolan and international waters. It made no attempt to conceal its prescence as it was, of course, impossible to hide from the superior Xing Shianan radar, not only from the ships, but also from land based stations in 440 mHz and the fleet's own AWACS. Also, being an allied aircraft, the surveillance bird hardly qualified as a threat, let alone a piority target, and was thus left more or less to its devices.<br><br>What it was monitoring was not the fleet nor its aircraft, but rather transmissions that would indicate that the mission had been compromised. On doing so, the Sentry would issue an abort order, and would scramble back to Changi Airbase as soon as possible.<br><br>By now, the flight had reached Reichen air space, Immediately, the two 767s broke off from the rest of the squadron and landed at wartorn Kaiserlautern International Airport to take on refugees. Neither of the two airliners' crew had any real indication what the military planes that had escorted them were really up two, but they quickly shelved these suspicions when they began loading passengers onboard. They had a job of their own to do, and had precious little time to do it.<br><br>The MC-130 and the F-15s proceeded to land at a military airfield somewhere outside the capital. Once on the ground, the MC-130 began disgorging men clad in black ninja gear and wearing night vision goggles, all of them cradling Uzis. They immediately fanned out and established a safe perimeter, much to the suprise and consternation of the ground crew.<br><br>The air traffic controller at the tower was about to ask them what the hell was going on when an even stranger thing happened. A black limo with flags on its bonnet represnting the Reichen Royal House pulled onto the tarmac. Two men in suits got out and started conversing with the leader of the commandos. At the same time, he received a phone call from the Reichen Ministry of Security, coldly informing him that everything he saw taking place on the tarmac never happened. The air controller took the hint and hurriedly went back to his work.<br><br>After a short while, three men left the Talon. They wore heavy overcoats and hats; a very odd appearance from people who supposedly come from a tropical country. The trio were ushered into the limosine by the two men in suits and the car burned rubber as it left the airfield, heading in the direction of the Royal Palace.<br></div>

Then, stopping himself, he said, "Uh, I mean, every possible route into and out of Reichland is covered.

This flight of 24 Bobcats would be the leading elements of a hastily assembled mission involving over fifty aircraft, flying anything from combat air patrol to electronic warfare support.<br><br>It was unlikely the aircraft they had now on their Low Probability of Intercept radars had any indication that Xing Shianan aircraft were so close to it, the Bobcats had been flying on strict radio silence and with their radar reflectors turned off, loitering around a large area in which they expected their quarry to pass on the extraction phase of their mission. Now the prey had arrived. Flying from above, the Bobcats swooped slickly to close behind their objectives, using the cloud for cover. They tailed the aircraft, unnoticed, until they reached a break in the clouds, it was time.<br><br>Â“Let them see us.Â” The flight leader ordered. The 24 Bobcats gunned to full military power, dumped their radar reflectors to maximum return, and split into four groups of six, two of which thundered past the unsuspecting aircraft they had been tailing and two of flank them while the last two tailed behind.<br><br>The aircraft they had been tailing, two Singabolah F-15 Eagles and an MC-130E Talon were effectively boxed in. They had taken the bait, diverting their flight path after thinking their mission had been compromised from falsified information. The resulting new flight path had taken them straight into the Bobcats which had been lurking in the area.<br><br>Â“This is the 122th Raptors of the XSS Holtz.Â” The leader radioed to the Singabolah aircraft as he parked himself off the wingtip of an F-15, looking straight at the startled pilot which stared straight back.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rioting Breaks Out in Reichen Refugee Camps</strong><br><br>12 May,2009<br><br>Tampenis, Singabolah(XNN)------ Fighting broke out today between Singabolan troops and Reichen refugees in several camps today following the Singabolah Government's agreement to hand over Reichens suspected of having vital military intelligence to the SENSE Security Council.<br><br>Singabolan troops had to use tear gas and water cannon to disperse frenzied Reichen mobs which appeared in force at the sixteen major camps in Singabolah. Amidst the chaos and the confusion, it is unsure how many are dead or injuired, although offical sources estimate three dead and 150 wounded.<br><br>"This is proof that no SENSE member can be trusted! These Singabolans are just nothing more than a lot of [Censored] hypocrites who made empty promises to us about a safe haven from those mad SENSE schweinhund, and then hand us over to their evil puppet masters, the Xing Shianans!" Hermann Fritz, 14, raved at reporters today. Fritz is an occupant of the Sunny Welfare Camp for Displaced Reichens, located outside the Singabolan city of Tampenis.<br><br>"We can not take this lying down! All Germans, Reichen and Prussian alike, must rise up now and overthrow the oppressive SENSE slavedrivers, before they destroy the Germanic race entirely! SEIG HEIL!!! REICHLAND UBER ALL-"<br><br>Here Fritz interupted by a Singabolan soldier wielding a baton, who promptly bashed his teeth out and dragged him off. One of his collegues, Coporal Boh Cheng Hu, 20, offered his opinion on the matter.<br><br>"Wah lau! I tell you ah, these [Censored] ang mohs really too much ah! We sayang them, give them food and let them stand there shake leg, but now see lah! I tell you, this is all the fault of the gahmen. So enthu, always want to bring in 'foleign talen,' now see what happen!"<br><br>At this point, Cpl. Boh was distracted by a Reichen who was in the process of a hurling Molotov cocktail at a soup kitchen. He ran over and began assualting the man with a table leg.<br><br>The Ministry of Home Affairs, who run the camps, has assured the public that the situation is well under control.<br><br>"There is nothing to be concerned about. The unrest in the camps is nothing more than a group of trouble makers trying to sow discord." a Ministry Spokesman said at a press statement earlier today.<br><br>It is not certain how much the riots will cause in terms of financial damage, but the political reprucussions are being felt already. Torn between its pro-SENSE stance and helping the Reichland, the riots have been a big setback for the anti-war faction in Singabolah Parliment, who argue that the riots were caused by the current administration indecisiveness in foreign policy.<br><br>"I tell you, Lee and his cronies have really [Censored] up this time," says hardline Opposition MP Francis Siow Ting Tong. "There is no such thing as peace with the Krauts. I say we throw in our sticks with the rest of SENSE and go hantham them back to Germany!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Errr, the MC-130 and Eagles are still on the ground, waiting for Empress Sharon, but nevermind.<br><br>Following the severe electronic lashing given to them by the Xing Shianan EW aircraft, the E-2C limped back to Changi with severly wrecked equipment and an unconcious crew member who had been on air monitoring radio signals just before the bombardment. As the plane touched down, the captain swore to himself. Their mission had been a failure, and The Xing Shianans had outsmarted them. Now, there was nothing they could do but leave the Eagles and the Talon grounded in Reichland. There was now no other option for Singabolah to avoid an international incident other than to hush up the botched operation, meekly toe the line and join in the war with Reichland.<br><br>However, there still was a shred of hope left to get the Empress out of Reichland. The captain just hoped that his flash message had gotten there before they had been taken out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Heist</strong><br><br>Near Changi Int Airport<br><br>The rubber tires of the black limo exploded into squalls of rubber as 5.56mm rounds from the Xing Shianan spec ops OICWs ripped into them, a .50 caliber round from the team sniper punctured the engine block and jammed the cylinders of the expensively handcrafted engine. The limo went dead, but still had sufficient velocity to skid on its metal rims, throw up a shower of sparks before hitting the airport expressway side rail and flipping onto its side.<br><br>Those events threw the motorcade into chaos, metal ground on metal as the escort vehicles swerved to avoid adding to the disaster. Smoke grenades mixed in with vomit and super tear gas tossed into the mix did little to assist them. More sickening crunches on metal played out, to be followed by the sounds of groans, gagging and vomiting when the all that metal finally stopped.<br><br>Emerging from their ambush positions like specters, the Xing Shianan operatives clad in full SIPE gear and gas masks fanned out to rapidly establish a perimeter around their ambush positions, using their thermal sensors to see through the long-lasting, vomit-inducing fog. But there was no resistance, all the people involved were busy spending their time curled up in a fetal position in a puddle of their own vomit, with tearing eyes pinched shut and noses running copious amounts of mucus. But the operatives took no chance, they made sure everyone of them had the bead of an OICW on them.<br><br>Â“Crap look at this, I hope all this doesnÂ’t start anything badÂ…Â” One of the operatives remarked as he used his boot to swipe a discarded uzi awat while looking at the black-clad man lying face up before him and hanging half in and out the wreck of his car, with vomit running out of his mouth and onto the rest of his face. The partially digested food matter matted the hair thickly to accumulate in thick drops before dripping off to a sizeable puddle on the road. It was a vile sight.<br><br>The squad leader nodded, the Singaboleans were on their side but this time their paths had to cross badly. None of them died in this encounter and most of them didnÂ’t look too badly hurt either, and he was sure that they would have given his men some trouble, had they resisted if it they hadnÂ’t all been non lethally smoked and gassed. They should recover in an hour. He motioned for his team to continue their mission. They went up to the flipped limo and extracted the Reichen Empress, who was a mess of blood, vomit, tears and mucus, though nothing had been permanently damaged. They dumped the unconscious Emperess into the back of a nondescript civilian car they had stolen, gathered the rest of the team in other similar vehicles, and drove for the coast.<br><br>They reached it without incident and dumped the vehicles, and quickly moved to establish a perimeter on the beach as their extraction units arrived, a flight of four Little Fox helicopters, which had arrived practically skimming the waves to avoid radar. The squad piled themselves and the Empress onto the tiny choppers and dusted off, heading for a nearby Xing Shianan destroyer that had moved in close in stealth to operate the choppers just for this mission.<br>Fifteen minutes later it was all over, Empress Sharon had been extracted and now in Xing Shianan hands in a covert ops mission that started by submarine insertion twenty hours ago into Singabolah and ended on board a Xing Shianan destroyer. It was time to gather some intelligence.</div>
