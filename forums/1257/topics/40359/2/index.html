            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Compromise</strong><br><br>Hold on, gentlemen. Remeber that our real enemy is the Malaysian government, not each other. We cannot afford to indulge in petty infighting amongst ourselves.<br><br>I believe that the best route to acheive a settlement is through diplomacy. We cannot allow the same mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. We must allow Prussia to come away from these negotiations with pride and dignity.<br><br>I suggest the following compromise:<br><br>1) Prussian missiles shall not possess offensive missiles systems exceeding the range specified by Xing Shiana.<br><br>2) Prussia shall not engage in WMD research.<br><br>3) Prussia will maintain an army of 1% in proportion to the size of its population. The army will be expected to be an all-professional force. Conscription will not be allowed. At no point in time should the army's manpower exceed the 1% cap limit. At this point in time, Prussia can have a standing army of 1.3 million.<br><br>4) Prussia shall not attempt to acquire any form of offensive missile artillery system (MLRS, BM21, etc.) It can be allowed to keep 155mm artillery, provided the range does not exceed 30km.<br><br>5) Prussia will be allowed to keep armoured divisions in the ratio of 1 Armoured/Mechanised division to every 5 Infantry divisions.<br><br>6) SENSE inspectors will be allowed total access to any part of the Prussian military/research complex, if Prussia is suspected to have violated any of the above agreements<br><br>7) The Prussian Navy will be allowed 100 surface combatants, divided into 2 fleets. It shall also be allowed to operate diesel powered submarines. SSN/SSBNs are strictly prohibited.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Prussia shall not be allowed to keep dedicated bombers with ranges exceeding 2000km (payload) w/o mid-air refuelling. Under this category falls heavy bombers such as the B-52 or Tu-16, and supersonic/stealth bombers such as the B-1 and Tu-142. However, Prussia can be allowed to possess medium-range strike bombers such as the F-111 and Tornado IDS, in addition to multi-role fighters which can perform in the strike/interdiction role.<br><br>In light of the recent tragedy, I further propose that a no-fly zone be established around Prussia's borders, to prevent future accidents.<br><br>I hope the following proposal is acceptable to all parties. Let us stive to obtain a peaceful resolution to this conflict and prevent it from degenerating into senseless violence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Soft Riposte</strong><br><br>The flight of Bobcats and JSFs slowed to three hundred knots when they neared the boundary of SENSE airspace with Reichland. At twenty thousand feet with clear skies and broad daylight, the pilots could see far into the country and even further with their AWACS support. Now it was the time to crank up things to be little dicer.<br><br>The JSFs and Bobcats deployed their radar reflectors, lighting themselves up to Reichen radar as they dived for the ground in a typical ground attack flight profile. The JSFs and Bobcats dumped chaffs and countermeasure decoys as they swooped to 10,000 feet, having entered Reichen airspace by over two kilometers as they pulled out from their dives. The fighters lit up their LPI radars and launched more chaff and countermeasures along flares, giving Reichen sensors of all typesÂ’ juicy targets to acquire. At that same time, the JSFs engaged their advanced ECM pods to full power, jamming Reichen radar and communications with electronic snow. They streaked even lower, now at eight hundred knots and supersonic. It was clear that this was now an incursion.<br><br>Reichen fighters that were in the air punched the afterburners and blasted down their vectors the moment the Xing Shianan aircraft turned up on their scopes. In the Reichen airbases, more pilots scrambled to aircraft as word quickly got around on a impending Xing Shianan air strike. Ground defenses searched for targets, but the picture was confusing enough thanks to the jamming and countermeasures that they would not have any chance of firing on the aircraft unless they were right on top of them. And the Xing Shianans were keeping far away from them, flying incursion profiles to minimize exposure to antiaircraft fire.<br><br>Then, as abruptly as it has begun, and fifteen kilometers into Reichen airspace, the Xing Shianan fighters made an abrupt about turn and made a supersonic dash for SENSE airspace, with over twenty Reichen aircraft hot on their heels, but a little too far and too late to catch up. The Xing Shianan aircraft reached SENSE airspace with time to spare, where additional units of over thirty Xing Shianan aircraft made their presence known to discourage Reichen pursuit. The Reichen aircraft milled near their border, flying frustrated patterns over their coast as their pilots waited for additional orders, knowing that trying anything even slightly hostile would probably end in disaster for them.<br><br>But the incursion was not quite over yet, two Bobcats, staying dark and stealthy had separated from the main group when the incursion had started, and they had used the resulting confusion created by the other flights to penetrate deeper into Reichen territory. Hugging the ground and blasting through the air at over nine hundred knots, the pilots flew their plane past startled Reichens civilians and military alike as they rushed past their positions trailing a sonic boom in their wake. Nearby air control crews had no warning, and no time to react at all when the Bobcats literally flew into their faces and out of in a matter of seconds.<br><br>The Bobcats slowed to high subsonic and screamed into KaiserLautern, the Prussian capital, swooping low over the rooftops, shaking the occupants of nearby buildings with their engines and jet blast as they bore straight for their target. They reached it ten seconds after entering the city limits.<br><br>Nosing down until they were just a frightening two hundred feet about ground level and literally flying in-between the buildings, the Bobcat pilots punched their afterburners and were pummeled into their ejection seats by gee forces as the Bobcats rapidly accelerated to just under the never-exceed-speed for this attitude. Blasting straight down at their target at just over one thousand knots, they dropped a rapid fire sucession of flares as they screamed over the Royal Palace at supersonic speed-<br><br>Every single window and glass object on the expensively decorated Palace and the surroundings imploded into a sudden blizzard of flying glass particles as the sonic boom trailing behind the Bobcats snapped through the grounds of the Royal Palace like a whip crack. The flares released from the Xing Shianan aircraft were also traveling at near the velocity imparted from the aircraft as they thudded into the Palace grounds and the building itself like cannon rounds, burning brightly. One of them found the giant ten meter Reichen flag hanging down the front of the palace and blasted through the thick cloth to embed itself in the expensive marble war behind. The flag started to burn nicely. The chaos transcribed a neat line following the path of the Bobcats, who were by now almost safely out of Reichen airspace even before the stunned country knew what hit it.<br><br>Forty five minutes later, the two Bobcats returned to their carriers to deck crew that lifted them off their high-technology perches and carried them round, while Campaigne sprayed. The Soft Riposte Raid was over.<br></div>

Injuring over thirty and causing extensive damage to the Palace Grounds.<br><br>Â“I saw them come right over.Â” Said palace janitor Hans Shatienhousen, Â“The noise was incredible and suddenly there was broken glass and flares all over the place.Â” The janitor had bleeding ears from the roar of the jet blast and was cut by flying glass.<br><br>When XNN visited the Royal Palace, it was evident that the damage done by the jets, thought extensive, was mainly superficial. Every single glass object near the palace grounds had been shattered, including windows and street lights. The Royal Palace now holds a hollow appearance without it large windowns, with many potholes and burn marks made on its lavish marble exterior apparently by flares. The large Reichland flag hanging on the front of the Palace now hangs two smoldering pieces and the local fire department had just put out a small fire that started when a flare fell into a leaf pile in the palace grounds.<br><br>Confused and stunned people milled around as paramedics tried to gather them for medical attention, some just stunned by what had just happened and some with having being cut by flying glass.<br><br>Among one of the injured was the ruler of Reichland, Emperor Andreas Kaiser who was rushed out unconscious to an ambulance surrounded by bodyguards, some of them injured themselves. The Emperor was bleeding from the nose and the ears, and had been badly cut all over the body, especially the face.<br><br>Â“Those Xing Shianans knew their stuff.Â” Said a bodyguard who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that his name would not be revealed, Â“ They made their move with him as their main target, and they managed to cause the most injuries to him. They even knew when to attack, which was during his afternoon tea where he would be sitting in front of his office window to see Eva Gruber, the lady he intends to have solicit affair with, but not work up the nerve to ask walk by. How strange, an Emperor who is too shy to get what he wantsÂ…Â”<br><br>The bodyguard was taken away protesting at this point, by the rest of his colleagues.<br><br>The Xing Shiana government has announced a press briefing soon on the incident.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Xing Shianan Official Briefing on Soft Riposte</strong><br><br>Matteus Tyrannus Tan,<br>The Xing Empire Representative to SENSE<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen of the SENSE assembly,<br><br>As you are now all aware, there has been an incursion into Reichland territory by our aircraft that had been ordered and authorized by our government. This incursion took place today at 4:15pm, in a mission that we have named Â“Soft RiposteÂ”. The aim of this incursion is a direct, demonstrated response to PrussiaÂ’s stating of its official stance that it would not tolerate the presence of Xing Shiana as part of the SENSE coalition to enforce the armament restrictions on Prussia.<br><br>The incursion was launched from one of our Carrier Battle Groups in the Sea of Fuchs, and involved over forty aircraft. Twenty XF-35 Bobcat fighter bombers and  twenty three X-35 Joint Strike Fighters were launched on the mission. Six Bobcats and seven Joint Strike Fighters actually made the incursion into SENSE airspace. The Bobcats were involved mainly in providing fighter support while the JSFs were equipped with ECM gear to jam the enemyÂ’s sensor network. Besides air to air weapons on the Bobcats for self defense, no strike munitions of any kind were carried.<br><br>The intruding aircraft penetrated fifteen kilometers into Reichland as part of the operation to create confusion and throw the defenses off balance, as well as to divert them while two of the Bobcats went on a deep penetration flight to reach the capital. Upon reaching the city, the two aircraft did a supersonic over flight of the Royal Palace and Â“boomedÂ” the facility, as well as to drop several flares. The entire mission lasted forty-five minutes and all Xing Shianan aircraft returned safely.<br><br>Now, I must state clearly that the main objective of Soft Riposte is not a move in a campaign to invade Reichland or their affiliated state, but as a direct, demonstrated response towards the Prussian regimeÂ’s move to block Xing Shianan as being part of the coalition to enforce the armament restrictions on Prussia.<br><br>Our government has felt that engaging in verbal diplomacy with the Germanic states has drawn an unacceptable amount of stonewalling and stubbornness to the point that basic verbal diplomacy has been deemed impossible. While Xing Shiana has agreed fully to the compromise proposal reached by Singabola, it has felt that the move by Prussia to block itÂ’s entry into the coalition to enforce the armament restrictions as an unacceptable move that obviously demonstrated their contempt for Xing ShianaÂ’s central position in SENSE. Have determined that verbal diplomacy on such an issue would be laborious, and unproductive, after much deliberation and consideration of other options, the Xing Shiana government has decided that a more forceful show of our official position was needed, and hence the go ahead for this mission was given.<br><br>I hope that the Germanic governments will draw the proper lessons from this incident. Xing Shiana has been the most involved nation in maintaining security in the Prussian region since the close of the first war, and knows the true intentions of the government under its watch well, and has shown extraordinary restrain in dealing with them. This mission demonstrates that Xing Shiana is willing to use force, when necessary, to enforce the interest and security of SENSE.<br><br>Contrary to what the two Germanic nations might say, the Xing Empire has no desire to neither circumvent nor dominate SENSE or to annex their nations. Xing Shiana has always acted to the best of its ability to enforce the security of SENSE, and has no territorial ambitions. During the Prussian/Sense war, Xing Shiana rushed to the defense of 440mhz when it was under imminent threat of being taken over by Prussia. Xing Shiana, despite being the most isolated country geographically in SENSE, has rushed men and material during the war and poured its nationÂ’s sweat and blood defending the interests of SENSE, fighting in complete cooperation and looking out for the back of their allies in SENSE. Following the war, Xing Shiana did not occupy Prussia but instead helped in the rebuilding of the country with its resources and encouraged the people to live in freedom from the old Reynard regime and to govern themselves. It is unfortunate that a similar regime has managed to come into power in such a nation in just a short space of five years. Xing Shiana has no desire to dominate its neighbors or annex other countries, but merely to maintain security in this region.<br><br>There are extremely compelling reasons why this current regime has had extremely poor relations with Xing Shiana, and they go beyond simple prejudice and hatred. Xing Shiana played a very large role in the defeat of the old regime during the war, managing to check Prussian advances at almost every move, from the abortive attack with nuclear weapons on SENSE troops to the invasion of Malaya and 440Mhz and clearing the desperate naval blockade to ensure that the resupply of SENSE troops in Promandy area after the invasion of Prussia was possible, and finally using our advanced technology to sweep aside all Prussian opposition and end the war with minimum SENSE casualties. All these military victories led directly to the downfall of the ex-duke Reynard and the liberation of the Prussian people. Unfortunately, the current Prussian regime is ruled by the son of Reynard, and as history goes, he will not give Xing Shiana an easy time to maintain security in the region. And if anything else, history has shown that it is Prussia who has a penchant for militaristic gains and Xing Shiana that has always held up the interests of SENSE to the absolute best of its ability.<br><br>If Xing Shiana is not part of the coalition to inspect and enforce the restrictions in Prussia, the loss would be great. Without the advanced intelligence technology of Xing Shiana, enforcing these restrictions in Prussia would be next to impossible, holding back Xing Shiana from playing a part in enforcing these restrictions will allow Prussia to literally rearm right under our noses to become a threat to us again, as Germany did in World War 2. Already their Germanic regime is becoming increasingly xenophobic and militant, wanting to claim, in their own words, their Â“rightful birthrightÂ” and Â“superiority of heritageÂ” and Â“fruits that are so rightfully oursÂ” referring to other sovereign and independent states, states like 440mhz and countless others in which Xing Shiana has fought so hard over the past 5 years to make sure remained safe from the rising threat of a alarming rise of militancy in Prussia. Xing Shiana, along with Eziiumi-shi were the founding nations of SENSE, and hence it makes no sense for Xing Shiana to act outside SENSE interests or to dominate SENSE, for whatÂ’s good for SENSE is good for Xing Shiana.<br><br>The objectives of todayÂ’s non-lethal missions are to announce to all those in the two regimes who still have any hidden intentions and hold the Xing Empire as enemies that there is no where to hide and no where to run from the right to justice and freedom, and security from the region. I seriously encourage the government of these two regimes to stop antagonizing Xing Shiana, and force it to move its hand against them. For today we have demonstrated that we are not on a campaign of half-measures to maintain peace in this region, and will act to the fullest of our ability to make sure everyone in SENSE can grow up safe. Being the Â“biggest kid in the blockÂ” it is our responsibility.<br><br>I now urge the governments of Prussia and Reichlands to reconsider their stances, and allow Xing Shiana inspectors as well as troops in under the agreed compromise proposal for all SENSE nations, lest we are forced to enforce these restrictions with more direct approaches that would be disastrous for the people of these nations. As todayÂ’s mission has demonstrated, Xing Shiana is perfectly capable of  dissolving any target it wants, even the top leadership in these two nations, and it seriously urges that the respective governments of these nations not to force relations to reach such a state, and to relent to the Xing Shianan demands for itÂ’s role in the inspections as well.<br><br>Thank you for your time.<br></div>

The doctors announced that some Â“radicalÂ” plastic surgery may be needed to treat the wounds to his face.<br><br>Despite the number of tragedies that have struck the royal family, many Reichens, despite their mourning and hostility towards Xing Shiana, have expressed rather pragmatic opinions on this event, apparently thinking as one Reichen civilian put it: Â“Â…to pull on an elephantÂ’s tail was to invite trouble.Â”<br><br>Reichen Army private Nicky Goering also offered another animal anthology when he was interviewed:<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s that way, when you play with the bull, sometimes you get the horn.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>From: George Wong, Prime Minister of Singabolah<br>To: Matteus Tyrannus Tan, Xing Ambassador to SENSE<br>Subject: Why!!!???</strong><br><br>Why, Mat? Why? There was no need to pursue this course of action. We had already forced Prussia to the negotiation table. They had accepted our conditions. We could have prevented more deaths. But because of this stupid, stupid action, all this has been in vain!<br><br>Our two nations have been friends since the arrival of Singabolah in SENSE. We could have never made it this far economically and politically had it not been for the Xing Empire. But you do realise, however, that we cannot associate with muderers (for as you have pointed out at the press conference, 'Soft Riposte' had been planned in advanced.)<br><br>Although the deaths of the Reichland Crown Prince may have not been intentional, the end result has brought nothing but shame upon SENSE. We have now earned the nicknames of 'murderers' and 'child killers' among the other members of SENSE. I say the OTHER members, for even as we speak, they are distancing themselves from the Xing Empire, and the Council in general, whom they see as collaborating with Xing Shiana in this henious act.<br><br>Know this, Mat. Instead of improving your position, the strike has only served to weaken it. For how can one be called a liberator when he takes innocent lives? I'm sure that you harboured no ill intention towards the boy, but even then killing him is no excuse to punish the sins of the father. (Or his grandfather, for Andreas Kaiser has not lifted his hand against SENSE up till now.)<br><br>I fear now that war is looming on the horizon. We will not shirk from it, but neither will we be the one to bring it about. Should Xing Shiana decide to proceed in this course of action, Singabolah will not stand in her way, but know this: Singabolah's men, and the rest of SENSE, will neither march nor shoulder a rifle in the name of tyranny!<br><br>Your loyal ally,<br>George Wong<br>Prime Minister, Republic of Singabolah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>mHzen official response </strong><br><br>The mHzen government sends its deepest condolences to Emperor Andreas Kaiser over the death of his son, but urges SENSE nations not to allow this incident to be overplayed by the Nations under Observation against the unity of SENSE. It is our governmentÂ’s view that the action was taken against their country was justified.<br><br>As a victim of Germanic invasion during the SENSE/Prussian war, 440mHz knows full well what the current regimes of the two nations are capable of, and what they intend to do. We are not impressed or convinced at all at their apparent proposal of Â“peaceÂ”, having seen the amount of deceit contained in their politics, where they once tried to frame and invade Pax Domina, followed by Malaya (now 220mHz and Free Malaya) and finally our country itself.<br><br>This strike on Reichland had not been taken unilaterally, but was handed down and discussed by the four nations most responsible for NO security and affairs, Pax Dominia, 440mHz and Xing Shiana. Due to the limited window in which the strike had to be launched, we were unable to contact the Eziiumi-Shi authorities, but a vote of 3-1 abstain was sufficient. The go ahead to strike was ultimately called by Xing Shiana but it had been agreed that this strike has taken place for the best interest of SENSE, and that is long term security and peace by strictly enforcing the regulations with a real show of determination, and not a short term peace based on Prussian and Reichen deceit.<br><br>440mHz pledges its full support behind the Xing Shiana government on taking a firm stand on Prussia and Reichland. Reichland should learn the right lessons from this tragic incident and stop trying to resist Xing Shianan moves to enforce security in this area but abide unconditionally to the proposal as set forth, part of which includes the inclusion of Xing Shiana in the team to inspect the nations.<br></div>

It has nothing to do with it. Just last month, our economy was rated as 'Reasonable', a step back from the previous fisical year, when it was 'Very Good.' Therefore, we must choose our hardware carefully. We found out that the F-16XL was not suitable for our needs, so regrettably, we had to cancel the order.<br><br>"We have a good understanding with the Xing Shiana Armed Forces. Of course, the recent incident has strained ties a bit, but we will remain allies and provide each other with assistance whenever requested."<br><br>When asked, Minister Tham said that the death of Prince Kaiser was 'unfortunate' but he urged the other members of SENSE to 'remain calm.'<br><br>"Please, don't respond too quickly to this terrible accident. Knee jerk reactions will get us nowhere, and will only serve to increase tension in the region."<br><br>The Republic of Singabolah Air Force (RoSAF) had been seeking 50 of the highly advanced F-16XL fighters, manufactured in Xing Shiana. As of this date, twelve have been delievered.<br><br>Minister Tham stated that the remaining order of 38 planes would be fufilled by less advanced and cheaper F-16C jet fighters, to be purchased from "other sources", in addition to a further batch of 42, bringing the F-16 fleet to 92.<br><br>At the press conference, Minister Tham also outlined the future purchasing strategy. "We hope to be able to create a small but efficent force capable of protecting our sovereignty and national interests."<br><br>It is speculateded that DSTA, the largest arms manufacturer in Singabolah, is seeking a contract to license build the F-15E Strike Eagle in Singabolah under the designation F-15SI. Minister Tham, however, denied these rumours.<br><br>"Our equipment will be selected according to our needs," he was quoted as saying.<br><br>When contacted, the Xing Shiana Defence Ministry could not be reached for comment.</div>

Jayapapaya demanded stubbornly.<br><br>"His Royal Highness will not speak to anyone,' scowled the guard. An ex-Jaegar, he had fled Prussia after the First War and now served the Kaiser Royal Family with a devotion befitting of his ancestors. He was slightly repulsed by the short, balding Indian Singabolan who now stood before him.<br><br>Jaya, however, was not one to be kept waiting. "LET ME SEE THE EMPEROR, SONNY BOY, OR I WILL WALLOP YOUR HEAD OFF AND EAT IT WITH CURRY!"<br><br>"At once, Herr Jayapapaya!" Shaken, the man unbolted the door and let Jaya through.<br><br>The sight was shocking. The once proud Emperor of Reichland, Andreas Kaiser, was now crawling around his bedroom on all fours, butting his head occasionally against pieces of funiture. He was attired in a regal purple bedrobe, a far cry from his physical appearance, now shrunken, bloodshot, and unshaven.<br><br>"Your Highness," said Jaya, removing his hat as a sign of respect. Andreas paid no attention to this gesture, and continued crawling around.<br><br>Jaya took a deep breath, and then began. "Your Highness, I come to you with a matter of grave importance.<br><br>"Important? What could be more important than my one and only son?" the Emperor moaned. He began banging his head against an expensive teak chair in despair.<br><br>Jaya had no time for his antics. "Listen, Your Highness," he spat. "In several hours the War Council will convene in Xing Shiana. They will pass a resolution calling for war on Prussia AND Reichland, and it WILL most certainly be approved. Our diplomatic corps are doing all that they can, but we cannot postpone the inevitable.<br><br>"I beseech you, sir, to abadicate. Order your army to stand down and your people not to resist SENSE military forces. War will only cause more suffering for your people. For all our peoples. Singabolah will give asylum to you and your family, as well as to the Grand Duke Adelbert and the Royal House of Prussia. We hope that you will take up this offer.<br><br>"Sir, we are sorry for the loss of your son. We are equally sorry that we confused you with Grand Duke Adelbert in our press statements. But we have to look to the future. War will bring bloodshed to the people of Reichland. Surely you don't want some Reichen mother to suffer the same loss as you did?<br><br>"I await your response," Jaya finished, seating himself on an armchair nearby, and praying to the godess Kali that he would leave the room alive.<br><br></div>

You killed your son, not a government that has been up to not extraordinary patient with your dastardly antics and attempts to play SENSE nations against each other with your crocodile tears. I am not impressed. If anything, we in 440mHz are disappointed that Xing Shiana did not use harder force to bring upon you and your house the retribution you so deserve. If anything, your actions have proven that five short years of freedom had done nothing to change the attitudes of your leaders and people.<br><br>If anything, I should know how it feels like to lose family members to unjustified incursions. I lost two of my brothers, a cousin and a son, daughter and niece to the Germanic Prussian invaders in the defense of 440mHz against your disgustingly arrogant actions against my state that showed you callousness to mHzen life. Who are you now to come and plead sympathy for your loss? So you have reaped in blood, shall you sow in blood. Xing Shiana has paid you back for your sins, justice has just started to be served, and it shall find you no matter what crevice you may slither into and hide. May this great nation of the Tyrannosaur continue to bring you to justice, for the time has come.<br><br>May you continue to lose more of your loved ones, then you shall know the true scope of the atrocities and horrors your racist and arrogant people have inflicted on other people first hand on your very people.<br><br>Bartan Chen<br>440mHz defence minister.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The mHzen appeal to SENSE nations </strong><br><br>Xing Shiana has started the ball rolling to bring the Reichland to justice. And I appeal to the SENSE nations to step behind the brave and righteous men of this nation who are brave vigilantes out to right a wrong that was never addressed when Reichland cowardly pulled out of the war and harbored escaping Prussian war criminals, as well as to work in cooperation to bring them back to power. Xing Shiana now has an ally in this great quest to finish off what that was not completed in this war, and that is to bring swift justice to Reichland and the people who support her regime. With the current Germanic regimes around, there can never be peace and security. Close your ears to their accursed pleas and put everyone of them who has supported their authorities and hope to see them repeated when the situation is in their favor to the sword.<br><br>Only then can we have true peace, not some poor political parody of the word that exists only to allow the current Germanic Regimes to persist and survive like a malignant tumor to the peace and sovereign of all. The surgery must be carried out to destroy such a blight upon humanity and only then can we have true peace.<br><br>Bartan Chen<br>440mHz defence minister.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Replies to MHZEN: </strong><br><br>Has your memory failed you.Reichland had no part in the offensive against 440Mhz.There were no Reichens at all in the war!And now you speak of crimes i have not done?If i am a hypocrite then you are a liar!If indeed your hatred is true,then you are a racist who will stop at nothing to see the Germanic people dead!For in your replies,i quote"I lost two of my brothers, a cousin and a son, daughter and niece to the Germanic Prussian invaders in the defense of 440mHz..." Now you have admitted yourself that you hate all Germanic people because in the first place i am a Germanic Reichen,not Prussian!<br><br>Have you got your facts wrong or you just want to see bodies of the Germanic race?<br><br>Signed,<br>Andreas Kaiser<br>Germanic REICHEN</div>
