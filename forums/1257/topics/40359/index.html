Reports have also stated that a new post-war Prussian army is being trained, reportedly by veterans of the previous war, some reportedly wanted for war crimes but having fled Prussia before SENSE took over. The Germanic states have also stated their intention to be independent of SENSE jurisdiction once again, announcing that they did not have to answer to SENSE for what they did within their own Â“sovereign bordersÂ”.<br><br>The recently installed leadership within Royal Prussia and Reichland, Grand Duke Ryan and Emperor Andreas Kaiser respectively, returned seven months ago following the rejection by popular approval of the SENSE installed government. They have been noted for their moves to make their countries a sizeable military power again, against all SENSE regulations and have been noted for their increasingly hawkish stances on the Â“royal birthrightÂ” of their people, on which they failed to elaborate.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Xing Shianan Proposal for regulations for Prussians Rearming In Disastrous Error (PRIDE)</strong><br><br>It has come to the attention of SENSE that Prussia is intending to rearm so that it can be self-sufficient in the area of security.<br><br>Let me reiterate that the term of Â“self sufficiencyÂ” when it comes to Prussia, is a loosely defined phase. If anything, we can tell from history that Prussia Â“self sufficiencyÂ” in security apparently means being able to flex its military muscle along with fulfilling its territorial ambitions, as we all saw from the last Prussia-SENSE conflict.<br><br>Also, the current regime of Prussia is one that has interests that are not compatible with SENSE. With the dissolution of the SENSE temporary government a few months back, it appears that the Prussians have installed a dangerous regime back again. While this new regime appears to talk peace, its real intentions are nowhere near peaceful. As a matter of fact, the current dictatorial ruler, the miniature Grand Duke Ryan is the son of the disposed ex-duke Reynard, whose body the intrepid and elite Xing Shianan conventional infantry flushed out of FredrickBurgÂ’s sewers along with thousands of cowering Jaegers. In effect, the installation of the son of Reynard back to the throne means that the old regime is effectively back in power, and one can easily see that their ambitions remain the same, though thanks to SENSE, now they do not have the guns.<br><br>Even before the talks for the rearming of Prussia has begin, Xing Shianan SIC has gleamed conclusive evidence via EINT that Prussia and Reichland are already making military moves against SENSE. They have sent spies to multiple sensitive installations and Reichland is apparently manufacturing weapons (with Prussian labor as help) at an increased rate under the guise of arming themselves when a large part of that arsenal will actually be transferred to Prussia. All these moves are obviously unacceptable.<br><br>But SENSE is a reasonable organization, so we have taken several solid steps to make sure everything is in accordance to regional stability. As of such, the Xing Empire proposes that these restrictions will be slammed down on the Germanic nations of Prussia and Riechland when it comes to them rearming:<br><br>1.	Prussia cannot acquire missiles of any kind that exceed 20 kilometers in range.<br>2.	Development of weapons of mass destruction is banned, and even any research in that direction will be met with serious consequences.<br>3.	Prussia cannot maintain an land army of no more then 500,000 individuals.<br>4.	Prussia must only have defensive weapons, as of such, MLRS systems are banned, and their arty guns cannot exceed 105mm in caliber.<br>5.	Prussia must not maintain an armored force of more then two divisions<br>6.	Prussia is banned from researching any advanced technologies, as are countries from sharing such technology with them.<br>7.	Prussia must allow SENSE arms inspectorsÂ’ full access to every part of their country.<br>8.	The Prussian navy must not exceed two fleets to a maximum total of 54 surface combatants. Surface combatants cannot exceed 5,000 tons displacement each.<br>9.	Submarines are to be banned. Prussia cannot have any.<br>10.	Prussia cannot acquire an air force more of that which is required to defend. Large military strike aircraft like bombers are banned.<br>11.	Reichland must follow all these rules as well. In addition, the military equipment and technology it has amassed until now must be destroyed or disbanded immediately until they meet these requirements.<br><br>If any of these restrictions are broken, SENSE will be at the liberty to respond with whatever measures it sees fit. Not coincidently, it is the Xing Empire that has been tasked with SENSE to deal with Prussia firsthand, so it will be for ours to respond, though we strongly encourage the whole of SENSE to work together towards eliminating any threat of Prussian PRIDE.<br><br>These are the restrictions that we propose that SENSE look seriously into. Slamming such rules onto the Prussians so caught up in their PRIDE will prove to be healthy in the long run for everybody, in SENSE and Prussia.<br><br>Matteus Tyrannus Tan,<br>The Xing Empire Representative to SENSE<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Xing Empire Responds</strong><br><br>This is not a threat, but be aware that Reichland survived the first Prussian-SENSE war because of Xing Shianan restraint and sufferance. Let this be a warning.<br><br>Firstly, we are aware from eint that Riechland has close connections with Prussia, and part of that relationship also involves the military.<br><br>Xing Shania Strategic Intelligence Command has ample reason to believe that even if Prussia abides by the arms restrictions, they could still use Reichland as a Â“proxyÂ” to build up their forces in Riechen territory till they reach sufficient mass to ignore the disarmament treaty. They will later acquire conveniently these forces and use these on whatever despot intentions they have. (Note their last ambitions plans had them trying to drop neutron bombs on SENSE troops)<br><br>From that every SENSE nation can see that if Reichland does not abide by the disarmament treaty, Prussia will still be able to arm herself. That aside, intelligence knows that ReichlandÂ’s ideology is also explicitly racist and expansionist, treating SENSE with contempt. They will not hesitate to annex SENSE if they had the ability to, and their close ties with Prussia means these two countries will always work together against us.<br><br>If Reichland does not follow these regulations, it would be akin to filling a hole in a dam but leaving another open. The threat of Germanic militarism will still plague SENSE. I seriously advice Reichland to observe the treaty to avoid unfortunate consequences.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>International Incident</strong><br><br>Â“My goodness, there must be nearly seventy of them up in the air.Â” The wingman remarked as she eased her Bobcat lower in the formation.<br><br>Â“True enough. TheyÂ’re flying CAP, just like us.Â” The leader observed. Their flight of four XF-35 Bobcats was cruising at twenty three thousand feet, two hundred miles off the coast of Riechland and safely in SENSE territorial waters. The planes were flying Â“lights outÂ”, without their radar and relying on eint and an AWACS bird fifty miles behind another ten thousand feet up. Their Electronic Warning System had been extremely active for the past half hour, warning the pilots of the radiated energy of hundreds of Reichland ground and airborne search radars that were sweeping the area, looking for anything out of the ordinary.<br><br>Not that they would have must luck in finding them anyway, the pilot noted. The XF-35 was smoothly contoured and built with stealth in mind, with the form of every surface and system considered to give the Bobcat as small as possible a radar signature as possible. The idea was, that the Bobcat did not exist to the enemy at allÂ… until it wanted to make its presence known, that is. Microwave radiation from the Reichland radars pounded the sleek fighters relentlessly, and was deflected off on harmless vectors or was absorbed through the complex dielectric composite Â“smartÂ” skin as was converted into electricity, ironically, to add to the charge of the BobcatÂ’s batteries.<br><br>The Reichland forces had some Â“stealthyÂ” or Â“low-observableÂ” aircraft as well, such as the F-22 raptor or the JSF ripoffs of which designs they copied and build in their countries, poor parodies of the original. But the Xing Shianans are still very far ahead of the Reichens in such warfare, and their Â“stealthÂ” aircraft were found almost as easily.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve got five bogeys headed your way.Â” The AWACS operator told the Bobcats, Â“They must have detected something from us.Â”<br><br>The wing leader was not surprised, the Reichens were extremely nervous and would investigate anything even slightly ambiguous or analogous on their radars. They were still quite far away in terms of ability to pick out the Â“lights outÂ” Bobcats, but they would have probably picked up some strange and faint readings on from the AWACS LPI radar and had gone in to investigate.<br><br>Unfortunately they were moving out of Reichen airspace, at least in the eyes of SENSE. Since the first Prussian-SENSE war, SENSE had maintained that Reichland would not be able to fly any aircraft beyond its borders, anything beyond considered SENSE international airspace. However Reichland had never accepted that restriction and claimed that all areas within 200 miles of its borders would be its airspace. It was an issue that was sidelined and never gotten around to much conclusion, being left on the political backburner following the recent governmental changes in the Germanic states and resulting militarism.  Though neither side suspected it, this issue would have to be decided by force. Now the five Reichen aircraft, a flight of Su-30 high performance fighters were well within SENSE-defined airspace and on a rapid vector of the AWACS aircraft. But they were still technically not enemies.<br><br>Â“Okay, IÂ’ll hail them.Â” The wing leader said. Â“Rest of you stay dark.Â” He set all his weapons controls on except for the master arm, the weapons one step short of being ready to shoot. In anticipation of the possibility of air to air combat maneuvering, the computer moved the advanced ejection seat to a more crouch like position to allow better tolerance of the Â“geesÂ”. Lastly, he selected the controls to turn on his radar reflectors which made him appear on the Reichen radars. They could detect him now. The rest of the Bobcats opened up the formation to allow flexibility in case of trouble and the two sides blasted towards each other with a combined closing speed of six hundred knots.<br><br>Â“This is the 25th Black Raptors of the XSS Holtz, Reichen aircraft, you are within SENSE international airspace, advice you reverse your heading immediately.Â” The Bobcat pilot called out on a general hailing circuit. There was silence.<br><br>Â“Repeat, Reichen aircraft, reverse heading immediately, over.Â” The pilot radioed. There was more silence, then a burst of static over the radio.<br><br>Â“It is our airspace you are in, SENSE scum!Â” The unfamiliar voice came in over the radio just as the EWS squawked a series of electronic tones warning that the Su-30s had locked their radars onto him. Another series of squawks warned him that there had been multiple AA-12 Adders launched and headed his way.<br><br>Â“Crap!Â” The pilot turned the radar reflectors off, triggered the master arm and LPI radar, and punched his plane into a vertical climb on full power while the computer automatically dumped radar reflecting chaff in his wake, attempted to blind and jam the AA-12s, and dumped noisemaker decoy that mimicked the radar and infrared signatures of the Bobcat, except much brighter and obvious.<br><br>At the same time the Su-30 pilots cursed as the Bobcat disappeared from their scopes, their missiles spearing into a confusing radar picture of jamming and countermeasures. The Adders all went wild, spearing through the Bobcat positions and beyond without hitting anything. Communicating frantically, they punched their burners to close to the last location of the Bobcat, hoping to get a shot with an Infrared missile or the cannon.<br><br>But the Xing Shianan Bobcats were already far ahead of the battle phase loop, two wingmen who had now moved to a good flanking position easily targeted the approaching fighters with their LPI radars and loosed three AMRAAM Bs at the incoming Reichens, the enemy detecting them only in the brief moment they opened their bay doors to release their weapons. It was too late. The targeted Reichens barely had time to react before the missiles slammed into them and blotted their planes out in the night sky in a spectacle of burning munitions and jet fuel as they plunged downwards with the grace of a broken leaf. Three down, two chutes.<br><br>Seeing the rapid destruction of their three wing mates, the remaining two Reichens decided they must have come up against a force of overwhelming numbers of undetectable Xing Shianan aircraft approaching on they raid. They turned tail and ran for their borders at full speed, screaming desperately for reinforcements and warning of an impending raid. The Bobcats smashed them both out of the sky with AIM-120 Bs where they ran. No chutes this time.<br><br>But it was not over, several flights of Reichen fighter aircraft had been now scrambled to fend off the supposed air raid while their entire nation was gripped in panic. They approached, then entered SENSE airspace on full power, charging into the dark night and hoping to get visual on the SENSE stealth aircraft so that they can engage manually. The four Bobcats exhausted their load of AIM-120s on them, and turned for home on super cruise, too fast for the Reichens, now less five more aircraft and low on fuel to pursue- not that they could detect them anyway.<br><br>The Bobcats returned to the XSS Holtz in the Sea of Fuchs twenty minutes later, having scored ten kills for no loss. The Reichen pilots never knew what they were fighting, nor from where the attackers had come, for both planes and ships could not be found on their sensors, but they knew such amazing abilities to stay hidden and punch hard could only be the work of Xing Shianan crew and technology.<br><br>Now in the midst of heightened tensions, there was an international incident to throw into an already volatile mix.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Xing Shiana Response to PrussiaÂ’s official stand</strong><br><br>We have read and carefully considered PrussiaÂ’s response to the terms set down for arms restrictions, and have concluded this shows blatantly that Prussia intends to create an army not just for self-defense, but obviously also to achieve their military ambitions to expand beyond other countries. Xing Shiana shall take apart their official stands for all to see with basic logic to expose their true colours:<br><br>Â“Prussian missiles shall be acquired according to the needs of the situation.Â”<br><br>This is obviously unacceptable, it blatantly puts the controls over the specifics of the missiles into Prussian hands. If they intend to hit other innocent states, whatÂ’s to stop them from saying that the Â“situationÂ” requires them to acquire 700km SCUDS? No, the specifications of the missiles Prussia aquires must rest firmly in SENSE hands. If not this would not even be considered an arms restriction.<br><br>Â”Prussia will not research or acquire WMDÂ”<br><br>Laudable rethoric, but history proves that SENSE has to be wary in this part. The Prussians obviously cannot be trusted.<br><br>Â”Prussia will maintain an army of 10 million to safeguard it's vast borders and land.Â”<br><br>This is nonsense. Even China with a population of 2 billion has no larger army then 2.5 million. Having 10 million blatantly refers to a force that is capable of engulfing and overwhelming other countries at will. The SENSE position stands, Prussia cannot maintain an army of more then 500,000. An army of 10 million is nonsensical, and Prussia better follow the SENSE rule lest we trim their ranks ourselves.<br><br>Â”MRLS will not find it's way to Prussia.But Prussians gun's caliber will not be fixed due to the technological advances of it's other enemies.Â”<br><br>No, the Prussian caliber of guns will remain at what is internationally recognized as a Â“defensiveÂ” caliber unable of useful offensive purpose, and those are guns not about 105mm. With advances in technologies, this yardstick can be raised, but that decision will rest solely with SENSE.<br><br>Â”Prussia's Armoured Force will be decided .IT is estimate Prussia's Armoured forces ratio will be 1:5 to the number of Prussian soldiers.Â”<br><br>Nonsense, this would mean Prussia would have about 2 million tanks in their army of 10 million. Barring the fact that no economy in the world cannot produce that many tanks, not even the soviet union, this is obviously a stand thatÂ’s to put Prussia in a position to have a offensive capability.<br><br>Â”SENSE inspectors will only be allowed to inspect parts of our weaponries.Â”<br><br>A moronic statement, if Prussia had anything to hide, they would obviously hide them away from such areas of inspections, defeating the entire purpose of inspections if they were to follow these Prussian-imposed rules. The inspectors will have full and complete access to the country.<br><br>Â”Prussian Navy will be 5 fleets.With up to 200 surface combatants.Submarines are to be part of the fleet to ensure the all rounded safety of Naval crews.Â”<br><br>This is obviously a fleet capable of offensive action. Even the US navy does not maintain that many surface combatants (177 SCs). Submarines are a weapon that can be easily used offensively (not that we cannot detect their hunks of junks) and will be BANNED. Do not build any, unless you want dead Prussian sailors.<br><br>Â”Prussian Air Force will be decided by the Prussian Defense Ministry.Bombers will be included to ensure Prussia can carry out offences while in defense of our homeland.Â”<br><br>Â“Offenses in defense of our homelandÂ” is an oxymoronic term, anyway, the Prussians can easily define anything as in the defense of their homeland, and that includes invading Malaya and 440mhz. Anyway this proves that Prussia obviously has offense in itÂ’s agenda.<br><br>Â”Prussia may research advance weapon systems and technology to ensure our defense force may be up to challenge our enemy's technology.Â”<br><br>Unacceptable, this means that Prussia could also research any technology that can be used in offense. They can only research technologies sanctioned by SENSE. Tinkering with anything else will invite a lot of trouble.<br><br>As we can see, Prussia is obviously not serious about defending itself, but is very keen on making their flaccid country and pride strong again by having military muscle to flex. This attitude has been obvious from the start ever since the vile, prideful but sadly unintelligent dictator Duke Ryan came to the throne. Prussia must comply to the SENSE regulations UNCONDITIONALLY and not their own.<br></div>
