            <div class='col-md body'>Mingug<br>0550 hrs<br><br>The F-16D Block 52J was not exactly the most ideal aircraft for the purpose in mind, but it was all there was. Four were configured for the high-altitude reconnaissance mission and scrambled from Changi AB twenty minutes after the first Reichen forces landed in 440 MHZ. Their objective was to gauge Reichen air defence missile/gun batteries reaction time and RRAF fighter scramble tactics. The Falcons were equipped with ELSIRA advanced jammers and ASPJ pods, a LANTRIN pod, two drop tanks, and two pairs of AIM-9Xs and AIM-120 AMRAAMs each for self-defence.<br><br>Once airborne, an E2C, which had already been aloft for the last half hour, provided ground mapping details to the F-16s via datalink. The F-16s took the long route to get inside 440 MHZ airspace, flying below radar detection along the coastal area. Along the way, four F-15s joined for top-cover.<br><br>From 10,000 feet, the Singabolean fighters could see the flashes and explosions on the ground. The flight of four broke into two elements of two each and went down for a closer look, while the Eagles orbited overhead.<br><br>No sooner had they dropped under one thousand metres when the first two Falcons were illuminated on radar by an entire company of Reichen Gepard flak tracks and a battery of Roland 3 SHORADs. The F-16s threat recievers had barely come online when a swarm of Reichen missiles and 35mm tracers rose from the eastern edge of the city. The Eagles, being higher up, had a much better chance at evasion. The F-16s had next to none.<br><br>The flight leader screamed frantic instructions over his VHF/UHF as two of the Falcons were blotted out of the sky. The second pair dodged the first wave of SAMs but accidently swung into the oncoming path of the tracers. One of the F-16s took a burst of cannon shells in the left wing, which tore away in the four hundred knot slipstream and sent both pilot and backseater plunging into a block of flats. The Flight Leader went to full afterburn and managed to escape by skimming west low over the rooftops. Heading out to sea, he was rejoined by the F-15s, and the escaping aircraft radioed the news back to Changi Ground Control. Already, there were twenty SEAD F-16s sitting on the tarmac at Changi, loading up with heavy ordanance.<br><br>The next wave would be different.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Force Projection</strong><br><br>The Reichen Commander ducked in his command tent at the sudden crack of noise that shattered the ambience of the Mingug coast. In the corner of his eye, he could make out a falling column of sand and scattering vehicle parts that was a Titanium Storm carrier a moment ago. He turned his head instinctively to view the sight. There was nothing much left of it but scrap metal and two scattered bodies.<br><br>It had to be the MHzen artillery again.<br><br>The procedure for responding to such threats was well known, and well drilled into his troops. Artillery radars would back track the path of the incoming shells, locate the offending battery, and return fire with their own batteries to pulverize the attackers before they could scoot away, which they were undoubtedly trying to do now. He waited with baited breath the typical thirty or forty seconds it took for his own guns to respond.<br><br>Tension mounted as the seconds ticked by, which soon grew into a full minute. Still, the Reichen howitzers did not respond.<br><br>A thump that shook the ground beneath his feet in concert with an expanding fireball from a Leopard 2 with its turret roof bashed in broke the tension. Another thump, followed soon after, this time a rising geyser of sand that rained down broken bodies and body parts from what was a foxhole. The impacts rapidly grew in their frequency, building up into a crescendo within fifteen seconds that was unlike any kind of artillery bombardment ever. All about, explosions blossomed from dirt, sand and vegetation that rained down scrap metal and body parts. The commander barely had time to take all this in-<br><br>Â“What the hel-Â“<br><br>He never got the chance to finish his statement. Blasting down into his command tent at over 8 times the speed of sound, the hypersonic Airspike HLCM cruise missile lanced through the thin canvas to explode its small warhead directly within, reducing the contents of the tent,  including its commander, to basic components that scattered in the blast. The kinetic energy of the missile was so great that despite having expended its warhead, the main wreckage continued to plow over ten meters into the dirt.<br><br>Launched from over 3,000 kilometers away from continental Eurasia, the Airspikes themselves were tiny missiles by most standards, carrying a 20 kilo warhead. Relying instead more on pin point targeting, a stealthy design and a hellacious speed of nearly three kilometers via scramjet to dodge defenses and kill its target with sheer kinetic energy. In which case, the victims themselves were point targets such as foxholes, vehicles and field command structures.<br><br>Within five minutes, the first wave of 450 missiles have achieved an over 95 percent hit rate on their assigned targets, the Reichen landing party had ravaged. The presision targeting left MHzen troops nearby unscathed and they cheered as the missiles came down too fast for the eye to see to pound their enemy.<br><br>Surviving Reichen air defence crews rushed to their positions in the few SAMs and anti aircraft guns that have been left untouched. And realized that all of most their local air defense radar had been knocked out, leaving them essentially blind on their optical backups. Those which still had radar support found that the radar was essentially useless against the stealthy missiles. But the hypersonic nature of the Airspikes gave them a break.<br><br>Blasting through the air at over 2,900 meters a second, the Airspikes reinforced carbon-carbon heat shields of the missiles were blasted to furnace temperatures from the sheer air friction that showed up on the Reichen backup short-ranged IR scopes very well. The second wave of incoming Airspikes showed up on the scope fifteen kilometers away, giving Reichen gunners and missile crews a mere five seconds to react. Given the circumstances, they did the best they could.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Blasting through the air at over 2,900 meters a second, the Airspikes reinforced carbon-carbon heat shields of the missiles were blasted to furnace temperatures from the sheer air friction that showed up on the Reichen backup short-ranged IR scopes very well. The second wave of incoming Airspikes showed up on the scope fifteen kilometers away, giving Reichen gunners and missile crews a mere five seconds to react. Given the circumstances, they did the best they could.<br><br>But it was hopeless, the Airspikes themselves were at least thrice as fast as their SAMs, and actually faster then the AA shells they were firing at them. The Reichen gunners managed to get off a few shots, connecting with none before the second wave of missiles found them, and scattered them about the coast of Mingug with their equipment.<br><br>The Riehcen innovative Titanium Storm anti air system fared better, but not by much. Through the projectiles they fired were far slower then the Airspikes themselves, they spat them out at a rate of over two million rounds a minute that it formed a swarm of bullets for which some of the missiles flew into. The combined collision speeds of over eleven times the speed of sound was impressive, destroying several missiles in their incoming phase. But when the preprogrammed subroutines specifically designed to counter this threat kicked into the electronic brain of the Airspikes, the Titanium StormÂ’s effectiveness against them dropped dramatically.<br><br>Kicking into a bunch of erratic maneuvers and popping flares as they went, the Airspikes confused the IR sensors of the electronically fired gun systems, forcing their gunners to fire blind. Given enough distance, the Airspikes could actually maneuver to dodge incoming swarms of bullets, avoiding them entirely before diving for their launchers. Like pack of wolves, the networked cruise missiles separated, turned, and dove on the gun positions from all directions, making it impossible to completely defend from attack. By the time the second wave was over, the anti air systems of the Riechen Landing Party had been decimated, along with other secondary key targets, leaving the way open for the conventional forces of SENSE. The single attack of over 700 missiles in two waves had effectively put a large portion of the Reichen military in Mingug out of action.<br><br>Minutes after the last missile fell on Mingug, three Â“leftoverÂ” Airspikes from the attack selected a Reichen warship as their opportunistic target which had recently sunk a Singabolah submarine. Deliberately targeting and hitting the bridge, engine room seriously damaging the vessel. As it lay wreathed in flames with a heavy list, the first light of Xing Shianan next-generation force projection had fallen, without actually committing any of its citizens physically to battle.<br></div>

The captain ordered sternly.<br><br>The weapons-control officer flipped open the plastic switch cage and jabbed the torpedo autodestruct button, causing the Singabolean fish to explode directly in the path of the oncoming depth charges.<br><br>"All hands brace for impact!" the captain shouted as the collison warning klaxon blared throughout the ship and crewmen scrambled for cover.<br><br>The shockwave from the detonation hammered the Chiam Siong with the force of an express train, sending unsecured personnel and equipment spiralling onto the floor. The captain steadied himself, and said, "Sonar, begin transmitting the Battle Response Decoy programme now."<br><br>Immediately, the water around the Chiam Siong reverberated with the transmitted sounds of a sub breaking up: internal explosions, bulkheads collapsing, even men screaming. It was all pretty believable.<br><br>After a while, the noises ceased. Then, from Sonar...<br><br>"Conn, Sonar, Sierra Two has gone silent. They've stopped to run an asdic test."<br><br>"Weapons control, Conn, reload tubes one and two with Harpoons," The captain ordered softly. Radiating calm and professionalism, he turned to the dive control officer and said, "Make my depth two-zero metres. I want to set her up for an aft shot."<br><br>The men on the bridge could not help but smile. "Aye sir!"<br><br>The Chiam Siong began an upward descent towards the Reichen warship...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Migug</strong><br><br>The Republic of Singabolah Air Force struck at approximately 0745 hours on the 11th of July. The plan called for a simultaneous attack on 10 Reichen airfields, in accordance with the concept of breaking the enemy's air strength first and then turning to ground support. The time was carefully chosen as being the moment when the Reichens would least expected to be blitzed. Dawn, yes. Later in the morning, possibly. But 0745 (MHZen time) was neither one thing nor another, and, as a result, the majority of the Reichen pilots and ground crew were either breakfasting or running odd jobs around their base.<br><br>The attack was carried out by virtually every strike aircraft that the RSAF could muster, supported by ample fighter protection. The ground attack relied on F-16s, F-15Es and F-35s, with Eurofighter Typhoons flying top cover. The attacking flights flew low and fast to avoid detection by Reichen radar, but, as they approached their targets, they climbed so as to become visible on the radar screens. This was a deliberate maneuver, timed so as to give the Reichen aircrews just enough time to run and board their machines but not enough for them to take off. Thus the pilots would be trapped and wounded or killed in their machines when the attacks took place.<br><br>The first waves of Singabolean fighters met virtually no opposition; many anti-aircraft batteries had already been taken out by the Xing Shianan Airspike bombardment, and the only Reichen aircraft to be encountered were four F-22s on CAP. These were promptly shot down. Nine of the target airfields were struck within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, each being subjected to three or four passes in which cannon fire and rockets destroyed virtually every aircraft on the ground. This accounted for most of the aircraft, which, since they were parked wing to wing on their airstrips with no attempt at concealment or dispersal, were an ideal target. The tenth field, Tamago, was shrouded in mist and the Singabolean pilots had trouble finding it. Finally running out of fuel, the aircraft gave up and returned to Singabolah.<br><br>One of the surprises also unfolded by the Singaboleans was the employment of Â‘concrete dibberÂ’ bombs to disrupt airfield runways. This was a special bomb with a heavy pointed nose, fitted with parachute brakes and rocket motors. Once released, it fell through the air for a predetermined distance, after which a parachute deployed to slow its flight, allowing it to turn in the air until it pointed downwards. At this point, the rocket motors ignited and the parachute was released, which resulted that the bomb was now propelled straight into and through the concrete apron of the runway. It passed into the ground underneath and detonated, producing an earthquake effect which ripped out enormous slabs of concrete and left massive craters in the runways. Some of the bombs were fitted with delay fuses so that they came to rest in the ground but did not detonate for three or four hours afterwards. This normally coincided with the arrival of repair crews, who were vainly trying to fill in the craters. The effect of the explosion of the delayed action bombs was enough to send the maintenance men running for their lives. Naturally, they were then reluctant to approach the runways until they could be sure that they were clear of bombs, which meant that the Reichens could undertake very little effective repair work for the next several days.<br><br>As the first wave turned and made for home, so the second wave was coming in, with some 10 minutes separating the two attacks. The perfection of the organization was such that, as the second wave struck, the third was well on its way, with the fourth taking off and the ground crews awaiting the return of the first. This, on arrival, was refueled, rearmed, and turned round to become the fifth wave, striking some 50 minutes after the first attack. This pattern was kept up for four hours, by which time almost every plane in the Royal Reichen air force in 440 MHz was damaged or destroyed. The RSAF had lost a bare 7 aircraft, with ground fire accounting for 4 kills.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rise Of The Titans </strong><br><span class="small">*by 440Mhz*</span><br><br>Wong sat in the corner of the armoured warehouse containing the new Merkava Mk 4 tanks. The mHzen top has decided to phase out the rather obsolete Leopard II and T-72s from its ordnance. With his MSG-90 anchored limply on his shoulder, Wong retrospect all that has happened over the short period of time. The rise and fall of the lousy Reichland Â… and itÂ’s rise again. Being that very menace of the society and thorn in the flesh. CanÂ’t they have some peace at all? Wong cursed in his heart. The low rumbling sound that resonated throughout the warehouse broke his train of thoughts at he looked up to catch a glimpse of the Mk 4 in action.<br><br>Containing a crew of 4, the Mk 4 can also support a total of 8 units including the tank crew. New developments on its specifications brought this menace to a dangerous new level. Having a 10 ready-to-fire round microprocessor installed was conducive for the smaller mHzen army compared to its brethren in SENSE. Its capability to move and fire at the same time proves it to be a lethal killing machine on the field of battle. Moving at speeds up to 65km/h, the Mk 4 was THE machine for the mHzen Land forces. But then, the M1A2 Abrams still remained a novelty to the MLF, proving itÂ’s worth in many instances in combat. So far, only 15% of the total Abrams of the MLF has been totally destroyed in fierce counter fire with 35% of them being damaged but still repairable.<br><br>Wong look intently as Chinooks flew in from the horizon of the setting sun to bring in troops. Mobilization didnÂ’t give him pleasure and Wong sure wasnÂ’t a hedonist, that idiot Reichland never gave anyone peace. Wong cursed again, not only the devil that was tormenting the armies of SENSE, also for himself for being alive. HeÂ’d wish that he was pretty much dead now, life didnÂ’t mean anything more than survival of the fittest, that Darwinian theory didnÂ’t mean much to him either and Wong grimaced at the reality of life that faced him point blank now. The pungent odour that permeated his camo was getting into his head, he needed a bathe, and sniper training wasnÂ’t any pleasant either. Proning in places where any average human wouldnÂ’t not think twice at that, but Wong wasnÂ’t human anymore. The hard facts of war were more of theory lessons to him rather than anything else, he had given up all emotions and feelings that encompassed a normal homo sapient, but he wasnÂ’t a any sapient now, he was just another instrument of warfare, an individual capable of inflicting serious damage to unsuspecting squads. Wong struggled to get up, that muscle ache at his left side didnÂ’t help any much than to hinder his movement in combat. He had to see his medical doctor soon. Wong smiled wryly as he remembered the very first time he saw the medical doctor who looked like a rabbi or imam. He remembered his incoherent rambling and the soliloquy he was given. It would be more debilitating mentally for Wong than any physical improvement after that appointment. But Wong had to get his body in shape.<br><br>The volatile nature of Reichland has caused Baruch to throw out a full-fledge mobilization exercise, in phases though. He wouldnÂ’t risk his people cursing and protesting at his doorstep for taking away their loved ones. Phase 1A was for the full-time clowns of the MLF who now are greenhorns in battle with each company replacement rates at 175%. Baruch stared blankly at the orange horizon that was now lit by the setting sun. He could stay put forever, just staring at the sun, but in time the sun will set and the moon will emerged, thatÂ’s what it is, in time, lives of thousands of young men will be put on the line again. Fighting for a cause that was a life imbuement from young, protect the Motherland. The offensive on Mingug was another benchmark in WongÂ’s life as he reminiscence the death of many of his comrades that day, holding back the lousy Reichland forces, Wong cursed again, though, not in anger or rage but rather in a paradox of feelings. He better learn how to stop cursing though, wonÂ’t do any good to his faith, Mother Mary might get angry. Wong glanced at his watch, 1845 hours. He had another hour before being dispatched as reinforcements to stop the onslaught of the Reichland forces. Maybe he should turn hedonist instead of keeping his covenant of not smoking and trying his best not to sin in case heÂ’ll spend a long time in purgatory Â…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Spitfire </strong><br><br>Wong caught sight of the Merkava Mk 4 rolling akin to the transport truck he was on. In another 1 hour, the counteroffensive of Mingug would occur, attempting to push the Reichens back to the sea, where they came from. Wong smirked at the thought of putting a bullet in a Reichen soldierÂ’s head, but that had to wait. As the 101st Armoured Mk 4 regiment approached the eastern side of Mingug, the 27th Mk 4 regiment alongside with the 25th Light Crack Infantry to route the town from the northern side Â… creating a pincer maneuver that was favoured by the Germans in WWII. Wong grimaced at the tactical change, not a very good idea but heÂ’d comply with it. Dispatched with the 10th Light Crack Infantry, the whole counteroffensive would be supported by 5 Apache Longbows thatÂ’ll provide air support. Wong grimaced at the thought again, not a very good idea, those idiots with bazookas would take them down quickly, but heÂ’d bet on that too.<br><br>The battalion stopped 1km from the eastern entrance. Waiting for the forward observer in the northern counteroffensive to give artillery cover before they move in. Wong closed his eyes only to be rudely awaken by an impending rumbling sound, he looked up to the sky to see A-10 Warthorgs coming in from the eastern side. Must be backup from the airbase in Yngway. The A-10s roared over their heads, flying low enough for the belly of the aircrafts to been seen in detail. Fascinating. Must have been at least over 50 of them. But how did Baruch rally so much crafts at one time Â… the present situation didnÂ’t make the MAF liable to deploy a strike force at this scale, with fuel and ammunitions running low.<br><br>The deafening cry of napalm and cluster bombs sent a wave of descending crescendo of whizzing as artillery shells rained down on the town. That was the signal. WongÂ’s truck jerked before speeding up, driving nose to tail. The decrescendo moaning signaled for Wong to get off! As gunshots fill the air, the first foot on the ground was an epoch as Wong ran to find a spot. Scrutinizing the surroundings, it was pretty much smoked up due to the earlier strike with bodies strewn all over the place.<br><br>The sight of a Reichen soldier drew natural instinct in Wong to bring up his scope and position the crosshair on his head. Running targets didnÂ’t mitigate his lethalness and prowess on the MSG-90 Â… not when it has served him for the whole duration of this accursed war. The depression of the trigger sent Wong back half an inch but that was natural feeling of the recoil. Another look, the clown was down on the ground with blood coursing out of the wound that went perfectly in the centre of his forehead, above the bridge of the nose. Wong smirked. Suddenly, his stereovision went all white, the last thing he could remember was that time broke into many pieces as he turned into a piece of flying tissue Â…<br><br>Sergeant Rick smirked as his Mk 4 finished off another Reichen tank, moving at a considerable high speed. The Mk 4 was made to run and shoot, reducing the probability of getting hit by a tank round. So far 50% of Mingug have been taken.<br><br>Â“Sir! Two Reichen Tanks! 2 oÂ’clock and 11 oÂ’clock!Â” his gunner radioed Â…<br><br>Â“LetÂ’s give them hell!Â” Rick ordered ecstatically. He smirked. For once the MLF was able to unleash a pandemonium that was never seen of in the battle between the warring factions.<br><br>RickÂ’s Mk 4 reversed in alacrity as a tank round brushed the front of the tank, exploding at impact in a house. The run-and-shot tactic was certainly too perfect. Rick brought up his visor as he auto-centred the box on the tank, he gave orders for his gunner to shot. A resounding explosion sent the Mk 4 rumbling as the vision on the tank turned foggy.<br><br>Â“Tank out sir!Â” his gunner radioed.<br><br>The 10 ready to fire-round microprocessor went into action as another HEAT round loaded on as the turret swiveled to lock on the other tank which had missed its round on the Mk 4. All these happened in a mere 5 seconds and the tank soon became a pile of burning metal fused together.<br><br>Rick laughed in glee as he watched the Reichen tanks burn Â…<br><br>Wong was still conscious but the searing pain in his head was unbearable. He opened his eyes to find himself covered with dust. Bruised and cuts were all over his body and he was still surprised that he could get up. Having a RPG exploding near you wasnÂ’t any fun as Wong realized how lucky he was. The pain didnÂ’t matter now; it was all a matter of survival as he ran deeper into town to join the rest of the attacking forces.<br><br>Â“Medic!!!Â”<br><br>Gunfire went in a crescendo as Wong neared the town centre. It wasnÂ’t any fun, having bullets flying over your head. Wong took cover behind a pillar as he scouted the surroundings, to find fanatical Reichen soldiers guarding their passes ferociously. His combat astute mind told him to take out the machine gunnerÂ’s post first. His body natural swiveled the rifle up to his shoulder level and he took aim.<br><br>Â“BooM! Â… BoOm!Â”<br><br>All that took less than 10 seconds for Wong to take out to machine gun positions as the rest of the Reichen troops struggled to fill in their dead comrades place, but all was in vain as WongÂ’s watchful scope was on both positions.<br><br>Screams filled the air as two hellfire rockets homed in on the beleaguered Reichen soldiers. Supporting Longbows were efficient in flushing them out as the Reichen had little AA counter fire.<br><br>Â“Pull out! Pull Out!Â” The Reichen commander ordered.<br><br>MHzen troops cheered in victory as the beleaguered Reichens fell back to their next defensive position.<br><br>65% of the town retaken.<br></div>

Â“Reichland has no consideration for SENSE as a sovereign entity, and has committed various hideous war crimes against our soldiers and populace, showing their utter contempt for our people and what we stand for. Xing Shiana needs to get more involved in the way beyond tossing missiles at the enemy- yes they do help, but we need forces on the ground to tip the tables against Reichens, before more lives get needlessly lost to their crimes against humanity.Â”<br><br>The Xing Shiana parliament currently debates.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Counterback </strong><br><br>Wong ran amidst the array of flying lead. The eastern counter offensive was taken aback by a surprise maneuver by the Reichen army. Dumb as they look, they had the skill and a tactically astute mind to pit their forces against the mHzen soldiers. Though for a mHzen soldier, the need for accuracy and flexibility was paramount, Baruch has been emphasizing the need for more snipers in the army due to the lack of firepower and numbers compared to the Reichen army. The current situation doesnÂ’t make the MLF liable to dispatch any more reinforcements at the moment but it makes the MLF liable to defend its current ground tenaciously.<br><br>The counter offensive on Mingug was more or less a failure as 25% of the A10s were lost compared to the faster F-22s the Reichens had. ItÂ’s time for the unleashing of a more serious firepower in the battle.<br><br>5 Kfirs flew in Alpha formation towards Mingug.<br><br>Â“5 minutes before engagement!Â” Kfir 1 radioed to the rest of his team<br><br>Out to unleash wrath on the F-22s, the Kfirs are armed with heavy firepower, meant to incapacitate the F-22 array of the Reichens.<br><br>Â“Enemy planes, 6 of them, 1 oÂ’clock!Â” Kfir 2 radioed to the squadron leader<br><br>Â“Tally ho tally ho, engage at will!Â” Kfir 1 radioed back<br><br>The Alpha formation broke up immediately with planes flying in a linear array. Apparently the F-22s had spotted them and had taken evasion actions but not running away though.<br><br>Â“Watch out, it might be a trapÂ” Kfir 3 radioed.<br><br>And certainly it was as a plane which was not on KfirÂ’s 3 radar appeared suddenly behind it. Warning signals beeped in a crescendo as the planeÂ’s system warned the pilot of an imminent missile attack. Kfir 3 closed his eyes to say his last prayers as he knew he couldnÂ’t outmaneuver the F-22 Â… Â“missile incoming!Â” beeped the warning system on his display screen that was direct 45 degrees to his throttle control.<br><br>Â“Fhoom!Â”<br><br>Kfir 3 opened his eyes in amazement to find that his was pretty much intact and not in heaven and certainly not in white.<br><br>Â“Sorry for that bait-using technique Rocky, had to outsmart them at times Â… Â“ Kfir 2 radioed back.<br><br>And that technique worked too well as they had already taken out 3 of the F-22s with minor damage to 2 planes. Perforated left wing on Kfir 4.<br><br>WongÂ’s heart raced as he tried his best to get away from the range of flying lead. Outnumbered and outmaneuvered Â… the eastern offensive was a total flop and he and his comrades were stuck close in the middle of the town with Mk 4s and other pockets of soldiers trapped all over the north-eastern side of the town. He had to get to the northern entrance; he had to. That was his only chance of survival.<br><br>Wong raced along with his comrades, taking out a few Reichen positions on the way. Though the Reichen soldiers outnumbered, the mHzen soldiers had a hand of advantage over them in accuracy. Trained to kill with a maximum of two bullets with proper aiming, mHzen soldiers are a notch above the rest in accuracy with a rifle.<br><br>Wong and his comrades reached the northern entrance at last, but to find entrenched Reichen soldiers guarding the oncoming contingent of mHzen armour and soldiers, guarding tenaciously and sedulously as they could.<br><br>This is his chance Â… Wong took cover behind a bahn with the rest of this comrades and starting picking off entrenched soldiers one by one.<br><br>The rumbling of engine brought hope to Wong and his comrades as 2 Mk 4 came in view.<br><br>Â“Hold on hold on! Alpha 5!! Go Go Go!!Â” Wong shouted.<br><br>A corporal slung his AR-15 around his chest and took out to hand grenades. Running towards the trench, he tossed both grenades in adroitly and running back to where Wong was.<br><br>Â“BoOm!Â” Â… no scream was heard but Wong knew that fragmentation grenades at close range, releasing 57,000 minute ball bearings works well as any grenade can. HeÂ’d prefer phosphorus grenades though.<br><br>The light at the end of the tunnel got brighter as the familiar Kfir planes flew overhead them, releasing Rockeye II cluster bombs on the entrenchment, paving way for the men to escape.<br><br>Wong got past the line with his comrades, the battle is lost for now, but theyÂ’ll fight back. After all their efforts in attempting to retake the town, 45% of the original contingent was lost with 25% of the Mk 4 reported lost and 45% of them still stuck diversely in the north-east area. 35% of soldiers still reported beleaguered and unable to move for now, running low on ammunition and medical supplies.<br><br>Wong grimaced at the figures but he had to pray and hope that his comrades will get out safely, too much lives lost, too much blood shed, too much time gone.<br><br></div>
