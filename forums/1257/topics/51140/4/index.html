            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Humanitarian Aid to Reichland</strong><br><br>In the light of recent events, Xing Shiana has decided to send several cruise missiles to drop crucial medical supplies on Reichland in order to help their suffering populace. This is done in the light of the fact that the Reichland medical supplies are ineffective, both in number and ability, to successfully treat the 30 million or so civilians affected by the raid. This is a mission to win the hearts and minds of the Reichen populace.<br><br>The missiles will come in and drop their payloads of medical supplies over medical centers of the major cities of Reichland before crashing into the ocean.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Humanitarian Aid </strong><br><br>The wave of 200 missiles streaked through the air towards their waypoints, as so many of their predecessors had done before, completing their semi-autonomous, pre-programmed routes to deliver their payloads. But these missiles were different; they were on a mission of mercy.<br><br>Reichen medicine had been stocked up in anticipation of an invasion, and they had been used liberally to treat the 30 million odd victims directly affected by the raid. It had helped, to an extent.<br><br>But the Reichen medical supplies were generally ineffective against the more heavily affected victims of the gassing. The chemical was so virulent and resilient that it lingered lodged in the mucus membranes of the victims, causing extreme inflammation and pain, along with the swelling and narrowing of the passages. Doctors tried to treat the symptoms to limited success with the drugs, but were unable to treat the cause, which was the chemical.<br><br>Packed tightly in multiple frozen gel packs within the missiles were the most powerful chemical neutralizers developed by Xing Shianan advanced medical technology that should help the victims of the gassing. They were no complete solution, though they should reduce the severity of the symptoms by about ten percent, and cause the chemical to break down about a day earlier then its usual life span. The missiles approached their release points, major hospitals all over Reichland.<br><br>The missiles screamed in at over eight times the speed of sound, and released their loads of mercy on a profile that would scatter them over their targets. Unfortunately, the missiles were still using the default cluster-bomb release method that released the frozen gel packs at over eight times the speed of sound, rather then slowing down to a safe speed to release them. Punching the munitions out at eight times the speed of sound aided in their destructive capabilities by imparting massive kinetic energies into them, but this was no mission of war, it was a medical drop. But nobody had thought of that, and nobody had reprogrammed the missiles to drop their loads safelyÂ…<br><br>The frozen gel packs were kicked out of their dispensers and blasted towards their targets almost as fast as the missiles, having acquired their momentum from the hypersonic missiles. Air resistance with their blunt shapes slowed them down radically, but not enough to be safe. Falling like supersonic hail out of the sky, they punched into their hospital targets at four times the speed of sound, blasting through the concrete walls, breaking up as they penetrated to explode out into the rooms within along with pieces of concrete spall, which ripped through the hospital wards with the horrific effect of a gigantic shotgun, ripping patients, nurses and doctors to shreds before they knew what hit them and scattering the inside surfaces off the room with gore and viscera. A scene repeated all over the nationsÂ’ hospital.<br><br>The missiles, unaware that their mission had gone horribly wrong, made another blunder as they screamed over their targets at eight times the speed of sound, adding the sonic boom to the chaos, exploding what glass that was left unbroken and causing more injuries as they went off, single-mindedly to crash into the ocean beyond, as their programming had dictated.<br><br>The missiles for this mission had been selected for their age, faulty, aging missiles that were no longer reliable for military use and pressed into service on this mission of mercy. While they functioned well in general, one missile had a microscopic crack within its stub wings that was not detected. The pre-launch crews had not thought to check, having declared the missiles a write off and hence skimping on vital procedure. As the missile maneuvered sharply to release the load, the stub wing tore off under the immense gee forces, sending the missile into a hypersonic corkscrew into its target hospital, taking out the large portion of a hospital block and turning the newborn infant and maternity ward into a morgue. Bodies and parts of bodies of babies and mothers were scattered for over two hundred yards.<br><br>The mission had been a miserable failure. Xing Shiana commanders were furious. Heads were going to roll.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fog Removal</strong><br><br>The flight of fifty seven missiles activated their evasive fight profiles and countermeasures the moment they detected the Reichenland radars trying to pinpoint their locations. They twisted and swerved through the air, pulling hundreds of gees that was beyond any pilot's ability to survive, painting false radar and infared targets as they went. Reichland antiaircraft rounds started to burst around, dotted by million-of-round per second bursts from metal storm systems, which the missiles defty detected and dodged. The AA fire was enough to faze the most sucidal pilot, But the missiles, being over twice as fast as the very rounds being fired at time and far more nimble, easily dodged through the fire with electronic reflexes millions of times faster then any human could muster. They were virtually completely safe in their speed and manuverability. Streaking over the shell-burst sky, they dove relentlessly towards their targets.<br><br>But the volume of fire directed by the paranoid Reichens against the missiles was misguided, for the only intention of their mission was to help the Reichen people by neutralizing the thick pepper fog that still hung over the city of FredericksBurg. Within their warhead holds were not packs of high explosive death, but neutralizing agents to aid in the recovery of Reichland. The robot missiles felt nothing of the ungratefulness of the very people they were trying to help, but did only what they were supposed to do, and that was to approach areas having been identified as having the heaviest fog concentrations, and to release their payloads of the neutralizing liquid chemical before crashing into the ocean beyond Reichland shores. They bore in relentlessly to their target, overflew them, and released the chemical.<br><br>Falling towards the ground in aersolized form, the chemical reacted with the pepper fog and started breaking it apart into its base components of oily gasoline jelly and the hypercapisum that made it so vile to humans. The thick, oily fog that hung in the air was now jellied, and started sinking slowly towards the ground where it can be washed off easily. The missiles, their mission completed, flew away towards the ocean on the last leg of their mission. Not one had been lost to Reichen fire. But Riechen gunners were not about to let their targets slip away, despite having demostrated the good-intentioned nature of their mission. They had simply been too indoctrinated to view all things Xing Shianan as bad and to be destroyed without even considering what was happening before them. With a single minded, primal intensity, they cut loose with everything they had, filling the air with millions of shells from their metal storm systems and conventional guns, tossing a few hundred SAMs into the mix in a display not unlike their over budgeted national day celebrations-<br><br>-It was a fatal mistake, the pepper fog had been converted into a thick, highly flammable gel fog that was slightly heavier then air, sinking down to collect on the ground where it could be washed away. In their desire to shoot even one of the missiles down and ignorant of the danger, the crews fired their ammunition straight through the gel fog that was not alike, and worked exactly as aersolized naplam-<br><br>The fog seemed to come alive and ripple with expanding energy as it ignited, the blast ripping the scream from the Reichen gun crews as the explosion started from their positions. Like a wildfire out of control, the resuting firestorms expanded from their starting points at supersonic speed, rushing through the streets, consuming the gel fog covering the city that was now feeding it. The firestorms, about seventy in all, soon expanded sufficently to meet and combine, creating one collective inferno that turned the Reichen air into a 2,000 degree blast furnance affecting most of the city. A mushroom cloud of fire and smoke rose two kilometers into the air from the resultant epicenter. The superflash fire consumed oxygen and superheated the air that was now rising rapidly, surrounding colder, denser, and oxygen rich air rushed in to fill the void, setting up winds in excess of two hundred kilometers, strewing pieces of glowing hot derbis about. With the oxygen restored, hundreds of thousands of fires started to reignite explosively, creating a hellish mixture. Fifty percent of the Reichen capital was now a blackened scar, dotted with thousands of points of glowing orange. Air temperatures at ground zero hovered at two hundred degrees.<br>Any Reichen caught directly in the blast was instantly immolated, their carbonized bodies frozen where the blast caught them, scattered around and broken up by the rush of tornado-like wind. Those who were indoors at the time avoided this fate, but were suffocated or baked to death as the firestorm heated their buildings to oven like temperatures and consumed their oxygen. Those few that survived the blast were killed by the following rush of tornado-like air and resulting reignitions, and the fewer that survived that now horribly burnt or dying under the burning ruins were forced to breathe in air that would sorch burn and horribly scar the insides of their throat and lungs.<br><br>The energy of the firestorm, set off by careless Reichen gunners, was rated at about 5 kilotons, or one third the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Over seventy thousand people died, and thrice that number were horribly burned or maimed.FredericksBurg now now a burning city of death and destruction, and would contuine to burn on for over two months.<br>Xing Shianan commanders were horrified at the unexpected outcome of the mission of mercy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Xing Shiana Statement on FredericksBurg Disaster</strong><br><br>As we are now all aware, a humanitarian mission to neutralize the pepper fog over FredericksBurg has one awry when ground fire from Reichen gunners in a misguided attempt to hit the missiles dispensing the neutralizing chemical ignited the flammable reactants of the chemical reactions that were necessary to remove the fog from the air. The neutralizing chemical breaks down the OFAP (Oily Fog Airborne Pepper) used in non-lethal applications into a fog composed of the OFAP basal components of aersolized jellied gasoline and hypercapisum, which will be further degraded until they are rendered inert. This process should have taken about thirty minutes.<br><br>However, within that timeframe, Reichen gunners fired upon the missiles, setting off the flammable chemical that covered the most of the city, setting off a citywide firestorm that destroyed over fifty percent of the city and killed what we confirmed as over sixty eight thousand people, a figure that is rising as this message is being composed.<br><br>The combustion of the resultant chemical fog before it has had a chance to degrade has also created an extremely toxic fume supercloud that is extremely harmful to human life. We estimate a 500 percent increase in the incidents of cancers, brian damage, liver and thyriod disorders, sterility and extreme birth defects that will affect approximately seven million who are within the enviromental impact area. We advise Reichen authorities to immediately evacuate areas which are in the path of the cloud. Should this chemical cloud combine with ordinary clouds and return to the earth as rain, we advise immediate evacuation as the chemical concentration can be lethal after esposure to only three or four raindrops. The epicenter of the FredericksBurg firestorm is extremely toxic and hostile to human life, and the surrpunding areas not affected directly by the firestorm are still highly exposed. We advise the complete evacuation of FredericksBurg to avoid more deaths from this toxic supercloud. In the long run, we estimate deaths from the disaster and its after effects to run into 23.5 million, discounting further generations affected by birth defects and cancer, along with other disorders. In the long run, FredericksBurg and the surrounding area of a radius of over two hundred kilometers may not be suitable for human life for decades, or even centuries.<br><br>Xing Shiana regrets to inform that what was a well-intentioned mission of mercy has turned into a disaster of immense scale. We send our condolences to all Reichens who are affected by this disaster. Xing Shiana pledges its unmost effort to assist in where it can. Even now, more humanitarian missions are being planned to bring relief to those affected by this disaster.</div>

The war is not a decision by SENSE War Council.<br><br>I request that Reichland give permission access of airspace to 200 obsolete B-52 "bombers" emblemed with Red Cross signs (all from Red Cross Society International) at about 1000hrs arrival time and allow them to drop tiny parachutes of humanitarian aid worth $40 million Shing-dollars from the Republic of Shingapooru (the original package is only worth half, but the increment of 100% is of the apologies of Shingapooru).<br><br>Please be reminded that all the pilots of the B-52 "bombers" are not from any SENSE nations' nationality. Their citizenship are of internationally. The air-drop points details will be given by the Reichland-Red Cross diplomat located in your nations.<br><br>The humanitarian aid includes medical supplies, food and other essential items. Important supplies for anti-chemical and biological weapons are included but would be dropped at near Reichland miltary areas. Please check for any bombs, poison, or other surprise attacks as there could be sabotages by other unfriendly nations or even by Shingapooruens with anti-Reichland sentiments. Please check the items that they are not expired.<br><br>Each parachute contains a package that is as small as a golfball, with the largest only the sizes of tennis balls. But there are millions of them to be drop, connected by thick fishing lines to prevent lost.<br><br>This strategy was done to gain substantial trust from Reichland as Xing Shianan unfortunately using the humanitarian aid as an decoy to attack Reichland. The size of the supply packages were kept small as fear of people putting in bomb sabotages.<br><br>The Republic of Shingapooru wishes Reichland to accept these aids as a form of goodwill. The Republic of Shingapooru will remain neutral.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Eiizumi<br>Secretary of SENSE Organisation and War Council<br>Supreme President of the Great Republics<br>The Republic of Shingapooru<br>The Republic of Eiizumi-Shi<br>The Republic of Zenbu Koogeki</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Beginning of An End</strong><br><br>With the destruction of the capital city, Reichland had been effectively decapitated. It now lacked a central government, economic hub, and law, along with these tenets of Reichland soceity went the revelance of the monarchy. Reichland had been effectively split into two factions, one still holding loyal to the monarchy, and the other which wanted the monarchy abolished and its members dead for bringing such disaster to Reichland. The rebel faction, led by former Reichen Brigadier Katukov, outnumbered those still loyal to the monarchy within two days of the destruction of Reichland, with more and more of the original Reichen army and populace defecting to his cause. The royal family was in grave danger.<br><br>And the wound of betrayal would run deep, an informant loyal to Katukov had infiltrated the deepest ranks of the Reichen monarchy, and given the location of Emperor Andreas' fallout bunker to the rebel leader. Rebel troops attacked and breached the perimeter one hour later, with much of the hopelessly outnumbered elite Royal Guard killed or defected. The rebels took no prisoners. Storming the bunker, they captured the Emperor's wife, Sharon, and daughter, Tammy. As luck would have it, Andreas was meeting with his top officals in another location at the time. Upon hearing the news of the impending fall of Reichland to rebel hands, and the capture of Andrea's family, they decieved the emperor into flying for the safety of Prussia, telling him that they had been transported there as well. It wasn't until he watched XNN later that day did he discover the news.<br><br>Xing Shianan spy satellites, orbiting high above the chaos, recorded the lynch scene playing out in the streets below. Brutally kicked and shoved as they were led by Rebel troops through the burnt out streets of FredericksBurg, the enraged civillian mob of FredericksBurg pelted Sharon and Tammy with rubbish and spat on them as they were led down the streets to the burnt out city square which was the epicenter of the blast. There, four rebel tanks waited, arranged in a square and pointing out away from one another..<br><br>Katukov stood on one of them, shouting the the surging masses, which once supported the emperor, now supported him. He moved the brutalized, bleeding Reichen royality to the center as the masses rained riot missiles down on them. Katukov stilled the masses as he rose his rifle.<br><br>"Listen people!" He shouted. "Today is a glorious day for us! Now the fate of Reichland is truly in our hands. Today here stands two of those people who had once held our lives in their very hands, sending our children off the die for useless causes."<br><br>The mob roared at that statement, a few more riot missiles rained down on Sharon and Tammy.<br><br>"No more of this! This is the dawn of the new socialist order! There will be peace and bread for every man, in accordance to his needs! No more shall we suffer for the selfishness of a few while they contuine to pad their pockets and homes! Taking what's ours for their own uses!"<br><br>"No more of this! Today in with the new, and out with the old!" He motioned as the crowd roared. Rebel troops yanked Sharon away from Tammy, she screamed and resisted, only to recieve a brutal stroke from a rifle that split her nose. As they dragged the mother away, anothe rebel trooper swung his rifle at the back of Tammy's left knee joint, breaking the thing and forcing her to her knees. She screamed in pain as the crowd roared.<br><br>He pointed his G36 rifle at the girl, and cut loose with a rattling burst from it. The girl's forhead seemed to deform like plastic and then expode outwards in a shower of blood, brain and bone. The body vibrated violently as more gouts of blood splattered out from bullet hits all over it in long stringy blobs. The body slumped over backwards obscenely, still stuck in the kneeling position as rebel soldiers started to pour more automatic fire into it, jerking it violently until what was once a girl resembled more like a thick, red, bleeding piece of cloth rag on the ground. Dragging the body by the neck like a dead lamb, a rebel tossed it into the crowd, which fought for it.<br><br>Katukov nodded, and they brought the mother forward back to the center of the formation of tanks. Groggy and dimy aware that her daughter was now dead, she did not resist as they chained each of her limbs to each of the tanks.<br><br>"In with the new, out with the old!" Katukov shouted.<br><br>The tanks surged forward, Sharon's body did not resist as the chains went tight. With a shake of dust off the chains as the tension went slack, all of Sharon's limbs were ripped loose from her torso, exposing bone and long strings of severed connective tissue that dragged along a red trail on the ground as they were dragged by the tanks. In the center, Sharon's torso twitched grostuquely, bleeding profusely from all the ragged holes that were once the joints where her limbs had met her torso. The head jerked up and down, as if trying to see beyond the chest to where the missing limbs had gone, still obvious that she was still quite aware and alive, and trying to move, to get up despite missing all her limbs. As the blood drained out from the four massive wounds ripped in the body, the twitching grew less frantic, the squirming slower. With a final shudder, the head dropped and lay out sideways on the ground, the mouth wide open like a landed finsh trying to gulp in air. The chest rose and fell sparodically for a few more times, before it was all still.<br><br>The rebels tossed the mutilated body into the crowd.<br><br>"In with the new, out with the old!"<br><br>Xing Shiana, 30 minutes later.<br><br>"My goodness..." The intelligence officer whispered as he viewed the satellite feed they had just recieved. The rest of the staff in the room was silent, huddled around the monitor.<br><br>An intelligence agent broke the silence as he burst into the room, slamming the door open, clutching a piece of paper crumpled in his hastly rush from his department to theirs.<br><br>"We have confirmation from field agents." He said breathlessly. "The DNA profiles from the bodies match. Sharon and Timmy Kaiser have been murdered."<br><br>"Report this to Head, now."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shattered Nation<br><br>The humanitarian aid arrived as planned, airdropped from hundreds of SENSE aircraft, delivering thousands of tons of much needed supplies to Reichland, relieving those who managed to get to them from some of the hardships of war.<br><br>But one could not feed a nation forever simply by aircraft alone, the average living conditions of the Reichen has sunk to deplorable levels, their economy shattered, their industries destroyed by the war, followed up by the contuined damage that was inflicted in the coup. Most Reichens now found that food, potable water, and other necessary medical supplies were now hard to find, costing over five hundred times their value in the black market. Lawlessness and arnachy also started to spread in the nation, with the rebel militia looting and robbing the civillian populace, siezing humanitarian aid and the little food supplies they had. Katukov imposed martial law. Anybody resisting them was shot. Oppression, fear, and hunger were his weapons. Famine started to strike Reichland on a bilicial scale.<br><br>By the end of the third month, 3.5 million Reichens had died of hunger. Disease and pestilence was rampant. Katukov's regime did not care, they were too focused on destroying any last threat to their regime, which was the exiled army still loyal to Andreas. Curfew was imposed all over the nation, no civillian allowed to leave their cities. There is no medical care, no economy, no power, no clean water, hardly any food, which was basically expired or bad food items the rebels troop had rejected to be distributed among the civillians. Thousands of Reichens died a day, their shrunken bodies tossed out in the streets to lie where they fell. There was nobody to clean them up.<br><br>And nowhere was there more felt then in the city of Konisburg, which had been under seige for since the civil war started. The last stronghold in Reichland still loyal to Andreas, it was crammed full of the still surviving Imperial Army, which now numbered only 6 million, crammed in along with 5 million civillians in a city made for half that total population. Starved and raked with disease, the daily attrition rate for the population in the city was about a thousand a day. The rebel army on the other hand, was well fed, had all the equipment they needed, along with the ammunition. They never stopped shelling the city, killing anybody caught in their way. The only relief came from SENSE airdrops, but most of them fell wide, were siezed by Katukov, or called off because the LZ was deemed too dangerous for an airdrop.<br><br>Konisburg was now nothing more then a cesspit of death and squalor. Every bulding had been reduced to ruins and the survivors now lived like rats, in sewers and any underground location they could find. Dead bodies littered the entire city, bloating in the hot summer sun, rotting and spreading more disease. There was no clean water, and virtually no food. More and more died of starvation, disease and enemy fire. Some resorted to cannabilism, feeding off the dead to survive.<br><br>Katukov could easily crush the city, but he bided his time. Once the harsh Reichen winter arrived in about four more months, it would well and truly finish off the last remainding pocket of resistance loyal to the now disposed emperor.<br><br>The End</div>
