            <div class='col-md body'>Retrieval<br><br>Wong lay in the medic tent as the field medic attended to his wounds. Young man, probably 20 or so, he noticed.<br><br>Â“Here you go Cap, you shouldnÂ’t have any problems taking out a few Reichen idiots!Â” said the medic ecstatically. HeÂ’d heard of WongÂ’s exploits and was euphoric that he was able to treat the legendary Captain.<br><br>Wong smiled at him, nodding as he got up. He picked up his MSG-90 and walked out of the tent, breathing in the air that is now polluted with carbon monoxide and filled with the rumblings of Mk 4s and Abram tanks. Engineers furiously clearing a space for the containment of Apache Longbows and space for bringing in tanks. The thought of reentering Mingug was horrifying Â… Wong had enough close encounters with death to put him off his line, but he was a soldier and a soldier had his duty. Wong grimaced at the thought, no matter how legendary greenhorns might think he is, heÂ’s just a human and is susceptible to all the diseases, dangers and vulnerability any other human can be exposed to. ItÂ’s just that he has extreme luck Â… thatÂ’s all.<br><br>Reinforcements are being brought in to commence the final operation, to retrieve all those who are trapped inside. So far known, 98 soldiers are known to be trapped and still alive. 15 Achzarits are being deployed to bring all the soldiers out. Fast and maneuverable, the Achzarits can move swiftly around the town. So far, the soldiers trapped inside have been briefed to converge at meeting points, mainly meeting point Alpha, Beta and Charlie.<br><br>0145 hours.<br><br>Time to commence the infiltration.<br><br>Â“Wong! Get ready, artillery will fall 50 metres directly from your start off point, you better watch out, those slammers back there pack a punch.!Â” His commander said.<br><br>Â“Yes, commander, I understand.Â” Wong replied dryly.<br><br>He never liked the idea of going back in again. But he had to get his comrades out.<br><br>The night sky was filled with the cries of descending artillery shells as the much feared mHzen battery pounded the northern entrance, reducing any gun position or fortified position to a pile of rubble, nothing could survive that. But Wong had to act fast, itÂ’ll be only a mere 20 minutes before the whole Reichen army will come upon them. Other than that, itÂ’s just fighting off pockets of Reichen patrol.<br><br>Wong held his breathe as his Achzarit slithered around the tight bends of Mingug, using night vision. The brownish-blacked Achzarit spotted with camo lines blend in well in the moonless night, which gave them the perfect surroundings to move in stealth, with cover under the noise of the oncoming artillery which is now pounding blindlessly all over the town in attempt to confuse the Reichens.<br><br>Â“Gamete, gamete! This is Ach 7, do you read??Â” Wong radioed.<br><br>Â“Ach 7, this is gamete, we are at Alpha point, be warned, Reichen resistance is strong, no signs of armour yet, 3 men down!Â” The voiced crackled under the sound of fire.<br><br>Â“Copy that gamete!Â” Wong replied.<br><br>He had 5 other Achzarits tailing him behind, but flesh wasnÂ’t anything compared to armoured personnel carriers. Ach 7 swerved wildly to the left, turning to give view to Alpha point which is now an open space of rubble and half-destroyed houses, giving perfect fortifications any soldier needed, but that wasnÂ’t any difficulty to any mHzen soldier trying to take out a head thatÂ’s sticking out at 100 metres.<br><br>Wong ran out with his head down, NVG on and he took cover behind the Achzarit.<br><br>Â“Covering fire gamete! Move out now!Â” Wong shouted in the midst of artillery shelling and gunfire.<br><br>Wong spotted a PO-2 on a ReichenÂ’s soldier, but the threat disappeared as soon as it appeared, he wasnÂ’t gonna take any chances.<br><br>The loading took less than 2 minutes with all men and casualties at that point loaded and the rescue team providing tenacious covering fire. The Reichens didnÂ’t stand a chance.<br><br>Wong scrambled onto the Achzarit after the all clear signal was given, with the AchzaritÂ’s 7.62mm coaxial provided them cover.<br><br>Â“Cap! Armour spotted!Â” the driver exclaimed<br><br>Â“Pull out pull out!!Â” Wong shouted into his radio, to his driver and to the other Achzarits too.<br><br>By that time the first Achzarit was already on the way out, but WongÂ’s Ach 7, being the first to enter, was the last to exit. The armour was approaching fast and the turret was already turning into his direction. WongÂ’s heart raced, he closed his eyes to pray, but that wasnÂ’t time for any prayer now, he had to focus on getting out fast, and time was the quintessential in this situation. It seemed eternity before the Achzarit behind him turned to speed off. By this time, the turret of the Reichen tank was nearly in target. WongÂ’s driver reversed with alacrity, swerving immediately as he reversed and stepping on the gas at once. The exit drew closer and closer as WongÂ’s heart raced faster. Ach 7 swerved right, but its vision was covered with flying debris and dust, though that didnÂ’t hinder the movement of Ach 7. The tank had fired, but it missed. Lousy shot, Wong thought.<br><br>Time now seemed to go faster and faster as they drew closer to the exit point. In just a mere 15 minutes, a dangerous operation to rescue his comrades was executed in style and precision.<br><br>Passing the safe line was euphoric to the once beleaguered soldiers and Wong himself. But things didnÂ’t turn out the way they wanted to. Apparent, Charlie point was a converging point for Reichen armour whose response was faster than the arrival of the Charlie rescue team, which managed to make it out with only one Achzarit, perforated and badly damaged. 25 of the 98 have been lost. Beta pointed fared better with low resistance and darker streets, with hedgerows growing over the streets, blocking off any possible light source from the top.<br><br>Wong breathe a sign of relief as he saw his comrades being rushed off to the medical centre for treatment. Another night over, another day begins. For now, the mHzen has to retreat to its humble abode before attempting to retake Mingug Â… or Minburg now Â… what a gayish name, Wong thought. 4 Achzarits lost, 25 lives lost and all their Mk 4 tanks that were trapped inside destroyed to prevent the stealing of any information from the cursed Reichens ... how much more will there be? ...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Crisis</strong><br><br>Wong swore and cursed as he laid in the Achzarit; now a makeshift medic truck. The unprecedented Reichen attack had cause a gapping wound his left thigh. Shrapnel Â… Wong cursed. This time fragments from a Mk 4 perforated his left thigh deeply when a Leopard III fired on it. Looks like heÂ’ll be out of action for a while.<br><br>So far, 25% of tanks lost at the backup base. Retreating was paramount for that moment; the mHzen army canÂ’t afford to lose any more ground troops. For now, battles will be fought in the air, and air shall be the place where blood will repay blood. Baruch was such a prig; he shouldÂ’ve at least notified some of the higher-ranking officers that he was bringing in new air support. The MiG 1.42 MFI Â… capable of speeds of 2450km/h, the MiG is bound to be a match to the Reichens F/A-22 Raptor. Nevertheless, itÂ’s going to take a while for the MiG squadron to be fully deployed, why didnÂ’t Baruch deploy them earlier? Wong thought. Currently, 10 MiGs are already in operation and ready-to-deploy.<br><br>The mHzen air power is gonna strike back.<br><br>Â“Cap, you gotta stop moving so much or I canÂ’t treat your wounds.Â” The medic said.<br><br>Â“Sorry Corp Â… Â“ Wong replied dryly.<br><br>He remembered the field medic who treated him before they went in Mingug Â… or Minburg for the extraction. Nice young man, rough features but handsome. But now he was seen no more. Wong grimaced at the thought. He prayed that the medic would be well off at this point of time. The proposal Baruch made, he hoped that Andreas Kaiser would comply, no matter how much a tyrant he may be. Wong wanted to see the young man again, and many of his other comrades.<br><br>The remaining forces of the so-called Delta Strike Force was reduced merely to the capability of defending themselves, they had to move back to regroup and bring in more reinforcements. Having a camp at the clearing wasnÂ’t too bad; the Reichens shouldnÂ’t have discovered them. Security was tight, Wong couldnÂ’t figure out how any forward observer couldÂ’ve slipped past the lines.<br><br>What are the other SENSE members doing? Where are they when they needed help the most? Wong thought, the Reichens are going to overrun 440mhz sooner or later and at this rate that they are going at, the day of reckoning will be just a blink of an eye.<br><br>Wong wagered that Baruch must be in his office contemplating his next move, pontificating the strength of the Reichens and their army statistics. What the heck does he know about them anyway? A new menace, a new army, a new driving force. What is there to come next? The future of 440mhz looks bleak, would the nation cease to exist anymore. Maybe, he thought. After all that fighting and trying to run for his life, Wong had enough of action for a while. But the reality of war grips him as hard as the bandage that was around his perforated left thigh. Wong smiled wryly. Soon enough heÂ’ll be in battle again Â… more lives to be lost, more blood to be shed.<br><br>Â“Captain. The commander wants to see you as soon as you get back to camp. He has something important to tell you.Â” The medic said.<br><br>Â“Okay, I wonder whatÂ’s up Â… Â“ Wong replied, sotto voce.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Operation Peace in 440 MHz</strong><br><br>The fall of Migug by Reichen forces had spurned the Singabolah Armed Forces into action. Convinced that the next Reichen target would be Singabolah itself, the SAF began hurriedly making preparations for a ground invasion to follow-up on the RSAF's airstrikes. The Singabolah economy began to gear itself for war production, and the civilian populace rehearsed dashing into air raid shelters. Nearly thirty divisions of reservist were called up, and the eastern border with 440 MHz was heavily fortified.<br><br>The Reichen army was formidable, and on the ground alone possessed more tanks than Hitler had used to invade France. Waiting for the blow to fall was to court disaster, and the Singabolah General Staff decided that its only hope lay in the much-theorised pre-emptive strike. Therefore, on the morning of the 14th of July, the Singabolah Parliment ordered the SAF to carry out its long planned Operation "Peace in 440 MHz".<br><br>The Singabolah government's original directive to the SAF staff had three principal clauses. The first was to clear Reichen forces out of the 440 MHz border area, so that none of the civil population of Singabolah was within range of Reichen weapons; the second was to break the impasse at Migug with the help of the MDF, and the third was to avoid involving the MHzen civilian population. In broad outline, the Singabolean plan was to divide its three combined arms divisons, the 3rd, 6th, and 9th, into three fast moving columns, each with its own air and artillery support, which would advance across the main routes at the Singabolah-440 MHz border.<br><br>The attack would be a daring strike from southwestern 440 MHz towards Migug, where the Reichen 4th Army was stationed at. Instead of approaching from the west, straight across the border, as was expected, the first two Singabolean columns would advance up the coastal road, resulting in a flanking position, and from there, Singabolean armour would circle around to east of Migug, into its rear area, while the 440 MHzen army covered its northeastern flank from counter-attack. The third column would cut Migug off from its sea lines of communications with Reichland, preventing resupply and reinforcement of the Reichen garrison at Mingug, and would also act as a backstop to trap any Reichens fleeing from the other two columns.<br><br>At 0400 hours, the first two columns moved out, traveling at 50km/h, and sometimes even 60km/h to cover as much ground as possible. The spearhead of each column was composed of an armoured brigade equipped with Merkava 3 Main Battle tanks, followed by mechanized infantry in Bionix 25 IFVs, all backed by close air support from F-16Cs and F-35s. The slower elements of the column, such as M109A6 Paladin Self Propelled Howitzers, had some trouble keeping up, but overall, loss of communication wasn't too severe and coordination as a whole hadn't fallen apart, and by 0600 the combined arms divisions had reached the outskirts of Migug.<br><br>At the same time, the 21st Singabolah Guards Division and the 56th Singabolah Armoured Brigade made an amphbious landing along the northern coast of the largest island in the Kuradi group. Supported by stealth frigates and Harpoon-equipped Fast Attack Craft, the landing craft reached shore without damage and unloaded their troops, which then rolled southwards to engage the main Reichen garrison on the island.<br><br>Operation Peace in 440 MHz was under way...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cry Havoc and let slip the Hokkien Pengs of War...</strong><br><br>10km north of Kuradi Islands<br>0600 hrs<br><br>"Eh, Boss, got twelve Leichen pai kias heading our dilection, bearing 2000, speed mach 1.3, lange 200, atitude 1000. Looks like they want to hoot us ah! Vector light to course sam-ji-liok and go in and hantham them ah!" WSO 2nd Lt. Wah Piang Eh called out from the backseat of a Republic of Singabolah Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon.<br><br>"Lorger. Lum Pah flight, come light to sam-ji-liok and plepare to engage ah!"<br><br>"Lorger!"<br><br>"Okay lah!"<br><br>"Siao ah!" one of the pilots said, "Four against twelve? How can?"<br><br>"Shuddap lah!"<br><br>The Typhoons, in "fingers-four" formation, broke up. This would be their first air-combat maneuvering battle. This would also be the first air-to-air engagement of the RSAF.<br><br>Lum Pah leader, Maj. Chao Ah Beng, squinted at the radar display. The AWACS transmission came in, and sure enough there were half a dozen F-22s supercrusing towards his position. Chao checked his fuel gauge. His tank was two-thirds full. Not enough for a high-speed, high-risk maneuvering dogfight and then a long trip back to Changi, but he'd have to take his chances... Chao smiled grimly. No prizes for second place in air-to-air combat...<br><br>"Chiong ah!" Chao yelled, announcing that he would be engaging the bandits. The sleek delta-winged Typhoon surged forward to a Mach 1 supercruise as its ERC-90 started to lock onto individual Reichen planes. Around Chao, the other Typhoons were gunning their engines as well, rapidly eating up the distance between the Reichen planes and the four ship formation.<br><br>Two hundred kilometres...<br><br>One hundred kilometres...<br><br>Fifty...<br><br>Twenty...<br><br>Ten...<br><br>The F-22s, outnumbering the Typhoons three-to-one and outclassing them in terms of firepower, speed, and maneuverability, broke formation.<br><br>The radar locked onto the first target.<br><br>"Arm Fox Two," Chao said.<br><br>A moment later, the infrared homing system of the AIM-9Xs locked on from seven kilometres away, and the low growl in Chao's headset made a comforting sound.<br><br>"Got tone, good or not?" he asked,<br><br>"Heck care! Just shoot lah!" his WSO screamed.<br><br>Chao decided not to heed his backseater's advice, and waited another few seconds for the IR lock to rise up to a piercing screech.<br><br>"Shoot Fox Two ah, Fox Two!"<br><br>The Sidewinder tore away from the Tomcat, and was followed a moment later by three others. Chao's F-22 saw the missile coming, and the Reichen pilot rose upwards, engines roaring, and then suddenly flipped over, flares streaking away as it dove down steeply. The Sidewinder switched targets and went for one of the IR flares. It exploded as its proximity fuse went off.<br><br>The other Typhoons began to mix it with the Raptors, and Chao climbed up and inverted his craft, keeping an eye on the F-22 below him. Chao pulled the flight stick back, and the Typhoon's twin EJ200 eurojets whined as he hit full throttle. The F-22 was inside two kilometres, too close for a Sidewinder. Major Chao switched from "Fox Two" to "Fox Three", and then to cannons. On the RSAF Typhoons, it was no longer a Mauser 27mm, but a standard US 20mm M61A1 Vulcan. He was determined to make the Banshee pilot devote himself to a "knife fight." Close in and no holds barred.<br><br>"They got lock!" Wah suddenly yelled a moment before the alarm cut in. "Launch liao! Radar-seeker! Eleven oÂ’clock low!"<br><br>Chao glanced at the radar-warning display. Some Reichen had gotten a lock on his Typhoon and had launched a radar-guided missile. Twisting the stick violently, he let the Typhoon fall over in a snap roll before executing a series of corkscrews and turns that confused the Reichen radar-seeker head. At the same time, his left thumb triggered off a series of chaff bundles, the aluminium-coated plastic shreds cluttering the radar and offering the Reichen missile a large number of ghost targets.<br><br>Not knowing better, it took the bait.<br><br>"That pai kia kana sai liao," Chao growled, swearing revenge.<br><br>The HUD display in front of him had the gun sight on, and as he approached the F-22, it danced into his crosshairs. He snapped off a long burst, missed, and then followed the F-22 as it broke right.<br><br>Chao pulled up into a near-inverted position, then positioned his Typhoon so he could see the Raptor by looking up out of his cockpit. He saw it, and as it continued to break right, Chao applied right rudder and cut the throttle, the nose of the Typhoon going down as he allowed the airplane to stall. He pushed the throttle back up to full power as the Eurofighter nosed over, and he was swooping down right on top of the F-22. Again, it danced into his gunsight. He opened fire with two bursts, both of them hitting its left wing, and a third burst shearing it completely off. The F-22 blossomed into a magnificent ball of fire, and plunged into the roiling sea. No ejection chute.<br><br>"Boh chute," Wah put it simply.<br><br>The Typhoons had done suprsingly well. Within minutes, five surviving F-22s were high tailing it back to the Kuradi Islands. No Singabolean casualties.<br><br>"Everyone how?" asked Chao.<br><br>"Okay lah."<br><br>"I trailing fuel leh..."<br><br>If they had been facing each other, Wah and Chao would have exchanged worried looks. As if to confirm his worst fears, Wah said,<br><br>"We pass bingo point two minutes ago. Boh fuel lor."<br><br>Bingo point was the point of no return. The Typhoon would flame out before it could reach Changi.<br><br>Chao checked his fuel guage. Only a fifth remained.<br><br>Chao needed a tanker, fast.<br></div>

Growing up in the same birthplace, studied in the same junior high and high school. Their relationship can be described as close-knitted. Bakky was BaruchÂ’s junior high nickname, when he still had that duckish hairstyle. After high school, Mordechai got a scholarship to study political science, being identified by a high-ranking government official in a debate competition. He later went on into a junior civil position and rose up to become the Head of State.<br><br>While Mordechai had his pinnacles of life, BaruchÂ’s beginnings were a little more humble. After high school, Baruch nearly missed going into military academy, but lucky justified him and he went in one of the last; but rose to become one of the most military astute mind in the academy, whether in tactical or handling a rifle or pistol, Baruch fit the qualifications. Fitting the qualification was an understatement; he rose to be identified as a potential genius in military and the government brought him in as a one-star general, at the tender age of 28.<br><br>Â“Seems like our SENSE brethren were quick in their arrival Â…Â” Mordechai smirked.<br><br>Baruch wagered that heÂ’s still euphoric over the Airspike by Xing Shiana. Arriving quickly? Baruch thought. Their help seemed like eternity but eternity wasnÂ’t the situation Baruch was in now.<br><br>Â“Yes. I was kind enough to let Rommel off without a bullet in his forehead.Â” Baruch grimaced.<br><br>Mordechai took that seriously. What Baruch say heÂ’ll do, he can do it and with perfection. Placing a USP or Beretta in his hand was equivalent to putting him in a Merkava Mk 4. Mordechai knew that Baruch could very well put a bullet through RommelÂ’s head with a glance and those armed guards around him too.<br><br>Â“So what do you intend to do? ItÂ’s the perfect opportunity to strike back.Â” Mordechai replied.<br><br>Â“So as to speak, IÂ’ve already given orders for more reinforcements to be placed on the northeastern line. I called it the Gamma Point Blank line or GPB for short. Ordnances are rolling out fresh from the factories and we can strike back either by the earliest tomorrow night or the day after.Â” Baruch said dispassionately.<br><br>War was something not to be reckoned with. Baruch knew that by striking back, more lives would be lost. ItÂ’s a total paradox to someone who is in a military commanding position like Baruch, who would be expected to execute offensives without remorse. But Baruch had an extremely soft heart. An animal and nature lover, he wished that he hadnÂ’t venture into the path that he was in now, heÂ’d had done something else if he was given the choice. But time does not wait for anyone. What he has to do he has to do it now for the countryÂ’s sake. Ultimately, the countryÂ’s future is paramount.<br><br><strong>Gamma Point Blank Line</strong><br><br>Wong laid on the make shift bed with a mattress and a pillow. Not bad for a shanty camp, he thought. The pillowÂ’s tenderness and freshness was alluring him to sleep; but sleep was in saturation for him. He wound was almost healed and in time to come, heÂ’ll be back hugging his MSG-90.<br><br>Wong could hear the C-130 Hercules landing and taking off, the rumbling of Sabra, Abrams and Mk 4 tanks outside his tent. The gasping of air by training soldiers whose recalcitrant bodies defied its cry for rest.<br><br>The original Delta Strike Force swelled up to almost 150% its original number. With more and more reinforcements coming in from the eastern country, the MLF is ready for a full, all out conventional offensive, pitting their technology, skill and rabid bloodlust for the revenge of their fallen comrades and the hope of seeing their captured comrades again. WongÂ’s heart raced at the thought of being back on the battle line. What was so rancid and putrid to him was now like fresh sweet and sour pork to his recalcitrant soul that now burns with fiery passion for adrenalin in his bloodstream.<br><br>Wong looked at the round, bluish clock that hung directly, diagonally up in front of him.<br><br><strong>1630 hours Â… </strong><br><br>Another 16 more hours and the day of reckoning would arrive for those cursed Reichens that trod the soil of his beloved Motherland.<br><br>Full force attack Â… Wong thought. That means LARs, Slammers being brought in with Achzarits to ride in. Seeing Longbows in action and the newly arrived Sabra tanks. Wong smirked. Sounds like fun Â…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Answers</strong></span><br><br><strong>2330 hours</strong><br><br>Wong ducked for cover as heavy fire from Reichen soldiers and tanks fell on his position. Attempting squeeze into his helmet was futile as the noise percolated into his head, striking fear of death and reminiscing the times where he was still in his medic tent staring at the same round, bluish clock.<br><br>So much for going into battle, he thought. 35% of the Delta Strike Force reduced with close to 250,000 taken casualty, either dead or wounded. Wong cursed at his fate.<br><br>He rose over the trench to expose his shoulders, taking off two Reichen soldiers. A consistent chopping sound in the midst of all the firing and noise drew his attention as he looked up to see a Longbow approach his position. Two hellfire missiles departed gleefully from its hoist and approach the Leopard III that was coming on WongÂ’s position. He couldnÂ’t see anything but he knew that the tank would not survive the onslaught of two hellfire. The crescendo of the LongbowÂ’s machine gun sent soil flying in the air like geysers and screams that punctuated the noise of combat.<br><br>Â“Get over that trench now!!Â” Wong shouted in the midst of exploding Â… stuff.<br><br>Just as the first men got up from their trenches, the Longbow turned into a ball of red fumes and carbon and debris befell them, injuring some men but not fatal enough to kill them. Wong peeked over to see another Leopard III approaching their position.<br><br>Â“Delong! Delong! WeÂ’re under heavy fire, request back up now!Â” Wong screamed into the receiver of the radio that one of his men was carrying.<br><br>Â“Affirmative! Backup on the way, itÂ’s getting hot down here too!Â” the voice crackled, sending high frequencies reverberating in the ear drum of Wong and ultrasounds that pressured the fluid of his ear.<br><br>Reinforcements seemed forever to arrive as Wong and his men held back the oncoming Leopard IIIs and the Reichen soldiers with RPG-7 and handheld fragmentation and phosphorus grenades.<br><br>As another Leopard III closed in, the sky lighted with wispy trails of carbon and fireworks as the rockets of a LAR descended 50 metres in front of them, taking out the Leopard III and the men surrounding it.<br><br><strong>0130 hours</strong><br><br>The fighting carried late into the night as Wong was still stuck in the same position with a few more men down. The onslaught of Leopard IIIs and Reichen soldiers never seem to stop. Contact was still available between pockets of armour and soldiers stuck all over the battlefield. GPB line was crucial, the mHzen army canÂ’t afford to move back any further than that. MiG 1.42 MFI, Kfir and A-10s homed in around WongÂ’s position to debilitate the oncoming Reichen element. Raiding the area with Rockeye II cluster submunitions and 30mm cannon.<br><br>Sergeant Yeo was now moving at top speed, trying to outrun the three Leopard IIIs that was now coming in different directions at him.<br><br>Â“Force 1!Â” Sgt Yeo ordered as he homed in on the nearest Leopart III that was in line with his aimer, eerily lit up in green as the NV was on.<br><br>With great alacrity, the Mk 4 fired on the Leopard III, which immediately stop its movement. The HEAT round must have done the job. Sgt Yeo swiveled his turret quickly to get another shot at the next Leopard III and put it out of action too.<br><br>By this time Sgt Yeo was smirking but his self-satisfied laughter turned into screams of pain as he felt his tank shake, coming to a screeching halt and knocking out soon after.<br><br>-------<br><br>Wong ducked back into his trench to unload his magazine and slot in a new one. He was running low on ammunitions, so was his men. How long more would this battle last? He thought. Fatigue was creeping up slowly on him and his men and they canÂ’t last for long like this.<br><br>The suddenly extreme change in air pressure cause the fluid in his ear to produce reverberating sounds that was now ringing in his head. Maybe he shouldÂ’ve learnt not to position himself near the tank. The night was dragging on as visibility was get poor and the delineation of opposition was getting harder and harder to spot in the dark Â…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ReichlandÂ’s Burning</strong><br><br>FredericksBurg, Reichland<br><br>There were many of them, the smartest of cruise missiles, screaming through the air, but not so fast as their smaller cousin, the Airspike. They were ACIM-130M Banshee Hypersonic Land Attack Cruise Missiles. Essentially the big brother of the Airspike that had haunted the Reichens since the start of the war, this would be the first time the Germanic people would face the larger, meaner version of the things they had come to fear and hate. For many it would be their last.<br><br>Over three times the size of the Airspike at six meters long, the Banshee missile had all the features found in the Xing Shiana ACIM family, stealth technology, advanced artifical intelligence and navigation systems and a hypersonic speed of over six times the speed of sound, all this to get the 1,000 or so odd pounds of payload to its target.<br><br>They were cruising at 50,000 feet now, their scramjet engines catching the supersonic slipstream, ramming the gas to incandesce, and spraying slush cryogenic hydrogen along with to create the trust necessary to maintain their hellacious speed. They were fast approaching their target, data from their onboard navigation systems and their uplink to the elint data network told them where they are Â– the map coordinates the altitude, the speed and direction of their targets, and against that the computer in the missiles had compared their location. Now approaching fast at over two kilometers a second, they were connecting the invisible dots in three-dimensional space, and they were most unlikely to miss, Has the missiles a brain, they would have felt satisfaction as they scream towards their target, selecting a point in space and time where they would meetÂ… Crossing one of the invisible aerial points in their flight which was significant to them as the waypoint to the final, terminal approach, they nosed down and swooped to the ground, staying just three hundred feet above.<br><br>They were low over FredericksBurg.<br><br>At hypersonic speed.<br><br>The thicker atmosphere at the lower altitude had generated more friction, slowing the missiles down to just over Mach 5. The carbon carbon insulation on their leading edges started to glow dull red as the kinetic energy transferred to them from the thousands of moles of air per second molecules slipping past their own was transformed to the most easily convertible form of energy; heat.<br><br>But not all of the energies of the Banshees missiles were converted in such a way. The hypersonic shock cones generated by the missiles left a large footprint of sonic devastation in their wake as the hyper-compressed air snapped back with many times the power normally generated by a supersonic aircraft, powerful enough to explode a large swathe of windows in their wake and leave anybody caught within their Â“footprintÂ” stunned and deafened. The missiles on their own part, were relatively unaffected by the devastation they were already causing with their speed even before they hit their targets, using their specially shaped Â“waveriderÂ” fuselages to ride on the shockwave, using it to supplement their own propulsion and lift.<br><br>One of the many persons caught in the devastation was Mr. Kent Nar Siah, a 52 year old Singabolean, one of the many Â“internedÂ” at one of the many concentration camps for his people in Reichland. Life in the camps directly contradicted what the Reichen government had said it was; it was brutal and inhumane, with the Singaboleans being forced to work as slave labor to support the Reichen war machine. They received little food and water for their efforts, as with all the other necessities of life. Many died under such brutal conditions, but their captors did not care, they believed it was their rightful place as the Germanic race to lord over the Â“inferiorÂ” races of the world, and they had shown the mentality all too well in this camp. But tonight would be different, Mr. Siah knew, even has he was deafened and rattled by flying glass caused by the swarms of Banshees as they streaked past his camp. While the Richens cowered and found nothing but fear and death in those missiles, every single Singabolen inmate who was aware of the missiles knew that their salvation and hope was heralded in by these technological constructs. The free people of the world were coming, they had not been forgotten.<br><br></div>
