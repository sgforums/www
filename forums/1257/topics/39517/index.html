            <div class='col-md body'>1. How do I declare war? How do I trade? How do I set up a peace treaty?<br><br>Currently, there is no system for doing any of those. Therfore, all of this must be roleplayed. For instance, if you would like weapons, make a post saying "Requesting Weapons." If anyone accepts this, then they'll respond with something like, "we'll be willing to give you weapons for a price of 1000 dollars."<br><br>2. So... it's not actually happening?<br><br>Correct.<br><br>3. Are they going to make a system in the future that doesn't rely on role-playing?<br><br>Possibly.<br><br>4. Okay, since it's all role-playing, I'm going to take over the world! I launch fifty nukes at every country!<br><br>First off, that wasn't even a question. Second off, that doesn't make much sense. Even though it is role-playing, there are limits and it's trusted that you're creative enough to work with those limits. For instance, if you just created your country five minutes ago, it's doubtful you even have nuclear weapons.<br><br>5. You're wrong! Aliens gave them to us.<br><br>That is called "God-modding." If you're going to role-play, at least make it believable. Other examples of God-modding:<br><br>-Having a giant force field that protects you from missiles<br>-Having technology that allows you to blow up the entire world<br>-Having millions of dollars when you've got an imploded economy that is heavily dependant on basket-weaving and trout<br><br>6. Well that stinks. What do I do now with my country besides eat some trout in a basket?<br><br>What would a real nation do? Think about that. You might want to apply for international aid. Or maybe offer to sell some land in your country.<br><br>7. I'm ready to declare war! Seriously this time though. I've been around for about a month now, my economy is very healthy, and we have a well-funded military along with tons of allies. What do I do?<br><br>Well first off, there should be a reason for every war. If you're a harmonious democracy with great civil rights who's been an advocate of world peace, don't just go out and say that you want to conquer the world. Come up with a reason, it makes it a lot better.<br><br>8. Okay, I've got a great reason; they stole my trout.<br><br>You can only say that if they actually posted it. Never make things up on behalf of a nation. And if they really did post it, are you sure you don't want to peacefully solve this?<br><br>9. Yes! Just let me declare war!<br><br>Okay then, post that you're declaring war. Make sure that the person who you're declaring war on responds. You can never make up actions for them, so don't say "I attacked you and you lost, you surrendured." After you get the go from your opponent, you might want to lay down the rules of the war with them and get someone to moderate it to make sure you're not God-modding. But remember, make it creative. A war shouldn't be like this:<br><br>PERSON 1: I attack.<br>PERSON 2: I attack back.<br>PERSON 1: I attack again.<br>PERSON 2: I attack back again.<br>PERSON 1: I attack.<br>PERSON 2: I attack.<br>PERSON 1: I attack.<br>PERSON 2: I... DEFEND! Didn't see that coming did you?<br>PERSON 1: I kill your defense.<br>PERSON 2. I attack!<br>PERSON 1: Then I attack back!<br>PERSON 2: I attack!<br>PERSON 1: I attack!<br>PERSON 2: Okay forget this, I'm gonna get a soda.<br><br>Be creative with your wars. They're never going to end if both of you just keep attacking each other endlessly until you get bored.<br><br>10. Let C be the curve in R3 defined by the parametric equations:<br>x(t) = cos(et)<br>y(t) = sin(et)<br>z(t) = et<br>For t in [0,2]. What is the length of C?<br><br>Square root of 2(e^2-1)<br><br>11. Added by Darkskye: What happens if somebody Godmods against me? What do I do if a nation launches 3057205712306893721067132 nukes at me...even though they were created 3 seconds ago! Help!<br><br>First off, ask the person to please be serious. RP is a serious buisness. If not, then smile and walk away and pretend it never happened. There is no reason to get worked up/upset/or keep playing if the person will not be serious about this.<br><br>12. Added by Xen: Other people won't RolePlay with me, what do I do?!<br><br>First of all, post very frequently, over the period of a week. Eventually, people will have to, in SOME form or way acknowledge your presence. Then you will be treated like a regular!<br><br>13. Added by New Caithness: I was polite. I contacted the nation I wanted to go to war\trade\otherwise interact with, and they're ignoring me. Does that mean I can just do what I want?<br><br>I set up a situation, using all the information available to me. I engineered it so that it was a can't-miss proposition on my nation's part-there was no way they could avoid what I was doing. They disregarded\made something up to prevent my action. Aren't they cheating?<br><br>No to both. Any roleplaying done via posts is free-form, and the only real rule is that everyone controls their own creation; only they can decide what really happens to it. They have the right to disregard you, especially if you are calling the effect of your action.<br><br>In short, in free-form roleplay, you have the right to take a swing at someone -- but only they have the right to say whether you managed to hit them.<br><br>14. I want to roleplay something different, but everyone isn't roleplaying on my level.<br><br>You don't have to be directly effected by the whole world if you've decided to make a nation 1000 years ago in the magical island of Tikitoki. There are many different role-playing "worlds" so to speak. A modern one, a future one, and even one that takes place in the 19th century. You can choose to role-play on whatever level you want.<br><br>15. Thanks for all of the information! Could you please give me a quick rundown?<br><br>No.<br><br>16. You stink.<br><br>Just kidding. Okay, here we are:<br><br>DO NOT roleplay for other nations (unless there is some form of communication)<br>DO NOT God-mod<br>Your role-playing SHOULD BE AFFECTED by your nation's current status in the game<br>BE CREATIVE when you role-play<br>If someone is God-modding or just being plain stupid, THEY WILL BE MODERATED</div>
