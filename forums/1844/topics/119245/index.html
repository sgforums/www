            <div class='col-md body'>Top 10 Hair Myths<br><br>There are many many myths about hair, and sadly perhaps, even hair stylists who should know better circulate some of this Hair Voodoo. Here are the scientific FACTS about the top 10 hair myths:<br><br>1.  Cutting your hair makes it stronger or grow faster.<br><br>Bull winkle. Its hair, not a lawn. Exactly where this myth started is unknown, but is probably related to the observation of men's facial hair. There are different kinds of hair on your face and head. Hair on your head and facial hair have different properties. Cutting your hair will only make it shorter and hairs grows almost exactly half an inch per month, no matter what you do or take.<br><br>2.  Split ends can be repaired.<br><br>Sorry Charlie, not true. Split ends cannot be repaired and should be cut off immediately or they will split yet higher and do yet more damage.<br><br>3.  Brushing your hair is good for it.<br><br>To the contrary, brushing your hair is very very very bad for your hair and the leading contributor to split ends and hair breakage. By all means groom your hair, but once it is in place, STOP.<br><br>4.  Tight hats cause baldness.<br><br>This one probably started in the military where young men entering the service were required to wear hats and soon showed signs of going bald, or at least of hair thinning. This is due to coincidental timing. The age that young men enter the military is also the same age that male pattern hair loss begins. This is due to dihydrotestosterone, not hats. Hats do cause hair breakage and to a lessor degree to split ends.<br><br>5.  Hair can turn gray or white over night.<br><br>What utter nonsense. This one was born in literature. What part of "fiction" did you not understand? Hair receives its color genetically and can only turn gray or white over very long periods of time. Actually the hair doesn't turn white in as much as the hair loses color, but not over night, or even a wild weekend.<br><br>6.  Pluck one gray hair and two grow back.<br><br>Folks, if this were true I would be pulling my hair out by the fist full. I need more hair and can always color the gray hair.<br><br>7.  Baldness is inherited from the mothers side of the family.<br><br>More Hair Voodoo. Male and female pattern hair loss can be inherited from either side of the family and may or may not skip many generations. Male pattern hair loss usually begins at age 18 to 20 and female patter hair loss between ages 45 and 55.<br><br>8. Dandruff is caused by dry scalp.<br><br>Dandruff and dry scalp are two entirely different things. A good shampoo and conditioner will take care of the dry scalp, which is 'flaking'. Dandruff shampoos such as "Head and Shoulders' are entirely unnecessary and inadvisable.<br><br>Dandruff is a serious health issue and requires medical attention and prescribed medication. The 'flakes' are actually oily, not dry. Very very few people have actual dandruff and you would know it if you did.<br><br>9.  Dandruff is contagious.<br><br>No. You already have the micro organism that causes dandruff, yours just aren't as active. On the other hand, there are plenty of nasty things you can get from someone else's comb or brush, so be careful.<br><br>10.  Cutting your hair during a full moon makes it grow in healthier, fuller, faster or longer.<br><br>Give me a break. I am not even going to dignify this one with an explanation. Hey, if you buy into this type of earth muffin drivel, by all means, mark the dates on your calendar.<br><br>END<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>adapted from a website<br></div>
