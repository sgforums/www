Not<br>wanting to disturb anyone she gently lifted up the baby and took<br>it back to her station. Feeling the baby's forehead, she found it was cold<br>and with a sudden panic she realized that the infant was dead. Calling upon<br>a doctor she knew to be on board, he examined the baby and confirmed that,<br>not only was it dead, but it was embalmed. The child's body had been<br>hollowed out and it was full of the drugs that the couples were trying to<br>smuggle into the States.<br><br>Story Two -<br><br>A young lady is alone in her apartment. She goes to bed with her dog on the<br>floor beside her. In the middle of the night, she is woken up by a strange<br>sound. She is alarmed, but reaches down to the dog, who licks her hand. She<br>is reassured and goes back to sleep. In the morning, she finds the dog hung<br>in the shower. Where the dog slept, she picks up a note which reads 'Humans<br>can lick too"<br><br>Story Three -<br><br>A woman living in the city {Salt Lake} was visiting some friends in Ogeden.<br>When she got into her car in front of this friend's house, she noticed that<br>a car started up right behind her car. It was about 2:00 in the morning, and<br>there weren't any other cars on the road. After she had driven to the<br>highway, she began to think that this car was following her. Some of the<br>time he would drive up real close to her car, but he wouldn't ever pass. She<br>was really scared to death and kept speeding to try to get away from him.<br>When she got to Salt Lake, she started running stop lights to get away from<br>him, but he would run right through them too. So when she got to her<br>driveway she pulled in really fast, and this guy pulled in right behind her.<br>She just laid on the horn, and her husband came running out. Just then, the<br>guy jumped out of the car, and her husband ran over and said, 'What the<br>hell's goin' on here?" So he grabbed the guy, and his wife said,"This man's<br>follo wed me all the way from Ogden." The man said, 'I followed your wife<br>because I was going to work, and as got into my car, I noticed when I turned<br>my lights on, a man's head bob down in her back seat." So the husband went<br>over to her back-seat, opened the door, and there was a deranged man sitting<br>on the floor with a knife in his hand.<br><br>Story Four -<br><br>Two roommates remain at their deserted college dormitory over a holiday<br>break. One of the girls goes out on a date that evening, and the other one<br>turns in and goes to bed before her roommate returns. Later that night the<br>sleeping girl is awakened by gurgling and scratching noises coming from<br>outside the hallway door. Frightened, she locks the door and cowers inside<br>the room until morning. When the girl finally opens the door and ventures<br>outside, she discovers the bloody corpse of her roommate in the hallway. The<br>murdered girl's throat had been slit, and she had bled to death in the<br>hallway while clawing at the door.<br><br>Story Five -<br><br>In Berlin, after World War II, money was short, supplies were tight, and it<br>seemed like everyone was hungry. At that time, people were telling the Tale<br>of a young woman who saw a blind man picking his way through a crowd. The<br>two started to talk. The man asked her for a favour: could she deliver the<br>letter to the address on the envelope? Well, it was on her way home, so she<br>agreed. She started out to deliver the message, when she turned around to<br>see if there was anything else the blind man needed. But she spotted him<br>hurrying through the crowd without his smoked glasses or white cane. She<br>went to the police, who raided the address on the envelope, where they<br>found heaps of human flesh for sale. And what was in the envelope? A note<br>saying "This is the last one I am sending you today,"<br><br>Story Six -<br><br>A male flight attendant was stopping over at Japan. He went to a local bar<br>where a Japanese man and woman approached him. They chatted and had a drink;<br>the man gave him an old traditional Japanese drink. The next memory the<br>flight attendant had, was when he woke up in a bath of ice in a hotel room<br>with agonizing pains in his stomach. He managed to pull himself out the bath<br>and phone the police. He told them everything he could remember, the<br>policeman described the two people and the man said that's what they were<br>like. The policeman calmly told him to get back into the bath and sit there<br>till the police and ambulance had arrived, the man's kidneys had been<br>removed.<br><br></div>
