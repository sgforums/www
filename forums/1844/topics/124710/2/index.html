            <div class='col-md body'>I go way back on anime...<br><br>I used to watch those Bubble Gum crisis, City Hunter, Gundam F91(it was that far back), Kujaku<br>there was more kiddy ones like Saint Seiya, Maddox, Doreamon, Creamy Mammy.<br>There was adult ones  as well.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>I missed the succulent and elegant way the story was told. the closest to what I used to watch was Inuyasha. Nowadays the stories are rather "deep" where they seek about the meaning of life. Like Ghost in the shell. I tot it was too serious.<br>The gundam series is like the Shun Yi Chao or the Meteor Garden where there is such a long long conversation. The longest cartoon series I watched back then was the Robotech series but i didn't like the spin off which was Maccross.<br><br>Maybe like out TCS channel 8, the script writers are all dried up and don't have good stories to tell anymore.  The only nice one I saw was the Spirited Away.  With computer graphics, sometimes the art of animation lost the human touch...<br></div>
