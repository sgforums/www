After the first month, his mother came to visit, with reinforcements of whiskey and oatmeal.<br><br>"And how do you find the English students, Donald?" she asked.<br><br>"Oh, Mother," he replied, shaking his head sadly, "they're such terrible, noisy people: The one on that side keeps banging his head against the wall, and woon't stop; and the one on the other side screams and screams and screams away into the night."<br><br>"But Donald! How do you manage with those dreadful noisy English neighbours?"<br><br>"Well, mother, I just ignore 'em. I just stay here quietly, playing my bagpipes..."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Going to the Zoo<br><br>A blonde lady motorist was about two hours from San Diego when she was flagged down by a man whose truck had broken down.<br>The man walked up to the car and asked, "Are you going to San Diego?"<br>"Sure," answered the blonde, "do you need a lift?"<br>"Not for me. I'll be spending the next three hours fixing my truck. My problem is I've got two chimpanzees in the back which have to be taken to the San Diego Zoo. They're a bit stressed already so I don't want to keep them on the road all day. Could you possibly take them to the zoo for me? I'll give you $100 for your trouble."<br>"I'd be happy to," said the blonde. So the two chimpanzees were ushered into the back seat of the blonde's car and carefully strapped into their seat belts. Off they went.<br>Five hours later, the truck driver was driving through the heart of San Diego when suddenly he was horrified!! There was the blonde walking down the street and holding hands with the two chimps, much to the amusement of a big crowd.<br>With a screech of brakes he pulled off the road and ran over to the blonde. "What the heck are you doing here?" he demanded, "I gave you $100 to take these chimpanzees to the zoo."<br>"Yes, I know you did," said the blonde, but we had money left over---so now we're going to Sea World<br><br></div>

His plan worked. the two were quickly thrown out of the bar. they proceeded to do this in bars all over town without ever having to pay.<br>Finally the second man said, "Man, I'm drunk enough.

            <div class='col-md body'>Doctors Orders<br><br>The doc told him that masturbating before sex often helped men last longer during the act.<br><br>The man decided, "What the hell, I'll try it,"He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn't do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe.<br>Finally, he realized his solution. On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck. Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to masturbate.<br>He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to orgasm, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants.<br>Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, "What?"<br>He heard, "This is the police. What's going on down there?"<br>The man replied, "I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted."<br>Came the reply, "Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you're down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>muahuahaahahar !! This is funny sia... !!<br>MUST READ !!<br><br>The Parrot<br><br>A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird's mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity. John tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music, and anything else he could think of to clean up the bird's vocabulary. Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot; the parrot got angrier and even ruder. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer. For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he'd hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John's outstretched arms and said, "I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions, and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior." John was stunned at the change in the bird's attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued, "May I ask what the turkey did?"</div>

They decided on the word "Typewriter."<br>One day the husband told his five year old daughter, "Go tell your mommy that daddy needs to type a letter."<br>The child told her mother what her dad said, and her mom responded, "Tell your daddy that he can't type a letter right now cause there is a red ribbon in the typewriter." The child went back to tell her father what mommy said.<br>A few days later the mom told the daughter, "Tell daddy that he can type that letter now."<br>The child told her father, returned to her mother and announced, "Daddy said never mind with the typewriter, he already wrote the letter by hand."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Divorce Letter<br><br>Divorce letter<br><br>Dear Meg,<br><br>I know the counselor said we shouldn't contact each other during our "cooling off" period, but I couldn't wait anymore. The day you left, I swore I'd never talk to you again. But that was just the wounded little boy in me talking. Still, I never wanted to be the first one to make contact. In my fantasies, it was always you who would come crawling back to me. I guess my pride needed that. But now I see that my pride's cost me a lot of things. I'm tired of pretending I don't miss you. I don't care about looking bad anymore. I don't care who makes the first move as long as one of us does. Maybe it's time we let our hearts speak as loudly as our hurt. And this is what my heart says: "There's no one like you, Meg ."<br>I look for you in the eyes and breasts of every woman I see, but they're not you. They're not even close.<br><br>Two weeks ago, I met this girl at Erie House and brought her home with me. I don't say this to hurt you, but just to illustrate the depth of my desperation. She was young, maybe 19, with one of those perfect bodies that only youth and maybe a childhood spent ice skating can give you. I mean, just a perfect body. Tits like you wouldn't believe and an ass that just wouldn't quit. Every man's dream, right?<br>But as I sat on the couch being blown by this stunner, I thought, look at the stuff we've made important in our lives. It's all so superficial. What does a perfect body mean? Does it make her better in bed?<br>Well, in this case, yes, but you see what I'm getting at. Does it make her a better person? Does she have a better heart than my moderately attractive Meg? I doubt it. And I'd never really thought of that before. I don't know, maybe I'm just growing up a little. Later, after I'd tossed her about a half a pint of throat yogurt, I found myself thinking, "Why do I feel so drained and empty?" It wasn't just her flawless technique or her slutty, shameless hunger, but something else. Some nagging feeling of loss. Why did it feel so incomplete? And then it hit me. It didn't feel the same because you weren't there to watch.<br>Do you know what I mean? Nothing feels the same without you. Jesus, Meg , I'm just going crazy without you. And everything I do just reminds me of you.<br><br>Do you remember Carol, that single mom we met at the Holiday Inn lounge last year? Well, she dropped by last week with a pan of lasagna. She said she figured I wasn't eating right without a woman around.<br>I didn't know what she meant till later, but that's not the real story. Anyway, we had a few glasses of wine and the next thing you know, we're banging away in our old bedroom. And this tart's a total monster in the sack. She's giving me everything, you know, like a real woman does when she's not hung up about her weight or her career and whether the kids can hear us. And all of a sudden, she spots that tilting mirror on your grandmother's old vanity. So she puts it on the floor and we straddle it, right, so we can watch ourselves. And it's totally hot, but it makes me sad, too. Cause I can't help thinking, "Why didn't Meg ever put the mirror on the floor? We've had this old vanity for what, 14 years, and we never used it as a sex toy."<br><br>Saturday, your sister drops by with my copy of the restraining order. I mean, Vicki's just a girl and all, but she's got a pretty good head on her shoulders and she's been a real friend to me during this painful time. She's given me lots of good advice about you and about women in general. She's pulling for us to get back together, Meg, she really is. So we're doing Jell-O shots in a hot bubble bath and talking about<br>happier times. Here's this girl with the same DNA as you and all I can do is think of how much she looked like you when you were 18. And that just about makes me cry. And then it turns out Vicki's really into the whole anal thing, that gets me to thinking about how many times I pressured you about trying it<br>and how that probably fueled some of the bitterness between us. But do you see how even then, when I'm thrusting inside your baby sister's cinnamon ring, all I can do is think of you?<br><br>It's true, Meg. In your heart you must know it. Don't you think we could start over? Just wipe out all the grievances away and start fresh? I think we can. If you feel the same please, please, please let me know.<br><br><strong>Otherwise, can you let me know where the fucking remote is.</strong><br><br>Love, Jimmy<br><br>MEN !!! humph !!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Affairs!<br><br>The First Affair<br>A married man was having an affair with his secretary.<br>One day, their passions overcame them and they took off for her house,where they made passionate love all afternoon. Exhausted from the wild sex, they fell asleep, awakening around 8:00 p.m.<br><br>As the man threw on his clothes, he told the woman to take his shoes outside and rub them through the grass and dirt.<br>Mystified, she nonetheless complied. He slipped into his shoes and drove home.<br>"Where have you been?" demanded his wife when he entered the house.<br>"Darling, I can't lie to you. I've been having an affair with my secretary and we've been having sex all afternoon. I fell asleep and didn't wake up until eight o'clock."<br><br>The wife glanced down at his shoes and said, "You lying bastard!<br>You've been playing golf!".<br><br>The Second Affair<br>There was a middle-aged couple that had two stunningly beautiful teenage daughters. The couple decided to try one last time for the son they always wanted.<br><br>After months of trying, the wife finally got pregnant and sure enough, delivered a healthy baby boy nine months later.<br>The joyful father rushed into the nursery to see his new son.<br>He took one look and was horrified to see the ugliest child he had ever seen. He went to his wife and told her there was no way he could be the father of that child.<br>"Look at the two beautiful daughters I fathered!"<br>Then he gave her a stern look and asked, "Have you been fooling around on me?"<br>The wife just smiled sweetly and said, "Not this time!"<br><br>The Third Affair<br>A mortician was working late one night. It was his job to examine the dead bodies before they were sent off to be buried or cremated.<br><br>As he examined the body of Mr. Schwartz, who was about to be cremated, he noticed the size of his manhood.<br>I'm sorry, Mr. Schwartz", said the mortician, "but I can't send you off to be cremated with a tremendously huge private part like this. It has to be saved for posterity."<br><br>With that, the mortician used his tools to remove the dead man's private bit. He stuffed his prize into a briefcase and took it home.<br><br>The first person he showed it to was his wife. "I have something to show you that you won't believe," he said, and opened up his briefcase.<br><br>"Oh my God!" the wife screamed, "Schwartz is dead!"<br><br>Fourth Affair<br>A woman was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband opening the front door.<br>"Hurry," she said, "stand in the corner." Then she quickly rubbed baby oil all over him and then dusted him with talcum powder.<br><br>"Don't move until I tell you to," she whispered.<br>"Just pretend you're a statue."<br>"What's this, honey?" the husband inquired as he entered the room.<br>"Oh, it's a statue," she replied nonchalantly. "The Smiths bought one for their bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too."<br><br>No more was said about the statue, not even later when they went to sleep. Around two in the morning, the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk.<br><br>"Here," he said to the statue, "eat something. I stood like an idiot at the Smiths for three days and nobody offered me as much as a glass of water."<br><br>The Fifth Affair<br>A man walks into a nightclub one night. He goes up to the bar and asks for a beer. "Certainly, Sir, that'll be 1 cent."<br><br>"One Cent?", exclaimed the man. The bartender replied, "Yes."<br>So the man glances over at the menu and asks, "Could I have a nice juicy T-bone steak, with chips, peas and a fried egg?"<br><br>"Certainly Sir," replies the barman, "but that comes to real money. A whole 4 cents."<br>"Four Cents?", exclaimed the man. "Where's the guy who owns this place?" The bartender replied, "Upstairs, with my wife."<br><br>The man says, "What's he doing upstairs with your wife?"<br>The bartender replied, "The same thing as I'm doing to his business."<br><br>The Sixth Affair<br>Jake was dying. His wife, Becky, was maintaining a candlelight vigil by his side. She held his fragile hand, tears running down her face.<br><br>Her praying roused him from his slumber. He looked up and his pale lip began to move slightly.<br><br>"Becky my darling," he whispered. "Hush my love," she said. "Rest, don't talk." He was insistent. "Becky," he said in his tired voice,I have something that I must confess."<br>"There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping Becky, "everything's all right, go to sleep."<br>"No, no. I must die in peace, Becky. I .... I slept with your sister, your best friend, her best friend and even your mother!"<br><br>"I know, my sweet one" whispered Becky, "that's why I poisoned you."<br><br>Carpe looks at Larling Gackt... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
