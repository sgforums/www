In fact, I have a 20 year old bride who's pregnant and having my child. What do you think of that !!!"<br><br>The doctor thinks for a second and then says,"Let me tell you a story. I know this guy who's an avid hunter. He never misses a hunting season. But one day he's in a hurry to go hunting and he accidentally grabs his umbrella instead of his rifle. So he's in the woods and suddenly a giant grizzly bear appears out of nowhere. He raises his umbrella, points at the bear, squeezes the handle and the bear drops dead in front of him. What do you think of that?"<br><br>The old man says, "That's impossible. Someone else must have shot that bear!".<br><br>"EXACTLY" says the doctor.<br></div>
