            <div class='col-md body'>Most definitely yes. However, there are people like yourself who may not enjoy interacting with kids. Nothing wrong with that.<br>What is really the problem are fathers wanting children but do not invest their time and energy on these kids and hope that these kids will turn out well. Nothing ventured nothing gain. Parenting is a full time job and anyone not willing to make some sacrifices should not go into it.</div>

I have two cousins and they come to my house sometimes. Both of them are very 'touchy'. Most of the things that is fragile or very important, we usually kept them out of their sight. They is one time when my mother forget to keep the keys for the cupboard, which is still intact on the door. My llttle cousin locked the cupboard and hide the keys. We only found out the key is missing when dad want to get some clothes from the cupboard at nite. We search for nearly one hour just to find the keys, not to mention ativiate my auntie to ask my cousin for the key's location... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But although they are naughty, but I still find them very cute...My litter cousin will put his both hands together and pray beside me when I am offering incense to the god.
