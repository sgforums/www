            <div class='col-md body'>Aries<br><br>These bold, arrogant and confident creatures are not afraid to flash a little leg or boast a low-cut top. When it comes to fashion, female Rams are self-styled leaders who love flashy, glamorous and sexy clothes. They are also the first to parade around in the latest trends.<br><br>They are also perfectionists who are hesitant to debut a new outfit until it has been outfitted with all the right accessories. They love expensive designer clothes but their thrifty side will settle for a decent imitation of Prada or Gucci. Plush velvets and vivid silks in colors such as red, yellow and gold suit the female ram's conception of herself as "royalty."<br><br>At work, the Ariesian female likes to stand out in a crowed by adding a pair of high-heels or sexy stocking to an otherwise straight looking skit. They love the style of the forties and details such as piping, kick-pleats and rounded collars. They also adore pea coats and long wool coats paired with a pair of high heel leather boots.<br>This demanding fire sign loves the flash of rubies and diamonds and is fond of wearing watches that display two time zones, even if they are not jetsetters.<br><br>By: Samantha Stevens<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taurus<br><br>Female bulls are homebodies so they don't tend to splurge their family budget on family. Their closet is often packed with clothing that reflects their love of practical activities such as gardening, cooking and home renovation. They are fond of inexpensive and utilitarian clothing such as khakis, jeans and sweatshirts and by easy-to-care for fabrics that can just are thrown in the wash. As they spend a lot of time outdoors, their closets are usually jammed with ski-jackets, pack-pats and work-boots.<br><br>Taurus Females dress more casually than most people at the office and are the type to wear the same thing to work every day. A cozy sweater worn over a ruffled blouse with a knee-length skirt is a typical outfit. As they tend to be heavier than most women in the Zodiac, they tend to wear a lot of "slimming black".<br><br>They have simple tastes in lingerie and consider a long white cotton nightgown to be just a sexy as any item bought from Victoria's secret. For more elegant affairs, bulls look best in empire style gowns that emphasize their busts and conceal their tummies.<br><br>Taureans tend to dislike wearing a lot of jewelery, as it gets lost or dirty, however one item loyal Bulls will never take off is their wedding ring.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Capricorn<br><br>Capricorns are blessed them with natural good taste and an eye for quality and durability. They tend to purchase timeless individual pieces and prefer well-tailored, conservative items in colors such as rose, grey, navy blue, sky blue and camel. This sometimes self-conscious sing prefers long sleeves to short sleeves and high collars to plunging cleavages. They also like vintage clothing, as long as it is in pristine condition.<br><br>Capable Capricorns like to add delicate feminine touches to power suits such as diamond earrings or an antique pin.<br><br>Female Cappies, often boast perfectly organized closets filled with classic items such as open-toed slingbacks, patent leather purses, crisp white blouses, navy suits, black cocktail dresses and well fitting jeans. They also treasure hair accessories such as tortoise shell clips and satin bows.<br><br>They love gemstones, in all colors of the rainbow, but would most value a classic piece such as a diamond tennis bracelet, an antique cameo or a pendant that sports their initials<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aquarius<br><br>These graceful, thoughtful and sensitive creatures are very concerned about what others think of them. They tend to choose clothes that make a strong, expressive personal statement. They love brilliant tones of purple, gold, sky-blue, ruby-red and emerald green.<br><br>At work Aquarian females tend to dress slightly more eccentrically than their colleagues. They are fond of patterns, plaids and pinstripes as well as unusual fabrics such as herringbone, tweed, seersucker and poplin. They have a jaunty sense of style, and often perk up an outfit by sporting a beret, a bright hair band or a large and funky piece of costume jewelry.<br><br>They detest extravagance and love to shop for clothes at flea markets, vintage shops and retail outlets. They are attracted to one-of-a-kind items such as hand-knit sweaters and caps and crocheted ponchos and shawls. Yet, at the same time they love the feel and tight-fit of Lycra and futuristic polyester blends. Sometimes they can seem very "space-age" in their streamlined, zippered black suits. For a night out, a female Aquarian will choose unusual pieces, such as a white sequined skirt, purple cowboy or a top made of a glittering mesh of gold chains.<br><br>Aquarians love jewelry that has an antique or futuristic look and tend to purchase unusual or one of a kind pieces to compliment their eccentric outfits.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Libra<br><br>Venus rules sensual Libra natives, so they are very tactile. Their sense of touch has a lot to do with how they choose clothing, and they prefer silks and cottons to scratchy wools. Librans can be surprisingly finicky about clothing, and they are the first to visit a tailor if the cut of a suit or a dress is not quite right. This sign loves balance and beauty and believe that clothing should perfectly compliment the figure.<br><br>At work, power-dressing Librans will choose sleek, tailored suits in jewel-tones or slimming black. They are not much for frills or an excess of jewelery and prefer to sport gold hoops or simple pearl studs as earrings.<br><br>For relaxing, they prefer well-fitting casual clothing in their favorite colors, pink and black. Librans love Capri pants and similar items that are sexy as well as practical.<br><br>For an evening out, simplicity is the key to the Libran style. They either prefer tight clothing, such as the little black Lycra dress or they will dress in a theme that subtly reminds you of another era, such as the 1970s or the 1950s. Librans have a delicate sense of balance so they prefer flat heels to high heels. When it comes to looking fashionable, they definitely believe, like Jackie O, Katherine Hepburn and Audrey Hepburn that "less is more."<br><br></div>
