I have tried my hardest to apologize sincerely and tek initiative to maintain the friendship... or probably this person have been wanting to freeze the friendship and this is simply a good cause for getting mi off that person's chest... mayb this is an accusation but i know that too well in my heart... its juz a one-sided friendship... sad to admit loh...<br><br>i'm feeling very pissed at myself... wanna know what have I said that pissed that person off??!! I saw that person's photos when he is young (coz he showed mi) and i merely mentioned "ooh, u looked skinny when u are young..."... that person is freaking angry and scolded mi for being so shallow to comment on people's looks... i'm reali not trying to critisize !! Its reali reali oni mean to be a passing remark.... i'm so freaking upset over this...<br><br>Have happened few weeks ago (when i started this thread) and to this very minute it stil stabs mi like hell... I've learnt my lesson and will never say anything abt people's looks anymore !! whether a praise or insult (which i have never insulted anyone on their looks before and i'm not a person to say this kinda thing !!), NEVER again will i say a single word on this !!! ooh God, what a sinner I am now... that person will never talk to mi again...<br><br>ARGHHH !!! feel like killing myself for saying it... such a shitty feeling....</div>
