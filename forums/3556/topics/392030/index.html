              <p>My name is jampa and today I have founf the sgForum so interesting and without wasting a minute I became one of the member of this site. The second thing that attracted me most is the presence of Dorje Shugden subject in this dicussing format, therefore, I like to express how i have felt in the past, feeling at present , will feel in near future on the controversy which have created chaos amongst the Buddha Dharma practioner throughout the world even in Singapore non shugden societies avoid or discriminate Shugden prationers without any hasitation, I must say that this inhuman act will not lead to anywhere except to the dreadful hell where suffering is eternal.  <br>The controversy was intendtionally created by people in order to take advantage politically but many poeple still in ignorance and some delibretely do not want to figure out whats realistic bihind this conspiricy. In my point of view, the politic should be separated from any kind religion at any cost, because one is full deception, false, hatered etc and another is full of love, peace, honesty, respect, harmony etc. so how can these two be combined since their difinations are totally opposite. So the point is the politic belongs to a place where it suit and religion belongs to where it suits. So far in the history of world, how many people killed in the name of religion which mixed with politics, it is a good example or lesson for us to look at and learn.</p>
              <p>  There is not a single war, civil war, conflict, controvercy etc. that really caused by a religion -Jampa</p>

              <div>These day some people use the controversy relating
              Dorje Shugden as a soft weapon to target or aim to gain their personal
              needs and fulfill unfinished business, this might sounds strange to you
              but thats the inconvenience truth about the Tibetan communities its
              exile government. So far, there have been some individual and
              organization who had refused and protested against the unacceptable
              decisions made by DL gov, later, an individual became invisible,
              treated as if traitor or moved permanently in abroad, the organization
              had been unapproved, pressured to shut down or separated. These are
              have been most priority agenda throughout its history and are very
              typical implementation of the government. There is one one in the
              Tibetan History who had refused or protested against it and lived
              happily ever after either they were imprisoned or terminated or treated
              as if enemy of the state rest of their lives. So these tell us there is
              nothing any value in name of democracy and human rights because freedom
              of expression is the fundamental right in terms of HR. We seek your
              kind support in order to restore the peace and harmony amongst Tibetan
              and Western Buddhism that we used to have. The Dorje Shugden
              Controversy is just a given name, it has really nothing do with any
              other sects or religions.<br> The Shugden communities have expressed immense gratitude towards the
              other sects for their tireless effort to continue their great lineage. <br></div>
