            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Boredom</strong> s when someone perceives one's environment as dull, tedious, and lacking stimuli. There is an inherent anxiety in boredom; people will expend considerable effort to prevent or remedy it, yet in many circumstances it is accepted as an inevitable suffering to be endured. A common way to escape boredom is through creative thoughts or daydreaming.<br><br>The first record of the word boredom is in the novel Bleak House, by Charles Dickens, written in 1852, although the expression to be a bore had been used in the sense of "to be tiresome or dull" since 1768.<br><br>Time often seems to move more slowly to someone who experiences boredom; this results from the way in which the human mind measures the passage of time, combined with the infrequency of events perceived as notable.<br><br><strong>Causes</strong><br><br>Boredom can be a symptom of clinical depression; some boredom is a form of learned helplessness, a phenomenon closely related to depression. Some philosophies of parenting propose that if children are raised in an environment devoid of stimuli, and are not allowed or encouraged to interact with their environment, they will fail to develop the mental capacities to do so. These children are then bored even when placed in an environment others would find stimulating.<br><br>Boredom is often associated with adolescence, especially in suburbs, small towns, and other isolated areas. A typical teenager's complaint is that there is 'nothing to do'; this statement can have a number of economic and social causes.<br><br>Some people hold the belief that having too much spare time causes boredom; for example, parents might encourage their children to fill their time with extracurricular activities or homework. Others disagree, arguing that few environments are inherently 'boring', and that boredom reflects a lack of imagination, initiative and creativity.<br><br><strong>Practical effects</strong><br><br>Far from being a minor annoyance, boredom can have major negative impacts on people. Perhaps more importantly, boredom is often a symptom of deeper problems, such as depression, ineffective teaching, or ineffective management in a workplace. This can also be due to the fact that some people just communicate poorly.<br><br>Boredom in the workplace does more than just waste time. Studies in behavioral finance have shown that stock traders can enter into "overtrading" (buying or selling even without any objective reason to do so) because they feel bored when they have nothing "productive" to do. Boredom in the workplace also hurts people's sense of self-worth, which can cause them to work less effectively or even to not work at all.<br><br><strong>Philosophy</strong><br><br>Arthur Schopenhauer used the existence of boredom in an attempt to prove the vanity of human existence, stating: "For if life, in the desire for which our essence and existence consists, possessed in itself a positive value and real content, there would be no such thing as boredom: mere existence would fulfill and satisfy us."<br><br>Boredom also plays a role in existentialist thought. Without stimulus or focus, the individual is confronted with nothingness, the meaninglessness of existence, and experiences existential anxiety. Martin Heidegger states this idea nicely: "Profound boredom, drifting here and there in the abysses of our existence like a muffling fog, removes all things and men and oneself along with it into a remarkable indifference. This boredom reveals being as a whole."<br><br></span></div>
