              <p>Sorry for sidetracking, but I do not wish to get a new topic for such a trivial question.</p>
              <p>I'll be heading to Japan for about 6 months, during which 3 to 4 months will be in winter. It doesn't snow very often there but it does go as low as negative.</p>
              <p>Where can I get something nice to wear for it? And also, whats the likely damage? Plus, should I just getting a winter jacket or a winter coat? Coats are like those that stretch down to the knee or something.</p>

              <p><br>you can get it from those winter warehouse sale in those industrial estate. if it's not too cold jacket should do. coat may look overkill. One way is to buy pants that prevent wind from going thru. eg. leather jacket and pants or even ski pants.</p>
              <p>long john from those chinese emporum like yue hua may be cheaper and effective. i don't know if it would be cheaper in Japan but the last time I bought them in Beijing, it was so much more cheaper than Singapore.</p>

              <p>Well, since I'm at it and in the mood to write, I'll share with you how we planned for the coming one.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>One year ago, during our casual converasation, a friend of mine and and I talked about where we would like to visit. Mount Kilash came to mind. Mt Kilash is located at the western region of Tibet, near Ladhak.</li>
              <li>We got interested and started reading about the place. We found that there were 5 routes there. Via Kangar - Xinjiang (China), via Sikimot (Western Nepal, shortest but more rugged and hostile), via Qinghai - Xinjiang (China), via Kathmandu (Nepal), via Chengdu (China) and many others. Some were out of bound to foreigners.</li>
              <li>We narrowed down to Kathmandu and Chengdu as the rest of the places either requires a longer time or is hostile. Then we decides to go via air or overland. </li>
              <li>A drive thru Kathmandu requires a shorter time but we had wanted to see some site at the North. Therefore flying into Lhasa would be a perfect choice. Furthermore, if a new comer going to Tibet have not seen Potala Palace, it would be like going Beijing without visiting the great wall. Not that Potala is the grandest place, there are many place more beautiful than it but Potala is well known. Furthermore I would love to see Lhasa after 22 years.  </li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <ol>
              <li>Next alternative was via Chengdu. We would love to drive into Lhasa via Chengdu but it will take us 12 to 14 days to reach Lhasa. It would be nice but time and money was a factor and Chengdu have daily flight into Lhasa.</li>
              <li>Then we started to work on an itinerary for both Chengdu-Lhasa-Mt Kilash-Lhasa-Chengdu and Kathmandu-Lhasa-Mt Kilash-Kathmandu. Our itineraries took us many ding-dong (more than 10 discussions and emails) before something concrete came out.</li>
              <li>By then, we would have worked out the time required (in days) for the trip. Next, we started searching for air tickets cost and timing(Chengdu to Lhasa is everyday but Kathmandu to Lhasa is Tue &amp; Sat), a travel agency to work with in Kathmandu and Chengdu </li>
              <li>The travel agency is to help you with the Visa and Tibet Permit. Without them, you can't even step into Tibet. By this time, you can almost fixed a date and an estimated budget.</li>
              <li>We have worked out that it is cheaper to travel by Chengdu and would be the best because my friend and I had intended to stay back in Lhasa for another week to do some more treking. We have to think about those who do not have the luxury of time too.</li>

              <li>We did not abandon the alternative plan(via Kathmandu). You will never know if it is still usable.</li>
              <li>Anway the itinerary is still a skeleton. You need to ask if there are places that they wishes to visit. You need to still write down all the places at each destination you wish to visit and to priortise them. (must see and if can see). This time you need to look into the timing (open day/time) and the flow of the route.</li>
              <li>You should finish your itinerary by now. Now it's time to arrange for the necessary visa to Chengdu, confirm your air tickets and off you go. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></li>

              <p>There are many other little things you have to look into as well, such as currency , languages, visa and permit. For places like Tibet, you may need extra permit to visit certain places too, otherwise you can be fine by the Public Security Beura.You may not need to visa to most countries as Singaporean but it is only valid for stays less than 14 days. You have to look into these little regulations too otherwise it may affect your programme.</p>
              <p>You will have to work your way thru.</p>

              <p>I just came back from Phuket Thailand, and realised that I dont have really decent packpacking bagpack.</p>
              <p>Should get one, even if I dont backpack.  Cos it helps to have really bulk of luggage on the back instead of various little bags on handcarry.</p>
              <p>Those cabin bags on rollers arent easy to load into the overhead compartments because they are heavier.</p>
