              <p>Day 3 (<em><strong>Burberry Blue Label @ Ginza &amp; Dining @ Shiseido Parlour</strong></em>):<br><br>Woke up early to check the latest news on <strong>ANA</strong>. I was worried cause the airline was on strike the night before. I'd to ensure my flight was operating &amp; that I can fly to Tokyo safely. It was a such a relief when the concierge informed me that all flights returned to normal.<br><br>While at the domestic airport, I noticed that all flight announcements were made only in Japanese. Even though I've finished with an advanced in the language, I'd to listen carefully at the continuous announcements just to ensure there were no last minute changes. It's really tough for non-Japanese speakers to fly domestic or to move around the airport.</p>
              <p>Flight time was just an hour half &amp; it was soon over. I'd chosen to land at <em>Haneda</em> airport as it's much nearer to the <em>Conrad Tokyo</em>. The ride was just 15mins &amp; but look at the fare! There're 2 places in the world that one shouldn't resort to taking cabs unless necessary - London &amp; Japan. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327467540989601442" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 187px; cursor: hand; height: 299px; text-align: center;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/Se73gJ0b5qI/AAAAAAAABYY/fHfbEyZumpk/s320/taxi.jpg" border="0" alt="">I got out of the hotel as soon as I checked in. I reminded myself, I just have another 48hrs here..... so scram. <span class="fullpost"><br><br>My first stop was to head straight to <em><a href="http://www.burberry-bluelabel.com/"><strong><span style="color: #cc2288;">Burberry Blue Label</span></strong></a></em> at Ginza to check out the latest fashion. This is like a 'must-do' whenever I visit Tokyo. You can't find <strong>Burberry Blue Label</strong> in other parts of the world except Japan. The prices are cheaper than <strong>Burberry</strong> but sizes are much smaller. I guess it's because it's catered to a younger crowd, but that doesn't stop me from visiting.</span></p>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>It was love-at-first-sight for this pretty dress. I tried &amp; sure looked good in it with its figure-hugging cut but it's definitely too young for me. Gosh! Wish I was 10yrs younger.</div>
              <p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327468607204663922" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 309px; cursor: hand; height: 320px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/Se74eNx6onI/AAAAAAAABYg/v0N9-uZ7kTE/s320/BurbDress4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>
              <div>Then I saw this chic denim coat. It's so unique &amp; I love the roll-up cuffs. I chatted with a sweet Japanese sales staff, who told me they carry different designs &amp; colours at other outlets. Hence, I decided to pop by the boutique @ <em>Omotesando</em> since I'd be heading to <em>Harajuku</em> the next day.</div>
              <p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327468974481330050" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 289px; text-align: center;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/Se74zl_fz4I/AAAAAAAABYw/JWT_sbH4pfk/s320/Burb_Blue3.jpg" border="0" alt="">My feet were aching &amp; I longed for a foot massage. I stumbled upon this parlour &amp; requested for a 30min session. Prices were stiff but my feet forbade me to think wisely. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327469567755375026" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: hand; text-align: center;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/Se75WIHDUbI/AAAAAAAABY4/WoLk3ml6m64/s320/Foot.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="288" height="201"> I was invited for dinner at the <strong>Shiseido Parlour</strong> at <em>Ginza</em>. Wow! I didn't know <strong>Shiseido </strong>is in the food business too, &amp; own the whole damn building in the swanky <em>Ginza</em>. Gosh, I was impressed! <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327470642756790978" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 240px; cursor: hand; height: 320px; text-align: center;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/Se76UszXKsI/AAAAAAAABZI/p325EX-p75U/s320/S_Bldg.JPG" border="0" alt="">I was told the parlour was established in 1902. The entire building consists of a lounge, gallery, restaurants &amp; even a salon. Our restaurant was located on the 5th flr &amp; the elevator brought us right up to the restaurant's doorstep. Friendly staff greeted us &amp; offered to take our coats. The ambience is cozy &amp; it can be felt from the moment we entered the nifty restaurant.<img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327470810067299106" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: hand; text-align: center;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/Se76ecFS6yI/AAAAAAAABZQ/ZDRlw4a80Js/s320/S.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="281" height="204">My friend &amp; I each ordered a different cocktail - The <em>'Sakura Mony'</em> &amp; <em>'Plum Cooler'</em> @ ¥840 each. I prefer the <em>Plum Cooler</em> which is a mixture of Plum Wine &amp; Ginger Ale.</p>
              <p>Starter for me was <em>Assorted Hors-d'oeuvres</em> @ ¥2,250. I was delighted with the selection of roast beef, smoked duck, parma ham, sashimi. It was simply delicious. For main course, I chose the <em>Roasted Seafood with Sauteed Tomato &amp; Green Salad</em> @ ¥2,620. The dish comprised of a crab claw &amp; scallop with lots of greens &amp; I was happy with my choice. The <em>Strawberry Parfait</em> @ ¥1,680 was simply too sweet. I picked that simply because it was written on the menu as 'äººæ°—No.1ã�§ã�™', meaning <em>'Most popular choice'</em>.</p>
              <p>I was delighted to be presented a small bouquet of flowers just before leaving the parlour. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327476955378891266" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: hand; text-align: center;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/Se8AEJJwOgI/AAAAAAAABac/8_HjSdebjas/s320/S_Flower.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="265" height="190">Well, dinner was really nice. I thanked my friend for the wonderful meal &amp; went back to my hotel. When I returned to my room &amp; finally had time to settle down, I saw this cute little teddy sitting on my bed. For a moment, I've completely forgotten about my <em>Conrad</em> bear collection. This bear looked different from the others I have, this is much smaller &amp; it's so cute. I immediately dashed to the shower room to find my rubber duckling.<img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327478016417394050" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 234px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/Se8BB51C7YI/AAAAAAAABa0/fcvlcutbTKM/s320/Conrad.JPG" border="0" alt=""> I like this white one, compared to the yellow ducklings. I'm pleased &amp; I felt like a big kid. This is one joy I find when staying at the <em>Conrad.</em>  Click <em><a href="http://luxuryhaven.blogspot.com/2009/04/travel-burberry-blue-label-in-ginza.html"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>here</strong></span></a></em> for full-write-up &amp; more photos!</p>
