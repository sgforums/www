              <p><strong>Malaysia plays down risks after US advisory on Borneo</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 16 January 2010 1523 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has moved to reassure foreign visitors
              after a United States travel advisory warned of the risk of terrorist
              attacks in a Borneo tourist destination.
              <br> <br>Thousands of Westerners visit the state of Sabah annually,
              attracted by its scenery and world class diving, especially in waters
              off Sipadan, close to the troubled southern Philippines.
              <br> <br>The United States embassy in Kuala Lumpur said Friday there was
              "present concern" over resorts in isolated areas in eastern Sabah
              including Sipadan, where foreign hostages were snatched in 2000.
              <br> <br>"There are indications that both criminal and terrorist groups are
              planning or intend acts of violence against foreigners in eastern
              Sabah," the embassy said in a notice on its website.
              <br> <br> "The Abu Sayyaf group, based in the southern Philippines, has kidnapped foreigners in eastern Sabah in the past."
              <br> <br> But the Malaysian government sought to limit the damage, telling potential visitors procedures had been ramped up.
              <br> <br>"Security and intelligence there has been tightened tremendously
              and there have been no reported attempts or acts of terror, including
              against foreigners," Mohamed Tajudeen Abdul Wahab, national security
              council secretary was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times
              newspaper Saturday.
              <br> <br>The US advisory identified the destinations of Semporna, Mabul and
              Sipadan and called on citizens to "please avoid or use extreme caution
              in connection with any travel in these areas or locations."
              <br> <br>Mohamad Shafie Apdal, MP for Semporna dismissed the threat of
              attacks by Islamic militants and said the government had established a
              military base in his constituency to ensure security for tourists.
              <br> <br> "At least one or two platoons patrol our tourist-centred islands in Sabah," he was quoted as saying by the newspaper.
              <br> <br>In 2000, the Abu Sayyaf militant group snatched 21 people,
              including 10 foreigners, in Sipadan. It held them hostage on Jolo
              island for several months.

              <p><strong>Malaysia says US terrorist attack warning on Sabah "misleading"</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 19 January 2010 1226 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>UALA LUMPUR - Malaysia has urged the United States to review a
              travel advisory that warned terrorists are targeting Borneo tourist
              destinations, describing it as "wrong and misleading".
              <br> <br>The US embassy in Kuala Lumpur said last week there were
              indications that criminal and terrorist groups are planning strikes in
              isolated areas of eastern Sabah state on Borneo island, including the
              diving resort of Sipadan.
              <br> <br>Malaysia summoned US ambassador James Keith on Monday to register
              its concern, and insisted the security situation in Sabah "was not as
              perceived" in the travel alert, the foreign ministry said in a
              statement late Monday.
              <br> <br>"The travel alert had generated anxiety, confusion and surprise
              from Malaysian leaders and the public over the alleged security
              situation in the popular tourist resorts of eastern Sabah," it said.
              <br> <br>"(It) could create a wrong, misleading and negative impression to
              the outside world on the security situation in Malaysia as a whole in
              relation to terrorist threats."
              <br> <br>The foreign ministry said its deputy secretary-general Radzi Abdul
              Rahman urged the ambassador at the meeting "to review the warden's
              notice and travel alert in light of the existing sound security
              arrangement".
              <br> <br> US embassy officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
              <br> <br>Malaysian authorities have played down the warning, saying that
              security measures and intelligence-gathering in the area have been
              dramatically increased since foreign hostages were snatched there in
              2000.
              <br> <br>Other foreign countries have warned their citizens of the threat of
              attacks in Sabah -- which lies in Malaysia's half of Borneo, an island
              split with Indonesia -- but the US advisory was more specific on the
              areas targeted.
              <br> <br>It identified the destinations of Semporna, Mabul and Sipadan and
              called on US citizens to "please avoid or use extreme caution in
              connection with any travel in these areas or locations."
              <br> <br>In 2000, the Abu Sayyaf militant group kidnapped 21 people,
              including 10 foreigners, in Sipadan and took them to their base on Jolo
              island in the Philippines, holding most of them for several months.
              <br> <br>Tens of thousands of Westerners visit Sabah annually, attracted by
              its scenery and world-class diving, especially in the waters off
              Sipadan, which lies close to the troubled southern Philippines.
              <br> <br>Tourism is a major foreign exchange earner for Malaysia, which has
              seen its export-dependent economy hit hard by the global recession,
              contracting by a forecast 3.0 percent in 2009.
