            <div class='col-md body'>A natal chart is just a circular wheel divided into twelve pieces, whether equal pieces or not depends on the type of charting you use. Each piece on the wheel represents a house and a sign. The details of your birth will determine which planet goes into which of the houses and which of the signs. A natal chart can be described as a photograph, it stills the movement of the planets during your time of birth. It is useful as it can help one inteprete the own personality and explore the hidden side, as well as help one understand another. It can also offer a glimpse into the our past and future and some say even the past life and the future lives. However, It needs to be understood that we are born with certain predispositions, reflected in our natal chart, which then predispose us to meeting that particular experience. It just means that there is a high possibility, a susceptibility. Not that the chart says like that means like that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> The planets and houses have their own... meanings.<br><br>Here are some common terms that I'll explain:<br><br><img src="http://img25.photobucket.com/albums/v76/astro_wytch/wbPMoon.jpg"> <strong>Moon sign</strong><br>The Moon Sign is very simply- which sign the moon is parked in duing the time of our births.<br>The moon represents our instincts, moods, feelings, mothers, domesticated matters, inherited traits, unconscious responses to everyday situations, behavioural patterns and mannerisms, the ability to attract people (personal magnetism), imagination, and empathy. It also shows how you get along with woman, -regardless of your gender. The moon can show where your strong emotional attachments are. In a guy's chart, the moon/venus whows which type of female (male) he is drawn to, and for the gals, it's the moon/mars placement to note. A moon's position on the natal chart also shows where there is a strong, major interest in life.<br><br><strong>Ascendant/ Rising Sign</strong><br>Usually symbolises by initials ASC on the birth chart. The ascendant is also the first house. For example your first house is cancer, then your rising sign is cancer. The natal chart is cast counter-clockwise from the 9 o'clock position, and exactly at cusps of the first house, there you'll find the loyally waiting ascendant <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The ascendant represents our external approach towards life. Refering to the way in which we choose to view life and will often reflects the general impressions that we make. The ascendant will affect how much of ourselves we'll reveal to another or can be used to conceal another part of our nature. With the asc, only the outer facade will be revealed and not the essential person. It is said that if the sun acts as our <span style="font-style: italic;">essence</span> then the acsendant is our <span style="font-style: italic;">image</span>. The Ascendant effectively represents the outer surface of the personality, or the 'persona', as it's sometimes called. It will also influence external physical appearance and characteristics. The relationship between the Sun Sign and the Ascendant is moderated by the influence of the Moon, representing our instinctive reactions to life, where the adjustment of one's instinctive reactions/feelings/emotions requires energy from the Sun, one's essence, which is then transformed by these requirements of the Moon and passed onto the Ascendant. This end result is projected into the outer world.<br>The planet ruling the Ascendant is referred to as the Ruling Planet and its influence will be strongly felt in the birth chart. Any planets within close proximity to the Ascendant will also strongly influence the individual.<br><br><strong>Descendant</strong><br>The Descendant is directly opposite (180 deg) of the ASC. Falls on the cusps of the 7th house.<br><br>The Descendant relates to our experience of other people: that which we seek from them, give to them, and receive from them. It also indicates our capacity for commitment and intimacy. By understanding our descendants, and that of our partners, we can see how easily our energies blend others and recognizes where we might have to make adjustments... The sign on the descendant indicates the attributes we will project onto others, or the things that we seek to live through them, rather than us recognizing those qualities in ourselves. Also, our interaction with others is strongly coloured by planets near to the descendants. (For eg, Uranus close to descendant has the same effect as an aquarian descendant. Pluto close to desc has the same effect as a scorpio desc, saturn as capricorn, neptune as pisces etc. People with neptune close to desc or pisces desc may idealize their partner, not seeing them clearly and expecting love, rather than seeing their own capacity for unconditional love, or deception. )<br>When we recognizes the energetic qualities of our desc, we can understand our need for partnership and the terms on which we can enter into initmate relationships.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Midheaven</strong><br>Abbreviated M.C, standing for <span style="font-style: italic;">Medium Coeli</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Meridian</span> inside the natal chart, it is found at the highest point and located at the cusps of the 10th house.<br><br>The m.c indicates where we make our mark on the world, and is often linked to career choice. It shows where we seek recognition and what we strive for. The sign on the m.c may also indicate a specific vocation or the sphere of life in which we seek to express ourself. The m.c does also show how we "go for it", indicating how "me-orientated" we are in our search for success. The element in which the m.c is placed indicates whether or not one is able to sustain effort. (for e.g, fire and air signs are great idea people but lack stamina to carry them through. Earth may find difficulty getting started but are more likely to stay on course. Waters most likely to be swayed by emotional considerations.) It can also indicate where we express our sense of individuality and our sense of self worth.<br><br><strong>Imum Coeli</strong><br>Seen on the chart as I.C, located 180 deg from the M.C, and in the quadrant house system is found in the cusp of the... yep, 4th house~!<br><br>The IC refers to the least conscious part of ourselves, also refering to our foundations, our beginnings in life, our roots, and what we may have experienced through parental inheritance. It relates to our security needs and our relationship with the home and family life, how we fit in, how easily we explore our own depths and how we react to being known by others at our depths.<br>The MC and the IC both have symbolic parental associations.<br><br><strong>Aspects</strong><br>The aspects, simply put, are the relationships that planets have with each other. They describe whether planetary drives are able to harmonise with each other or whether there will be difficulties and tensions.<br><br>Aspects relate to the angular distance, a geometric relationship between 2 planets. The major aspects are <strong>conjunction (0 deg)</strong>, <strong>Sextile (60 deg)</strong>, <strong>Square (90 deg)</strong>, <strong>Trine (120 deg)</strong>, and <strong>Opposition (180 deg)</strong>.<br><br>There are also aspect patterns (for e.g, Grand Cross, Bowl, Kite, Grand Trine etc.)</div>

Each of the houses in your natal chart corresponds to, or is said to be "ruled by", a specific Astrological sign that represents a field of experience that challenges you to develop the qualities of it's corresponding Sign.<br><br>FIRST HOUSE  (ARIES is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to develop your own unique identity and present it to the world.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with personal appearance.<br><br>SECOND HOUSE  (TAURUS is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to define and refine your personal sense of values. The things, talents, and qualities that you treasure, cherish, enjoy, and hold on to for security are here.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with ; inner and outer talents and resources, personal values.<br><br>THIRD HOUSE  (GEMINI is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to organize personal experiences to form your own unique picture of the world, and then communicate your perceptions to others.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; brothers and sisters; basic education; eye-hand coordination and manual dexterity.<br><br>FOURTH HOUSE  (CANCER is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to develop your capacity for emotional closeness; to find a feeling of security ; and to face the effects your early childhood experiences had upon you.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; nurturing; inherited traits; unconditional love; the type of home you establish.<br><br>FIFTH HOUSE  (LEO is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to develop your creativity and self-esteem, and to find joy in living.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; children; enthusiasm; creativity; and motivation.<br><br>SIXTH HOUSE  (AQUARIUS is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to establish a relationship with group consciousness and contribute your gifts to community.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; humanitarian organizations; associations; friends; hopes, wishes and and ambitions; shared ideals.<br><br>SEVENTH HOUSE  (LIBRA is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to develop committed relationships with others.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; your attitudes toward spouses and partners; intimate relationships; friends; dealings with the public; what you look for in others.<br><br>EIGHTH HOUSE  (SCORPIO is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to boldly wrest all the powers of your psyche from the deep, dark underworld; focus all that power with ruthless intensity on the process of breaking down your reality structure into little pieces, then reassemble all the pieces into a new whole. Here is the place where all the taboos of society are addressed; where you dig into your own "internal garbage" to find the treasure hidden there. Think of a compost heap where all the bits of decaying food break down and eventually turn into fertilizer to nourish new growth.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; other peoples's resources (possessions, money); sex; death and regeneration.<br><br>NINTH HOUSE  (SAGITTARIUS is the natural ruler. )<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to broaden your philosophical perspectives and to realize your highest potentials.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; the higher mind; higher education; law; in-laws; grand children.<br><br>TENTH HOUSE  (CAPRICORN is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to earn respect and recognition in the world.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; ambition; status; reputation; career; the parent who set limits for you as a child.<br><br>ELEVENTH HOUSE  (AQUARIUS is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to establish a relationship with group consciousness and contribute your gifts to community.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; humanitarian organizations; associations; friends; hopes, wishes and and ambitions; shared ideals.<br><br>TWELFTH HOUSE  (PISCES is the natural ruler.)<br>This is the field of experience in which you are challenged to explore your inner depths in solitude and silence; to discern between illumination and illusion, between spiritual growth and escapism. Before you can transcend the definitions of reality that confine you, you must be willing to let go of them. These definitions often have to become uncomfortable before we want to let go of them. Disillusionment and the experience of "bad luck" can create the desire to move through and beyond what is causing the pain.<br>Traditionally this house is associated with; the unconscious; self undoing; sacrifice; karma; secrets; secret enemies; hospitals and institutions of confinement.</div>
