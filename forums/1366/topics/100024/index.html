The theory is that electromagnetic forces are somehow unleashed, usually from the earth, and create many odd effects and/or hallucinations.  How and why this occurs is still unknown.<br><br>The occultists will take this a bit further.  Colin Wilson mentions how he saw a dowser standing above an underground spring with his hands locked and acting as if in the grips of tremendous forces, while sweat poured down the dowser's face.  Colin Wilson, and other occultists, came to believe that dowsing was caused by a force from the earth that could be channeled, and poltergeist activity was merely a projection of that energy, rather than holding it within the body and/or object as a dowser does. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.kompaktkiste.de/cd/_abc/_p/psy003.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">RSPK:<br><br>What is recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis?  It is PK force that instantly creates changes around the PK Talent over and over again.  Here is a simple description of typical RSPK Focuses:<br><br>"One of the most striking features of the poltergeist phenomena is that in an overwhelming majority of cases a young person seems to be the unconscious agent of the effects.  In 95% of the cases it is a young girl; in 5% a boy or youth, says Price.  Moreover, sexual change or shock seems to be frequently associated either with the beginning or the cessation of the phenomena.  Puberty and adolescence are thus the periods favourable to the effects.  Price informs us that Eleonora Zugun's power vanished overnight with the first appearance of the menses; that the Schneider brothers were brilliant about puberty, but th effects waned as adolescence advanced; conversely, that Stella C's power became marked with sexual maturity; that in the case of Esther Cox, the phenomena which lasted a year were initiated by nervous shock following attempted sexual assault, and that moreover they attained their greatest strength every 28 days...Price also tells of an interview with the husband of Frieda W., a young Austrian medium, who informed him that at the height of his wife's sexual excitement in their early married life, ornaments would sometimes fall off the mantel piece in their bedroom; also that during menstruation...mediumship did not occur."--Raynor C. Johnson writes in The Imprisoned Splendor 1953<br><br>Whether by channeling the forces above, or by some other unknown means, the person demonstrates a psionic ability that can barely be controlled.  This goes into several realms and most mystifying to me includes apports, or objects teleported to the scene.<br><br>In one experiment, objects that continually seemed to teleport to a scene were sealed in a cabinet by parapsychologists.  When the objects reappeared, they went and saw that the seal had not been broken.  When they did break it, the objects were indeed gone.<br><br>It should be noted that objects will sometimes fly through something as if not there.  For example, eggs put in the fridge can smash against the wall, even though the door was closed and showed no sign of damage!<br><br>Another time stones were raining gently down on a house when, after thumping, suddenly materialized through the roof (causing no damage) and floated down to the feet of the witness.<br><br>Stone throwing is a very common poltergeist phenomena.  They often fall as if "sinking through water" and seldom cause damage.  When picked up, they are almost always hot to the touch.  In one case where stones did break a window, they only made one hole.  After that, every stone was the exact same size and followed the exact projectory so that it did no further damage to the window!<br><br>All poltergeist phenomena can be found all the way to ancient records, and were often categorized by what happened.  There is an unbroken continuity of poltergeist activity, non stop (even during times of skepticism and lack of attention to spirits and magick) into our present day.  There are laws on the books from ages ago relating to poltergeists, and even St. Cyprian recounts how the doctor of King Theodoric "endured flights of stone from within his home."<br><br>I have looked and asked in many places and cannot find that any geological tests were done on these rocks.  Or where the rocks were likely "apported from."  And do different Focuses (a Focus is the alleged center, usually a person, of poltergeist phenomena) manifest different rocks?  When a family afflicted by a poltergeist moves, and the stones continue to rain on them even after they have travelled hundreds of miles, are they the same kind of stones?<br><br>And is there any connection to the rare times that it rains frogs and fish?  As the frogs and fish survive the fall (although fish find themselves in need of water), it would suggest they also float down through the same field that the rocks do.<br><br>And while there seem to be spirits involved in a few cases, some say that these are merely Projections of the Focus empowered by PK, a view that is very much debated by several people who study this.  But in this section, I am looking at those who believe that this is merely the hidden powers of the mind unleashed and nothing more.<br><br>In such cases, voices have been known to speak from the air, or the Focus, and are often harsh and crude.  They are very much like the sad spirit entities that possess and torment humans in Ann Rice's novels actually (like crude, malicious little boys).  And in one case in the 70s, one such poltergeist, as in an Ann Rice novel, really did puncture people and seem to sip their blood (the Babylonians would call such a spirit an ekimmu).  But even in cases such as these, it is insisted by some that these are merely projections of a disturbed, PK mind.<br><br>D. Scott Rogo, author of *The Poltergeist Experience*, states that poltergeists of the 17th and 18th centuries often had manifestations of ghostly and scary animals.  Yet it is very rare in the 19th and 20th centuries.  Rogo believes that the reason there were more animals back then was the belief of the PK mind that the poltergeist phenomena surrounding the Focus was the work of witches. These animals were their demonic familiars delivering their destruction on those the witches had targeted.  Now that people no longer believe in witches as causing poltergeists, the familiars are no longer seen.<br><br>It should be noted that many old school occultists often describe creating astral constructs or shaping elementals to do their bidding.  They build up a resevoir of intense love (music, sweet incense, prayers, bright colors) or of hatred ( killing animals in bizarre ways, grim colors and incense) with acts of sympathetic magick that is then projected into their creation (usually called "charging" ) and projected towards the target of their spell.<br><br>Many who now favor the RSPK will say that poltergeists are created by intense emotional forces, very much like the occultists who tried this on purpose, which form these PK charged shells that act as spirits.<br><br>And while no person who was able to consistantly demonstrate psychokinetic abilities in the laboratory beyond affecting needles, pins, and paper clips by pushing them a few inches, they insist that in the laboratory, one cannot create the highly charged emotional turmoil -- such as rape -- that seem to create poltergeists in the home. (Let's hope it stays that way, people.)<br><br>Yet it should be noted that there are some common factors of these incidents that create questions.  For example, unlike other psi abilities such as telepathy, PK is definitely affected by proximity to the Focus.  It is as if an object affected somehow absorbs energy from the Focus, and when pushed, will go further and faster if the Focus is near, or will be pretty dull if the object is far away.  The "elementals" of constructs seem not to be constrained by distance. (One idea on this is that the PK force is built up and then contained within an astral construct, which unleashes its PK force for good or ill when the astral form reaches the Target.)<br><br>Another interesting piece of PK lore is called the PK Field. According to this theory a house has absorbed so much PK force that it actively puts out PK phenomena even when it is no longer being fed.  However, this seems unlikely to me considering what was discovered about PK Fields. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.cebunet.com/kirlian/sparks.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">*The PK Field*<br><br>The PK Field was called "the linger effect" when first noted by Graham and Anita Watkins at the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man in Durham.  They decided to follow up by testing a compass needle that their PK talent,Felicia Parise, affected.<br><br>Felicia had no difficulty in moving the compass needle by 15 degrees.  Yet even after Felicia was gone, the needle would return to the 15 degrees off the mark whenever they brought the compass back into the test area.  Even when the Watkinses brought in a magnet and a steel blade, the compass needle refused to moved from where Felicia had put it with her alleged PK powers.<br><br>As they decided to test the compass for malfunctions of other sorts, they noted as soon as they went 4 feet from the table, the needle returned to normal.  When they returned to the test area, the needle went back to its deviation.<br><br>Further tests showed that, with Felicia anyway, the "PK Field," or "linger effect," remained active for roughly 25 minutes.<br><br>The Watkinses created very carefully controlled tests to further study this and have found that even when PK is used to affect mice, the field stays with the mice and the area in which PK was used.<br><br>This linger effect may have gotten one study in trouble in the early years of PK testing.<br><br>A parapsychologists consistently got sixes on die rolls to the astonishment of other parapsychologists.  When he decided to do a control set without the PK, the die continued to come up 6, and it was decided that the die were somehow loaded.  Perhaps, though, they simply should have waited half an hour before doing the control rolls. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Some spirits even seem to have a sense of humor.  After a priest conducted an exorcism on a monk haunting such a house and proclaimed the exorcism a success, a candle came in and floated under the priest's nose. Another poltergeist levitated white gloves and pretended to be a conductor for singing xians.<br><br>However, not all are so funny, and I'm going to focus on one of the scariest poltergeists ever documented for this, the "Bell Witch" case.<br><br>Started in 1817 with the typical heralding of scratching and knocking noises, the Focus appears to have been a 12-yr-old girl called Betsy (formally named Elizabeth).  The poltergeist grew malevolent and begin to physically assault people.  The full range of poltergeist phenomena occurred, and then some.<br><br>One such unique instance was when the Bell Witch showed it could be two places at once by pulling the hair painfully of both Betsy and her father (who were in seperate rooms and waked from sleep).<br><br>The "witch" attacked nearly all, and pins and needles were teleported into food.  Oddly enough, Betsy often vomited up pins and needles to the mystified horror of witnesses.<br><br>An interesting aspect that suggests this was an independent Entity is this account given by friend of the Bell family, William Porter.  He was awakened when the Bell Witch attempted to rip off his clothing (something the Entity often tried with those she attacked).  He quickly threw the covers over the Entity which began to struggle.  He wrote:<br><br>"In an instant I grabbed the roll of covers in my arms and started to the fire, intending to throw the covers, Witch and all, in the blaze.  I discovered that it was very weighty and smelled awful.  I had not got halfway across the room before the luggage got so heavy and became so offensive that I was compelled to drop it on the floor and rush out of doors for a breath of fresh air. The odor emitted from the rolls was the most offensive stench I ever smelled..."<br><br>[I would like to take a moment to compare to another incident----<br><br>From Vampires Among Us by Rosemary Ellen Guiley<br><br>"A miller at D-- had a healthy servant-boy, who soon after entering his service began to fail.  He acquired a ravenous appetite, but nevertheless grew daily more feeble and emaciated.  Being interrogated, he at last confessed that a thing which he could not see, but which he could plainly feel, came to him every night about twelve o'clock, and settled upon his chest, drawing all the life out of him, so that he became paralyzed for the time being, and neither could move nor cry out.  Thereupon the miller agreed to share the bed with the boy, and made him promise that he should give a certain sign when the vampire arrived.  This was done, and when the signal was made the miller putting out his hands grasped an invisible but very tangible substance that rested upon the boy's chest.  He described it as apparently elliptical in shape, and to the touch feeling like gelatin, properties that suggest an ectoplasmic formation.  The thing writhed and fiercely struggled to escape, but he gripped it frimly and threw it on the fire.  After that the boy recovered, and there was an end to these visits."--Occult Review in 1924, by Dr. Franz Hartmann.]<br><br>Interesting enough, Betsy's father, John, gained the specific ire of the Entity calling itself the Bell Witch (yes, the Entity spoke, and would get into alot of trouble with its obscene and non-PC rantings now).  It swore to kill John Bell.  (Nandor Fodor, an expert on this phenomena and, while a believer in PK, a skeptic of spirits, believes that John was molesting Betsy and that the "Bell Witch" was a PK charged fragment of Betsy's mind that attacked her father.)<br><br>It should also be noted that like many poltergeists such as this, the Focus would become drained.  In this case, the Bell Witch and other voices would cease when Betsy would collapse in a faint.  While a few have suggested this 12-yr-old girl threw her voice to imitate several voices, including a grown man with a deep voice that caused the walls to shake, others compare Betsy to a medium.<br><br>Eventually, the voice of the Witch claimed to have "put some medicine for old Jack that would kill him."  John Bell later died, supposedly of poison teleported into his food.  The Witch shrieked with triumph when John Bell died.<br><br>In 1821, after 3 years of harassment (and shortly after the death of John Bell), long after such poltergeist activities should have stopped, an object like a cannonball rolled down the chimney and into the dining room where the family was eating, and turned into smoke.  The witch's voice cried, "I am going and will be gone for 7 years!"<br><br>According to Colin Wilson, the witch never returned.  But D. Scott Rogo says that there was documentation of the return of the "Bell Witch" 7 years later, although the Entity was much more subdued and lasted only 2 weeks (although she invaded other homes, which is extremely unusual) before disappearing for good. Dr. Philip Stander and Dr. Paul Schmolling also list the Bell Witch as having returned 7 years later.  Those who believe the Bell Witch is an independent entity that merely drew upon Betsy for its power note that upon the witch's return, Betsy was married and living elsewhere.  But those who insist it was Betsy claim that this was a fragment of Betsy's mind that had taken a life of its own, charged by Betsy's PK powers.<br><br>Here, to demonstrate that others at this time were haunted by "hags", I would like to comment that Sir Walter Scott described a patient who thought he was tormented by a hag every night at 6 in his home.  A doctor treating him offered to keep him company.<br><br>The patient seemed to have forgotten his terror and the doctor thought the night would pass without incident, but at 6 sharp, the patient suddenly went white and yelled, "The hag comes again!"  The patient saw the door come open and a hag fly in on a stick that was used by the hag to beat him senseless.<br><br>The doctor saw no changes, except for his terrified patient "beating at himself" (could he have been warding off the blows?) and was deemed psychotic.  Perhaps so, as this case does not include the poltergeist effects of the Bell Witch case, but it does seem possible to me that the doctor and the patient were in two different realities.<br><br>In Poltergeists &amp; The Paranormal by Dr. Philip Stander &amp; Dr. Paul Schmolling, the doctors list their conversation with a woman in NYC who was seemingly molested by a spirit that broke into her apartment (Ch. 5 Margo:  A Case of Incubus Attack?), and fit the poltergeist model while it lasted.  They found her credible, and list much of the taped interview with her background.<br><br>As Morpheus asks in The Matrix, "What is real?  How do you define real?  If real is what you can see and taste and touch, then reality is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."<br><br>Years ago, I saw some show, I think Unsolved Mysteries, in which people were being filmed while waiting to see a promised appearance of the Virgin Mary.  At the appointed time, many people saw the sun come flying down over their heads and Mary appeared.<br><br>The camera showed nothing, except for several people ducking in the same direction at the same time!  Other around looked around at the others a bit confused.<br><br>Yet those who had fallen to the hysteria reported not only Visions and Peace, but also demonstrated miraculous healings.  Real or not, it produced very real effects that were beneficial in this world.  This may be a benign manifestation of the forces that also produce the Bell Witch.<br><br>However it should be noted that in the late 20th century, benevolent witches and demonic xian spirits have also been appearing.  Do we create such entities by our belief, do we summon already existing entities by our belief, or are we merely creating phantasms on such entities in order to make sense of them, by whatever our beliefs are? </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

But these powers are very right brained and one must appeal to the poetry and sensibilities of the "right brain" as well as raise the energy needed to produce these effects.  The PK Field should be taken into account; these effects linger.  It is entirely possible that if someone's aura repells such a force that it would rebound upon the one who projected it.<br><br>The PK Field suggests that every half hour you repeat your chants on candles, or on medallions for occassional recharge, the magick worked could be much enhanced.<br><br>If you have spirit familiars, you should be careful that you use positive energy in "feeding" such spirits, for it is possible that in feeding them energy of Hatred, while powerful, it may either corrupt them, or give them a taste for such energy, and they could turn malevolent.  If that's what you want, fine, but I feel sorry for any guests you have!<br><br>It would seem important to me that one creates a truly sacred place for workings of magick, and keep to the practice of setting aside "virgin tools" for the use in witchcraft, as they really do seem to absorb the vibrations put into them and that this absorbed, emotionally charged place and tools would also be projected into your spell workings.<br><br>And think of when you move.  It takes awhile for a place to feel like "yours."  This could be by low level but constant PK projections of our aura that get absorbed.  In our magickal areas, I would say we should frequently use the same place as well as the same tools, and that these places would become particular wells of resevoir power that we could call upon in our magick.<br><br>After working magick, it might be a good idea to "ground" for 30 minutes before attempting to drive somewhere or do something that requires concentration.<br><br>It has been described elsewhere that poltergeist events are generally spontaneous while witchcraft and other occult techniques are planned and directed by the witch.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.clee.com/krause/Seance.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">"Philip" The following is taken directly from pages 173-4 of Poltergeists and the Paranormal by Dr. Philip Stander &amp; Dr. Paul Schmolling.  It is an experiment you might want to repeat:<br><br>In 1976, a privately funded organization of people who wanted to further their knowledge of parapsychology, the Toronto Society for Psychical Research, conducted an experiment to create a poltergeist out of a group of people's collective PK energy.  Some researchers call this Group PK, or PK-by-committee.  Step by step, eight individuals who never claimed to be psychic or to have had psychic experiences met once a week, creating a fictitious story of Philip, and then made "Philip" come to life.<br><br>As recounted by authors I.M. Owen and M. Sparrow (Conjuring Up Philip:  An Adventure in Psychokinesis, 1976), here are the essential elements of Philip's fictional biography, which were later filled in and elaborated by the group:  Philip, an aristocratic Englishman living in the 1600's, was unhappily married.  He subsequently fell in love with a gypsy woman.  His wife, in a jealous rage, caused the gypsy's death by accusing her of witchcraft.  Heartbroken, Philip killed himself.<br><br>After a full year of reviewing the elements of the story, elaborating on the details, producing a picture of Philip, engaging in meditation and then using the method of a Seance Circle as designed by K.J. Batcheldor, Philip was "born."  At first, members of the group felt vibrations from the top of the table, and then heard loud rappings.  A simple code was created and soon Philip answered one rap for "yes" and two for "no."  As the sittings continued, Philip was able to do more, much of it captured in very bright light by television cameras.  For example, if a member of the group walked into the room late, the table would rush across the room to the latecomer.  On other occasions, lights on a panel would flicker in response to verbal instructions.  At times the table would creak and groan as if something were trying to take it apart.  Toward the end of the experiment, the group witnessed the table raising three legs off the floor, sometimes sliding about the floor in a random manner, and at other times rocking and jumping as if Philip were being playful.  At the end of January 1974, the group made a documentary film, Philip, the Imaginary Ghost, which told the story of the experiment and captured movements of the table and sounds of the raps on film.<br><br>After reading this story, you may still question whether a discarnate personality, or ghost, produced the poltergeist phenomena.  In coming to grips with this question, it is important to note that, when Philip was asked questions about the fact of the 1600's, the time in which he "lived," often his answers were wrong simply because members of the group did not know the correct answers.  In fact, a lack of knowledge and uncertainty in the group resulted in raps that were hesitant, or loud scratchings at the bottom of the table.  This would lead us to believe that the phenomena were created by group PK and not an independent entity</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

She manifested odd electrical and magnetic phenomena.  Sometimes objects came toward her, other times, they were repulsed by her.  In one case, a chair was so repulsed that even several people holding the chair, it would be pushed backwards so that she could not sit in it.  (Suddenly, Magneto doesn't sound that outrageous!)<br><br>While many felt Angelique was in need of an exorcism, science would finally prevail in this case.  She was turned over to M. de Faremont who carefully studied her and documented the phenomena.  He was convinced that she could not fake it, especially after a heavy bin she passed by would effortlessly levitate several inches off the floor in her presence.<br><br>She was also able to consciously give electric shocks to other people.  Also, she consciously lifted a tub with a man still in it by willpower alone.<br><br>Interesting that her abilities increased while standing on bare earth, but decreased when standing on carpet.<br><br>She would eventually be sent to Paris where she was studied by many scientists, including Francois Arago.  Again, a chair was flung against the wall, even though it was held down.<br><br>But the tests were cancelled for they were wholly unable to measure anything.  They could not explain how she did what she did, but neither could they measure it by any known means.<br><br>It might also be noteworthy that in Lynn Schroeder's Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain (1970), one woman who could use PK powers on demand was hooked to an electroencephalograph.  Her brain and nervous system was shown to put out 50 times the normal electricity when her abilities were in use.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Neon lights repeatedly went out, automatic fuses were blown, developing liquids spilled from copying machines, and phones acted very weird.  The power lines were examined by experts and emergency systems were put on line which promptly went haywire.<br><br>Dr. Hans Bender was eventually called to investigate.  He traced the poltergeist phenomena to a 19-yr-old employee.  As this woman walked, lamps around her would shake wildly, light fixtures would explode and the fragmented glass would fly towards her.<br><br>With a little difficulty, his team was able to videotape many odd and even previously unknown poltergeist phenomena as it occured.  And according to the phone company, 50 calls to the same number had been made at the same time--in which everyone agreed was impossible.<br><br>What has excited paranormal researchers about this case is that with the help of technical experts (one from the Max Planck Institute, the other from the Technical University at Munich) along with the local personell, they were able to (haphazardly) measure electrical bursts that seemed to coincide with the poltergeist phenomena.<br><br>But as is typical, no rational explanations were found to even be likely.  And in objective science, one has to prove what one IS, they simply cannot prove what one is not.  Thus, it is proven that many odd things DO happen, but poltergeists in terms of spirits or PK are not proven objectively (but certainly the possibility becomes likely).<br><br>However, D. Scott Rogo lists a similar case in which he calls a "proto poltergeist."  Apparently 2 women at another plant was able to feel and redirect electrical waves about them.<br><br>There are several other documented cases of this.  And while it remains mysterious, many scientists who look at this particular type of poltergeist feel that this is understandable scientifically, and are among the best documented and recorded in parapsychology.<br><br>Physicist Michael Shallis of Oxford measured one such woman dubbed "the electric housewife" as putting out 80,000 volts.  A microwave puts out a mere 700 volts.<br><br>As a final note, a friend told me when she was learning to use online and CD-Rom databases at school, all she had to do was sit down in front of the computer for it to freeze.  When this happened yet again one evening, the instructor advised her not to mention this difficulty during job interviews!  It should also be noted that this woman's mother could not wear watches for they would malfunction.  She herself does not wear a watch.<br><br>(These cases of electrokinesis, with the exception of the last paragraph, were referenced in Poltergeists and the Paranormal by Dr. Philip Stander &amp; Dr. Paul Schmolling.  In particular, pages 34-39 and pages 102-109.)</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

In most cases, the events are short lived, and are often dealt with by religious or occult means than by scientific means, even now in the 21st century.<br><br>Since 1882, the Society of Psychical Research in London has been studying such phenomena.  Examining poltergeists under laboratory conditions has proved difficult, although it has happened.  Duke University studied such events seriously between 1932 to 1951.  The Journal they started still exists ( http://www.rhine.org/jp1.html ).<br><br>The focuses are almost all teenagers under severe stressful situations.  Many have been found to be frauds (the thing with teenage hoaxers is that they're just not that good against those who know the tricks of the trade!).  Yet many are seen as genuine, and under strict laboratory conditions, incidents were recorded such a glass and china that would fly around a boy, and another girl who in the lab consciously willed an apple to her hand.<br><br>Parapsychology is not spiritualism of any kind.  It has many prestigious organizations with strict requirements for membership.  They include experts in various scientific fields, and thanx to some pranks orchestrated by James Randi, have also often included stage magicians in their field research.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

Such experiments yielded results suggesting that we do affect other people's bodies via PK.<br><br>This becomes fascinating when applied to such things as occult healing, the "evil eye" and other curses, and even psychic vampirism.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>

Consider the fact that very little PK energy is needed to interfere with delicate electronic circuitry in today's sophisticated weapons, and very little PK energy is needed to interfere with computers and other industrial devices.  Consider how little force is needed to press a button in a factory, a computer, or on a pad that launches a missile.  What if the energy amplified by generating PK by committee or a large group?  There is literally no end to the mischief that could be done by poltergeist activity unleashed by a hostile, belligerent nation.<br><br>"OTOH, think of the good that could be done by health professionals who use PK to heal and regenerate tissue, or contribute to our knowledge of the mind and body.
