Do not be alarmed, everything is fine unless Deva-vu visions becomes a daily thing &amp; start to affect your daily lives like difficulty to fall asleep or rest well then it can be dangerous. It occurs randomly &amp; unconciously, very individual depending on whether the link is strong as it varies.<br><br>Premonition is part of a form of Psychic Ability known as Precognition! This Gift is usually combine with other psychic abilities! This ability most people have it to some degree although a small population of people are more strongly inclined than others.<br><br>Precognition is the ability to sense, see, or hear things that may happen in the future. Usually combined with one of the other Gifts.

The purposes of this "deja vu feeling" is to let the person know that they are in the same scenario as their past self and to warn them to make the right choice this time.<br>So the remaining of the world who is not affected by his decision would also be forced to live out that period of time once more.<br><br>This is my explaination.

Then i am sure everyone has this feeling that he/she wishes that he could turn back time and wished he had taken another path/choice that wouldnt lead to his/her current mess in life.<br><br>In rare cases, i believe that God actually grant us that wish and bring us back to the past. The specific point of time  where we have to make the choice that would either get us out of into the mess.<br>In the process, all memories of whatever happened have been erased completely from the person's memories.<br>As for those people who actually is able to recognise a particular scene ( deja vu) , i believe that they are the person whom God have intervene and helped reverse their life. The purposes of this "deja vu feeling" is to let the person know that they are in the same scenario as their past self and to warn them to make the right choice this time.<br>So the remaining of the world who is not affected by his decision would also be forced to live out that period of time once more.<br><br>This is my explaination.
