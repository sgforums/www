Dream1 happen probably becoz of the stress you are having at that point of time! The passengers are the burdens or responsibilities that you are putting on yourself, may signify your family &amp; friends, probably is due to the exam stress you ae afriad you will disappoint them!<br><br>In Dream 2, the person in it is probably your old friend who has not been contacting for awhile, Lighting a cig walking out of LT probably means he is breaking away from his usual social circle making his choice to break free or move away! You saw him in your dream probably subconsciously you missed a friend like him &amp; you may meet or see him soon! The cig also represent a barrier between you &amp; your friend, probably something happened that kept him away from you!<br><br>Dream 3 happen probably you really love your camera &amp; you have fear that it might be spoilt or broken thats why there is occurence of such a dream!<br><br>Well all 3 dreams of yours in my perspective are due to your sub-conscience or your intents, its not a premonition! This kinda dream is due to projection of your mind &amp; intent, you are probably experiencing alot of stress in various aspects of your life &amp; you are too tense have tendency to think too much! Try to relax more, try some aromatheraphy essential oil like lavender &amp; geranium! Hahaha...have a nice day!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

(the thing you travel or "ride" through life in)<br><br>This might vary if you are a mechanic or designer of vehicles. Unusually over exposure to a specific vehicle type may easily change the meaning.

Consider how smooth or rough  the car ride is.<br><br>Whether you are driving the car or a passenger, is indicative of of your active role or passive role in your life.  If you are in the backseat of the car, then it indicates that you are putting yourself down and are allowing others to take over.  This may be a result of low self-esteem or low self-confidence.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Overall, this dream symbol is an indication of your dependence and degree of control you have on your life.<br><br>Cheers...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
