The answers will come to us in our sleep, helping us to make powerful changes in our lives. As Richmond shows us with authority and inspiration, the path to a better life is only a dream away. </span> </span><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Knotline.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Wake up, dreamers!

Its not just about a cycle in your past lives, they are here in this live for a reason perhaps a Karmic link. How would you define your present life &amp; past life not much difference? Do you who are you in your past many lives? You may not be human at all, you can be a rat also, possibilities aplenty. What do you mean by suffering? Only by attaining Nirvana or Enlightenment perhaps Sentient Beings can break away from the 6 realms without having to go through the Sufferings of Reincarnations.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
