            <div class='col-md body'>Okay...im not going to ask for interpretations, rather, i'm gonna share with u guys this OUT OF THIS WORLD experience...i honestly believe i dreamt while still in a semi-conscious state, half awake, half asleep, and i was in control of myself during the "dream"...<br><br>it happened on a sunday afternoon, after 3 days straight of clubbing and late nights...i was lying down on my bed, staring up at the wall. When i closed my eyes i was shocked to find that i could still see the wall, although the colour was inverted (ie black become white) and i opened my eyes. This time i looked at my bedside clock and closed my eyes, and it happened again! this time i continued closing my eyes, and visualised myself in the "dream state" reaching out and tuning the clock. Amazingly i could do it! So i began visualising random things like food, girls, and stuff like that and they all materialized and i could interact with them in the so called "dream state" and all this while, my PHYSICAL self was smiling, telling myself "i cant believe this is happening" so then i visualised myself<br>in this club and everything, and it happened and what happened was what u would expect at a usual club, except in a dream state. Suddenly there was an EXTREMELY pleasurable sensation flowing out from my belly into all my extremities (no i didnt have a wet dream) and it felt SOOO good it was almost painful, in fact i did let out a small cry. I tried to wake myself up but i found myself unable to move, but aware of my surroundings. So i closed my eyes and drifted into subconscious dreamland again. I remember my physical self was looking at my bedside clock every so often while my mind still controlled my dream-self. The whole experience lasted 3 hours until the sensation became unbearable. I felt pinned down again, and i let out a shout and a jerk i woke up...<br><br>I swear every single word is true, it is up to you to believe. I have tried to induce a similar state but to no avail...</div>

In the course of your work, you met many new acquaintances, although you wanted in heart to know them better however in reality there is no actions that can be done or permit you to do so... So all the emotioms are hidden inside you.

OBEs can occurred to anyone at any time, at times it happens after One had experienced some traumatising experiences or the physical body undergo alot of stress &amp; extreme condition or if One's personal energy is not grounded &amp; very light, OBEs can occurred suddenly without the subject of being awared of it &amp; not within control.<br><br>With benefit of doubt, Its possible that you had such an OBE as you mentioned partaking 3 days straight of clubbing and late nights which render you physically &amp; mentally weak. However if you took any drugs or medications before this, it may be due to your hullicination under their effect.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Its a reminder to you not to meddle with other's matter that is obviously none of your concern be it in actions or words.

            <div class='col-md body'>i have dreams alot that i cannot really remember.. but the ones that i can remember.. majority have an affinity with nature.. and it kinda freaks me out because the starting and the ending remains pretty much the same in majority of my dreams.<br><br>its like this.. my dreams starts of with the beach MOST OF THE TIME, i am always lying down on the sand and there is a starfish beside me,  there will be a crab that crawls around, sometimes it bites me, but i do not wake up into the real world. when it does bite me actually, i will wake up in the dream, and then start wondering about. most of the time, there will be a massive growth of greenery behind me, and i would be able to see a waterfall if i walk deep enough into the forest. this is when things always get haywired..<br><br>at times, everything will suddenly rot and turn into a sea of graveyards.. where i just crumble and then wake up into reality<br><br>i might also get chased by a tiger, and always a white tiger, the tiger will never reach me, but i will fall and wake up into reality.<br><br>also, i might be staring at the scenery and then suddenly just fall into a black hole.. a bottomless pit.. where i only wake up when i "land" in the midst of nothingness..<br><br>another scenario will be when i wake up on the beach, after getting bitten by a crab, and then there will always be this extremely beautiful girl that i can never picture the face of even in my mind, i just know that she is beautiful, but can never figure out the face. i will then wake up after she disappears while we are strolling on the beach.<br><br>everytime though, however scary or highly action packed the dream is, i wake up extremely calm, as though i expected everything<br><br>the scary thing is how almost every dream is so similar, and even though i cannot remember some as clearly.. i am extremely sure they are related.. somewhere in my sub conscious mind.</div>
