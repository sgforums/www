She attended in the UK just after Easter break for a 21/2 year term where her workouts kept her buys throughout the day. A typical week included the following: dance from 8am to 10:30am, break, school work from 11am to 1pm, lunch, school work at 2pm till 4pm and dance from 5pm to 6pm on Monday and Friday. Saturdays she had a 2hour ballet class and Sunday having no dance class at all, but did have to attend church, Witch Fairuza did manage to skip allot. Her and a friend decided since they were Wicca it was against their religion. Fairuza had originally planned to attend the Art Education School, but after meeting six other girls attending Bush Davies. including some of the future co-stars in "The Worst Witch" she applied there instead.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"As I was being born my father claims that he was playing his fiddle/violin to soothe my mother and when my head came out he says that I looked right into his eyes and that my eyes were the color of electric turquoise and in Persian the word for turquoise is Fairuza,it also means Sacred or Precious one....don't ask me....."

You have surely seen her in several movies, like the tough love interest for Adam Sandler in Â“WaterboyÂ”, or the beautiful hippie Saphire Loveson in Â“Almost FamousÂ”.

She had the title role as Dorothy in Walt Disney Pictures the release of Â“Return to OzÂ” in 1985, that remains more faithful to the darker world described in BaumÂ’s writings. And she was the skinhead girlfriend to Ed NortonÂ’s lead In Â“American History XÂ”.<br><br>I always liked her since She starred as "Dorothy" in her first Big Screen in 1985 "Return To Oz".

Her father Solomon Feldthouse was a travelling musician, and her mother Cathryn Balk was a belly dancer.<br><br>Fairuza grew up just north of San Francisco on a commune-type ranch. Her mother later found some work in Vancouver; it was there that Fairuza got her first acting job in a TV-movie, at age 9. Two years later, they moved to England where Fairuza attended the Royal Academy of Ballet, the Ramona Beauchamp Agency and the Bush Davies Performing Arts School.<br><br>Fairuza would work for Disney for a while; at age 11 she was chosen from out of 1,200 girls to play the part of Dorothy, starring in Â“Return to OzÂ” (1985). A year later she would star as, prophetically enough, Â“The Worst WitchÂ”, a omen of her breakout role in Â“The CraftÂ” 10 years later. Fairuza and her mother remained in London until 1988, and then headed to Paris where the 15-year-old Fairuza starred in Â“ValmontÂ”.<br><br>The next year they returned to Vancouver where Fairuza enrolled in high school. But, despite being a movie star, Fairuza was shy in class; she ended up doing correspondence courses. Back in Hollywood, Fairuza starred in a string of movies, including Â“Gas Food LodgingÂ” (1992) for which she received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress. Following further TV and film work, the beautiful Fairuza, now 5Â’3Â” and 100 lbs, achieved cult status with her starring role as a teenage witch in her signature movie Â“The CraftÂ” (1996).</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

Wicca gives women, especially, a great sense of themselves because of the goddess ideology.<br><br>A woman is the mother; sheÂ’s the nurturer, the life-giver. SheÂ’s as close to God as you can get because she can create life. It gives women the sense that it's okay to be big. It's okay to be different. It's okay to want to have children. ItÂ’s okay to be feminine. It also teaches women how to take control of their lives. It teaches them how to meditate. It's a very positive thing for people in general; because there is no martyr. There is no self -flagellation. There's no guilt.<br><br>It's all about positively and empowering yourself and discovering who you are as opposed to the restrictive thing many religions are,Â” Fairuza explained in an interview to Shout magazine (March 2001).<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/1sd.jpg"><br><br>The same year she appeared in Â“The Island of Dr. MoreauÂ”, in which she did some belly dancing, and attracted the attention of Lancashire, England-born co-star David Thewlis. It was rumored that they were dating. They did two more movies together: Â“American PerfektÂ” ( 1997 ) and Â“Great SexÂ” ( 2000 ). Fairuza was the love interest in the wildly popular flick Â“The WaterboyÂ” ( 1998 ) and had a major role in Â“American History XÂ”. With a half dozen movies for 2000, Fairuza is much in demand.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/b.jpg"><br><br>Fairuza: <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Right now I am currently writing and working on an (music) album. Things are going splendidly and I am very pleased on the whole. I have four 3-week-old kittens and I am trying to find homes for them. I am planning on moving back to New York City this summer and am looking forward to the moveÂ…Â”</span></span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
