            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, I have a recurring dream that has happened three times. It goes like this.<br><br>I am in my house with my family. Suddenly, the front door unlatches. My family all panics. And then, they unlatch a secret passage to take us out of the house. We went up, up and up until we are floating in the middle of the ocean and we floated off to land. I remember that in the dream, I felt relief that we escaped. The dream was the same thing two times. <br><br>At the third time of the dream, that was just last night. They unlatched the door too early. It was a man and a woman. We did not have enough time to escape. And I peeped out of the door and saw the woman holding a knife. I am ashamed to say this but I ran away by myself to my room.(The escape hatch was in my parents room)And tried to close the door. Before I could close and lock the door on her, she pushed on the door and stopped me from closing it. I was rather surprised as she was pressing near the hinge of the door. And still with the knife. I tried to close the door another two times. But she could stop the door from closing. At that point, I awoke. <br><br>As soon as I awoke, I started feeling both ashamed and angry. Ashamed because I ran away by myself. Something that I thought I would never do. And yet angry because my house was taken over and we were the ones who tried to escape instead of trying to attack the intruders. <br><br>Thats why I have made a plan. I will keep a few sticks both in my parents room and my room too. When the dream comes again, I believe that the sticks will still be there and we can use then to fight off the intruders. Also, I believe that the woman I was trying to close the door on was strong because of my fear. Thats why I must try to be brave, even in my dream. But I think i could try to attack with my bare hands if there is a need. And is there other things I should look out for? If its really a recurring dream?</p></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">I may be wrong, and sorry to say this, but this dream could be related to something connected with your sexuality. You may be a young person confronting sexual issues in your life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">The dream seems to indicate that you fear facing what you cannot avoid. Because of that, you have issues about a subject or situation you are involved in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">There is an escape mechanism or an 'explanation' which you have believed in and want to continue believing in, the source of which could be your parents, their beliefs/ideas/culture/religion or simply old-fashioned, traditional principles.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">You may be in a difficult situation in a certain relationship which you are reluctant or fearful of developing further. You also feel shame and anger about this situation/relationship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">The situation/problem is a deep-rooted psychological one, and you seem unprepared to face it and deal with it. You want a way out of your predicament.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">But the 'escape mechanism' does not seem reliable enough to help you cope with the situation/problem. So you are forced to confront the issue all by yourself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">The reason why I suspect the dream is about sexuality is because of the knife, the couple and the latches, as well as the episode with the woman and your room door. Houses or rooms can represent our physical bodies. Water and/or the sea usually indicate that our emotions/passions are involved.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">You need to assess your current relationships, and to be honest with yourself regarding your feelings, emotions, desires, fears and anxieties. You also need to build the courage to take decisive action about your relationships and/or your sexuality.</span></p>
