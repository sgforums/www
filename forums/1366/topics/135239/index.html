On a cosmic scale, nothing of this sort is important. What is of consequence is your stated willingness to commit to a spiritual life and the intent with which you openly and freely put that into practice. With integrity, adopt the precepts of Universal Law and apply them in every aspect of your life. Attempt to love others without expectation that they will love you in return. Endeavor with the best of your ability to practice compassionate love for all sentient beings."  "<br><br>"Arcturian Songs of the Masters of Light"<br>Patricia L. Pereira</span></span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Have you ever wondered where you really came from? I'm not talking about your parents or a particular country or even planet Earth for that matter. At this point many of us make a big jump and say we're from God. And that is true. Everything is.<br><br>But let's not jump quite that far. We'll miss one of the most exciting parts of all. What I'm talking about is where have we been from the moment God first created us in the beginning to that time just before we are conceived and born. Were we simply "nothing" and then all of a sudden we find ourselves inside our mother's womb? Or were we in a state of suspended animation, a limbo, until it was our turn to visit Earth? Or were we very much alive, conscious, in a lighter body, perhaps in another dimension or maybe on a planet in another star system?<br><br>Over the past ten years I've come to realize in a very profound way that planet Earth is not my permanent home. On the contrary, it is just a wonderful place to visit and grow into spiritual knowingness. And all of it is part of a much larger and grander cosmic plan that goes way beyond anything I was led to believe for most of my life. Before that time, I often wondered to myself where was I really from. Perhaps this kind of question interests you as well.<br><br>It wasn't until my spiritual awakening during the past ten years that I realized answers were available I never knew existed. I'm not talking about "we're born with sin, we grow up fearing God, we work to survive and to have the comforts and pleasures of life, get married, have babies, pay taxes, grow old, retire, then die and either go to heaven or hell for eternity."<br><br>This simplistic, fear-based fairy tale I was conditioned to believe in has misled us (and me) for a long, long time. When I found other answers to my questions, they made so much sense. They had the right "feel" and in my heart I knew there was undeniable truth to them.<br><br>From 1991 to 1999, I went through a time of unexpected turmoil and upheaval that expanded into a full-blown series of crises in my personal life. At the same time, I also began to awaken spiritually after reading hundreds of New Age/metaphysical books that have had an incredibly profound effect on my life. Somehow I just can't seem to get enough of the wisdom and truth these books contain.<br><br>Within these books I found many answers I'd been looking for all my life. These insights came from inspired messages via the spirit world, eastern mysticism, teachings of ancient civilizations, Native American wisdom, and so on. And, for some unexplained reason, it made so much sense as I read them.<br><br>Can I prove much of what is being said in these books? No I can't. Quite frankly, if a lot of this information could be proved beyond any doubt, our free wills would have a tough time dealing with some of it. It's a subtler, gentle process.<br><br>The truths contained within these books are there to create "feeling" for us to react to at the heart level and to make free will choices from it all. Nothing is forced. Again, it has to do with feeling and I trust the very powerful emotions they've created in my heart for me.<br><br>Briefly, what I've learned is that before our universe was created God was All There Was. What existed then has been described as the Absolute, in which there was nothing but the incomprehensible mind of our Creator. There was no physical/material world in existence at that time.<br></span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;">In the Absolute, God could only know things but couldn't feel or experience them. For example, we can know what it's like to fall in love, but until we experience and feel it, something very, very big is missing.<br><br>When God created us (souls) we, too, were in the Absolute. And, although it was complete joy and bliss to be there, all we could do was know things, but not experience and feel them.<br><br>In order to resolve this dilemma, God came up with a plan. A place, separate from the Absolute, would be created. This would be a physical world where everything in it, including all emotions, feelings and experiences had an opposite. God knew that unless there was an opposite for something like cold we could never experience, feel and appreciate warmth. And, because of these opposites, we would be able to have the experiences and feelings so important to us.<br><br>In one magnificent burst of our Creator's mind (the big bang), the universe we live in was manifested and God was to experience all of it through the souls that were created... us. To say this in a different way, when you smell a rose, God smells a rose. That's how intimate our connection is with All That Is.<br><br>At the moment of the big bang, we were released into the physical universe. For ages upon ages, we played in the stars. Countless Beings of Light separated into untold numbers of families or races of souls who went their many ways to explore, feel and experience the material universe.<br><br>On top of it all we had been given two of the greatest gifts possible: free will and the ability to create anything we wanted to. Anything. We also knew that God loved us unconditionally and that our Source was always at the center of all we thought and did. Over time that changed for some of us.<br><br>Many of the original root races have since populated countless other star systems in the billions of galaxies found throughout our universe. As that happened, some members of a given family remained in spirit form, while others lowered their vibrations in order to explore the physical world at the 3-dimensional level.<br><br>Since that time, many of these root races have evolved into societies that are more advanced or less advanced than our own. Some are more spiritual, others less. Some are of the Light, others of the darkness. But they are all a part of our original family and are to be loved unconditionally. Just as God does.<br><br>Most of us on planet Earth are part of the human root race. At one time, all humans were in spirit form roaming the stars. Eons and eons ago we came as a family to Earth with a special challenge. We agreed to bring Spirit into 3-dimensional matter and find a way to balance the two. In other words we wanted to raise planet Earth's energy by infusing it with God's love and, in the process, transform it into a very sacred place in the universe for all to visit and behold.<br><br>To begin this love-based project, many of us descended into matter and caused our spirit forms to vibrate at a much slower 3-dimensional level. Others of our family remained behind as spirits to give us help and watch over us.<br><br>Somewhere along the way we lost our God-centeredness. As a result, our egos began to dominate our thinking and we over-identified with the material world and the physical pleasures it had to offer. We forgot our divine origin and the spirituality it creates in us. Over the ages, we have been trying to reestablish our connection with the divine so that we can accomplish our original goal and then return to the stars for more adventures.<br><br>Prior to the Fall into physicality, we told those in our soul family who remained behind as spirits, that if we ever get lost and confused while in material form, to help us remember who we really are. That awakening to our divine heritage is taking place now on a broad scale all across this planet. Others are helping as well.<br><br>From what I read, Earth is not a homogeneous planet. Although spirits from the human root race mostly inhabit it, there are members of other spirit families here as well. They come from other star systems such as Sirius, the Pleiades, Arcturus, and so on. Most walk in the Light. Others prefer fear or darkness.<br><br>Starseeds from other planets, who agreed to forget who they are when born as humans, are here in great numbers. Many come with special missions to serve humanity in some way. They are now awakening to who they really are and sense that something spectacular will happen soon, as we approach 2012. They too are here to help us awaken.<br><br>Years ago, while a successful corporate executive, I never dreamt I'd be saying these kinds of things today. Never. As a Ph.D. scientist I was told time and time again throughout my education, "Only measurable facts count and even then discoveries must be repeated time and time again in order to be considered verifiable. The only thing that is real is what can be seen and measured."<br><br>My thoughts today blend with the heart and the soul. Even though all the statements I've made herein cannot be proven at this time, something deep inside, a knowingness, tells me to pay attention to it because it has the right feel. I'm going with these feelings.<br><br>As always, my intent is to make others think and wonder just as the books I've read inspired me to do. In the end the final choices must be your own. For me one thing feels certain. We are all from the stars.</span><br><br><span style="color: violet;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"It doesn't matter whether we were born as Earth people or whether we came from a distant star. If we truly believe what we're all trying to understand and learn here - that we're all part of the One Source of all creation - then really, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that you're processing through that path to divinity and learning how to love and be loved. That's all that matters."<br><br>Spoken by "Betty" ... taken from the book "From Elsewhere" by Scott Mandelk, Ph.D.</span></span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span> </strong></div>

Even though you are genetically encoded to do so, by the time you reach the point of activation, you will be totally convinced that you are an Earthling."<br><br>E. T. 101<br>Zoev Jho</span></span><br><br><span style="color: purple;"><br>Is it possible that you came to planet Earth from another star system? Are you here on a special mission to help this planet and its human family shift into a higher vibration by raising the spiritual awareness of those around you?<br><br>As incredible as it may sound, there are many people on planet Earth today who have a deep, inner knowingness that they may indeed be here as a Starseed. Such individuals are often educated and respected members of society. They can be found in the fields of medicine, law, teaching, the humanities and other walks of life that seem to center around some form of service.<br><br>Millions of others are in the process of awakening at this very moment. And they too are seriously wondering if they came from the stars.<br><br>Beginning in 1960's, and continuing for the next 20 years or so, a series of books were published, which contained channeled information from a humble, discarnate messenger called Ra. The first book in the series is called, The Ra Material.<br><br>Ra's message raises the distinct possibility that there are indeed beings from elsewhere (Wanderers) who are continuing to awaken on planet Earth. To be precise, Ra estimated that 65,000,000 were already incarnate on Earth during the 1960's.<br><br>Wanderers are described as beings who have evolved to a point of physical and spiritual maturity, which compels them to compassionately reach their hands out to any entities in the universe who call for help. Ra further states that these individuals are from all reaches of the infinite creation. And they are bound together by a common and very singular purpose; to serve those in need.<br><br>At this moment, planet Earth and its inhabitants fit that description well. We are in great need. That is why the Starseed wanderers are among us. They are here to help us raise our vibrations and those of Earth Mother so that their transformation, prophesized for these times, can take place.<br><br>This will be accomplished by shifting our awareness from self-centeredness and an over-identification with the  material world to a more balanced one that puts far more emphasis on the spiritual. If we do not do this soon, we'll have to start all over as a family of souls until we get it right. Apparently, we've reached this point before during the times of Atlantis. That civilization also over-identified with the greed, pleasures and self-indulgences of the material world, while at the same time ignoring the spiritual aspects of life.<br><br>During the late 1980's, another book was published called, E. T. 101. It has been out of print for a while. However, you should be able to find a copy here. It ranks among the finest literature I've read that relates to the Starseed experience. Like The Ra Material, it is also channeled information and it is THE manual for Starseeds.<br><br>In essence, E. T. 101 stresses that there are many Starseeds on planet Earth today who were pre-programmed to awaken at this critical moment in time. These awakened Starseeds are here to help Earth and its inhabitants shift into a higher vibrational dimension. And it appears to be imminent.<br><br>This book describes Starseeds as volunteers from distant star systems, who respond to the cry of help from individuals on planets that are in the process of awakening to their true spiritual nature. Plant Earth and its inhabitants is one of them.<br><br>After hearing the call, Starseed volunteers came to Earth in earlier times and purposely forgot their real identity and origin. This temporary amnesia allowed them to become dysfunctional humans by taking on all the ego-based, human traits.<br><br>Today, Starseeds find that their outer and inner worlds are being turned inside out and upside down, which has ignited their awakening process. As the Starseeds gradually remember their true identity and mission, the fear-based thinking they've taken on by becoming an Earthling is being transformed to that which is based upon love. This in turn impacts the entire collective consciousness of this planet in a very positive way. And we are experiencing that shift this very moment.<br><br>E. T. 101 tells us...<br><br>"As the old programs of a dying world begin to unravel, you may experience a little discomfort, such as your entire world falling apart. It may be useful during this transition to remember that you are an interdimensional master who is an expert at transmuting crumbling realities. You have done this many times before."<br><br>This book is a must for anyone who wants to know if they are a Starseed, what's going on, and how to move through your inner changes and mission successfully. In a nutshell, when our entire lives have fallen apart, this book brings hope, understanding and the explanations why.<br><br>Another book that does the same is, From Elsewhere, by Scott Mandelker, Ph.D.<br><br>If you have a deep, inner feeling and knowingness that you might be from another star system, don't be frightened. Apparently, there are many here at this moment in time who are part of the same courageous mission. If you have a fascination with the stars, UFO's, ETs, have  awakened spiritually, find your life is in turmoil, have an urgent need to be of service to mankind, or any combination of these "symptoms," then you may indeed be from another star system.<br><br>Take heart, Starseed. You have long endured the human trial and have finally begun to awaken to your true nature and purpose. As you go through your day-to-day struggles, know in your heart that you are transmuting all the negative, dysfunctional patterns you have willingly become by taking on the human form. This is turn makes it easier for those who are human to follow your lead.<br><br>Although you may not remember it at this time, you agreed to do this to assist the Earth in her birthing process into the Light and to liberate the souls who have lost their way on this planet. That is why you are here. That is your mission of love and service.<br><br>As always, my words are meant to inspire thought and a sense of wonder about who you really are.</span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

It was an extremely large, highly complex and incredibly detailed crop circle whose intricate design and mathematical relationships continue to challenge the limits of oneÂ’s imagination. This crop circle had a diameter longer than a football field, its symmetry was absolutely breathtaking and it was clearly an artistically stunning creation.<br><br>Another one of these mysterious, cosmic designs appeared overnight at Etchilhampton, Wiltshire on July 29, 1996 and, incredibly, was over 4,100 feet, just short of a mile in length! This design was so large that its aerial photo had to be constructed as a montage.<br><br>Since the 1970's, crop circle patterns have not only become far more complex, but their numbers have been increasing dramatically as well, as if to heighten awareness of the changes taking place on planet Earth today. Click for pictures of some recent spectacular formations, which are referred to in this article.<br><br>It has been estimated that over the past 25 years more than 10,000 of these mysterious images have been etched into meadows all over our planet in such diverse places as Japan, Germany, USA, The Netherlands, Austria, Canada, Brazil, Romania, Hungary, and many other countries.<br><br>It seems as though "something" is trying to get our attention in a very repetitive way because each year crop circles faithfully return like migrating birds to warmer climates. However, when it comes to sheer numbers and frequency, the spectacular crop circles of the English countryside stand out above all the rest.<br><br>Also intriguing is that archeologists, mystics and academics who study ancient civilizations recognize a form of sacred geometry and symbolism in these designs. Adding support to their findings is the fact that many of the mysterious glyphs that have been found in England magically appear (and frequently reappear) near ancient, sacred sites such as Stonehenge, Avebury, and the earth mound of Silbury Hill. These places are known for their high energy vortexes.<br><br><span class="large">What is also compelling about crop circles is that they are real, even though hoaxers have made a small percentage of them.</span><br><br>Unlike UFOs, which have often been linked to them, circle formations can be visited, photographed, walked on, measured, and scientifically analyzed. They are concrete reminders of what appears to be the handiwork of an off-Earth intelligence and, for anyone who has researched this area, it is difficult to deny their existence. Sadly, as with other types of paranormal phenomena, crop circles have been the victims of massive disinformation programs.<br><br>Another very interesting crop design occurred on June 17, 1996 in Alton Barnes, England. This incredible glyph was almost 2 football fields long and consisted of spiraling spheres of various sizes, which were easily identified as a DNA double helix. This particular crop circle was so compelling the prestigious (but conservative) scientific journal, Nature, decided to include a reference and a picture of it in one of its recent issues.<br><br>Soon after the DNA glyph appeared, an incredibly exquisite design over 900 feet long was discovered in a field across the road from Stonehenge, which consisted of 151 circles of varying size. Incredibly, a pilot flew over this same field during late afternoon and saw nothing out of the ordinary. However, thirty minutes later, on his return leg, he observed this extraordinary formation.<br><br>Dr. W. C. Levengood of the Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory in Grass Lake, Michigan has studied crop formations for years. His scientific data leads him to believe that very uniform and ordered forces are involved in their formation. His efforts have focused on the possibility that residual effects may be left behind in the crop formations that can be measured.<br><br>In general, Dr. Levengood has made precise physical measurements of the stems, nodes, and other parts of the plants taken from the crop formation and compared them to the same kinds of measurements from plants a far distance away, but within the same field. In addition, he also compared the ability of seeds to germinate taken from crop circle and normal plants.<br><br>His findings, published in Physiologia Plantarum 92: 356-363, 1994 (a peer-reviewed scientific journal), clearly show that meaningful differences exist between the plant stems and seeds taken from the crop circle versus those taken from plants in other parts of the field. Based upon his recent findings, Dr. Levengood suggests that the affected plants show distinct signs of having been exposed to transient high temperatures, possibly caused by microwave radiation.<br><br><span class="large">What have our scientists, our government officials and the media done with Dr. LevengoodÂ’s data? As usual, theyÂ’ve ignored it.</span><br><br>Why are crop circles being made? My own feeling is that they are the product of an off-Earth intelligence and are being sent for a very specific reason. There are sweeping changes taking place on planet Earth today (see Earth Changes, Cosmic Cycles and A.D.2012). The momentum behind these changes began to pick up pace during the 1960's and 1970Â’s and has continued to strengthen through the present day. Interestingly, UFO sightings, crop circles, spiritual/New Age books and other kinds of mystical happenings have made themselves felt during this same period of time.<br><br>The combined effect of these phenomena, including the symbols etched in crop fields, are prodding humanity into a greater cosmic awareness and an acceptance of intelligent life within the universe. There is no doubt that our collective consciousness is being raised and crop circles are an important part of the overall process.<br><br>I am also convinced that these magnificent, symbolic formations are meant to encourage us to remember who we really are: Children of the stars with a divine heritage and origin. As we awaken to our true spiritual nature, the awareness of how we can become responsible cosmic citizens will come into focus.</span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong><br></div>

K. newspaper, the Independent, reports that a Chinese researcher has discovered, close to the Mongolian border, 2,500-year-old stone circles in the same patterns as modern crop circles.<br><br><span class="large">Crop circles: Something Else The Chinese Had First</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By Calum McLeod in Urumqi, Xinjiang<br>26 August 2001</span><br><br>Is it a teardrop, a beard, the sun or the moon? And why do alien visitors to Earth leave these mysterious signs in our fields? Some answers may lie in the wilds of north-west China. There is no Chinese equivalent for " croppies " yet, but the global army of crop-circle enthusiasts just gained a key convert the their cause, virgin lands ripe for speculation, and a great leap backwards into antiquity.<br><br>Close to the Mongolian border, a Chinese explorer has discovered a series of stone circles and other shapes he claims are the 2,500-year-old prototypes of crop patterns found in recent years everywhere from Wiltshire to Western Australia. More than 70 countries worldwide, embracing each continent, have reported ever more bizarre examples appearing in corn and wheat fields, or grass, flowerbeds and even snow.<br><br>China was among the last major nations to resist a phenomenon so intriguing it has spawned its own science Â– cereology Â– and survived the pranks of confessed circle-makers. In the past year, Chinese man of mystery Zhang Hui, research fellow at the Xinjiang Museum in Urumqi, has harvested more than 20 patterns that appear to match examples found in other countries, but may pre-date them by up to 3,000 years. While croppies in the West debate which circles are genuine mysteries and which the "agrarian graffiti" of hoaxers, the Chinese finds are clearly man-made.<br><br>"The primitive peoples who lived there were inspired by the crop circles they saw," said Zhang, whose quest for the truth has taken him to the farthest reaches of China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, an expanse of Central Asian desert, mountain and grassland seven times larger than the UK. "They thought the circles were a way of communicating with the gods, and so placed rocks in the shape of the circles."<br><br>Zhang found several circles in the grasslands of Qinghe county beside the Sino-Mongolian border, ranging from simple circles to more elaborate teardrop and other shapes. Bemused by their geometrical sophistication, he went to Beijing to consult Chinese translations of reference works by British croppies. "I was amazed by the similarities, " he said. "Both sets show characteristics of modern, industrial civilisations, as you would need modern instruments to make such perfect circles, yet these could be the oldest records of crop circles world-wide. They show that the phenomenon is much older than people thought."<br><br>Zhang published his findings in the latest edition of a Chinese magazine, Western, which is devoted not to gunslingers but the vast and under-populated provinces of west China. The region is home to many non-Chinese ethnic minorities, including most of China's Muslims. Several of Zhang's stone patterns surround vast piles of stones gathered to commemorate not ancient Chinese but warrior nomads known as the Scythians, an Indo-Iranian people with Caucasian features.<br><br>The Scythian connection will fuel fevered croppie speculation, since their conquests were so extensive that Western historians have identified cultural interaction with the ancient Celts, whose religious sites have been among the leading locations for crop circles. Zhang suggests links to places such as Stonehenge, for luminaries such as John Haddington of the UK's Centre of Crop Circle Studies have noted that circles often appear close to the sacred sites of Celts, Australian Aborigines and Native Americans. Based in a region at the heart of the old Silk Road, Zhang is keen to explore these tenuous links between East and West.<br><br>The first publicly recorded crop circle, in 1678, in Stirlingshire, Scotland, came to be known as the "Devil's Circle". Zhang noted a similar reaction to a pattern in Qinghe, encircling a stone pile and tombstone with a deer engraving. "The nomads call it the 'magic circle', and believe whoever dares to touch the tombstone will offend the gods and be punished."<br><br>He himself would have been punished if he had pursued such research two decades ago. For years, Chairman Mao waged war on " superstitious " beliefs he saw holding back his attempts to modernise China. "During the Cultural Revolution, a group of Red Guards in north-east China saw a crop circle appear in a field in a very short time," Zhang recalled from a rare eyewitness account of a formation actually in progress, published much later. "They were stunned, but at the time, nobody was allowed to believe in such 'superstition' ."<br><br>In these more liberal times, 30-year-old Zhang has spent six years specialising in China's "mysterious culture". Other fans of the unexplained run China's booming UFO Society, with regional meetings and a newsletter of regular sightings. So does Zhang agree with some Western croppies that extra-terrestrial powers are creating these fields of dreams, and not bored border guards, wind vortexes, electromagnetic fields, or even hedgehogs as one theory goes?<br><br>"It's too early too say for sure," was his sensible reply, " but there is a definite connection with the cosmos. It could be a supernatural force, or even an alien civilisation. " The truth is still out there.</span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large">The Path To Inner Peace</span><br><br><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~perroudburns/innerpeace.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What is REAL inner peace? How did the Masters find it? Is it possible for us to achieve in this seemingly crazy, hectic world in which we live? </span><br><br>Yes, it is possible to reach inner peace, but it will not come over night. And it may take many lifetimes to achieve what the Masters have learned and taught us.<br><br>In order to understand inner peace, one has to stand back a bit and take a look at who you really are. Briefly, you are a spiritual being caught up in a human, 3-dimsional experience.<br><br>Ancient mystical wisdom tells us that our God-centered spirits discovered planet Earth aeons and aeons ago. We decided to slow our vibrations down so that we could appreciate the wonders of the material, 3-dimensional world.<br><br>After that initial experience, we jointly agreed that we would bring a sense of sacredness to this planet by blending Spirit with matter. In other words, we wanted to being a sense of God-energy and Heaven to Earth.<br><br>Over time we lost our way by over-identifying with the pleasures of the physical world and all it could offer. As a result, we've gotten stuck here. We now find ourselves in a cycle of life-death-karma until we awaken spiritually and find a balance between our  mind-body-soul. When we do, our spirits will be free from the material world we find ourselves attached to lifetime after lifetime.<br><br>Each and every one of us is a part of our Source. Prior to arriving on planet Earth as a human family of souls we were always God-centered. Everything we did was a result of our sacred relationship with All That Is. We constantly experienced a deep and profound inner peace because of our connection with the divine.<br><br>As we lost our way in this material world of 3-dimensional reality, we drifted further and further from God-centeredness. The more we drifted, the more we lost our inner peace. The more we lost our inner peace the more we experienced suffering and pain.<br><br>All of this occurred because of free will choices we made that separated us from our Creator. It has nothing to do with God punishing us. It has everything to do with the past, ego-based choices we've made, individually and collectively.<br><br>Because of divine wisdom and God's perfect plan, we will never find lasting happiness or a profound sense of inner peace outside of ourselves. We may be able to rent it for a while, but it will never be permanent. Nowhere in the physical universe is this possible.<br><br>There is nothing in the material world that lasts forever nor can anything material, regardless of the degree of pleasure, provide a deep and continuing state of peace and happiness. One must go within to find it.<br><br>What is within? God. The inner journey, the discovery of remembering who we really are is the path to inner peace. It is only when we are God-centered in all we think and do that we will finally achieve the lasting peace we've forgotten about.<br><br>The Masters know this. Nothing perturbed them. They saw through the illusion of the physical world and all of its false promises... promises we have yet to detach from.<br><br>What are some things we can do to begin the journey towards inner peace. Here are a few thoughts and suggestions, much of which comes from the Peace Pilgrim, a modern day saint...<br><br>"Your lower self (ego) sees things from the viewpoint of your physical well-being only. Your higher self considers your spiritual well-being.<br><br>When you are governed by your lower self you are selfish and materialistic... if you follow the promptings of your higher self you will see things realistically and find harmony within yourself and others.<br><br>Body, mind and emotions are instruments which can either be the self centered nature or the God-centered nature.<br><br>The self-centered nature uses these instruments, yet it is never fully able to control them, so there is a constant struggle. They can only be fully controlled by the God-centered nature.<br><br>When the God-centered nature takes over, you have found inner peace."<br><br>The Peace Pilgrim has expressed her thoughts as to how we can achieve inner peace...<br><br>"No problem ever comes to you that does not have a purpose in your life... that cannot contribute to your inner growth.<br><br>When you perceive this, you will recognize that problems are opportunities in disguise.<br><br>Bring your lives into harmony with the laws that govern this universe.<br><br>Every one of us has a special place in the life pattern and no two people have the same part to play in Life's Pattern.<br><br>There is guidance, which comes from within to all who will listen.<br><br>We must remain open to God's guidance.<br><br>Every morning I thought of God and thought of things I might do that day to be of service to God's children.<br><br>I looked at every situation I came into to see if there was anything I could do there to be of service.</span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>
