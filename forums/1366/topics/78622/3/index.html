I am the practioner of magick. My interest at times may lie in the celtic way, at others, may lie in the Italian lore. Eclectic in practice, I never claimed to be a practioner in the celtic mysteries.<br><br>This bunch of people you are talking about? I think it wise for her to retreat. Now she just got a little hurt. (like someone once taught me before) Better run before it gets worse. This is just what she did. A small hurt now, greater hurts in the future. So while the heart is cold, might as well drop everything at once. Rather than having the trust shatter once and again for more decades to come... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> She is still new, and whether she be a practioner, is up to her and time to tell. She may know little of the craft now, but given her interest, her knowledge shall rise- fast!<br><br>These "baubles" as you call it, was intended to help. Alienating others is their own choice. (i do not believe she alienated your friend, just stop contacting her) Ever think that perhaps those baubles gave confidence and strength enough to let them stand alone? As opposed to using your friends like a crutch and making your friends feel needed and useful? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> IF you're still admanmant on the fact that your friend is so pitifully neglected, perhaps can ask her to try making a first move. Makes a lot of difference, ya know? If you are hurt, why would you approach those who hurt you? Why shouldn't they make the first move? until everything settles and something new could be built from the pile of ashes that was once the friendship?<br><br>Both of us have our believes, we each stand by our friend, both on different sides of the camp. What I would like to say is that while you fight for your friend, (and that is a good thing! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) by belittling our practices, you are not helping things along. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  As for my friend, i do believe that she is slowly recovering... She has a good-heart and inclined to forgive hurts against her. Ask your friend to apologise sincerely and really make a move to patch the friendship. Might work wonders you know?!</div>

It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"? Its many "Uses" &amp; "Effacies". </span><br><br><img src="http://www.bloodymarystours.com/images/productthumb-grisgris.jpg"><br><br>A mixture of Magickal herbs, talismans, roots, powders &amp; stones in a muslin, flannel,felt or chamois bag that should be carried with you at all times to get a specific desired effect. That is a Mojo Bag.<br><br>Also known as an "Ouanga" ,"Conjure" , "Gris Gris" or "Medicine" bag ,regardless of the area in which the name was derived or the culture you may be familiar with ,they are all used for the same basic thing &amp; prescribe to the same basic principle; To attract to or dispel from the wearer, certain influences. Thus they can be made for just about any purpose under the sun. They imply faith and serve as a link beween that in which you believe and that which you desire.<br><br>Mojo Bags are usually worn around the neck or pinned inside the undergarments so that they are in touch with your skin. However ,in a pocket  or bag is also fine in any case.<br></span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>[/b]</blockquote>Not everyone can successfully owning one ... is depend on your fate.

In Neandertal Enigma by James Shreeve (Wm Morrow, 1995), there is a section  with excerpts on the Scientific basis on an aspect of Magick, if you like maybe can go read up the book or have a look at the short article i have at <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=71555" rel="nofollow">~*~ Scientific Magic ~*~</a>.<br><br>To get a girlfriend of coz you must expand your social circle &amp; socialise but are you sure you can be well liked by all! That is possible if you have the quality &amp; charisma of a social butterfly but are all the rest same as you?, i don't think so! That is when the use of Mojo bag comes in, it will definitely increase your chance in hitching one by increasing your charisma &amp; charm or whatever the intents of the bag are for! Definitely no chiobu will flock to you if you keep yourself away from people...don't you reckon that?<br><br>The effacies of Mojo bag need not be sweared upon but the results can be seen by many globally...welll do not undermined the wisdom of the Ancient Ones...no harm trying..but definitely a loss if you don't even make the 1st step...Thanks for sharing your views &amp; reply!
