Items inside the bag and even the bag itself has to be charged and consecrated. Not to mention some of the things in the bag doesn't come cheap. Life isn't free, ya know? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> The correct term for the fee paid is called "energy-exchange". A disbeliever you may be, but testimonies from many others who have had the bags would swear at their results. Then again, it depends on whether they appealed to a real pract or some swindler for the bags.<br><br>Self-esteem is not symptomatic with luck. How many times have you seen a wealthy businessman falls. You trying to say that all the while successful, then <span style="font-style: italic;">suddenly</span> lack self-esteem, one wrong choice and... poof? I hardly think so. Bad luck is for real, happens to everyone. One period, or more, of time when everything seems to run dry in your life. The mojo bags for luck doesn't mean you'll immediately strike 4D, though it could happen for a few people, it just means that there's a cushion and things wouldn't be as bad... Then again, if you choose not to believe... It's also up to you.<br><br>All this is about faith, believing in the spirit. Although, truthfully, I'm surprised that someone of your Age &amp; Mentality failed to see that... Sometimes, i really sympathise &amp; wonder if there really is a so called "Flawed Human Nature" or simply its the way One is being brought up or there is a failure in the Educational system. Warped Humanity is evident in our current time &amp; space, when people failed to see eye to eye with something or issue , they simply distorted, assume &amp; provoke to cause harm, verbal insult or simply undermine something which they are in no position to comment or challenge at all unless otherwise they are REALLY "God form" in their own Name or an expertise in the Metaphysic field...<br><br>You may be a christian, buddhist or whatnot. It still ends up in a word- faith. Believing in the spirit. If you keep doubting it, not likely to have much effect, is it? The believe system is different, but the intent is the same. You pray for better life, do charity for better karma. In our believes, we are more active, we work for what we want. Sometimes, we extent our works to others. By receiving an energy-exchange, our work is justified. Money, services, products, reading, sometimes even deep friendship is a valid form of energy-exchange...  hope that while you follow your belief system, do spare a thought for others with a life and believes different from you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

" Beliefs " I am sure everyone has their own, very individual which differentiated "Human" from "Animal", Do not tell me you have no " Beliefs ", i seriously doubt that regardless whether its about your religion, your love life or work life. Whatever your " Beliefs " i do not care &amp; will disregard it coz its simply ain't my cuppa tea to interfere with Other's cognitions or perspectives, but one thing for sure i hope you will "Respect" yourself if you want others to "Respect" you! "Sentience" is what you lack or imbalance! Perhaps your intelligience &amp; cognitions are out of harmony with the sentieny of your mind thats why you are making such "Attack" which are volatile &amp; repulsive as that of a "Animal" Do not "Abuse" your "own Human Rights " neither do you have the " Rights " to "Abuse" Others'.<br><br>Well my perspective of  "You" &amp; whatever Statements you made earlier on has been greatly reduced to "Repugnancy" , they are now full of " Doubts " on your "Mentality" , "Integrity" &amp; your "Ethical Motive" on all these " Actions " you Just done, how "farcical" it seems. But again I welcome your views &amp; sharing whatever Different perspectives you might have however i do not tolerate neither will Others when you try to "Impose" your Will &amp; Perceptions on them, When you failed to do so, you reduced to making "Personal Attacks " , "Labeling" , " Accusations " , &amp; even to the extent of "Blasphemy"! Symptomatic of a shallow understanding, ignorance &amp; insolence is what we see here evidently!<br><br>Hello There, "Preacher" or "Father", do you think you have the "Wisdom" or "Authority" to "Refute" the Ways of the Old by "Undermining" all Spiritual Aspects in Life &amp; more "condemnable" to direct provoke the Tradition &amp; Religion of "Vodoun" or "Voodoo" whose roots can be traced back to the 18th century that bore the "Mojo". Its a Blasphemy to Spirit of Orisha! Its never a "Newest Fad" probably older &amp; wiser than your whole life &amp; existence! Well you can be a non-believer &amp; its ok but do not undermine or insult Other's Beliefs, Religions or Practice. Are you intolerant of All " Religions "? I think you are but why do you go church then? So are you implying all Religions are fake, All their teachings are wrong regardless whether its Buddhism, Christianity, Wiccan, Paganism or Hinduism etc.. Or simply you just wanna challenge the Validity of Spiritual Aspect of Life...The ways of the Old...the Pagan Path...or Real Witchcraft? If thats the case, I fear the wrath of the Spirits , Pagans &amp; all in the Path which you incurred through your " Actions "! it need not be from me but there will be Others around with watchful eyes... Be humble, Arrogance get you nowhere, it will only bring about your downfall...your sorrowful Life &amp; predicaments...<br><br>"A Spade is Always a Spade" a tool to help you accomplish something but if you do not put it to good use, it will always be a useless "Spade" thats what i perceive...I believe everyone will put their spade to good use rather than wasting it away...Do u? hahaha<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Last but not least, All who come by my Haven are my friends unless they chose otherwise...

            <div class='col-md body'>After so long, it's all actually about that incident eh?<br><br>Before you accuse someone, please, take a more neutral stand. From what I know, the someone with a "weak mind" was out with her friends. When she tried to help, by projecting love, she was called names, by none other than your friend. Someone whom she thought was her friend... Like you said, as friends, how to just stand by and watch?<br><br>Her hysteria was not due to "nonsense" as you chose to address it. Rather, it was due to the betrayal of someone she thought was her friend. If I am to be surrounded by that kinda "friends" I'll rather face crystal all my life, and trust me, crystals can be better company. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> You have a right to post what you deem correct. Your friend was spooked by the change. People changes, so what? My friend was upset over the act which she deem as equivalent to betrayal! The last time she talk to me abt that, <strong>on a bus</strong> she was tearing up and trying to hold back her tears!!! Changes are common, hurting a friend maliciously- <strong>is NOT!</strong><br><br>I'll kindly ask you now to retract your statement. Do not malign or belittle our practices, lest you offend anymore people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
