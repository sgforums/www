It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"? Its many "Uses" &amp; "Effacies". </span><br><br><img src="http://www.bloodymarystours.com/images/productthumb-grisgris.jpg"><br><br>A mixture of Magickal herbs, talismans, roots, powders &amp; stones in a muslin, flannel,felt or chamois bag that should be carried with you at all times to get a specific desired effect. That is a Mojo Bag.<br><br>Also known as an "Ouanga" ,"Conjure" , "Gris Gris" or "Medicine" bag ,regardless of the area in which the name was derived or the culture you may be familiar with ,they are all used for the same basic thing &amp; prescribe to the same basic principle; To attract to or dispel from the wearer, certain influences. Thus they can be made for just about any purpose under the sun. They imply faith and serve as a link beween that in which you believe and that which you desire.<br><br>Mojo Bags are usually worn around the neck or pinned inside the undergarments so that they are in touch with your skin. However ,in a pocket  or bag is also fine in any case.<br></span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

Probably you do not have the "Awareness" of the "Spiritual" aspects of Life. From such a statement you made without any substantial proof or evidence, anyone can tell that you do not possess much of the quality of "Self-Esteem" which you preached, contradicting yourself!<br><br>In term of Psychology, i would say you are doing "Self Monitoring" on yourself. I would deemed you as a "High self-monitor"  by assessing your psychology profile &amp; traits</span>.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"> A "High self-monitor"  is someone who is concerned about how they are perceived by others and will actually change their behavior in order to fit different situations (e.g., if they believe they will be perceived negatively by others, they may change their behavior so that they are perceived more positively...rather than just acting in a consistent manner).<br><br>A "High self-monitor" might say something other than their true beliefs if they believe the situation calls for it or if they believe others will perceive them in a negative manner.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Well that probably don't make you " Decisive " or " Strong-willed "  in any ways...a great "Delusion" its seems.<br><br>"Pandering on Inanimated object" what a statement? A person of your age &amp; mentality can challenge the "Wisdoms &amp; Ways" of the Ancient Ones from a Tradition commonly known as "Voodoo" that can be traced back to 18th and 19th century Dahomey. Without any Substantial evidences or results, what makes you think it can survive to this Era of Automation &amp; Technology? By the way "Mojo bags" are alive in their own ways so is everything on this Earthly plane even a tree or the breeze! Libveforce is all around regardless of animated or inanimated objects, probably there is a shallowness in you &amp; you failed to see the Depths of things were. So is these the so called "False Hopes" of yours that probably make you "Hopeless". What do you deemed by "Profiting" are you implying majority of the people &amp; organisation globally. I guess you are paid for your work unless you work for free which i think its impossible in such a setting &amp; society. I do not make much profit at all, my main purpose is to increase awareness locally &amp; help those people in need. If you refused help do not assume the same for the masses. Such unappreciativeness from you i can reckon that &amp; i forgive your ignorance &amp; non-receptiveness. A word of Advice "Do not do unto others unless you want others do unto you" I may be able to forgive you for all the personal attack you made so far but i cannot say for others. I take that as a healthy discussion for your greater good. What a great "Devil's Advocate" you make? hahaha<br><br>"Hustler" what a great label you got there, probably labeling is a norm of Society on things &amp; people, use when you are unsure or scared perhaps. Again I forgive you on that. To each its own, basically you have no "Trust" in anyone neither your friends or Families &amp; i sympathise that but you can chose to rectify it. Your Insecurities, Animosity, Arrogance, Negative &amp; Skeptical ways will not help you in any aspects neither makes you a preacher or help to Humanity.  It only proved that you are an "Evil" in your own ways. "God Will save those who wants to save themself" God bless you...Thanks for your replies..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

A mojo bag is <strong>not</strong> an inanimate object. I'm sure you know of quartz crystals, used in watches coz they keep accurate time. The quartz generates an electro-magnetic field that scientists capitalizes on. This electro-magnetic field is also what them magicians/ magick pract refer to as energy. Now everything contains energy. (scientic point of view: obj made out of atoms, atoms made up of blah, blah, blah- whatever.

From the meta-physical point of view, it is possible to capitalize on various energies in order to get the correct recipe for outcome (usually mundane goals) to materialise. A mojo bag is meant to be a helping hand, not a crutch. That is perhaps one of the reasons why mojo bags are also known as mojo hands. A person will have to help themselves too, instead of relying totally on magick...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Information on "Mojo Bags"</span><br><br>So what is a mojo? It is, in short, the staple amulet of African-American hoodoo practice, a flannel bag containing one or more magical items. The word is thought by some to be a corruption of the English word "magic" but it more likely is related to the West African word "mojuba," meaning a prayer of praise and homage. It is a "prayer in a bag" -- a spell you can carry.<br><br>Alternaive American names for the mojo bag include hand, mojo hand, conjure hand, lucky hand, conjure bag, trick bag, root bag, toby, jomo, and gris-gris bag. In the Memphis region, a special kind of mojo, worn only by women, is called a nation sack. A mojo used for divination, somehwat like a pendulum, is called a Jack, Jack bag, or Jack ball.<br><br>The word "gris-gris" looks French ( and in French it would mean "grey-grey" ), but it is simply a Frenchified spelling of the Central African word gree-gree (also sometimes seplled gri-gri). Gree-gree means "fetish" or "charm," thus a gris-gris or gree-gree bag is a charm bag. In the Caribbean, an almost-identical African-derived bag is called a wanga or oanga bag, from the African word wanga, which also means "charm" or "spell" -- but that word is uncommon in the USA.<br><br>The word "conjure" -- as in "conjure work" (casting spells) and "conjure woman" (a female herbalist-magician) -- is an old alternative to "hoodoo," thus a conjure hand is a hoodoo bag, one made by a conjure doctor or two-headed doctor. Likewise, the word trick derives from an African-American term for spell-casting -- "laying tricks" -- so a trick bag is a a bag that contains a spell. Similarly, "wanga" is a West African word meaning a spell, hence a wanga bag is a bag containing a spell.<br><br>The word "hand" in this context means a combination of ingredients. The term may derive from the use of finger and hand bones of the dead in mojo bags made for various purposes, from the use of a rare orchid root called Lucky Hand root as an ingredient in mojo bags for gamblers, or by an analogy between the mixed ingredients in the bag and the several cards that make up a "hand" in card games.<br><br>Although most "Southern Style" conjure bags are made of red flannel, some root doctors favour the colour-symbolism employed in hoodoo style candle-burning magic and thus use green flannel for a money mojo, white flannel for a baby-blessing mojo, red flannel for a love mojo, pale blue flannel for a peaceful home mojo, and so forth. Leather bags are also seen, but far less frequently than flannel; they are associated with West Indian obeah, another form of folk magic closely related to African-American hoodoo.<br><br><img src="http://lotsofkidssite.com/luckycharm_bag.gif"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">~A version of Modern Mojo bag that can be wore on the neck~</span></span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkred;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Uses &amp; beliefs of "Mojo Bags"</span><br><br>Mojos made for an individual are usually carried on the person, always out of sight. They are very rarely worn on a string around the neck, fairly commonly pinned inside a woman's brassiere, and much more commonly pinned to the clothes below the waist or caried in a pants pocket. Those who make conjure bags to carry as love spells sometimes specify that the mojo be worn next to the skin. Mojos intended to purify or protect a location are generally placed near the door, hidden in such a way that they cannot be seen by strangers.<br><br>Keeping the mojo from being seen is important because if another person touches it, the luck may be lost. This is sometimes called "killing the hand." </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

When performed properly, spells using charm bags, along with your energies, can produce powerful tools.<br><br>The purpose of the charm bag is to charge your aura or another's aura with the specific energies it is designed to hold and create a magnet effect within that aura for the purpose it is designed for, attracting energies of the same sort.<br><br>Charm bags can be used for an indefinite period of time as long as it is continuously charged &amp; treated with care. Charm bags can be worn, hung around one's house, buried, etc.<br><br>According to my School of Thoughts, a "Mojo" bag can last you a lifetime once its consecrated whereas a "Gris Gris" bag need to be dispose off once the specific need or goal has been attained as "Gris Gris" bag are made for emergency when fast or immediate results are needed to be seen in the situation for example in situation like a Court case. Therefore "Gris Gris" bag has very fast result but short life span due to its intent.<br><br>Hope all these can provide a clearer insights on "Mojo Bag" to those who are interested or wish to know more.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
