Although it is called the Great Duke Jupiter, it does not represent the actual planet Jupiter. Tai Sui is an intangible star which moves directly opposite of the planet Jupiter. When translated from Chinese, the Tai Sui is known as the Yearly God. "Tai Sui" is the most powerful "Earthly God". The story of "Tai Sui" is widely spread, there are few version. One claims that he's the god of moon and another he's the warrior god. But the actual account is the god of the year. The Chinese lunar calendar has 60 years in one cycle, its formed by the Heavenly stem and Earthly branch. Therefore there are 60 "Tai Sui" in the cycle, each one dominates one single year. This is the reason Tai Sui is called the god of the year, every event that occurs during the year is under his jurisdiction.  People respect him highly, and fear to offend him because it would cause misfortunes and bad luck. To avoid offending the Tai Sui of the year, people pacify and enshrine the Tai Sui of the year.<br><br>Each year, there would be a new Yearly God on duty looking after all matters on earth. His appointment would commence on the 1st solar term or called "Li Chun" , in Chinese. And the next would take over the task on the following "Li Chun".<br><br>Each year there will be some zodiac sign that has opposing forces with the "Tai Sui". These zodiac sign are said to suffer some form of bad fortune. The negative impact differs from people to people depending on individual birth data. These zodiac sign can be determined base on the earthly branch of the year as it corresponds with the 12 Chinese zodiac sign. It can classified under offend, clash or conflict formation with the "Tai Sui".<br><br>Its a common practice &amp; age old tradition that "Tai Sui" is worshipped between the 1st and 15th day of the 1st lunar month of the year. Many people have misconception that "Tai Sui" can only be worshipped during this period however its not really true. One can actually pray to Tai Sui any day throughout the year unless you offend, clash or conflict with "Tai Sui" which you have to make special prayer or offering to "Tai Sui" known as "Age Suppression" ( Ya Tai Sui ) or "Age Praying" (Pai Tai Sui), its got to be done within 1st to 15th day of the 1st lunar month of the year. However do take note if you do so, you must return thanks at the end of the year.</span></strong></div>

This is to be done at Temple.</span><br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Age Suppression" (Ya Tai Sui)</span></span><br><br>The former refers to a situation where one prays to the Deity when he/she encounters bad luck. The traditional way to do this is to write down one's birth date and time on a piece of gold-coloured paper and place it under the idol of the "Tai Sui". A year later, this person must "return" the age that he has previously "suppressed". In some cases, 49 copper coins are used to suppress the paper with one's birth date and time. However, this method is not very safe and you will need someone who is familiar with the method to be around to give you guidance. the Temple attendant got to do it for you then you give him/her an ang pow for the help &amp; good luck.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> "Age Praying" (Pai Tai Sui)</span></span><br><br>The latter, termed "Age Praying", occurs when one is doing fine &amp; experiencing good luck therefore pray to "Tai Sui" so they will not have any adverse effects due to clash, conflict or offend of "Tai Sui" in that particular year. In this case, the birth date and time are written down on a piece of gold-coloured paper which is then brought in front of the "Tai Sui" and burned after saying prayers. This is a safer and more practical method.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Praying to Grand Duke Jupiter "Tai Sui" at home</span></span><br><br>You can pray to "Tai Sui" at home also, it is necessary to prepare a set of offering (joss paper), incense, candles, fruits (use 5 apples &amp; 5 oranges). When you're praying, tell Tai Sui your name, make your wish sincerely for improvement of health, luck, wealth, prosperity, family safety and helpful mentors supports. Remeber to offer thanks by doing another prayer session to "Tai Sui" at the end of the year.<br><br>For those who have encountered setbacks in their life, health, business or career, it is advisable to offer their prayers to the "Tai Sui" for peace and a smooth flow of luck.<br><br>According to Chinese Custom &amp; Practice, It determines that the "returning of age" (Huang Tai Sui) will take place between the 1st and 15th day of the last lunar month. Those who performed "Tai Sui" : "Age Suppression" (Ya Tai Sui) &amp; "Age Praying" (Pai Tai Sui), must remember to perform the "returning of age" (Huang Tai Sui) at whichever Temple yopu went to previously, this is very important.</span></strong></div>
