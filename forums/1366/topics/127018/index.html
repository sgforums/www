So you are telling me this is only a hearsay of no validity? "Apocalyse" or "Doomsday" are also mentioned in the Book of Revelation, Believers of impeding Apocalyse whereby will mark the End of the World like "Doomsday Cult" have their own perspective on Signs of Apocalypse which can be more than the vague 7 signs that you cited without much backing.

Transition Period of what? Some believe its the Transition Period between Piscean Age and the Aquarian Age. Some believe that Aquarian Age has already arrived, its the New Age Era &amp; the dawn of it has brought about many changes due to the shifting of energies too. Its concern not only Mankind but all Beings that reside in this Earthly Plane.<br><br>Maybe now its the Spiritual Age whereby all Sentient Beings are going to prove their worth of Existence to the Divine by embracing all of Nature &amp; Divine, advancing towards the Divine through their Faith &amp; Practice &amp; degenerating to the Primitive Ways of life. Many may think even if they are not Divine but by being close to Divine, it may really save their Souls. Don't you think so? At this moment there can never be any Answers, maybe we will never know untill there is any Physical Manifestations maybe not in this lifetime but the Answers shall be revealed in our future generations.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos  </span></strong></div>

There's no need to waste our time thinking and pondering whether the Apocalypse has come. If for your own interest you want to know more about this, then fine. But it is not something ultimate that we must know.<br><br>But all these natural disasters tells us one thing: That life itself is fickle and impermanent, to attain a human life is indeed very precious.<br><br>Start practising! Start living every single moment in the world blissfully and liberatedly - nothing in the world that happens can defeat you. Your Buddha Nature is unchanging and will never die. That is ultimately what we seek. In other spiritual systems it's known as the "Higher/Greater Self", "God nature", "Source", etc. The experience is the same although different people different sages realise it in different clarity and interprete it differently at the conceptual level.<br><br>However to live your life indulged in sensuous pleasures... but being ignorant of death and sufferings, is something that we all must avoid. We can live every single day and suffer every single day. Or maybe we can live every single day indulged in sensuous pleasures with not much pain but at the end of the life, we are full of regretts, we are full of miseries, we cannot let go. That is a life not worthy of living... it has no value. However on the other hand we don't have to.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by elektra:</div><div class="quote_body">which scripture mention the year and date exactly? so fascinating</div></blockquote>Actually in Tibetan Buddhism got such scriptures. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Just read the Kalachakra scriptures, their prophecies not only fulfill, but ON TIME. The Kalachakra provide a 100-year period prophecies about what would generally be happening. It doesn't speak of an apocalypse though.<br><br><blockquote>"...for example, king Manjushrikirti (living in the second century BCE) predicted the coming of the "barbarian Dharma" after 800 years (about 600 CE).<br>The prophecy further says that during the reign of the 21st. king, Aniruddha (1927-2027), Buddhism and the Kalachakra will have nearly come to an end in Tibet, Mongolia, China and much of Asia. This could certainly be said to be accurate! For example, after the Chinese invasion in Tibet in 1959 and the destruction of nearly all monasteries afterwards, the master Ven. Kirti Tsenshab Rinpoche was the only remaining Tibetan master holding a specific lineage of the Vimalaprabha (the 'Stainless Light' commentary); which is one of the only two main Kalachakra texts..."</blockquote>and some other ancient Tibetan prophecies (the following particular one by the founder of Tantric Tibetan Buddhism, Padmasambhava, in addition to the previous one, that also speaks about foreign persecution of Tibet and spreading of the Buddhadharma to other parts of the world:<br><br><blockquote>Â“When the iron bird flies, and horses run on wheels, the Tibetan people will be scattered like ants across the world, and the Dharma will come to the land of the red faced peopleÂ”</blockquote>This has certainly have been/am fulfilling in the current situation of Buddhism.<br><br>Anyway this is not Buddhist forum so I won't post any further.<br><br>But... nevertheless prophecies aren't really very important unless it particularly concerns us. What happens 10000 years later doesnt matter me... yet.</div>

There's no need to waste our time thinking and pondering whether the Apocalypse has come. If for your own interest you want to know more about this, then fine.

Start living every single moment in the world blissfully and liberatedly - nothing in the world that happens can defeat you. Your Buddha Nature is unchanging and will never die. That is ultimately what we seek. In other spiritual systems it's known as the "Higher/Greater Self", "God nature", "Source", etc. The experience is the same although different people different sages realise it in different clarity and interprete it differently at the conceptual level.<br><br>However to live your life indulged in sensuous pleasures... but being ignorant of death and sufferings, is something that we all must avoid. We can live every single day and suffer every single day. Or maybe we can live every single day indulged in sensuous pleasures with not much pain but at the end of the life, we are full of regretts, we are full of miseries, we cannot let go. That is a life not worthy of living... it has no value. However on the other hand we don't have to.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I do not seek to aspire to be a buddha/god/deity after I die/be enlightened</blockquote>Some people see it as merely a mystical attainment. It is rather a form of realisation - that you were ALWAYS, and have been, a Buddha. Enlightenment can take place RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW... it doesn't require time, in fact it transcends it. But of course without a realised teacher (not easy to find one..) its not so easy.<br><br>A mistaken concept about enlightenment is that it takes place after death. If you cant be liberated in life, how do you think it is possible in death? (with all the pain.. etc)<br><br><blockquote>I am a god, here, now and always.</blockquote>Nope, only when such karma lasts <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> You never know what may happen.<br><br>Gd luck. But be a meritious and virtuous person. So even if you dont get enlightened at least your good karma wont be over so soon.</div>

It transcends ordinary sensuous enjoyment.

It is in this life that we should make use of.<br><br>Most people nowadays are getting more materialistic... they seek what is outside but forsake the inner mind and their true self. They are not any material entities but yet it does not reject them. Objects and forms of the world are very limited. They are impermanent and without any inherent existence. The mind is however infinite, boundless, like space.<br><br>Happiness, sufferings, it all depends on your mind.<br><br><blockquote>...Today, I am going to speak about the meaning of life and the experience of death in a positive way, which is very important to our lives. As you see, everybody, no matter what country he or she comes from, what language he or she speaks, what social, economic and political system he or she belongs to, what kind of culture or belief system he or she is acquainted with, whether he or she is rich or poor, educated or uneducated, desire to have peace and happiness and be free from suffering. There is no question about that. Even if we have to destroy our happiness, we are destroying our happiness in order to bring happiness. Even if we have to chase the suffering, we are chasing the suffering in order to be free from suffering. Due to ignorance, we chase the suffering unintentionally in order to be free from suffering. We make efforts and work very hard in our lives in different fields to acquire more happiness and be free from suffering. Due to different cultures, different belief systems, different teachings, we follow different paths materialistically, spiritually, outwardly and inwardly. <strong>However, the basic purpose of our lives is the same, that is, to bring happiness and be free from suffering. This is the meaning of life and the purpose of life.<br><br>Because of that, as modern technology advances, many new things are invented and developed in order to bring happiness and to make our lives more comfortable and peaceful.</strong> The advanced technology enables us to measure and go to the outer space. We try to explore the outer space as much as we can even though there is no limit to the outer space. We try to see what we can find there Â–another planet, another place, what kind of things or beings exist. We would like to have more control of the outer space in order to secure our peace and happiness. Computers can do so much and still there is no end to exploring technology in order to have better and more meaningful lives. <strong>When we are so busy exploring the outer technology, outer phenomena, we forget our inner mental technology. The quality of our inner mental technology is immeasurable, infinite, like space. We keep projecting and exploring outside and forget that mind is the one that explored and created all these technologies.</strong> We lose the sense of mental quality. To know our mind, we do not have to go anywhere. It resides within us, face to face and yet we do not know. We judge other things, other people, outer technologies, we do not know how to judge our mind...<br><br><a href="http://www.purifymind.com/LifeAndDeath.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.purifymind.com/LifeAndDeath.htm</a><br></blockquote>The Original Mind.. is the most natural state of the mind. That is what spiritual practitioners seek. A mind of attachments, miseries, wrong thoughts, these are the 'unnatural' state of mind that brings sufferings.<br><br>Buddhism is ultimately not more than finding your true self.<br><br><blockquote>Karma? Jhana? Enlightenment? I never said anything about after death.</blockquote>Entering into jhanas during meditations are quite common among those who practised meditation for some time. Like I said Enlightenment happens in the living. For example, Buddha attained enlightenment while he was alive. Karma is also committed in the living by our Mind, Speech, Actions. I did not suggest anything linked to death.</div>
