              <p>Hello, I'm a girl who has been interested in Wicca since I was 13 (I am currently 18). I am currently reading Scott Cunningham's book Wicca a guide for the solitary practitioner. I am really interested in knowing more about Wicca. My parents are the conservative type who believe that witchcraft and magick is just evil fairy tales, so I never dared to tell them about my interest, nor have I been able to actively research about it (especially due to the extremely competitive academic nature of Singaporeans, studying has taken my time up more than anything. I just finished my A levels last year) During my life I have sat through rituals and talks and preaches of so many religions, and none of them have made me feel connected to their beliefs one bit, aside from Wicca. Yes, I have never witnessed an actual Wiccan ritual, but I believe very strongly in the beliefs that there is power in all things, I believe in magick. I want to learn more about Wicca and possibly become a practicing Wiccan myself. </p>
              <p>Please advise of what I should do. </p>
              <p>Blessed be</p>

              <p>I can give u a brief but u won't be happy with my conclusions.</p>
              <p>Wicca (prounonced Wisha) is 'white' witchcraft which worships nature, the chief diety being the Great Mother. Her name is ARAYDA. There is also a horned God who ruled the sun and hunting. 1st time devotees believed the rites they did were for the benefit of the earth n think there's a GREAT difference between Wicca n Satan worshippers. An initiate is given the title of Priest of the Goddess. Many say Wicca stretched back to ancient pagan fertility rites but there is no proof. It is in fact a manufactured religion that began with the book ok shadows (ritual book for Wiccans) in 1910.<br><br>Wiccans sometimes dance naked in a ring within a magick circle, sometimes have ritual sex, n whipped each other to raise their power. It encompasses a belief in forward reincarnation, belief that all objects have life n souls, militantly feminist, 'do your own thing' which is Alister Crowley's, the satanist logo. Others r evolvement to attain godhood, like d New Age movement n psychic powers involved in healing by spirit guides (these guides are actually Satan's angels).<br><br>Initially, as a 1st grader, it will seem innocent enuf. Eventually, to maintain power, u would need to go to the 2nd n 3rd grade. At the grade it will be necesary to begin the study of 'Higher Wisdom' in order to keep growing. Magick is like a drug. U keep needing more. It is at this point that Satan worship becomes very apparent. Depression n feelings of suicide will be manifested. Try n get out of Wicca and this point n Satan or his angels will attack u.<br><br>The only hope for true spiritual fulfillment in life is Jesus Christ. Sori to dampen yr feelings but that is d absolute truth. I fact whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. And this is the only way to obtain peace on earth and everlasting life in heaven. All this may be cliche to u but it is the only truth in this world. Everything else r lies perpetrated by the devil.</p>

              <p>@Bhw33 Er.. Yeah thanks for your imput, I won't be replying to your claims about Wicca because from your last paragraph its kinda obvious that whatever I say would just be dismissed, but yeah, what you say in the last paragraph is exactly why I don't feel the least bit connected to Christianity. I feel the whole "love thy neighbour" thing should be applied to all situations, even to respect other people's belief and not say that "oh you are all wrong, only Christianity is the right path, the devil created all other thoughts and you shall all go to hell unless you believe in Chirstianity." I respect everyone's belief, therefore I would not exactly listen to someone who is completely biased to their own belief and claims that everyone else is wrong. The truth is, none of us know what is the "real" religion, although there are claims that people have "spoken to God" we do not know exactly which "God" it is. </p>
              <p>But thanks for your reply anyway. God bless. </p>

              <p>Women tend to believe sincerly in whatever spiritual practices.</p>
              <p>But do keep a watch out for the men, though. They are in it for sex, and would lie and deceive for sex.</p>
              <p>Watch out for the great smooth talker, he wants sex.</p>
              <p>Sorry for saying this, but it is sex that caused the downfall of the angels. And sex feature prominently in many religion and cults.</p>
              <p>Guard youself, and don't get tricked.</p>

Sure, I have found many writings denouncing "Witchcraft" as evil, but most of these writings come from peoples of other faiths and religions. Just by reading these writings, the obsessional characteristics of the writers become apparent and to my mind at least, most do not lead to credence.<br><br>So if witchcraft is not about evil, then what is it about? Many may ask &amp; there are many ways to answer these queries. "Wicca" is a Religion that is commonly perceived &amp; known to be in association with "Witchcraft". so i shall briefly touched on it to give a clearer picture.<br><br>"Wicca" is a contemporary spiritual religion, based on and reviving the ancient pre-Christian pagan religions of Europe. Wiccans believe in a divine force or power as the source of all. It is both immanent and transcendent while encompassing the whole universe. Therefore the world and all aspects within the world, "nature" and "life itself" in particular, are considered sacred.<br><br>Wiccans use ancient and modern ceremonies, rituals and shamanic practices to attune themselves to the natural rhythms of nature, the world, and the universe in their efforts to commune with this divine force.<br><br>Hope all these can give the Masses a better understanding of Wicca, Witchcraft &amp; Magick.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></p>
