Only by attaining that, Sentient Beings can break away from the 6 realms without having to go through the Sufferings of Reincarnations.

All Mantras can help us in all aspect of life, by reciting it can clear our obstacles, avert adverse karmic related occurence, calm our mind, body &amp; spirit etc. They can even help our dying pets, friends or relative to move on smoothly to another realms through recitation. Regardless of which Mantra or Suttra you are comfy with, its always good to do chanting whenever you are free, its even better if you dedicate a little time daily to do it or one great way is to recite a Mantra Like "Om mani padme hum" with every steps you make on your way home, to school or work while walking.

            <div class='col-md body'>Chanting is a very good way to clear our minds of wandering samsaric thoughts, so that we can be peaceful. When we chant, we must concentrate on our chanting. Chanting is a practice of Samadhi.<br><br>There was an old lady... she chanted "Namo Amitabha", but every "Amitabha" will be followed by a vulgar word aimed at her grand-children.. so it goes something like, "Namo Amitabha, hey shut up you faggot!" It totally defeats the purpose, and the monks who saw that quickly approached the old lady and advised her.<br><br>However, there is something else I would like to point out. There are 3 types of people who chant mantras/buddha names:<br><br>1) They chant for the liberation of all sentient beings<br>2) They chant for the liberation of themselves from samsara<br>3) They chant for material benefits and anything due to the three poisons: Greed/Hatred/Ignorance<br><br>The 3rd type of chanting is only Samsaric, worldly, and one cannot escape the cycle of samsara with the type of mentality. There are even those who chant dangerous mantras with hatred, aimed at bringing pain to an enemy. This would only bring himself more sufferings and dangers. So, it is important to have the right motivation and right thought.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Mantra chanting does not only restricted to Buddhism, Various Religions also practise &amp; encourage chanting of mantras. Definitely intent of Ones who chant the Mantra also play an important role, Chanting Mantra is also a form of Self-cultivation of one's personal energy. Through Chanting by the Vibration of the Mantra, this energy is send to the Universe reaching all Realms of Existence. Billion of people globally from different races &amp; religions chant mantras everyday with denial. Are they merely consist of the 3 type of people who chant Mantra, probably alot may disagree with that. Just like same kind of Rice grain can feed 100 types of people, Can they just be categorised into a few numeric group which is quantifiable? , i personally don't think so....<br><br>For example, One who preached must have the correct intent behind their Action so that others may benefit from it. If not it will reduced to just meaningless mere words which is redundant. Just like the analogy which is cited &amp; shared in our previous post, Even if the old Lady, she chanted "Namo Amitabha" without the vulgarities but in her heart she has this strong intent for somebody to Shut the Hell Up, It will definitely caused more harm than mere words. Words can be spoketh without much Trouble however Intent which is unseen or hidden can cause more Trouble.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
