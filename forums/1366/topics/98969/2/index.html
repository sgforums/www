            <div class='col-md body'>haiz nvm, i'll try to explain it even though im not too sure of it also.<br><br>2 things can be called the soul in buddhism.<br>one is the wrong idea of a permanently unchanging thing existing inside or outside of you that you consider to be "you". some people would think its in the mind. the buddha has however broken down all that makes up a "self" into the 5 aggregates, and all experiences we have must come from these aggregates. some people would think that the eternal soul exists outside of these 5 aggregates, maybe even holding them together. that is false.<br>another thing that can be called the soul is the gaseous bardo state created by the thoughts of the deceased if he or she is still very attached. that is also something that changes every moment because it was created by some of the 5 aggregates.<br><br>that's all i think i know, thanks. wanna find out more go read up.<br><br>[EDITED ADD ON]: how can there be rebirth without a permanent soul?<br><br><blockquote>from <a href="http://www.mountainman.com.au/buddha/carus_53.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mountainman.com.au/buddha/carus_53.htm</a>:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">"There is rebirth of character,<br>but no transmigration of a self.<br>Thy thought-forms reappear,<br>but there is no egoentity transferred.<br>The stanza uttered by a teacher<br>is reborn in the scholar who repeats the words."</span></blockquote>this means that the thoughts are not the self. you just think its you becos its a continuum.</div>

If you think by merely quotely a few lines by some westerner who embraced Buddhism later than people brought up from generation to generation through the teachings of Buddhism then maybe you have made a mistake, probably touching the brim &amp; surface of the outer layer rather than the Core/Essence of Buddhism. In the 1st place, the rules &amp; regulations of my Haven is that i don't encourage any discussion of any religions in any ways which i have already made known to you. In the past whenever there is such discussion whether is on Buddhism , Christianity or any other religions, Its bound to cause alot of unecessary unrest among fellow forumites. If you discuss such issues in your ways &amp;  such manners in any other forum, the topic would have been closed long ago. Just that i chosed not to as i feel you are a young &amp; curious seeker of Buddhism with some doubts &amp; misconceptions which i feel a need to clarify your wrong perspective. But as it prolonged, you seem rather out of the hand &amp; sad to say "No Manners At All". If you don't even respect others why should they bother with you, One is able to guide but not change any of the latter if the latter chose not to, its a matter of choice which is applicable to everything in life. Like all dreamers Ones confuse disenchantment with truth. Since i already done my part as the Owner of ~*~LOA~*~ to clarify your misconception &amp; mispresentation of info which is not taken is fine with me instead returned with such arrogance &amp; ill manners will not be tolerated by me in any ways, neither do i feel obligated to look at your later posts nor seek any answers from  a nobody like you who hold no authority over me or Buddhism in any ways. Last &amp; not least, my kind &amp; amiable nature does not permit you to command or question me in any ways for that nature may just shift to a not so nice way when there is a need to...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

If you think by merely quotely a few lines by some westerner who embraced Buddhism later than people brought up from generation to generation through the teachings of Buddhism then maybe you have made a mistake, probably touching the brim &amp; surface of the outer layer rather than the Core/Essence of Buddhism.</blockquote>Buddhism is the same everywhere if it goes according to the true teachings of the Buddha. Someone may think he's a buddhist but he may be a taoist/buddhist/chinese-worshipper mix. Another one brought up in a buddhist family may not have been taught about Buddhist teachings at all. Having proper education on the true teachings of the Buddha and knowing the right way of practise under the guidance of a qualified teacher is what's important.<br><br>All along you have labelled me as not knowing what I was talking about. If you had looked at my posts with an open mind, you would have found your claims to my "misconceptions" to be invalid.<br><br><blockquote>In the 1st place, the rules &amp; regulations of my Haven is that i don't encourage any discussion of any religions in any ways which i have already made known to you. In the past whenever there is such discussion whether is on Buddhism , Christianity or any other religions, Its bound to cause alot of unecessary unrest among fellow forumites.</blockquote>First off, I am new not only to this forum but also to this entire website, so I won't have known of any previous disputes you had here. Second, you didn't make it clear the rule to me (ok, I was wrong to not have caught it, sorry), and I interpreted it as you telling me to stop because you found me to not know what I was talking about, which was obviously untrue. I found a thread asking for views, naturally I post my views unless you specifically say "NO RELIGIOUS TALKS ALLOWED".<br><br><blockquote>If you discuss such issues in your ways &amp; such manners in any other forum, the topic would have been closed long ago. Just that i chosed not to as i feel you are a young &amp; curious seeker of Buddhism with some doubts &amp; misconceptions which i feel a need to clarify your wrong perspective.</blockquote>I see arrogance here.<br><br><blockquote>But as it prolonged, you seem rather out of the hand &amp; sad to say "No Manners At All". If you don't even respect others why should they bother with you, One is able to guide but not change any of the latter if the latter chose not to, its a matter of choice which is applicable to everything in life.</blockquote>who has less manners? Person A who posts what he knows about something, or person B who constantly say that the other person doesn't know what he's talking about, only pasted from random sites without understanding, and worst of all person B doesn't know any better.<br><br><blockquote>Like all dreamers Ones confuse disenchantment with truth. Since i already done my part as the Owner of ~*~LOA~*~ to clarify your misconception &amp; mispresentation of info which is not taken is fine with me instead returned with such arrogance &amp; ill manners will not be tolerated by me in any ways,</blockquote>See, all along you have been labelling me as confused and posting wrong information, when you obviously know less about Buddhism than I do. (not that I know a lot)<br><br><blockquote>neither do i feel obligated to look at your later posts nor seek any answers from a nobody like you who hold no authority over me or Buddhism in any ways.</blockquote>You attempted to correct someone's "mistakes", yet when someone shows you the reason why he posted those things you ignore them. This is truly open-mindedness and not arrogance.<br><br><blockquote>Last &amp; not least, my kind &amp; amiable nature does not permit you to command or question me in any ways for that nature may just shift to a not so nice way when there is a need to...</blockquote>No comments here.</div>

You REALIZE things that are already there. So if there is no soul at nirvana, there is no soul now. Like I have already said, the 7th consciousness is a delusion and that is what buddhists call the soul. I have also already clarified that there are 2 definitions of soul, one is the bardo state while the other is the 7th consciousness delusion, and we were each talking about different ones.
