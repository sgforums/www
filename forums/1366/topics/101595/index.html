            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Image.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet to All,<br><br>I would like to share with all of you about this.<br><br>One day as i walking past a Christian Shop, something in the Display showcase attracted my attention, it was a big Solomon sword so i went in to the shop to have a look. I really like the Sword but the Steward told me it was already sold &amp; the new owner is coming to collect later. The Steward asked me to browse around, there may be something i like. While browsing around, i saw this statue of Mother Mary, she was emitting a soothing energy that makes me feel warm &amp; calm. I ask the Steward whether its for sale, he said,"Yes". Then i ask him this is "which emanation of Mother Mary?". He told me he doesn't know too, just Mother Mary thats all. The statue look as if made of Copper or Brass however the Steward told me its not but handcrafted from stone made to look as if made of metal material. It looked fantastic but at that point of time, i had my reservation because of the price. there were other few statues but only this attracted my attention. I told the Steward i will have to think about it then i left.<br><br>On my way home, the image of the statue of Mother Mary kept lingering in my mind, my heart was not at peace. Is this a Calling from the Virgin Mother? I have always resonate with Mother Mary vibration &amp; do have faith in her. I can't get to sleep that night. The next day i decided i must take the statue of Mother Mary home so i called up the place &amp; spoke to the steward, I ask him to reserve the Statue for me as currently i do not have enough cash &amp; he agreed. I tried very hard to get the amount which is needed to get the statue but however i am unable to get the amount still short of abit. In my heart, i really wanted the statue, I made a silent prayer to Mother Mary that night asking if she is willing to follow me home please let me have the Statue from the shop at the amount i can get &amp; afford.<br><br>The next day which is the third day, i went to the shop with a heavy heart wanted to tell the Steward i can't get the amount needed for the Statue unless he is willing to let go to me at a lower price. I felt chance was quite bleak because i am still short of around 100 bucks. Miraculously when i told him that he agreed to let go to me with a discount of 80 bucks which is the best he can do. I paid immediately as i do have the amount in my wallet although after paying i would have nothing left but i am happy. Maybe its my affinity with Mother Mary, my prayer was answered. The Steward told me something just tell him that he must let me have the statue thats why he is will to give me the discount &amp; he does not make much profit from the sale as the usual selling price of this one &amp; only statue was slightly below 1k, he has already marked down the price when i asked him because he is closing down his shop by that week &amp; new Owner is coming to take over the place next week. He is actually clearing &amp; packing his stuffs. He told me this statue was hand-carried back from Overseas few years ago, alot are interested but because of the hefty price perhaps it was not taken, Maybe its my affinity to have it. I told him "Thank You, God Bless You" &amp; happily i made my way home with few coins left in my pocket...I felt its really a blessing...A gift from the Divine...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
