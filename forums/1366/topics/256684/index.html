Their interpretation is a form of divination. These Signs usually occur in the form of Dreams.<br><br>Superstition tells us that you must never tell a dream before breakfast and never relate a Friday's dream if bad.<br><br>The proverb says: 'Friday's dream on Saturday told, is sure to come true before nine days old.'<br><br>For most people omens are considered as antiquated superstitions, yet a surprising number of people secretly believe in them.<br><br>Many of the dream dictionaries on the market today -and particularly those that deal with dreams about the future- rely on superstition and ignore the discoveries of psychology. The unconscious speaks to us in symbolism, metaphor and allegory so long list of dream meaning based only upon superstition are not particularly helpful when trying to unravel the real meaning of a dream. According to Aristotle, " the skilful interpreter of dreams is he who has the faculty of observing resemblances. "  This is the ability you need to develop if you wish to understand the hidden meaning of your dreams or to know their prophetic value.<br><br>Omens and Superstitions can cater to the insecurities and weakness in human nature but could it be that there are factors that influence our lives that are not governed by the laws of causality?<br><br>The earliest records of omens and dreams come from the time of the Babylonian and Assyrian civilisations. The priests from these times would deduce omens from the appearance and actions of animals, birds, fish and reptiles. Signs were also observed from the condition of human or animal offspring or from the symptoms of sick men. Omens would be seen in the appearance of a man's shadow, from the images seen in a fire or smoke and the forms seen in the landscape.<br><br>Most of the superstitions about dreams we have today have very ancient credentials going back to the times when omens influenced people's lives.</span></strong><br><br></div>

It may be partly due to the occurence of recent Tsunami, by coincidence you happen to tap in the frequency &amp; energy, you felt the great sadness there that lead to this dream.<br><br>However, primarily i feel this dream is a sign for you to take note of yourself, your emotions, subconciously you always wanted something but in reality you never seems to be able to hold on to anything, you always feel there is alot of choices for you however none seems right for you &amp; you are not listening to your inner voice, you are not accepting or receptive of anything that comes your way. To a point you feel very tired with everything, it seems that whatever choices you made seem to turn out be wrong in some ways in time to come, your mom is very concern about you, she is the one who is always there to support you in whatever you do. Let go of the past no matter how deep it is inside you before you can be truly happy &amp; open your heart for anything good to come, if not you will always be going round in circles like a neverending cycle, feeling more lost, confused &amp; dishearted with everything.<br><br>Hope these would be of help to you, thanks again.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i happened to have dreams related to death on 2 consecutive nights.

Somehow I managed to escape from what I was running from, I found myself to be in this room, felt safe. Around 3-4 ppl were in that room. Suddenly, something exploded. Only myself and the other person in the room was hit. The weird thing was that, I saw my own body 'charred' and stiff in front of me. I looked around, the other ppl in that room don't seem to bother about what just happen. After that I woke up, rather strange dream.<br><br>The second dream: I was in this house. There was this lady, a stranger to me. We were making tea. I remember seeing 2 cups with teabag each and me helping out by pouring water etc etc.. It felt kinda nice, until we had a conversation and the lady said something like I was already 'dead'. I can't remember in detail. But I do remember sth about death. Don't remember much after I woke up though.<br><br>Weird dreams I had for 2 nights. (Friday and Yesterday night).</div>

They are an extension of who we are and can carry messages from the divine. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud described it as an extension of our consciousness and all over the world, dreams have been a way we can sort to improve our lives.<br><br>For your first dream, you dream of your death in a theatre. Do not fear as it does not mean death in a literal sense. Change is part and parcel of life and this dreams means you have changed and grown and thus your "death" is symbolic of casting out the bad and welcoming the new. This can also mean a new and foreign environment that you are not familiar with, thus the uneasiness, espically the scenario of being in the same room with 3 0r 4 people. This might be because you feel you are under the scrutiny of people around you.<br><br>In your second dream, the lady is a figure of authority. Tea time might be her having a talk with you and divulging information that might shock you. Possible news on someone close to you who might turn out disappointing you.</span></div>

Due to the lack of details, it is actually rather hard to tell if it is good or bad but chances are you might not enjoy what is about to come. Recurring dreams are normally warnings of events that are about to unfold in your life rather soon. Do practice more care in your everyday life in the meantime.<br><br>Anyway,I am deciphering the dreams on Oceanos's behalf as he is busy at the current point of time. If anyone has any urgent issues, please PM him and he will get back to you as soon as possible.</span></div>
