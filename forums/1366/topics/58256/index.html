            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://lovelore.com/sun.jpg">The Sun - The astrological sign that the Sun is in at your time of birth is what most people are talking about when mentioning their Star Sign. It is a very large part of your astrological make-up but is not the end all and be all. A well-placed Sun enables us to radiate joy, confidence and strength as well as fight off disease. The Sun corresponds to the sign Leo, which has the same attributes<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/moon.jpg">The Moon - In a horoscope the Moon is associated with the sign Cancer and represents the subconscious, emotional disposition, fertility, creative energies, the home, family, mother and the reception of other people's moods. You can tell if someone tends to be moody or emotionally stable.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/mercury.jpg">Mercury - In Astrology Mercury represents our ability to communicate, analytical reason, business sense, common sense and wit. As morning star it is associated with the sign Gemini, as evening star with Virgo.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/venus.jpg">Venus - In Astrology, Venus stands for everything that we find beautiful and desirable. Its place in the horoscope tells us about our requirements for peaceful, harmonious surroundings, our love life and our ability to sacrifice. The arts, especially music, are associated with Venus, as is our sense of aesthetics and our preferences in the art of seduction or being seduced. As evening star Venus is associated with the sign Libra, as morning star with Taurus.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/mars.jpg">Mars - Mars stands for assertiveness, drive, aggression, courage and also for sex drive. Mars rules the sign Aries as well as together with Pluto, the sign Scorpio.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/jupiter.jpg">Jupiter - In Astrology Jupiter signifies higher religious, philosophical moral and ethical knowledge. Its position in the chart tells us how to expand our horizons, because it represents expansion in all areas. Justice, Law and doctrine also belong to this field. In addition Jupiter can offer a little luck. Wherever Jupiter appears, one should be careful not to become dogmatic, arrogant or excessive. Jupiter as well as the sign Pisces rules the sign Sagittarius.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/saturn.jpg">Saturn - In Astrology Saturn is considered the karmic planet. Karma is the law of cause and effect. Saturn makes sure that we are confronted with the consequences of our actions. This is especially true of the Return of Saturn, around the age of 29, when the natal Saturn forms a conjunction with the transiting Saturn. This is the time to reflect on life with all its mistakes and regrets, which may force some corrective actions. Saturn is the past, tradition, the father and restrictive principle. Where Saturn is found, there are regularly problems to be solved, as challenges can be found in every horoscope. We have to overcome fear and inhibitions. As seen positively, Saturn brings consistency, perseverance, diligence and responsibility. It rules the sign Capricorn.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/uranus.jpg">Uranus - In Astrology Uranus denotes a break with tradition as well as new development; it is spirit, intuition and spontaneity. Its position in the chart tells us about our relationships with our friends as well as our attitude toward authority. Uranus can also bring about a revolution and can destroy that which it cannot improve. Uranus rules the sign Aquarius.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/neptune.jpg">Neptune - In Astrology Neptune represents deception, mysticism, imagination, dreams, extrasensory capabilities, a foreboding and inspiration. It symbolizes creative energy. With Neptune's help creative abilities can find expression. Neptune stays in one sign for 14 years, therefore its individual interpretation, house position and aspects of other planets should be considered. Neptune is assigned to the sign Pisces.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/pluto.jpg">Pluto - In Astrology it symbolizes the masses and stands for sudden change, destruction, regeneration and transformation. It can be interpreted in context with the actual happenings in the world. In personal horoscopes one should concentrate on the position of its houses and its aspects. Together, Pluto and Mars rule the sign Scorpio.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/partoffortune.jpg">Part of Fortune - The Part of Fortune is calculated by subtracting the Sun position from the Ascendant position. We add the number of degrees of the moon to this result. A simple formula would look like the following:<br>Part of Fortune = Ascendant - Sun + Moon<br><br>The Sun as the symbol of identity and ambition, the Moon for its emotionality and its conscious and subconscious reactions, and finally the Ascendant as the visible personality, which expresses the energies of the Sun and the Moon. The position in the horoscope where Sun, Moon and Ascendant are most harmoniously working together is called the Part of Fortune. The energies of a sign and the affairs of the astrological house concerned will show you how to reach a state of true happiness.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/northnode.jpg">North Moon Node - The rising Moon Node is referred to as the northern Moon Node or Dragon's Head.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/snode.gif">The falling Moon Node is called the <strong>Southern Moon Node</strong> or Dragon's Tail. In Indian Astrology they are called Rahu and Ketu.<br><br>The meaning of the Moon Node Axis is tied closely to Karmic Astrology and is easier to understand in this context. It begins with a premonition that we are not on planet Earth for the first time, but that we have brought experiences from previous lives with us. In a horoscope the principle of reincarnation is described by the Moon Node Axis, whereby the falling Moon Node shows where the soul is coming from while the rising Moon Node describes where it is going to and our goals in this life.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/blacklilith.jpg">Lilith - Lilith's position tells us about unfulfilled wishes, the suppressed shadow-side of our personality, painful experiences, privation and darkness. As with Pluto, the processes triggered here should lead to self-recognition and the acceptance of our dark side. Good and bad should not be differentiated from each other, but human existence should be seen as many-faceted.<br><br>In a man's horoscope, Lilith can reveal what type of woman he fears most and which type of woman can drive him to despair.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/chiron.jpg">Chiron - Its astrological exploration is just beginning. As with all the planets discovered in modern times, the general mood and the situation of the entire human race at the time of the discovery are taken into account in Chiron's interpretations. Chiron's symbol resembles a key. It is often seen to show areas in our chart that are likely to suffer and are in need of healing.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/ascendant.gif">Ascendant - The Ascendant is the rising sign in the East at the time of birth. It metaphorically channels our expectations of life. The first impression stays with us throughout the day, influencing each contact and every event. The Ascendant channels all the other energies in the chart actively working to express them. It describes the way we live our natal chart and how we confront our environment, making up an important part of our identity.<br><br><img src="http://lovelore.com/mc.gif">Medium Coeli - The Medium Coeli also called MC or Midheaven refers to the highest point on the chart. It is the point of culmination where the planets reach the point on their apparent orbits highest above the horizon. The position of the MC on your chart can reveal how you conduct yourself in the outside world. This includes your role in public, your professional career, and your social position and in some cases your rate of success. The MC describes your professional orientation, where your talents lie and how you go about planning your career. There is also information about the relevance of other people's opinions and tells if you are persistent and/or determined.</div>
