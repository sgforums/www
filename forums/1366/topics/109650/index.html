            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Oracle and Cartomancy Traditions are all the Wisdom of the Ancient Ones &amp; they do comes in various forms. Divination is a form of cartomancy which is highly intuitive &amp; can provide us with Answers to Queries &amp; Doubts of our Heart &amp; Spirit.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/michael1.jpg"><br><br>Angels are close to humanity, yet unseen by most. The word "angel" is derived from the Greek word "angelos" and the Latin word "angelus", both meaning "messenger." Angels appear to have wings due to the Light that radiates out in rays or waves that take an an appearance similar to feathers. Angels are entrusted with the role of serving the Sons and Daughters of God through the release of powerfully positive feelings and vibrations. The feeling nature of Angels enables them to infuse matter with the constructive aspects of Divine Qualities and Consciousness. Angels are Beings of Pure Light &amp; the Angelic Realms are intuned with High Vibrations! I have work With Angels for more than a Decade &amp; i resonate well With the High Vibrations of the Angelic Realms. Angelic Guides are very Different from Other Guides such as Faeries, Elementals, Spirits, Animals &amp; so on, They bring us messages to guide and protect us during the spiritual transformation that is taking place now on the planet. Other Guides tend to have personalities &amp; some do talk alot, trust me...hehehe Angels can vary in form, depending on the needs and expectations of those requesting help. They may appear as either male or female, but are neither! They usually come with a frequency of unconditional love &amp; work with the "Karma" aspects of Humanity. Let us invite these High Vibrations &amp; Beings of Pure Light into our Lives to Love, Protect &amp; Guide us in our Daily Lives...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

You have to let go of the sadness &amp; pain in your heart before you can welcome in the New Key to your Heart. You need to expand your sociual circle in term of giving &amp; receiving Love to all around you. You been giving Love but however your heart failed to accept the Love from other thus you are lost &amp; unmoveable, stand on the Peak of the Mountain alone. For the coming year 2005, Good Luck &amp; Monetary Gains will be coming your way however its best for you to exercise some caution in whatever you do as there is always a risk to lose what you have so far.
