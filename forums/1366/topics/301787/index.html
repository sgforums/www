It is a profound and highly effective technique/ritual for clearing and revitalizing the energy in buildings, including homes, offices, shops and other spaces thus enhancing the quality and nature of the energy in the space.<br><br>In this Modern Era, Science has proved that everything in the Universe and beyond is comprised of energy, constantly flowing, changing and affecting all areas of our lives. Energy levels in the places we live, work, shop and socialize can have far-reaching effects on our physical, emotional, mental and spiritual well-being.<br><br>The Space Clearing Ritual Ceremony removes stagnant and negative energy in a home or business with the goal to improve health, relationships, finances and many more.<br><br>How can space affect our daily lives?<br><br>When things goes wrong in our lives, what is the main cause that can exert such a great influence in our lives other than ourselves? Majority of lives are spent in our own home or workplace. When any of the aspects of our lives goes wrong all of a sudden, other than ourselves, the major influence would be either our private sanctuary which is our home or our workplace. A home is our space where we rest and regenerate our energy so we can have the strength to walk the longer road of our lives. If it is clogged with the history of sicknesses we have gone through, tears we have shed, arguments we have fought, sadnesses we have endured? And not just our own but also the energy imprints left by previous occupants, year after year, layer upon layer, embedded into the walls, at the corners, causing history to repeat itself. How can we have peace &amp; harmony in our lives? How can a home or space be a sanctuary and place of harmony for ourselves and our families?<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/LOAsigil.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small">Â© copyright by ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~  All rights reserved.</span></span></strong></div>

These energies might effect the physical, mental and emotional health of those spending a considerable amount of time in these places, leaving them drained and unable to push and achieve and excel.</span></div>

You feel uncomfortable because of the energy the space housed simply does not agree with you personal energy, "Yes" your personal energy clashed with the energy of the particular space, its human nature when you do not like or feel uneasy about something, the immediate action would be you want to leave it. Just remember a situation where you walked into a room where an argument has just taken place, remember the feeling of the space - what do you feel about it? The energetic release during the argument was so intense, that the energy left behind was almost physically tangible.<br><br>The residue of these energy ripples accumulates around the building, particularly in corners. Like the build up of dust in a home, the energy stagnates, affecting the flow of energy within the building and within the lives of the occupants.<br><br>Our homes and businesses all carry these energetic imprints and stagnant energy. The source of these can be many things and they stay behind long after the cause..<br><br>Every argument, illness or death in the home or office creates an energetic imprint. The energetic imprint can also have its source from the energy left by the previous inhabitants. It can come from clutter, or in special circumstances itÂ’s source is a left over astral fragments from a dying person. At times there will be haunting or some other entities that chose to reside in these spaces. People with spiritual powers can plant good or bad energy. Have you ever come across houses or space that are jinxed or cursed and cause harms to the occupants. Removal of such hauntings, entities, bad energy or spiritual influence in a space is not easy.<br><br>Just because an environment has good Feng Shui will not guarantee the harmonious qi flow we are looking for. For as long as there is still stagnant energy, it will not sparkle with energy and light. Feng Shui can enhance your Luck to even better if your premise Feng shui is good however if your premise Feng shui is bad, Feng shui cure can only stop the negative influence but not removing it. "Space Clearing" can remove the negative influence &amp; instill positive influence into your premise. It work immediately &amp; very effective, if you are sensitive to energy, you can feel the difference immediately once it is done. Feng Shui placements or cures will need time for it to work.<br><br>Feng Shui always works better and faster when done in conjunction with Space Clearing. Many people now choose to make Space Clearing part of their regular building maintenance programme so that their space is energetically as well as physically clean and clear.<br><br>Childrens are most sensitive to energies, they are one of the first to recognize the difference of a cleared space! Their reactions and behavior patterns are always aligned to the energy of the space.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/LOAsigil.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small">Â© copyright by ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~  All rights reserved.</span></span></strong></div>

This is accomplished by cleansing and purifying the chi of a building, house, space or premises, thus enhancing the quality and nature of the energy in the space.<br><br>Space Clearing  is also extremely helpful, when your life seems to be stuck in some way or for when you want to make a new start. By clearing out the energy of what has happened in a place (either your own energy build-up or that of people who have occupied the space before you), and then consecrating the space to the specific frequencies of what you want to happen in your life, instilling positive energy thus remarkable changes can occur in all aspects of our lives.<br><br>"The Art Of Space Clearing" Â– Who needs it?<br><br>I would say just about everyone. There are very few buildings in the world that are so well designed  that they don't need regular Space Clearing.<br><br>It is also widely accepted now that traditional Feng Shui works better and faster when done in conjunction with Space Clearing.<br><br>After sickness, death, divorce, constant arguments,moving into new space (or leaving old one behind!)...<br><br>"The Art Of Space Clearing" Â– In Business &amp; Working environment:<br><br>Any Business &amp; Working environment, the premise or space is under the influence of its employees, workers &amp; clients. To improve harmony and productivity in the workplace, and enhance profits in business, Space Clearing has a very high success rate and also very effectively enhances traditional Feng Shui. Running a business at a good &amp; busy location but business is bad, there is nothing wrong with the business concept or products at, why so? This is probably due to the energy of the space or premise. Space Clearing would help to rectify this, tangible effects &amp; results can be seen, some almost immediately. A vast difference from before &amp; after.<br><br>Shops, Stores, Offices, Restaurants etc. all  are in desperate need of Space Clearing all over the world!<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/LOAsigil.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small">Â© copyright by ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~  All rights reserved.</span></span></strong></div>

The difference between Space Clearing work and other types of energy clearing methods is that the practitioner does not hold a specific outcome in mind. There is not any manipulating of the unbalanced energies. The balance is restored by allowing the disturbed energies to be fully embraced by Unconditional Love, and It knows what needs to occur for all parties concerned.<br><br>The essence of this Space Clearing work is based on unifying the heart and mind in Unconditional Love and nonjudgement when identifying and clearing, stabilizing and/or shielding against the disturbed energies that may be present in the environment. The Space Clearing work can also be used for identifying and clearing personal issues <br><br>Space Clearing work can be done either in person or at a distance. This is because everything is made of energy and everything is interconnected. Things, people, both animate and inanimate are all connected, they just vibrate at different frequencies. It is possible for a skilled practitioner to tune into an individual place or person with clear intent of purpose and focus and be able to identify specific information. It is worth noting that this type of work is only performed with specific permission.<br><br>Both y</strong><strong>ou and your environment are connected and affect each other. By restoring balance in both the environment and personally, much stress and tension is released. When an environment has been cleared and balanced, and the people living in the environment have been cleared, then there is a greater opportunity to grow and develop your natural God given talents and abilities. <br><br>We each co-create our reality based on our conscious and unconscious beliefs. The personal clearing work helps to release old beliefs, old patterns, and old wounds. You become more empowered to make conscious choices and co-create your life with positive intention where stress, tension and old patterns no longer have the ability to hold you back. You become more empowered to be the best that you can be. . . living a fuller, happier life. <br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</strong></span><br><br><strong><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/LOAsigil.gif" alt=""><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small">© copyright by ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ All rights reserved.</span></span></strong></p></div>

              <p>Smug sage, burn incense, ritual bells are some methods.  But these methods hardly clear away powerful thought forms that have its own life force feeding from your thought energies.</p>

              </p><p><span style="color: blue;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Well if everything is as simple as that then there will not be a need for any professional. If you are so naive to think everyone can learn to fish, will be able to know how to fish themselves, then all fishing trade must cease operation already. If you think you can do Space Clearing yourself simply by asking about it, read a few books, ask a few question in the net. If its so simple, there will not be any classification or categorisation in Society, there will not be a need for any professional. If you are sick administer your own medication but if there is any detriments of mishaps, only yourself is answerable for it, non-vicarous to anyone else!</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>After Space Clearing of coz there is a need to maintain it. Just like you go to a SPA, after the SPA treatment, your body is in tip-top condition, of coz you need to do your daily grooming routine to maintain it. It is not just thought forms that we clear during Space Clearing, there are other kind of energies &amp; even entities. We are clearing energies at a deep level, there are different dimensional levels of energies, they can be layered, some can be very adhering to the Space that we have to remove it forcefully. Other than thought forms created by the clients, themselves after our Space Clearing, the energies or whatsoever we cleared will never come back by itself.  Once a Space is cleared of coz we need to seal in the positive energies &amp;  protect the space, ward off any unwanted, negative energies from entering the space.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Anyway my LOA Space Clearing Service is very different from any Professional Metaphysical services that are available elsewhere irregardless locally or globally. It is exclusive &amp; unique to LOA only as we are not only doing energy work but spiritual work also. Anyway LOA Space Clearing Service is solely facilitate by myself personally. My In-house Facilliators are unable to provide this service. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Thanks again.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>My ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ is based in Singapore. My Organisation is based in Australia, USA &amp; UK.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>I am "Oceanos" an initiated full fledged Wizard &amp; High Priest, a Clairvoyant, a practitioner of various Magickal Arts including Low Magick, High Magick, Santeria Voodoo, Hoodoo, Shamanism &amp; Healing light works for more than a decade. I am from a Traditional Path but i am electic in my practice.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong> Providing Services to the Masses for more than a decade under my name "Oceanos". I am the Founder of ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ established since 1999. Our Haven started as a Platform of Awareness, Resource, Haven for all those who are interested in Metaphysics! Its been a long way since our humble beginning in here, but we have grown in strength through our hard work, effort, Wisdom of the Old Ways, Blessings from Divine &amp; support from all of you out there. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ provide various services &amp; products to the Masses since 1999 under me &amp; a team of In-house Psychics, Witches &amp; Healers.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>I create spells, make charms and potions and other magickal tools, I also read the Tarot cards &amp; various kinds of Oracles, this is my craft, this is the witch's craft. I do healing light works with Reiki, Mahatma, Crystals healing, Prana ki &amp; Angelic healing! I have spell kits, mojo bags &amp; gris gris bags available to cater for all your individual needs.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Is my Services free, Definitely not. In Life when things are free sometimes there is no meaning &amp; neither will it be cherished<br><br>Its energy exchange not as in profit as what i do is Spiritual Works &amp; Guidance. I render energy to teach/guide/aid you, you give me monetary fee as exchange. In short, the main purpose of energy exchange fee is to cut the link between me &amp; my client/student so that after the Services it will not affect me or my client/Student as there is a fair exchange. If it is free, there is no fair exchange, its neither good for me or you as you will owe me something due to it &amp; there will be a link which can result in Karma debt. If Everything is Free then no one will get salary for their job, You do your part as an employee in a company &amp; end of the day, the company pay you, this is obviously a fair exchange.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Hope all these answer your queries. Thanks again.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Merry Meet Caitaokue,</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Nope i am not acquainted with Robert Bruce. I am a Witchcraft Practicioner, we are from different path. My forte is Witchcraft thats what i do best.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>I do conduct Energy Healing workshop &amp; other workshop from time to time. Currently, I only do attunement for "Mahatma Healing". <span style="color: #0000ff;">The Mahatma energy became available to all mankind through a unique Divine dispensation that came Directly from the Godhead, during the Harmonic Concordance, which was a special event upon the Earth in 1987. I no longer do any Reiki Attunements. I am a practicioner of "Usui Reiki". Over the years there are alot of sub branches of Reiki like Tummo Reiki(make use of Kundalini energy which is part of Tantric).....Angelic Reiki......&amp; many more! Only "Usui Reiki" is the purest form of ancient Healing power! </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Most cases in singapore are pertaining to individual personal needs &amp; mundane stuffs. From time to time there will be some interesting spiritual issues rather than psychic issues. Hexes &amp; Curses not so common in singapore but there are still some cases. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Love Hexes &amp; Spells cases i did handled quite a few over the years not solely from Thailand Black Magic only but some other Eastern Black Magic from other parts of Asia. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Power of the Spells, Hexes or Curses is highly dependable on the one who cast it. Their Strength varies,  Spells &amp; Hexes have limitations. However, one similarity is the longer a victim suffered from the Spells, Hexes or Curses, the harder to remove it, such Black Magick will grow in Strength as time goes by, going deeper in the astral bodies &amp; merged with the victim. Some is to a point can't be removed. If it is discovered early, can still be removed. Some cases need more time for the spiritual influences to be fully removed &amp; lifted. Most Curses are hard to break or removed, why it is called "Curses" because it is permanent, some can passed on from generation to generation.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I beg to differ, Thailand Black Magick is slow-acting but with strength, they can still be lifted if discovered early. Some need to be remove gradually but not immediately. Personally, i would say Javanese Magic is most difficult to deal with, as most of such Spell Casters will bid the Spells, Hexes or Curses to themselves, make it almost impossible to break or lift. In such cases, if their Spells, Hexes or Curses are broken or lifted, the one who cast it will come to harm or even death.<br></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Demon Possession or other kind of Possessions would need exorcism to purge out the baleful spirit, demons or animal spirits etc. If Possession has taken place for long time, it cannot be exorcised. It is also part of bad Karmic ties in cases of possession that take place. Even if you managed to purge out  the baleful spirit, demons or animal spirits, they might come back again in time to come to repossess their claimed victim again. It is very torturing for the body, mind &amp; spirit of the victim. Even in cases whereby Exorcism is successful, the weary victim might already lost their sanity or their body has already suffered irrecoverable harm. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I would suggest a consultation to verify if it is a genuine case of possession or simply a psychological case. If it is a psychological case i would suggest the person seek appropriate medical help. If it is a genuine case of possession, i can still help &amp; the client is ok with my energy-exchange fee, i would suggest an exorcism ritual done by myself personally or others from my organisation, the cost varies. If it is not possible, i will also let the client or family know, my LOA reserved all the right to reject any requests or cases upon my sole-discretion. </span></strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>What can Space Clearing do for you?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Space clearing is a powerful way to remove unwanted energy from your space and to fill your space with vibrant, positive energies or "Chi". LOA Space Clearing Service is very different from any Professional Metaphysical services that are available elsewhere irregardless locally or globally. It is exclusive &amp; unique to LOA only as we are not only doing energy work but spiritual work also to give the space a very thorough cleansing. Anyway LOA Space Clearing Service is solely facilitate by myself personally. Some common situations in which space clearing is recommended include:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>• When you move into a new home or office, to clear any negative "predecessor chi" <br>• Following significant life changes (such as marriage, or the birth of a child) <br>• If you are planning to sell your home, and want to entice buyers <br>• When you have been experiencing a period of bad luck, stress, or anxiety, to clear those vibrations from your space <br>• If you have been feeling stuck or hopeless about some aspect of your life <br>• When you want your home to have a clean and welcoming energy for visitors <br>• Any time you want to feel that you are making a fresh start</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The idea of purifying and blessing a space through ritual is as old as time. More people in this Modern Era with stressful lifestyle, over the years many have become more concern about their overall wellbeing, spiritual self, more aware of the intimate connection between their own energy and that of their homes and offices, interest in space clearing has increased as well.</strong></span></p>
