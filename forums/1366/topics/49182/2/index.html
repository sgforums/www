This was the reading that time... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>1-present position: 2 of wands<br>Presently in control of your situation, however, only you choose to only see wat you want. It'll seem that you brought your current plight upon yourself. Also you have been geeting the control you've been "demanding"!<br><br>2-Ostacles: The empress (r)<br>Conflicting elements. It lays patiently awaiting your move, judging, weighing and deciding it's own. It's part of the dark, but feeds on the light. Either darkness or light both feeds it, both doesn't affect it. Presence of three elements. Earth, ever changing, water, slow but steady- a stream. Air stagnant and oppresive, lacking fire, which is lacking in itself. The fire is supplied by outside eleents, the surrounding cards.<br><br>3-Goal: 10 of wands<br>The burden/obstacle you face are meant to help you advance, however your vision seems obscured now, unble to very clearly judge or see your path. Yet it seems that you are determined to perserve on. Again, the issue of control comes into view.<br><br>4-distant past: 2 of cups (r)<br>A partnership or supposedly healing relationship went wry, resulting in anger and indignation on both parties. Be careful of what is offered to you. Everything is connected! Therefore, becareful of small details for they too, meant certain thing.<br><br>5-recent past: 9 of wands<br>Seemed that the suspicion you had was clearer than before. You are temped to or have already called to the left-hand path? Seems to be some sort of guilt? or perhaps just restlessness? There is a way out, if you'd only allow yourself to see it...<br><br>6-future: Page of wands (r)<br>You seemed in control, seemed to have recovered fully... Though, have you really? It seemed that you're still the same person, yet sporting a different  "package". You have what you think you want, but at wat price?<br><br>7-querent: knight of pentacle (r)<br>Beware of illusions. Things are of a stand-still right now, and it seems that you are not paying enough attention to certain areas in your life. There seem to be this innate arrogance/pride about you, be careful you do not lose what you have becoz of that. Also, beware of those you trust, those you think supports you, may very well be the ones who overthrows you, so always judge their character wisely. Do not be too obessesssed with small things.<br><br>8-environmental: knight of wands<br>Taking lead and in control. Yet somewhat impulsive, charging into battle? Seemed rather demanding a task-master, in the end preferring to take over everything, letting yourself handle everything...<br><br>9-hopes, fears etc: Queen of cups<br>About a woman, wondering about romance perhaps? Something emotional, psyhic, deep nature. Seem worried, petulant? Suspicions keep revolving inside your head. Seemed that you are afraid that things are not what they seem. Hope to obtain glory, ut fer to trust and to miss out on other opportunities.<br><br>10-final: 5 of pentacles (r)<br>Refused help coz of pride? or of some personal views? Seek a balance. All that you wanted, you will have already achieved or can be very eastily achieved, if you know where to look. Do try really hard to see what is just in front of you, or you will miss it very easily. Everything is falling into it's place nice, what is supposed to be happening is happening, so try not to worry too much bah.</div></blockquote><strong><span style="color: blue;">Dear Mei Mei,<br><br>Thanks for your reading.......
