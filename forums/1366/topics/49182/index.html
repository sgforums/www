            <div class='col-md body'>Just a short intro of tarot here as well as advertising my sevices  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br><img src="http://www.osho.com/magazine/tarot/picCards/zen001TheFool.jpg"><br><br>Tarot has existed since around the late 14th century, although some believed it to be even earlier. The history of tarot is a mystery of it's own and that may be why it is so popular with people, even until today... The general believe was that when it first started out, tarot was just another card game for the public, but then was used as a divinatory tool, as was all card games generally  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Only difference between tarot cards and normal cards is that the tarot consists of 78 cards, while the normal deck have only 52... Oh, and nicer graphics <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>With tarot, there are also four suits, but with extra 22 trump cards and an additional card for each suit as compared to the playing cards. The trump cards or the major arcana is used mostly as a highlight or outline of events, with the minor arcanas, or the suits to provide more details. Generally tarot comprises of a lot of things, it can be linked from the esoteric studies like astrology and khabbalah to more familiar topics as psychology. Surely tarot is an art waiting to be mastered...<br><br>Being very interested in tarot, I took to learning this art a while ago. So just a beginner looking for anyone interested for a read, giving me a chance to polish my skills  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

This was the reading that time... just treat it as increase post count bah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>1-present position: 2 of wands<br>Presently in control of your situation, however, only you choose to only see wat you want. It'll seem that you brought your current plight upon yourself. Also you have been geeting the control you've been "demanding"!<br><br>2-Ostacles: The empress (r)<br>Conflicting elements. It lays patiently awaiting your move, judging, weighing and deciding it's own. It's part of the dark, but feeds on the light. Either darkness or light both feeds it, both doesn't affect it. Presence of three elements. Earth, ever changing, water, slow but steady- a stream. Air stagnant and oppresive, lacking fire, which is lacking in itself. The fire is supplied by outside eleents, the surrounding cards.<br><br>3-Goal: 10 of wands<br>The burden/obstacle you face are meant to help you advance, however your vision seems obscured now, unble to very clearly judge or see your path. Yet it seems that you are determined to perserve on. Again, the issue of control comes into view.<br><br>4-distant past: 2 of cups (r)<br>A partnership or supposedly healing relationship went wry, resulting in anger and indignation on both parties. Be careful of what is offered to you. Everything is connected! Therefore, becareful of small details for they too, meant certain thing.<br><br>5-recent past: 9 of wands<br>Seemed that the suspicion you had was clearer than before. You are temped to or have already called to the left-hand path? Seems to be some sort of guilt? or perhaps just restlessness? There is a way out, if you'd only allow yourself to see it...<br><br>6-future: Page of wands (r)<br>You seemed in control, seemed to have recovered fully... Though, have you really? It seemed that you're still the same person, yet sporting a different  "package". You have what you think you want, but at wat price?<br><br>7-querent: knight of pentacle (r)<br>Beware of illusions. Things are of a stand-still right now, and it seems that you are not paying enough attention to certain areas in your life. There seem to be this innate arrogance/pride about you, be careful you do not lose what you have becoz of that. Also, beware of those you trust, those you think supports you, may very well be the ones who overthrows you, so always judge their character wisely. Do not be too obessesssed with small things.<br><br>8-environmental: knight of wands<br>Taking lead and in control. Yet somewhat impulsive, charging into battle? Seemed rather demanding a task-master, in the end preferring to take over everything, letting yourself handle everything...<br><br>9-hopes, fears etc: Queen of cups<br>About a woman, wondering about romance perhaps? Something emotional, psyhic, deep nature. Seem worried, petulant? Suspicions keep revolving inside your head. Seemed that you are afraid that things are not what they seem. Hope to obtain glory, ut fer to trust and to miss out on other opportunities.<br><br>10-final: 5 of pentacles (r)<br>Refused help coz of pride? or of some personal views? Seek a balance. All that you wanted, you will have already achieved or can be very eastily achieved, if you know where to look. Do try really hard to see what is just in front of you, or you will miss it very easily. Everything is falling into it's place nice, what is supposed to be happening is happening, so try not to worry too much bah.</div>

Yet, do know that your past is waht shaped you into who you are today! Also some lessons must be earned, look for some recurring issues in your past, until you learn to break that vicious cycle, it will manifest itself yet again n some part of your life.<br><br>Present: 6 of swords<br>Quite a bit on your mind lately? Seemed to me as if you had let your imagination run wild. Even though you realised you made mistake, you still will let your pride take over and continue instead of apologizing. Make yur friends wisely, coz there is no point in doubting or suspecting deveryone in your life. At least make it o that there is at least one person you can put all your trust in, withou earing that he or she may break or run away with your trust. By keeping things to yourelf, doubting and unwilling to share, a rift is create in between you and your friends...<br><br>Future: Page of pentacles.<br>Oblivious to the things happning around you. You seem to have this idea, this fixation on a certain thing, concerning love. Perhaps you have this fixed idea tht the love of your life would follow the list you have kept, or maybe that relationships are supposed to be happening in a certain way or something... This fixation on one aspect of your romance life actually obscured your vision, your chances and opportunities. Remember that stubborness and pride does not and will not help in any of your situations.Athough it'll seem that knowledge and sincerity would! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Take care and lemme know how's the reading, thankx.</div>
