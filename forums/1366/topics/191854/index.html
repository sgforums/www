The Condition that manifested from Nothing will revert &amp; go back to Nothing.<br><br>What is most important is "NOW". At this Present Moment... right here..right now in our own minds. It does not matter how long we have had Negative Patterns, illness, bad relationship, stressful jobs, lack of finance, deprived of love, or even self-hatred, we can begin to make a change TODAY, yes starting from TODAY. The thoughts we once held, words we constantly use &amp; experiences that has created our life to this point All these are Past Thinking, we have already been there &amp; done that. What we are choosing to think &amp; say today, at this moment, will create Tomorrow, the next day, the next week, the next month, the next year &amp; all the days to come. The "POWER" is "NOW", this is where we begin to make changes. We can begin to let all the old nonsense, burdens &amp; rubbish go...Right NOW... the smallest beginning will make a BIG DIFFERENCE in the days to come...Create the POSITIVE CHANGE in our Lives...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>When we first come to this World as a tiny baby, we were of Pure Joy, Pure Energy of the Original Life Blueprint &amp; Pure Love. We KNOW how important we were, we were the center of the Universe, we love ourself totally through our free expression, we were Perfect, the truth of our Being. As times goes by as we grow, we become tainted &amp; clouded due to other factors like enviroment, we pick up &amp; learned nonsense &amp; so on. Whatever nonsense we learned can be unlearned. If we were taught as a child that the World is a frightening place then everything we hear, see &amp; feel fits in our beliefs &amp; Logical cognition, we will accept as True for us. "Don't trust people"..."People cheat you"..."Human are evil"... Likewise if we were taught early in life that the World is a safe &amp; joyous place then we would have a different perception. "Human are kind"..."Money comes to me easily"... &amp; so on. Life Experiences mirror our beliefs &amp; perceptions.<br><br>Take a moment now to question our beliefs &amp; perceptions. Gauge what in our mind is it true? What do we want in life? Stop for a moment to catch our thought. What are you thinking right now? If thoughts shape our lives &amp; experiences, Do you want this thought to become True for you. If its a thought of worries, anger, hurt, hatred or revenge, how do you think this thought will come back to you? If we want joyous life, we must have joyous thoughts. A prosperous life must have prosperous thoughts... A loving life must have loving thoughts &amp; so on... Whatever we send out to the Universe be it mentally or verbally will come back to us in like form. Positive thought will have Positive Outcome, Negative thoughts will only negate all outcomes.<br><br>Prepare a Notebook, Take a little time, listen to yourself &amp; words you say. If you said something more than 3 times, write it down. this probably has become a pattern for you. end of the week look at the list you made &amp; you will discover how your words fits your experiences. Be "WILLING" to change your thoughts &amp; words &amp; Watch your life CHANGE. None will think the same in mind as you, "Take Control of Your Life" is through your choice of words &amp; thoughts...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Both Good in our lives &amp; the Disease are the results of our own mental thought patterns which formed our experiences. We all have many thoughts patterns which produce Good, Positive Experiences which we enjoy. However its is the Negative Thought Patterns that produce Uncomfortable, Unrewarding Experiences which we are concerned. Its is our Desire to change the Disease in life to Perfect Health.<br><br>We all should now know that for every effect in our lives there is a thought Pattern that precedes &amp; maintains it. Our consistent thinking patterns create our experiences, therefore by changing our thinking patterns, we can change our experiences.<br><br>"The Mental Thoughts That Form Our Experience", The Words &amp; Thoughts Metaphysical Causations that create Experiences thus understanding the connection between Thoughts, Words, the other parts of body &amp; physical problems. At this moment you learned that how One had unknowingly created Disease in themselves &amp; this make a Great difference in life. Now you can stop blaming life &amp; other people for what was wrong in your life &amp; your body.You could now take Full Responsibilty for your own life &amp; health, you began to see how to avoid creating Negative Thought Patterns, that will manifest into a Real Disease in future.<br><br>For Example, a friend of mine was constantly bothered by stiff neck problems. Upon my consultation, i discovered that the pain in the neck was greatly linked to his thoughts &amp; character. He was a very inflexible person by nature, often refusing to listen to others &amp; seeing different sides of an issue. I urged him to be more flexible in his thinking &amp; able with a loving understanding to listen to those around him. Upon this change in his Thought Patterns, the stiff neck preoblem ceased to bother him. From time to time as &amp; when he fell abit of stiff neck, he would look in to see if his thinking is stiff &amp; rigid.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Inorder to permanently eliminate a condition, we must first work to dissolved the mental cause. Usually we do not know what the cause is &amp; we find it hard to know where to begin. Later on i am going to provide some clue to find the cause &amp; some Affirmations as a guide for building New thought Patterns which will produce Health in Mind, Body &amp; Spirit!<br><br>I have learnt every condition in our lives there is a NEED FOR IT otherwise we would not have it. The Symptom is only an Outer &amp; External Effect. We must go Within to dissolve the Mental Cause. this is why Will Power &amp; Discipline do not work as they are only battling the Outer Effect. Its like cutting down the weed without unrooting it. So before you begin the New Thought Pattern Affirmations, Work on the WILLINGNESS TO RELEASE THE NEED for headache, junk foods &amp; whatever bad habits or undesirable conditions. Wehnthe need is gone to the Outer Effect must die, no plant will survive without roots.<br><br>The Mental Thought Patterns that cause the most disease in the boday are CRITICISM, ANGER, RESENTMENT &amp; GUILT. For Instance, Criticismindulged long enough will often lead to Diseases such as Arthritis. Anger Become Boil, Rashes, burn &amp; infect the body. Resentment for prolonged period can eats &amp; fester away, ultimately manifest into Tumour &amp; Cancer. Guilt always seek punishment &amp; will lead to pain at different part of physical body. Its much easier to release these Negative Thinking Patterns from our mind when we are healthy rather than trying to dig them out when we are in a stae of Panic or threat under the surgeon's knife.<br><br>There is a need to replace old patterns, i offer with Love &amp; Light, a desire to share some simple methods of helping to  Â¨Â˜Â”Â°ÂºÂ• Heal Your BodyÂ•ÂºÂ°Â”Â˜Â¨.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

As i mention Will Power &amp; Discipline do not work as they just counter the Outer/External Effect of any illnesses. We have to release the Old Negative Thought Patterns replacing them with Positive Thought Patterns with Acceptance. Later i will share on some Affirmations to guide your Thought Pattern to a Healthier "YOU". Feel free to ask if you would like to counter on a specific pain or illness.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong>[/b]</blockquote><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>No worry, the illness flash out with the water i consumed. the disease run from my sunny smile.
