Driving him crazy, he wish he had never go. He regreted it so much.<br><br>Is oceanus a buddhist? Buddhist DO not practise witchcraft and definetely wont conduct a course to earn money out of it. My fren from buddhist told me that these kind of things are playing with evil spirits and devils. Enlighten me if i am wrong.

Oh gosh that is so bad but again hearsay like these are common, however if you are not the directly involved subject then it may not be of validity. Are you a buddhist? Kindly refrain from making comments of such to avoid incurring "Bad Karma".<br><br>My name is " OCEANOS ", do you have Learning Problem? Unable to comprehend what my alphabets make? My Haven is a NEW AGE Forum, so what do you think? Is this a Buddhist Sanctuary? Commentaries of any of your friends, your personal perspectives are none of my concern!<br><br>5-pointed Star is called a "Pentacle", 6-pointed Star is called a "Star Of David", Carrying the "Star Of David" doesn't make you a Jewish in any ways !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I have never heard before "Star Of David" is a symbol of Devil! Of no validity again i see. Thanks for your reply.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>What is "Noble"? Definition literally means "Having high moral qualities". What is a "Noble" Person? Someone having High Moral qualities however it must be recognised by all not just because of One or Two personal perspectives of it. Definitely a Noble Person would refrain from making any commentaries &amp; advices that are of no validity! So what do you think? Have a thought on it. Personally in my own perspective, Mother Teresa is Noble, Dalai Lama is considered Noble even the Pope is Noble. Other than that probably none can be held with such Term, Are they worthy?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>
