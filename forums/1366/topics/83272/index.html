Rather than (or so I had interpreted) after death it'll re-intergrate into the consciousness immediately unless the other memories (subtle bodies) have not completely disintergrated. Although I very strongly believe that even if the soul does not recognizes itself as a part of the consciousness, it still is linked to it. May not be able to merge with it but can most definitely identify/feel the connection... until it is ready to return itself to the awareness.</div>
