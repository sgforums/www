You may ask what is an "Evil Eye"? The "Evil Eye"  is the name for a sickness transmitted usually without intention by someone who is envious, jealous, or covetous. It is also called the invidious eye and the envious eye. In Hebrew it is ayin ha'ra (the evil eye), which in Yiddish is variously spelled ayin horoh, ayin hora, or ayen hara. In mainland Italian it is mal occhio (the bad eye) and in Spanish mal ojo or el ojo (the bad eye or just the eye). In Sicily it is jettatore (the projection [from the eye]) and in Farsi it is bla band (the eye of evil).<br><br>The "Evil Eye" belief is that a person otherwise not malific in any way, can harm you, your children, your livestock, or your fruit trees, by *looking at them* with envy and praising them. The word "Evil" is unfortunate in this context because it implies that someone has "cursed" the victim, but such is not the case. A better understanding of the term "Evil Eye" is gained if you know that the old British and Scottish word for it is "overlooking," which implies merely that the gaze has remained too long upon the coveted object, person, or animal. In other words, the effect of the "Evil Eye" is misfortunate, but the person who harbours jealousy and gives the "Evil Eye" is not necessarily an Evil person per se.<br><br>Well i would say your dream during your childhood years, the big dark blue eye you saw belongs to some entity or spirit that is watching over you. Many childrens are sensitive to vibrations, presence &amp; some do have spiritual sights just they do not know how to describe what they see, hear or feel. When we are born, all of us are of pure energy of the Original Life Blueprint, as times goes by as we grow, we become tainted &amp; clouded due to other factors like enviroment &amp; so on. Many of us do have the spiritual sight when we were young be it more or less but however Adults will always say its not true, they don't exist on &amp; on again, soon Logical cognition will take over &amp; totally eradicate the existence of these latent abilities or suppressing &amp; locked it deep within us untill we find the key to it, we will not be able to use these latent abilities again. By the time we reached puberty towards the phase of Adulthood, it is almost totally gone.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

The third eye can be only open using enenrgy or thru meditation. Another thing we not only have 3 eye but also 4th eye located at the back of head<br><br>Anantham<br>Pranashakty</div>
