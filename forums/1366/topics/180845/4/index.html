One of the higher Chakras...Thought-Form... its influence over psychic sense and spiritual enlightenment.<br><br>The Third Eye is related to what, in Eastern religions, is called the ajna center, and it is located between the eyebrows.<br><br>According to Esoteric Doctrines, "The third eye is an energy centre constructed by man; it is a correspondence to the energy centre, the causal body, constructed by the Monad."<br><br>Hope all these will give you a clear picture what is Third Eye.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The other day, I saw this very tanned chinese teen or young guy on the street had a strange tattoo shaped like some moon like the size of a 5 cents on his 'third eye' and I realized he also had some tatoo on his arms etc. Maybe he belongs to a cult or some secrete socities or such mystical body modification is supposed to give him powers?! Is this common and do people do that these days? Well, I tried to look but not stare as it is intrusive...Anyway,  I have not read about these spiritual things for years as I have lost faith in god, ghost, people or any meta physicals. To me, there is no need for any complicated prayers, procedures or rituals even if it is a rocket science discovery. They may just give you a temporal solace or sense of grandeur but you eventually become a follower of something  much like obsseissve compulsive disorders. I am not saying such things do not exist or put the believers or practitioners in disrepute as maybe you have got to experience them and whether it is real or make believe, I think very few  people how hard they try do possess these. Well, life is enough problems, so the simple motto is one should not do harm  (lest you are weak willed and believe in karma), but guard against envy (evil eye) and live for yourself (most have got a personal motive/ambition). That also means not to be too kind to others (do not belive that your god likes this and reward you with a lottery win).
