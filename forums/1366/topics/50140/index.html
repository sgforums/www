            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> COLDS AND SORE THROATS<br><br>Here are some proven remedies to relive cold symptoms,<br><br>* To banish a chest cold soak a large piece of a brown paper grocery bag in ACV.  Sprinkle cayenne pepper over the saturated paper and bind to the chest with cloth stips.  Make sure the pepper side is against the skin.  Leave on for 20 minutes remove and wash with warm water<br><br>* You can ease a sore throat caused by a cold by mixing one quarter cup honey and one quarter cup apple cider vinegar.  Take 1 tablespoon every four hours or as needed. A sore throat heals faster if you sip a tonic made of one half cup ACV to one half cup water and three tablespoons honey and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.<br><br>Gargling wit ACV also helps soothe a sore throat.  Use a tablespoon of ACV added to a glass of warm water and gargle a mouthful of the solution every hour.  I also put two drops of betidine as well to this.<br><br>*gargling with ACV kills strep germs, Dr Jarvis observes this treatment has cured a streptococci sore throat in 4 hours.  The patient became free of symptoms even before the state laboratory confirmed that the culture showed the presence of streptococci.<br><br>Also try this Place a thin cloth soaked in ACV over the throat.  Cover the cloth with a hot, damp towel to heat the throat and neck so the ACV is absorbed throuh the skin.  If a dry night cough keeps you awake, try sprinkling your pillow with apple cider vinegar before going to bed.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> DIGESTION<br><br>Good health often depends on good digestion.  2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar (honey optional) in a glass of water at each meal can keep your digestive system in top shape.  ACV destroys the bacteria, fungi and viruses that make us sick.<br><br>*Making ACV a daily havit can even protect you from accidental food poisioning from tainted fish, meat or bad mayonaise based salads.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> UPSET STOMACH<br><br>Summertime with its picnics and other outdoor activities is prime time for diarrhea or upset stomach caused by foods that are left to long with out refrigeration.  Apple cider vinegar can mean the difference between a bad or a mild case of food poisoning.  A teaspoon of apple cider vinegar added to a glass of water miraculously soothes the digestive tract even after the symptoms appear.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> NAUSEA<br><br>Others claim you can relieve the discomfort of nausea if you soad a cloth in warm ACV wring it out and place it on your stomach.  Replace with anotehr warm cloth as the first one cools.<br><br>* If you awake with nausea or vomiting, stick with apple cider vinegar and water throughout the day.  By evening you should be able to keep light food down.  Continue to take vinegar and water five times a day for the next three days to make sure the bacteria is completely out of your system.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> DIARRHEA<br><br>Some experts believe that apple cider vinegar can prevent food poisiong or travelers diarrhea.  If you are traveling outside the US bring your own supply of ACV and honey.  Thirty minutes before meals, take the usual dosage, 1 teasppon of each, Just make sure you use bottled water or some other sealed beverage with the mixture.<br><br>* Sometimes diarrhea strikes at home, mild food poisoning allergic reaction monor bacterial infection fatigue, stress or overeating many bring it on.  Whatever the cause depletion and dehydration are the results.  Drink lots of water throughout the bout and after mineral water is best.  The same prevention advice applies if you know you are going to be eating a large meal that may give you indigestion.  Drink the standard ACV cocktail 15 minutes before you sit down to eat.  Experts advise that if the diarrhea hasnt cleared up after three days, you should see your doctor.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> OTHER DIGESTION PROBLEMS<br><br>The regular ACV treatment before each meal or three times a day accomplishes three things, it destroys the harmful bacteria thats causing the condition it supplies lost fluids and it replaces the valuable potassium that your system loses.  Nutrutionists have discovered that ACV is remarkabley like the stomach acids that keep digestion flowing naturally and evenly.  And its well known that good digestion means the body is metabolizing foods and nutrients in the way thats necessary to keep the body well oiled and fueled for action.<br><br>* Many folk remidies suggest ACV for a variety of tummy problems including hiccups and excess gas.  Other advocates of apple cider vinegar recommend taking a teaspoon of ACV before meals as a digestive aid.  Hold the solution in your mouth for a few seconds before swallowing.  This will start the saliva flowing.  Which then turns on the stomachs digestive fluid faucet.  The result better digestion...<br><br>* To avoid heartburn mix 1 teaspoon of ACV in half glass water and sip it throughout the meal.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> FEET AND LEGS<br><br>The next time you have sore, aching feet fill the bathtub with ankle deep warm water.

Do this in the morning and just before going to bed at night your sore feet will feel cool, soothed and relaxed.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> ATHLETES FOOT<br><br>Apple cider Vinegar is also beneficial for treating athletes foot.  If the infection is severe, you may want to soak your feet in undiluted apple cider vinegar for ten minutes.  It may sting, but it only lasts for a few seconds.  Afterward, moisten gauze with the cider vinegar and apply it to the infected area.  Then cover with a dry sock.  Kep the pads on overnight and soak your feet again the next morning.  The infection should clear up in about two weeks.  Athletes foot is a fungal infection that thrives in dark, warm moist places such as your shoes.

To remove ferms from your socks or pantyhose, soak in a mixture ofone part ACV and 5 parts water.  Soak for 30 minutes vefore washing as usual.<br><br>One home remedy requires soaking a slice of bread in apple cider vinegar.  Secure it in place with a gauze bandage overnight.  By morning the corns or calluses should have disappeared.<br><br>* to soften and dissolve corns, soak the affected areas in a solution of warm water and half cup ACV for 30 minutes.  Dry with a course towel and gently rub with a pumice stone.

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> HEADACHES<br><br>Most headaches are caused by too much alkali in the system say many nutritionist and naturopathic physicians.  When the body chemistry is changed back to a natural acidity headaches dissappear or lessen in severity.  Dr Jarvis firmly believes that the best way to restore your bodys natural acidity level is to drink a soloution of ACV and water at every meal.  For very bad headaches he suggests doubling the amount of ACV.  He also recommends 2 teaspoonsful of honey at each meal as a way to prevent headaches.  If the headache does not appear, take a no process of digestion and will quickly be in the bloodstream, the headache will often lessen by the end of a half hour.  If not another teaspoonful of honey should be taken.<br><br>* Another remedy for relieving migraines is a vinegar vapor. Mix equal parts vinegar and water together in a pan on the stove and bring it to a slow boil.  Lean your head over the pan and inhale the fumes.  You can concentrate the effects by draping a towel over your head while breathing the vapor.  According to Dr. Jarvis prescription inhale fumes for 75 breaths.  Generally you will find that the headache stops for about half an hour.  If it starts again it will be 50 percent less severe.  The use of the headache tablets can be stopped if the apple cider vinegar fumes method is emplyed.<br><br>* The same treatment works with a modern vaporizer just add a few drops of ACV to the water.  Lie quietly and breathe the vapors for about five minutes.  In most cases the headache will be gone in 20 minutes.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> INFECTIONS<br><br>A single dose of apple cider vinegar is packed with about 30 vital nutrients a dozen minerals half a dozen vitamins, essental amino acids perctin and enzymes all critical to good health.  What researchers still arent sure of is why apple cider vinegar is such a powerful antiseptic and anibiotic and why it promotes faster healing.  Scientists say that the precise ingredients of apple cider vinegar may vary according to the type and condition of the apples used.  Laboratory researchers who investigated the health properties of apple cider vinegar reported that this marvelous substance contains no less than 93 different compunds that are considered important to good health and a balanced metabolism.  For hundreds of years, folk medicine has prescribed vinegar or aplle cider vinegar to treat internal and external infections for two reasons....the antiseptic componetnt of ACV kills germs on contact while its antibiotic content contains good bacteria that attacks the microorganisms causing the infection.  Here are some of the infections treated with ACV.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> EAR INFECTIONS<br><br>Apple cider vinegar has been used to treat chronic middle ear infections when traditional drug therapies fail.  The usual treatment is to place a few drops of ACV into the infective ear for half a minute then tilt your head to the other side so the viegar drains out.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> URINARY KIDNEY BLADDER INFECTIONS<br><br>Thousands of people suffer from urinary tract, kidney or bladder infections ailments that recur frequently and often show strong resistance to treatment by antiviotics.  Nutrutionists and naturalists believe ACV can cure these ailments apple cider vinegar when taken daily maintains an acid environment in the urinary tract that greatly reduces the likelihood of a stubborn kidney or bladder infection.<br><br>* Apple cider vinegar combats inflamation of the kidneys, an infection that  can lead to a backup of toxins and blood poisoning.  The acid in vinegar makes the urinary tract unfriendly to germs.  Two teaspoons of vinegar in water can also prevent a potentially dangerous condition called pyelitis, in which pus cells originating in the bladder are present in the urine.  Others suggest adding a cup of apple cider vinegar to a warm bath twice a day helps to heal bladder infections.  According to Dr. Jarvis apple cider vinegar is a poweful infection fighter because it keeps moisture away from the harmful bacteria that needs it to survive.  If the process goes unchecked and the bacteria continu to multiply they rob the body of fluids.  In the case of E. coli bacteria untreated infections can easily lead to death.  Of course you shouldnt let any infection progress to that stage before you seek medical attention, but in Dr Jarvis view there is no better way to protect against the invasion of life threatening bacteria than by forming a daily habit of ingesting ACV before each meals.If there is enough potassium in each body cell it will draw moisture from the bacteria, instead of the bacteria taking moisture from the body cells.  It is by eating foods which are a source of potassium such as fruit berries edible leaves, edible roots, honey and ACV that the body cells are provided with the moisture attrating potassium needed to fight bacteria.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> SKIN<br><br>Scientist tell us that ACV is effective in treating skin disorders, from acne to warts because the pH is identical to normal healthy skin.  Apply ACV to the damaged areas will help normalize the pH on the skins surface and foster healing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> SUNBURN<br><br>Several home remedies suggestbathing as quickly as possible after sun exposure in a cool to lukewarm bath to which 1 or 2 cups of ACv have been added.  Lightly pat the sunburned skin with ACV to relieve the sting and burning sensation.<br><br>Use Same Methods for<br><br>BURNS<br><br>ITCHY SKIN<br><br>BITES<br><br>WARTS<br><br>BLEMISHES<br><br>HAIR AND SCALP<br><br>WEIGHTLOSS<br><br>Millions of dieters can save time and anxiety by following this basic folk medicine dieting tip.<br>[color=0099cc]<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Mix 1 tablespoon of honey in a glass of unsweetened grapefruit juice.(make sure you are not on medications that say not to use grapefruit juice with your medication) Drink the solution a half hour before each meal.  The ACV treatment curbs your appetite, regulates the thyroid and is said to help make the pounds just melt away.  Nearly all the doctors and nutritionists who prescribe ACV  for various illnesses also recommended it as an aid to weight loss.  Simply drinking a glass of water mixed with a teaspoon of ACV is said to act as a natural appetite suppressant.
