But letÂ’s face it, we live in a world where psychodynamics are what make the world go around. An individual who wishes to live successfully in the world as a spiritual person really needs to understand that psychology is as spiritual as prayer.

We are all swimming in the projections and filters of each otherÂ’s life experiences and often we are just the stand-ins, the chess pieces of life to which our loved ones have their own built-in reactions. This is not to dehumanize life or take away the intimacy from our relationships, but mainly for us to know that almost every time we get offended, we are actually just in a misunderstanding.<br><br>A true embodiment of this idea actually allows for more intimacy and less suffering throughout all of our relationships. When we know that we are just the one who happens to be standing in the right place at the right psychodynamic time for someone to say or do what they are doingÂ—we donÂ’t have to take life personally. If it werenÂ’t us, it would likely be someone else.<br><br>This frees us to be a little more detached from the reactions of people around us. How often do we react to a statement of another by being offended rather than seeing that the other might actually be hurting? In fact, every time we get offended, it is actually an opportunity to extend kindness to one who may be sufferingÂ—even if they themselves do not appear that way on the surface. All anger, all acting out, all harshness, all criticism, is in truth a form of suffering. When we provide no Velcro for it to stick, something changes in the world. We do not even have to say a thing. In fact, it is usually better not to say a thing.<br><br>People who are suffering on the inside, but not showing it on the outside, are usually not keen on someone pointing out to them that they are suffering. We do not have to be our loved oneÂ’s therapist. We need only understand the situation and move on. In the least, we ourselves experience less suffering and at best, we have a chance to make the world a better place.<br><br>This is also not to be confused with allowing ourselves to be hurt, neglected or taken advantage of. True compassion does not allow harm to ourselves either. But when we know that nothing is personal, a magical thing happens. Many of the seeming abusers of the world start to leave our lives. Once we are conscious, so-called abuse can only happen if we believe what the other is saying. When we know nothing is personal, we also do not end up feeling abused. We can say, Â“Thank you for sharing,Â” and move on. We are not hooked by what another does or says, since we know it is not about us.<br><br>When we know that our inherent worth is not determined by what another says, does or believes, we can take the world a little less seriously.

            <div class='col-md body'>Confession time:  I give people the impression that I do not get offended when a transgression is committed against me.  When things go against my way, my outward expression is one of calm and flexibility.  I refuse to get angry - even though I might be inside.<br><br>Then I store it.  Usually, it goes away on its own.  Sometimes I need help with it - like I need to run, or vent it elsewhere.  Sometimes I drink it away.<br><br>But sometimes - it corrupts me.  I know I haven't let it go.  I know I'm angry.  But it feels wrong to be angry.  But to me - it shouldn't be wrong.  I should get angry.  I should be allowed to let it out.<br><br>Then when I think like that - all it takes is a trigger.  One event/person/thing to set me off.  And I lose all control.  All the rage and negativity comes out in a flood.  Most times this means I raise my voice uncontrollably and speak in a highly threatening tone.  Basically - I pick a fight.<br><br>On a few occasions, I didn't pick a fight.  I just went ahead and started one.  And on at least one occasion I can remember, I finished the fight too.  I try not to remember these incidents.  They scare me.<br><br>I do believe there is a way to not get offended.  Its a mindset.  But not one I have.  Sad right?</div>

I will leave most of these alone.  Just say that although the idea is noble, this doctor needs to spend a year in a working person's shoes.<br><br>Hell yes you are going to get offended, no you don't have to take it personally, but sooner or later you are going to have to take a stand against someone for yourself, otherwise get used to "washing the shoe prints of your shirts".<br><br>I'll just said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Art Of Not Being Offended</span> is not something everyone is capable of doing all the time, there are very few Mother Teresas out there.<br><br>Sooner or later, someone... somewhere is going to find out how to push your buttons, and yes we all have triggers which will elicit responses, social as well as physical.

Its easier said than done but still its always good to try. Everything is a "Cycle" or "Circle", its neverending. You are who you chose to interact/hang out with, Birds of feathers flock together.
