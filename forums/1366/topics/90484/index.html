            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet ooh_lala,<br><br>Well Astrology can only be use as a guideline or reference pertaining to one's Lifepath, some characteristic traits are inherent definitely but doesn't mean it fits perfectly to all who are born on the same day mainly due to the different astrological hours of the time of birth. Energies are shifting every minute &amp; second in different planes &amp; dimensions. We are all living in the third dimension &amp; energies can only be felt at fourth dimension therefore nothing is confirmed in this plane of existence, its everchanging due to one's personal energy, enviromental factors &amp; external influences!<br><br>Intuitively i would say you are someone who is skeptical, stubborn however you do have charisma which is definitely due to the Venus influence in your Lifepath but that will not compensate trials &amp; obstacles you will meet due to your own egoistic &amp; at times domineering over-conceited ways. Well sales job or job that require alot of movements are quite suitable for you, Office job may just bored you out...ha ha<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway welcome to my haven...hope you enjoy your stay in here...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

NO way... can age faster....</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I relate to sun as the prominant male figure in your life, which I would place that role upon your father. With the sun in the 4th house, and the 4th house being that represented by family, similarly I would place that your father plays an important role in your life. Upon assumption, I placed your 4th house under scorpio, which led me to the impression that your father was of a more imposing figure throughout your life. One thing though, your mother is not squeaky clean, tidy person due to the virgo in your moon. Remember at the very least, you are born after your mother. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> The moon in virgo would reflect the type of person that your mother is, the influence she would have over you and in your life, but it will not determine or change her character as you had seem to imply, nor is it in any way due to you. It is the way you perceive her/she reacts to you.<br><br>What I was trying to say was... Normally you are not such a person, but should an opportunity presents itself and appeals immensely to you, you have the ability and will take advantage of the situation to your advantage. Irregardless of the thoughts and sometimes emotions of people around you (thus presenting yourself as cold) and sharp to even the littlest opening that may turn the situation to what you want or your advantage (and thus appearing calculating).<br><br>Mwahahahaha~ $ or youth? You know your lifepath number, and the advices. That may give you a clearer direction in perhaps where you wanna head towards.</div>
