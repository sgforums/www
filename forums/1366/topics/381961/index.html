              <p>Hey~</p>
              <p>I think that exploring tarot is a good thing. Do know that reading a book about cards and actually having experiences with them are quite different. Depending on the books that you have about the cards- it could make a whole world of difference as well.</p>
              <p>You are just starting out, lower your expectations. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> Do not strive for 100% accuracy.<br>I feel that in order to be accurate, you will need to find your own voice. Your way of relating to your cards.</p>
              <p>When you say that your reading was totally off the point, was it addressing an issue that your father may not be too forthcoming about? <br>Or was it talking about an altogether different issue from what you were asking? <br>Did it make sense, or was it totally nonsensical? <br>In retrospect now, did that "off-the-point" reading now make sense in regards to your situation back then...?<br>All of these are different situations that you may encounter, and will result in a different explanation and advice to proceed.</p>
              <p>If you do encounter any more issues, feel free to enquire around. People here are generally helpful (if you can find them online, in time). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br><strong>Do remember-- practise safely, and do not dabble with anything beyond your scope. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></strong> (Beginner's luck can only cover you so far- beyond which you had better know what you are getting yourself into...) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Until then, lucks with your exploration, and be safe~<br>Take care! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>

              <p><br>I still worship Satan, but I also worship God. I am currently at a stage in my life when I believe in both Satan and God.</p>
              <p>I used to believe in God, then lost faith in him. Then, I worship Satan and later began to question him. Then, I believe in God, again, but had not given up entirely on Satan, either.</p>
              <p>I guess you can say I am currently at a stage where I believe in both God and Satan.</p>
