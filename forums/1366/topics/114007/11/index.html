            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/broken-heart-pictures.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All<br><br>If you are separated from the one that you love, the "ABSOLUTE WORSE" thing that you can do is to sit around and feel sorry for yourself and even if you have resorted to Magick, it will take time before your desires manifest, as we already know nothing happens overnight and depending on the circumstances of your situation it may require more or less time to see results and in most cases it will require more than a couple of months and depending on the turns and twists along the way it may take even a great deal more time than that!<br><br>If you have made a decision to work with Magick to achieve your desire of reuniting with your lover allow yourself to undergo a Healing Process, Healing is necessary to make the heart whole again, far too many times someone we love hurts us dearly and we force ourselves to get over it or we fool ourselves into thinking that we have gotten over it and by some small miracle the one that we love comes back into our life and sitting at the dinner table one night we explode and go off like a rocket being launched to the moon, why? Because instead of Healing while we were waiting for results from the spells that we weaved, we were busy feeling sorry for ourselves, we were busy pushing and rushing through a process that requires time; ladies and gentlemen the Healing Process is part of that time!<br><br>You can whine and cry all you want about how much it hurts to be without the one that you love, but unless you take advantage of the time that you have without them and allow your Heart to Heal, it will not last when it finally does come back together. If you are hurting and crying all of the time you are not Healing and while crying is part of the emotional release process, if you are still wailing after a few weeks of separation you do not need Magick, you need a shrink, Time is the Greatest Healer of all, especially where our hearts are concerned!<br><br>Anyone who expects instant results from a spell casting is delusional, it does not work that way, there is an assumption by the general population that it works that way because after all it is magic or they have been told by some irresponsible Psychic or Healer who has no concept of Magick at all, that it works that way, but Magick, as we know doesnÂ’t manifest just to appease us, folks even when I cast a spell for myself I stay focused on my life and continue with my plans knowing that I have enlisted the aid of the God/Goddess and the Universal forces, I do not sit around and allow my life to go to hell in a hand basket while wallowing in self-pity!<br><br>What if the shoes were on the other feet? Try reversing roles, switch places with your lover and take a long hard look at yourself, whining, crying and wallowing in self-pity all of the time is not very attractive, if you are honest with yourself you know that if you were him or her that you would not want to be with "you" either, not under those circumstances!<br><br>Most people who are of a strong character desires the same from a partner and while there will be similarities there will also be differences and those differences are what keep the relationship interesting and viable! No one wants to be with someone who has to be constantly reassured and on the other hand if your mate has a history of being unfaithful, why do you still desire to be with him or her?<br><br>The bottom line here is "COMMON SENSE", if you love the person and have committed yourself to reuniting with them, let go of the past and this means letting go of their indiscretions as well. Most of all let go of the pain of the past, allow your heart to heal, become a stronger individual, make better decisions for yourself and in the process define what you are willing to accept from that special someone in a relationship, I would also recommend that you define what is unacceptable as well!<br><br>The main responsibility that we have in life is to ourselves, it is important to set boundaries within our lives and our relationships, as I have stated so many times before if you are unable to make yourself a "Priority" in your life, you cannot expect someone to make you a priority in their life and part of your "Priority" has to be to Heal and to become "WHOLE" again!<br><br>Perpetuating a broken heart, Let Healing now begins...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>was watching a taiwanese show just now.  An astrologist revealed a simple ritual for inviting love (tao hua).  Not sure real or not but sounds easy enough to do as long as you have the stuffs ready.  The celebrities on the show seem to have used this ritual and highly recommend it.<br><br>You need roses and a bath tub.<br><br>Choose a period of 7 consecutive days (11pm to 1 am) for this ritual. buy 7 roses of 7 different colours (if you have someone in your life or in your mind, then buy 7 roses of same colour), pluck 3 petals from each rose (total 21 petals).  Fill your bath tub with warm water and sprinkle it with 21 petals.  Between 11pm to 1 am, submerged yourself in the rose petals warm water for 7 min. During this 7 min, try to make your love wish.   Repeat the ritual for 7 consecutive days.<br><br>Sound like spa treatment!  Rose petal bath!  When I was young, I remember showering in those flowers that my mum buy to pray.  Mummy said it will keep us safe!  Pity I don't have bath tub at home, or else, can try this rose petal bath.  Can de-stress while inviting love in your life! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>By the way, this is just sharing of information.  if you decide to do this ritual, you are doing it at your own risk. I am no expert so I am not sure what is the risk involved in doing this ritual. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Best is you get the love attraction bath salt from oceanos.  at least that one no need bath tub.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>By the way, the show also mentioned wearing rose quartz is great for attracting love.

Well Flower Bath Water are common &amp; evident in many different cultures &amp; practises. Not only for purpose of love, some for blessing, removing bad luck &amp; many more. The 7 Day 7 Roses Bath can be quite a hassle, time consuming &amp; costly too. I do not think its possible to get roses of 7 different colours unless a specialised florist &amp; provided you are willing to pay for Holland Roses.

Its not about the quality of the Quartz Crystal as long its a genuine quartz then will work too but prior to that you got to cleanse it of all the remnant energies then follow by programming it to work for you. This kind of programming involves you projecting certain wishes &amp; intetentions into your crystal, which will send out vibrations to attract what you want. If you desire excellent result will need some magickal enchantment to enhance.

Helps with insecure feelings, removes blockages and balances the emotions. Good for respiratory disorders. However this is not at all a stone for attracting love but more for emotional healing for wearers to love themselves more. Rosequartz is a more widely known all rounder stone of love.
