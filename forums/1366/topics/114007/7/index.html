Do You need Love? Do you want to find New Love? Have you ever wonder what is that thing missing in your Life? Is It Love? Lover's Tiffs &amp; Quarrel? Communication breakdown? Any Love Issues? I may be able to help you if you let me to, Invite Love into your Life!<br><br>Many may wonder What is Love Spell? How do Love Spell work? How to make Love Spell work for you?<br><br><img src="http://creativity.net/images/12Heart.gif"><br><br>Individuals who are inquiring about love spells approach me often, in my opinion magic of any kind should never be taken lightly, especially love spells. Magic or the act of casting a spell opens a door and creates a window of opportunity, and often it is a small window or timeframe that we are working with, but in many cases it is just enough to allow things to flow and manifest into fruition!<br><br>When someone cast a love spell or even ask for help from a reputable practitioner it is crucial to understand that in order for your desire to manifest it has to be allowed to flow, once the work is done and the request has been made unto the Goddess, in most cases when I weave a love spell I call on Venus, the ultimate weaver of the web of love! As well once she has granted my request I repay her favoritism by burning thanksgiving incense unto her and I always give back something from myself as a gesture of good will.<br><br>The exchange is very important because that is indeed what keeps the energy flowing freely, if you the think of it in this manner, money is a universal energy, and we exchange money for services that we receive, believe it or not when you pay your gas, electric or phone bill it is an exchange of energy between you and your provider, the provider gives you a service that is important to your survival and in return you give back to that provider by paying your bill and insuring that the provider will be able to continue supplying you with the services that you so desperately need.<br><br>I know that we have become spoiled, because there is not one individual reading this article who would want to live without heat or the air conditioning, and as long as you can make the exchange you will not have to! Energy goes both ways and the energy that we exchange with the universe is in my opinion equally if not of a greater importance than paying the electric bill.<br><br>When a love spell is cast, we call upon a collective universal consciousness, you have to look at it this way, if all you ever did was withdraw funds from your bank account without making any deposits your bank would become displeased in a very short period of time, picture the universe as one big bank, and the Gods as bankers, it is okay to make requests and withdrawals, but please make certain that you are doing your part by making a deposit every once in a while.<br><br>Believe it or not one of the easiest ways for us to give thanks is rolling around in our heads, mental energy, whispering an incantation, saying a prayer or meditating for the good of mankind, these are all easy ways to make a deposit into our universal bank accounts, now if you choose to get creative volunteering at your local homeless shelter, working with the underprivileged, or simply making a donation to your favorite charity is an excellent way as well. The most important thing is that whatever method you choose must come from a sincere place within and just like with everything else make certain that your motives are honorable and pure.<br><br>As a practitioner that offers services to a wide array of people I cannot always count on my clients giving thanks unto the Gods and the Universe, so I take it upon myself to always give thanks on their behalf, part of the reason that I choose to do this is because my karma is at stake every time that I cast a spell, whether it is for me or for someone else, I want to make certain that the Gods know that any assistance that they provide me with is greatly appreciated. When working with love energy it is very important to make sure that you turn on your love magnet, especially in cases where you may be trying to reconnect with someone where the relationship ended on a bad note, you cannot expect to exhibit the same behavior and have your lover eating out of your hands, in order to be effective you must change the pattern of energy that you are working in.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br><br>[/b]</blockquote><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/meowsusan/Sgforums/purplelove.jpg"><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/meowsusan/Sgforums/purplelove.jpg"><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/meowsusan/Sgforums/purplelove.jpg"><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/meowsusan/Sgforums/purplelove.jpg"></div>

They claim to love the person they desire to be with, but they are willing to go to any extreme to get them back, even black magick! That is not love!<br><br>In most cases after I explain to them the ramifications of partaking in black-magic I almost always decline working with and accepting them as a client. Why you may ask? Because what they have already participated in can and will have a negative impact on anything that I attempt to assist them with.<br><br>Throughout life and our many incarnations we incur a little thing called karma, most people have no idea what that means and in layman's terms it simply means that you are responsible for your actions and thoughts and everything be it good or bad will come home to roost, the Universe will hold you accountable! It is far better that your actions be of a higher standard than end up having to pay the piper for the wrong that you have done someone and all in the name of love!<br><br>I refuse to participate in black magick doesn't mean that I do not acknowledge and respect your right to participate in it, if you so choose, but let me tell you that when you are dealing with love and you cross the line and decide to wield a negative love spell in an attempt to be reunited with someone, the sad fact of the matter is that in all probability that love will be lost forever.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br></div>

I took the time to consider the message and the image that I wish to convey to the World Masses and my potential clients, when you look at what I have put into place, it defines who I am and what I am about very clearly.<br><br>I took it a step further by choosing to label myself as A White Witch, A Healer, A Clairvoyant, A Lightworker, A Psychic, A Practitioner of the White Magickal Arts, A Weaver of White Magick Love Spells! By doing so I am constantly reinforcing who I am and what I do and better yet what I will not do, and that is to cross the line and weave black magick that will force another back into the arms of one my clients, it can and has been done before and will undoubtedly be done again, just not by me!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

As long as the magick that you wield or have wielded on your behalf is true to life white and pure as the driven snow!<br><br>I have cast many love spells on my behalf over the years but only for serious cases that required my Action subjected on case to case basis and I was always careful not to cross the line into the never-ending cycle of the darkness and dank energy that comes from casting a black magick love spell, now I will be the first to tell you that black magick has its place and I have used it in my own self- defense or in the defense of a loved one, admittedly I have directed it to someone who has wronged or harmed me in my defense and I always make certain that my actions are and were justified and that I use no more force than necessary to set things right for myself and the ones that I love.<br><br>There has to be a balance in nature and in the Universe, you cannot have a positive force without its negative opposing force, even the Christians can relate to this concept with their belief in Heaven and Hell! Good would not exist in the world without bad, we would not even have an understanding as to how to define the word itself without its opposition.<br><br>The bottom line that you have to look at when you are considering casting or having a love spell cast on your behalf or by yourself is this: Will the end result justify the means and will I gain more than I lose? I can tell you that if the love spell that is being cast is of a dark nature and it is not a White Magick Love Spell, you will lose far more than you ever gain!<br><br>The end result will always justify the means, the end result will reflect your true intentions, this is why I always tell everyone that I decide to work with, to make certain that they are coming from a place of love, it is easy for them to lie to me and to fool me into working and weaving a love spell on their behalf, but they cannot lie to the Universe or to the Divine and therefore the end result that is received will always reflect their true motivation!<br><br>Any Magickal work that is performed by a practitioner on your behalf or yourself will have an impact on your personal karma and when I perform a White Witch Love Spell for a client I never allow myself to become emotionally involved, if I did I couldn't be effective and I go to even greater lengths to shield myself from any negative repercussions that may arise due to a clients dishonesty with me and with themselves about their motives! Of coz when i recommend a client to do a Spell, i will always remind them to do it with Positivity &amp; Love for everything to work well, end of the day it depends on what is your need? What you want? I can only provide the Tools to help by making a Spellkit for you, the User of these Tools &amp; Caster of the spell will still be you, yourself, your Intent!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Casting a pure White Magick Love Spell is one thing, nurturing and growing the feelings that are there or even once were there, is another, but blatantly crossing the line and pulling someone back to you in a negative way is ludicrous!<br><br>I mean you may get what you want for just a little while, but if what you receive wasn't manifested out of love it will not last and your results will be minimal! Furthermore you will never really know whether or not that person loves you or if their feelings were forced upon them, you will always be left with doubt which will eventually undermine and destroy your relationship beyond repair!<br><br>White Magick Love Spells may take longer to manifest and produce the desired results, after all it takes more energy to do something of a positive nature than that of a negative, people are so much more comfortable with focusing on the negative and of course it takes less energy to be negative and that is why we have all the meanness, nastiness and mischief on the planet!<br><br>My advice to anyone who is considering casting a love spell or having one cast is to make certain that you have done a great deal of soul searching and make sure that you are coming from a very sincere and positive space, magic should always be taking seriously and the pros and cons weighed very carefully, to set about casting a white magick love spell with anything less than love in your heart is to set sail in a ship that will surely sink to the bottom of the ocean.<br><br>Love is a wonderful thing when it is reciprocated, often my clients find themselves in very negative situations with little or no " Communication ", " Communication " is important but not necessary in order to manifest positive results from a love spell. I often tell my clients that if they can keep the conversation light and airy and it doesn't impact them in a negative way try and keep the communication open and flowing!<br><br>Some people definitely have the wrong idea about magick and how the process works, it is entirely unreasonable to expect any kind of results overnight. You have to look at it this way, the situation that you are dealing with at the moment didn't happen overnight and more than likely the resolution will take even longer, the best approach to magick and especially white witch love spells is to throw it to the four winds and be open and ready to accept what the Divine and the Universe returns to you.<br><br>Dealing with magick and love spells in particular you can define exactly what you are looking for or desire in a mate, but sometimes the Universe will send you something entirely different, when you cast a love spell you never really know what the Divine holds in store for you and what she decides to send you may just be for your highest good!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

She hope to gain contact with her Ex-Boyfriend whom she still love in her heart &amp; left her due to something wrong she done in the past. I recommended her a "Love Reconciliation Spellkit". Few Weeks later, she called me &amp; told me that now she is able to ask him out for a dinner which prior to casting the spell, she was ignored by him even she took the initiative to ask him out, conversation was even minimal. Surprisingly after casting the spell, he seems more receptive &amp; been able to talk more, she decided to ask him out. They finally can have a heart to heart talk &amp; dinner together again &amp; its good enough. Whether they can be together again just let nature takes its course. At least she is happy that she is able to resolve the differences &amp; unhappiness they had previously &amp; untied the knot dangling in her heart. The whole Issue previously has affected her not only emotional but also her career. Now she is able to concentrate on her career &amp; her sales is picking up.<br><br>The above is a great example as to how the Universe will provide for you once the door is open, magick can open many doors and is not limited to just our love life, I for one believe that all aspects of our lives can be improved by utilizing the magickal force within ourselves and tapping into the cosmic energy pool. Magick is everywhere and as long as you remember to give back and to pay respect to the Gods, Goddesses, Divine and the Universe and you never take more than you need you are fine to go about fulfilling all of your desires.<br><br>I challenge you today to take control of your life and to stop procrastinating, as a human being you have the right to be happy and you have every right to love and to be loved as long as you do not harm yourself or another, the Universe will provide for you that which you seek and ask for. Love is in the air as it is nothing more than energy, love can and will manifest in your heart if you are open and ready for it, do not let love pass you by, do not let the one chance that you may have at true happiness escape you because you are afraid, remember that love is an investment just like everything else, nothing ventured, nothing gained!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Many may ask this question &amp; each individual has their own perspective of it!<br><br>Love is a free flowing energy that is housed in the Universe; love is available for any strong-hearted individual who has the intestinal fortitude to take a dive into its never-ending pool! Those who take the plunge either swim to victory or sink to the bottom like the titanic going down for the second time around!<br><br>The problem with most people is pretty basic, they claim to want and desire love, but very few rarely know exactly what that means or how to obtain it, and those who do acquire it, often fear loosing it so much that they strangle the life right out of their relationship.<br><br>The definition of love is different for everyone; no two people on the planet will ever share the same definition or point of view when it comes to love, why you may ask? The main reason is that as human beings we attach our own feelings to the energy, which is love, thus defining and personalizing the definition to suit our own needs, and no two people share the exact same feeling or emotion, our feelings and emotions are unique unto our own incarnation and the manner in which we deal with our lovers will determine the lessons in love that we have to learn the next time around!<br><br>The interesting thing that I have found in dealing with my clients over the years is the choices that are made when choosing a partner, I would say that 80% of the individuals who have contacted me in reference to another person meddling or interfering in their relationship has played a role in putting that person in between them and the one that they love, maybe not directly, but indirectly yes, by choosing a partner who is emotionally unavailable or otherwise attached to someone else, which is the exact way that most love triangles are formed to begin with.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

You can probably start by asking yourself some pretty honest and clear questions &amp; answer them most truthfully.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">1: Am I attracted to this individual because he or she happens to be emotionally unavailable and cannot commit to a relationship with me 100%?<br><br>2: Is it the person that I love or the chase?<br><br>3: If the other individual werenÂ’t involved would I still want him or her on the same level?<br><br>4: Do I feel love in my heart or is it simply lust in my loins?<br><br>5: If this individual commits to me, am I ready to reciprocate the commitment?<br><br>6: Am I motivated by need or greed?<br><br>7: My mate was already committed to someone else prior to our involvement, did I pursue him or her or did he/she pursue me? </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">If you knowingly go after someone who is already involved in a relationship you may be setting yourself up for a life filled with misery, everybody handles love and their commitments differently and what may seem like a disaster waiting to happen to you may seem like heaven to them and in most cases the difficulties that arise from your actions will cancel out the few stolen moments of pleasure that you may experience while in their company, it is far better to be patient and allow the relationship to end of its own accord than it is to involve yourself in a situation that you will have little or no control over.<br><br>Love triangles are often formed without the consent of all parties involved and if this is the case where you are concerned and if your mate was deceptive then you have every right to defend your honor and your feelings, if you committed yourself in good faith without prior knowledge of your mate's involvement with another, it is your mate who will rack up the negative karma, however once you have knowledge of the deceptiveness you must handle yourself accordingly to insure that you will free yourself from any karmic responsibility or repercussions!<br><br>If  I can be of assistance to you in any way please do not hesitate to contact me.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
