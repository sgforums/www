It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"?

He had an older sister named Marta and the other destined for fame: Maria, owner of the Castle of Magdalon, and this is why she was known as Maria Magdalena, which counts in the story of Jesus that he was the freind of her family and he liked to go there to visit her. The Gospel assures us that Lazaro became ill and died, but on the fourth day Jesus revived him.<br><br>Lazaro had to leave the country and arrived in France, where he was the Bishop of Marseilles, under the the emperor Domiciano. Then the was made prisoner and executed, and this time he died definitely. He is presented wrapped in banages, as was the custom to do with corpses of the Jews, this being the explanation for the interpretation that is associated with the image of the San Lazaro that is adored by the Cubans, which is the religious syncretism with the African deities, he is known as Babalú Ayé.</span><br><br><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif"><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif" alt="image" width="288" height="70"></a><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~</span> <span style="color: red;">San Lázaro: "The Miracle Worker"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/lazaro.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>" San Lázaro: "The Miracle Worker " Mojo Kit is Conjured &amp; Blessed by Mambo High Priestess &amp; High Priest Oceanos for immediate use.

It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"? Its many "Uses" &amp; "Effacies".</span><br><br>A mixture of Magickal herbs, talismans, roots, powders &amp; stones in a muslin, flannel,felt or chamois bag that should be carried with you at all times to get a specific desired effect. That is a Mojo Bag.<br><br>Also known as an "Ouanga" ,"Conjure" , "Gris Gris" or "Medicine" bag ,regardless of the area in which the name was derived or the culture you may be familiar with ,they are all used for the same basic thing &amp; prescribe to the same basic principle; To attract to or dispel from the wearer, certain influences. Thus they can be made for just about any purpose under the sun. They imply faith and serve as a link beween that in which you believe and that which you desire.<br><br>Mojo Bags are usually worn around the neck or pinned inside the undergarments so that they are in touch with your skin. However ,in a pocket or bag is also fine in any case.</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Black Alligator Paw"? Its many "Uses" &amp; "Effacies".</span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/alligatorfeet.gif" alt="image"><br><br>Alligator Paw are regularly used in the South to increase gambling luck. Like the ever-popular rabbit foot, also considered lucky for gamblers, the Alligator Paw may worn as a key chain charm or carried in a mojo bag along with such natural curios as rattlesnake rattles, badger teeth, bat hearts, nutmegs, buckeye nuts, Lucky Hand roots, five-finger grass, John the Conqueror roots, and lodestones dressed with magnetic sand.<br><br>The use of alligator paw as gamblers' lucky charms seems to be an American notion, for alligators are indigenous to the Americas. I can find no discernible precedent for the custom in African, European, or Asian folklore, although the "clutching hand" effect of these feet resembles on a larger scale the appearance of the Lucky Hand root, a distinctively African-American gambler's charm.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~</span> <span style="color: darkblue;">"Special MOJO Bags"</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">"LUCKY BLACK ALLIGATOR MOJO"<br><br><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/blackalligatormojo.jpg"><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/blackalligatormojo.jpg" alt="image" width="288" height="216"></a><br><br>Carry Lucky Black Alligator Mojo Bag with you.

              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong>&gt;&gt;*&lt;&lt; AUTHENTIC LUCKY RABBIT FOOT &gt;&gt;*&lt;&lt;</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>The belief that a rabbit's foot is lucky seems to have become a commonplace of American popular culture, but at one time in the past this belief was considered a Southern superstition, specifically one of strictly African-American origin. And from what i have read in older books on folklore, in earlier decades, it was only the left hind foot of the rabbit that was considered lucky and the bearer had to rub it to activate the luck. In addition, some people back then believed that the rabbit's foot was a source of protective magic in addition to bringing good fortune.<br><br>Images of the lucky rabbit foot were most common in the era before World War Two. The foot charm depicted on a "Good Luck" postcard of the 1910s (tied with a red ribbon, much as raccoon penis bone charms are tied), and on several North American Good Luck Coins of the 1930s.<br><br>As for the foot itself, a circa-1940 mail order catalogue from the Standard O and B Supply Company, a Chicago-based distributor of African-American hoodoo material, offered undyed rabbit foot charms "made with a metal band and a link to attach on chain." The Johnson-Smith Novelty Company offered identical charms in its 1941 catalogue.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/bwrabbitfoot.gif" alt="image"><br><br>The advertisement shown here goes these one better and promises a free vial of Van Van oil with each rabbit's foot; the formula is a Louisiana hoodoo favourite that "clears away that evil mess" and increases the strength of any good luck charm to which it is applied. Since none of the older catalogues or ads mention any colour when describing rabbit's foot charms, it can be assumed that the items were undyed and came only in natural tan or white.<br><br>Symbolic representations of the rabbit foot have become rare now, possibly due to the contemporary interest in "animal rights." But while Johnson-Smith no longer offers rabbit foot key chain charms for sale, traditional rabbit foot charms, both dyed and undyed, are still manufactured and remain part of the hoodoo stock in trade. Contemporary conjure bags in my collection that contain rabbit foot charms include a "Fast Luck" bag and a "Wishing Bag." The rabbit feet in these bags are natural in colour and not dyed.<br><br>Why is the rabbit foot lucky? Rabbits are swift and they reproduce prolifically, but the luck of the rabbit foot is monetary and sexual; as far as i know, it is not related to swiftness or fertility. There is considerable evidence that the lucky rabbit foot is a remnant of an African clan totem, an importation related somehow to Br'er Rabbit, the famous protagonist of an African trickster-god myth-cycle.</strong></span></p>
