            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: violet;">Mystical Month of  March<br><br>'Noble brothers and sisters,<br>be joyful and keep the Faith<br>and persevere in the little things<br>you have heard and learnt together with me.'<br><br>David (1 March)<br><br>'Mars', the Roman 'God of War', and fertility was the inspiration for the name 'March'. As part of the seasonal calendar March is the time of the 'Storm Moon' according to Pagan beliefs and the period described as the 'Moon of the Snow-blind' by Black Elk (Black Elk Speaks, Neihardt). It has also been known as:<br><br>'Lent-maand' (The time of lent)<br>Old Dutch<br>'Hreth-monath' (Rough month)<br>'Length-monath' (Lengthening month)<br>'Llyd-monath' (Boisterous month)<br>Old Saxon<br><br>March is the second month of 'Imbolc' and a time in the Celtic church when it was believed that all the saint would redress the forces of darkness with the aim of driving out all negative energies and evil demons. The time of prayer is seen also within the Christian church with the advent of 'Lent' and 'Easter', which celebrates the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. The fast from 'Ash Wednesday' to 'Easter Sunday' (usually end of March/early April) runs through the majority of this month hence this period became referred to as 'Lencten-faesten' or 'Lent'. 'Lencten monath' was the name given by the Saxons to this month as day-by-day the length of the day increased which was said to be keenly felt during this time of fasting.<br><br>The lorica of Patrick<br>(17 March)<br><br>'For my shield this day, I call<br>Heaven's might,<br>Sun's brightness,<br>Moon's whiteness,<br>Fire's glory,<br>Lightning's swiftness,<br>Wind's wildness,<br>Ocean's depth,<br>Earth's solidity,<br>Rock's immobility.'<br><br>In the seasonal calendar the herbs parsley and basil  were important believed to keep away the dangers of starvation. As a result the development of plant folklore was prevalent during this time, as was the need to toil the land and sow for an early harvest. The earth goddess and her support of Bel became vital to ensure the fertility of the land brought forth the needed foods, and provided luscious pasture for the animals that had been kept over the winter months. March is a time of spirituality, and the influence of the feminine aspects within nature within all faiths. At the same time Aries in the astrological calendar brings the power of the masculine, the sun, the seed, and also the determination and strength to succeed which is further reflected in the symbolism of Mark, of the gospels, preaching and glyph of the lion. The ram (Aries), and the fish (Pisces) are, like in February, important in the role and function of animal folklore at this time.<br><br>'Feel the shift of balance,<br>from darkness to light growing stronger.'<br>'Welcome Spring! Now is the time for banishing Winter.'</span><br><br><img src="http://stencilwithstyle.com/LL%20340%20Celtic%20knot.gif"><br><img src="http://www-ang.kfunigraz.ac.at/~katzer/pictures/petr_02.jpg"><br>Parsley<br><img src="http://www.earthlygoods.com/large_herb_jpgs/basil.2.jpg"><br>Basil</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: violet;">As part of the astrological calendar, March has many associations. This is the month of the house of Pisces (20 February - March 20) and the house of Aries (21 March - April 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>Pisces is the twelfth sign of the zodiac, symbolised by the 'Fish' and the Roman 'God Neptune', also known as 'The Mystic'. The 'Age of Pisces' witnessed the birth of Christ and the glyph more often associated with the Christian religion was, for the first five to six hundred years, the fish. This period is generally taken to have started before the birth of Christ, approximately 200 BC. The duration of the Age of Pisces has been calculated to be one-twelfth of 25,725 years, working out to 2,143. The figure most usually referred to though for calculating the length of the Equinox is 2,160 years. The Age of Aquarius which follows Pisces in the precession of the Equinoxes is generally thought to start at the beginning for the new millennium, around 2000 AD. There is dispute over he exact date of the dawn of the New Age. We can be sure that before Pisces was the Age of Aries, and before this the Age of Taurus, thought to be around 4000 - 2000 BC. The progress of the Ages follows the opposite path to the one most associate with the annual path of the zodiac. Within each period it is also clear that the symbol of the house has held much influence and importance, for example in ancient Egyptian mythology, the God Apis was highly revered during the Age of Taurus, with many cult groups taking the glyph of the bull to symbolise belief, obedience and respect.<br><br>The influence of Neptune is clear in the house of Pisces possessing the qualities of spiritual development, romance, lyricism, dreaminess, caring, perception and intuition. 'Jupiter' is the ruling planet of Pisces bringing with it a belief in the highest most positive powers of the universe. As the last house before Aries, Pisces strives to find peace before death with the cosmos, which must be achieved in order to move on, hence the extraordinary evolution that can occur as the month progresses. It is seen to represent the last stage of life and the ability to approach imminent change with ease, as of course Pisces represents the ability to progress from the material to the spiritual world. Pisces is a mutable and negative water sign associated with the statement 'I am in harmony, in unison with the mysteries of the universe'. It rules the feet. Pisces is associated with Angelica, Iris, Orchids, Violets and Water Lilies, as well as Mosses, Ferns, and Seaweed  Pisces is further associated with any tree that grows close to the water's edge, including the Weeping Willow and also the Alder, Ash, Dogwood and Fig Colours associated with Pisces are silver, sea greens, mauve, purple and violet. The main stone associated with Pisces is the Amethyst, whilst the main stone associated with the month of February is the AquamarineLucky number is seven, lucky day Thursday . Metals associated are germanium and strontium.<br><br><img src="http://www.semsk.kz/entert/vallejo/images/1987/pisces.jpg"><br><br></span></div>

The Aries is a force to be reckoned with as 'Mars' the ruling planet of Aries brings with it Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and represents the beginning of the journey that the sun will follow through the zodiac. symbolised by the 'Ram' and the ancient Greek 'God Ares', the 'War God' of the Iliad, son of 'Zeus' and 'Hera', who is the equivalent of the Roman 'God Mars'. The vernal equinox, the start of spring begins on March 21 the same day as we enter the house of Aries. The horns, and the centre between the eyebrows and the nose of the ram are also used as signs for Aries, as the power force has long been associated with the head, the source of the Aries drive. Naturally then the Aries should possess a strong sense of intuition. In ancient Assyrian mythology Aries meant 'Prince', and the ancient Egyptians connected Aries with the 'God Amun', also 'Amon-Ra', the 'Sun God' revered as the leader of the universe and the creator.<br><br>The influence of 'Mars' is clear as Aries possesses the qualities of the pioneer, the leader, primal passion, initiative, creativity, courage and self-will. On the negative side Aries can appear to be brusque, impulsive, impatient an extremely powerful force that can at times be unstable. As the first sign Aries is full of energy like the child who is curious, and is likened to the first stage of life. Aries is a cardinal and positive fire sign associated with the statements 'I am' or 'I am first' or 'I will be first' (needless to say that this assertiveness can be mistaken for arrogance). Aries is associated with the Poppy, Honeysuckle, Bryony, Thistles and Ferns, Peppermint and the Anemone Aries is further associated with the Alder, Blackthorn, Dogwood, Hawthorn, Pomegranate, Spruce and Weeping Willow . Colours associated with Aries are scarlet, all shades of red, carmine The main stone associated with Aries is the Diamond, whilst the main stone associated with the month of March is the Bloodstone Lucky number is nine, lucky day Tuesday Metal associated is iron.<br><br>'At last from Aries rolls the bounteous sun.' </span><br><br><img src="http://www.semsk.kz/entert/vallejo/images/1987/aries.jpg"></div>

Some suggest that David did not actually exist but provided the church, the Catholic church with a vehicle for control of the Celts. He is the patron saint of Wales (UK) and believed to have been born during a violent storm at Menevia which can be found in Pembrokeshire, Wales. Associated with Paul Aurelian (12 March), he spent many years also at Tregaron. He established a stern manner of conduct and a frugal table with his monks. It is said the emblem of Wales, the leek, was inspired by David and the monks, as the main staple of their diet was the wild leek. Carantoc (16 May) was believed to be his uncle, and Weena (18 October) his aunt. David travelled with Teilo (9 February) and Padarn (15 April) on his travels to Jerusalem. Died 588. (See also February 13). Associated with Ismael (16 June), Finbar (25 September), Dyfrig (14 November).<br><br>'First comes David, then comes Chad,<br>Then comes Winnol, roaring like mad.'<br><br>Wales (UK) generally : 'St. David's Day' celebrations.<br><br>Lanark, Lanarkshire, Scotland : Traditional 'Whuppity Stoorie' festivities.<br></span></div>

The closure process and contemplation in February has opened the doors now to let in new opportunities. This is a month to harvest the fruits which have been planted before. It is very simple: what you haven given will now be given to you - the ripe fruits are falling down on material level as well as on all other levels.<br><br>The wheel of fortune equals the wheel of destiny, whereby "luck" and "winning" on a deeper level are referring to your skill to take your destiny in your own hands. You are "lucky" when you can accept all different kinds of truths and find in the middle of uncertainty your own truth. You are a "winner" when you can appreciate all different kinds of opinions, suggestions, and inputs and make up your own mind. Listen to what is said or what is shown to you with gratitude, but think and decide on your own. Follow Spirit without hesitation, follow external recommendations only when they are in alignment with your intuition.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

This refers to the weather in this unsettled month - it's the end of Winter in the Northern hemisphere and the end of Summer in the South. The days of March are often blustery followed by mildness whatever part of the world you're in. Thinking about that old saying, I decided the goddess of the month should be connected with lions and that it was about time the Roman god Mars should get a little Public Relations work.<br><br>At some parts of the World, It's also a celebration of mothers this month. At least it is in Great Britain where Mothers' Day falls on 6 March.<br><br>Now, a curious thing, do you have a strange feeling that dragons are in the world psyche at the moment ? Keep an eye out for these fabulous beasts in the coming month, and you won't be surprised when they appear.<br><br>At the other end of the Globe, The seasons are changing too, the birds are starting to migrate and the colours around us are being transformed. If you're about to swing into Spring, enjoy the verdant gifts that the earth offers and if, like me, you are moving towards Autumn, get ready to store the treasures you've gained over this past Summer.
