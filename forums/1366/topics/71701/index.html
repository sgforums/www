They feel that they didn't get enough love, or their parents loved their sibling more, or they just had it tough. Funny how we perceive things when we're a child.<br><br>I have observed that most children whine less about a lot of things than adults. They are usually quite happy with what they have and how they are loved, until someone shows them something different or takes it away.<br><br>Not all people love the same and not all people can love everyone the same way. There are many kinds of love.<br><br>Over the years while walking my spiritual path, I have remembered my childhood and worked through times when I didn't feel so loved. I felt that my Mother was too busy with my siblings and I was the "different" child and my Father, he worked too much and was always tired.<br><br>My parents gave me the love they knew and more, and I appreciate that very much. They took the love they were given and shown as children, grew up and had to recycle some of it to pass onto their children.<br><br>Recycle you say? Yes, often we have to take the love we get and sometimes its not so perfect or pretty or even that clean, so we have to take it, clean it up, remember it all, but toss out the bad parts, take the good parts and put them all together again. We recycle the love and learn to love even better!<br><br>It's like aluminum cans. We buy them, drink what's in them, we crush them and take them to the recycle center. The recycle center takes them and melts them back down and makes all new cans. They come out looking shiny and new for us to use all over again. In this whole process we had to do our part, we had to make an effort to take those used cans, empty and crushed, back to the recycle center to be made new again.<br><br>Love is like that. You may feel used and crushed...you may not feel so new anymore, bogged down with problems and wondering what to do next. Maybe you need a big change in your life and happiness. That all begins right there within you with the resources you already have.<br><br>It's time for you to find what you need in your life and clean it up, toss out the bad parts and take the good parts and put the "new you" all back together again. It's a matter of processing, of accepting that maybe your life has had some rough spots, but without the rough spots, how would we grow?<br><br>The love we have had or been shown up to now, may not have been perfect and we long for better love and a better life.  You CAN have that, I mean, just look where you are right now!! You're reading this and that means changes are occurring in your life, right now!!<br><br>Take the love you have and recycle it. Remember the process can take time. Take that love, that you feel is inadequate and change it into a new love that makes your heart soar and know that you are always loved. You are love and you can share the love you have.<br><br>Recycled love is a love that has seen its worse days but now, starting right now, you can reshape that crushed love, that old love, that used up love and recycle it into a beautiful new love, because you are love. You are a being that loves love and loves to share love. What we share we always get back, in so many ways.<br><br>Recognize that love and light in your life today and get to work recycling!!<br><br>About the Author:  Fran Hafey is a Spiritual Counselor, Healer, Writer and Teacher.

Our society does nothing to promote self-esteem in our children. In fact,  just the opposite occurs. A baby is born knowing that it is the most beautiful, wonderful thing in existence. But as we grow up, we are told: "You're bad." "You aren't as smart as your brother." "Only babies cry." "Go play and leave me alone."  Plus many other things to destroy our self-esteem.One of the most important things we as humans need to learn is self-love. If we do not love ourselves, it is impossible for others to love us or for us to love anyone else. So, we are a society of people who hate themselves and  have no idea how to love anyone. As a result of this, child and spousal abuse is rampant. Murders occur every day.  Love can change all of this.<br><br>We are taught that if we love and care for ourselves that we are being selfish. This couldn't be further from the truth. The more you love yourself, the more love you have to give to others. By caring for yourself, you are then able to care for others. But, how do we learn to love ourselves? Most people have no idea, because they have no role models to follow. Let's begin now to become role models for our children and our children's children. Try the following exercises and learn to love yourself.<br><br>1.) Concentrate on something you love such as a rose, animal or child.After you have generated these strong feelings within yourself, transfer those feelings of love toward yourself. Look at your body, appreciatingeach part of it. Touch it and feel it's texture. Feel yourself inside it.Caress it. Smell it. Speak kindly to it. Practice this daily until you are comfortablewith the exercise.<br><br>2.) Choose a part of your body that you dislike or are ashamed of. Concentrate on that body part and direct love into it. You can try talking to it kindly and stroking it. If there is pain in your body, give it extra love. Then send love to your whole body. Try using the colors of green, rose, gold and white, filling your body with the colors.<br><br>3.) Sit in front of a mirror, look into your eyes and love yourself. Do not allow yourself to make any judgments about the things you feel are wrong with yourself. If you find yourself doing this,  immediately change the judgment to a loving thought. Speak kindly to yourself. Look deeply into your eyes and see the spirit there. Notice how beautiful your eyes are. Notice the positive aspects of your features.<br><br>4.) Stand before a full-length mirror nude. Love and accept every part of your body. Touch your body and love it. When negative self-judgments arise, speak them out loud and feel your emotional response to them. Replace the negative judgment with a positive statement about that part of yourbody.  Fill this body part with unconditional love. Cover your entire body in this way.Some of these exercises will not be easy, but they will be well worth any<br>embarrassment your suffer starting them.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

I have wonderful relationships with them. Years ago, when I was going through a divorce, my ex-husband got very nasty and lost sight of love and he took my daughters away. They were 2 1/2 and 5. The circumstances that led to this horrible act were neither right nor wrong, but it still happened.<br><br>My heart was almost broken. I hurt horribly to have two people that were a part of my heart, soul and body, ripped from me the way they were, in the middle of the night. I suffered and cried for many years. My spirit ached.<br><br>A year or so after they were gone I met a wonderful man, fell in love and had a son. This helped ease my pain. I love them dearly, but I still felt the empty spot in my heart. I was not able to Mother my daughters the way I wanted, but I was blessed to spend time with them. Their Father was always filled with such hatred and pain. I still loved him as a person, although I did not love his acts of hate.<br><br>I was an adult, and I acted with love for my daughters. I worked hard to change and be a better person. But, deep down inside, I hurt because I knew I had done nothing wrong, but to be human. I made mistakes too.<br><br>I feel I let my daughters go in a sense, so that they would have a better life, instead of watching the fighting and hate going on all around them. I let them go, so that I could grow and be a better person too. They were never very far, they were always in my heart.<br><br>It took time for me to forgive myself and to let go of that pain. I had to learn to love again in many ways, but I let go of hate and sorrow so my daughters could feel my love I had so deeply for them.<br><br>Today, as I grow Spiritually, I sometimes wish I had known then, what I know now, but I also have learned that all things happen for a reason. I would not change one thing in my past. I know that pain and letting go have made me who I am today.<br><br>I have now chosen to look at those painful memories differently. I have let go of the hurt and the sadness and the "what ifs" and I am blessed to have healthy, wonderful relationships with my children.<br><br>I learned a lot in those years and now share with others how to have their own personal power, to get it and keep it. Others can do hurtful things to us, but we don't have to accept them, we can fight back with love and we can let go of so much of what hurts us. We can love ourselves enough to know we do not deserve to be treated badly. We can stand up for our rights and our beliefs, without harming others.<br><br>Sometimes we have to let go of those we love in order to learn and move on. Whether it's letting go of a love one through death or separation, letting the other person in our relationship grow or perhaps just for a short time, when we are not able to be together for different circumstances.<br><br>I know I am here right now, typing this story, because I chose to let go of the pain in my life. I have learned unconditionally, there is a time for everything, there is a reason for all things and I choose to let go of the pain and live life fully.<br><br>Sent with love and light,<br><br>Mysti~</span></strong></div>

My attitude toward every day life can make a big difference in whether I see something as a blessing or a hindrance.<br><br>Many people will sit and worry. By worrying they are not helping matters, where in fact they may be making things worse.<br><br>I choose not to worry, but to use my energy for bigger and better things.<br><br>A few of my friends may say other wise, because yes, I do have things on my mind and I will discuss them, but I don't let them take control. Bringing them out into the open always clears the path and helps us turn things around for the highest good and to move forward.<br><br>My family and I recently had what we thought was a problem on our property. We began to see water in our basement. We checked things out to make sure we had no broken pipes or problems within the house and plumbing fixtures.<br><br>We had noticed during the summer, even when the news was saying we were in the middle of a drought, we had a small "hole" in the ground beside our driveway that was filling with water. When we bought our home, we knew there was an artesian well or spring somewhere on it.<br><br>Well, we found it.<br><br>With the water coming in the basement, my husband began to worry. He worried about the foundation, which I can see that is a concern. I discussed it with him and gave my input and left it at that.<br><br>What was my choice?<br><br>I chose to see that spring as a blessing!<br><br>Yes it was causing us some discomfort at the moment, with extra water around our driveway and mud, but I chose to educate myself and found that having a spring on the property is truly a blessing.<br><br>It's fresh spring water that we will have for a very long time, perhaps forever. The water can be used to irrigate our garden and have drinking water for all the wonderful wildlife in the woods where we live. We can make it into a pond, a fountain, or a creek and enjoy it year round. There are many possibilities.<br><br>I choose to see it as a blessing, not a burden and I know all will work out fine. Why, because I choose to believe it. You can too.<br><br>By learning to choose our thoughts and the words we say, we reap good things when we speak positively. We have choices. Learning to let things go, is a beginning.<br><br>I can do something about this situation. It will take hard work and time. Those are both things I have and can do.<br><br>I also choose not to worry about it, but to take action.<br><br>How do you see the "so called" problems in your life today? As a burden or a blessings?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span></strong></div>

There were other trees not very far away, just along the forests edge. The little tree grew straight and each year the farmer would trim its branches back, along with all the other trees and tell them how beautiful they were.<br><br>One year the farmer who had grown old, went away, and the trees were not visited as much and they didn't have their branches trimmed. This made them sad, but they were very proud to still be on the hillside.<br><br>One day they noticed a new family had moved into the house down in the valley that they overlooked.<br><br>The little tree saw a little girl with her dog running and playing in the yard in the summer breeze.  The little girl and her dog ran up the hill to the very top and they looked down. The little girl said "oh my what a beautiful view of the valley." Excited she turned and noticed the little tree standing there alone and said<br><br>"I will trim your branches and make you beautiful again."<br><br>This made the little tree very happy.<br><br>When the cool north winds came, the little girl didn't come to visit as much, but a man did. He walked up the hillside and looked down into the valley. He looked at the trees and said.<br><br>"I will cut these trees down, they block my view of the sun and they would make good firewood."  The little tree shook with fear and was once again, very sad. He loved looking down into the valley and he missed the little girl and her dog.<br><br>The man returned with an ax in his hand. But the little girl was chasing behind him.<br><br>"Please daddy" she cried. "Please don't cut down my tree!"<br><br>The man turned and saw his little girl crying and he said, "but the tree blocks my view and it just stands here all alone and it's not even a very big tree at all." Just then it started to snow, so the man said he would come back tomorrow. He picked up the little girl and headed down the hillside.<br><br>That night, Christmas Eve night, as the little girl and her dog slept, the man sat by the fire. He watched the flames pop and dance as he was mesmerized and taken back in time, when he was a boy.<br><br>He too had loved the trees and loved the holiday snow. He remembered back, many years gone by, the trees and how beautiful they were. His father had taught him to love all living things and to cherish them.<br><br>When his father died and then later also his wife, he was left alone with his little girl.  He had somehow lost that love he had for nature and the beauty of all things. He lost many things, and with this memory he shed a tear. He sat by the fire for a long time that night.<br><br>The next morning the little girl awoke to a quiet empty house. There was no tree, no decorations, no candy canes or doggy treats waiting for her and her dog.<br><br>The little girl felt very sad.<br><br>Just then she heard a sound outside and she ran to look out the window. She could hardly believe her eyes, when she gazed up on the hillside and she saw all the sparkling lights and decorations all glowing upon those trees and there was her father waving to her, with a big smile on his face. Something she hadn't seen for a very long time.<br><br>She grabbed her boots and coat and headed for the door.<br><br>She ran up the hill with her dog in tow, her cheeks glowing rosy red. Her father raised her high in his arms and lifted her to place a star on the little tree, there on the hillside.<br><br>The little tree was shaking, but this time, not from fear, but with joy and happiness!<br><br>Some say they heard a voice on the wind whistling through the forest that Christmas morning. It was the voice of love.<br><br>The father vowed to never forget, ever again, the love that he had once held in his heart. He would hold it close, but live his life for the family he had, now. He promised to do his part, to love all living things and to always take care of the little tree on the hillside.<br><br>Sending you love, grace and peace,<br><br>~Mystiblu </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

I love to watch it gently fall to the earth and see how it makes everything look bright and new. I become like a child again when I see it, bundling up to run out and feel its magical touch. It seems I hardly even notice the cold when I am out in it.<br><br>It brings back memories from my childhood and those days we didn't have school because of the snow that fell the night before while we were sleeping.<br><br>I like to walk through the woods quietly, and meditate as the snow falls, talking to Spirit, conversing and sharing. I see it fresh and untouched. I see the patterns it makes on everything, the bushes, trees and ground. As I walk, I see the footprints I have left behind and it reminds me of life and the paths we choose. I had to take my first steps, to forge my own path, once I was awakened from my slumber and able to understand more of life in a Spiritual manner.<br><br>Sometimes the snow on my path has been deeper in some areas than others. There have even been some pretty bad storms and icy spots that took more time to get through. Clumsily slipping and sliding my way through, but always landing in just the right place, at the right time.<br><br>We make those first footprints in the snow and others may choose to follow. We may start off alone and then move to another path, to follow others, to learn. We may see other footprints and we know we're not alone, but in time we may feel a strong pull or need, to be the ones to make our own path. We will branch off, make those first steps in the fresh, new, untouched snow, and we will find our inner peace, our true selves. Some will follow, some will not, but as long as we are happy with our own path, that's what's important.<br><br>Our ideas and beliefs may change from time to time on this journey, but we stay true to ourselves. Each day is an exciting adventure in life and to seek out the unknown, mysterious and mystical. Oh, how wonderful it is to start each day as new!<br><br>I look out the window at the snow that fell while I was sleeping and I wonder what great paths I can make out in it this day! Grabbing my coat and hat...running out the door and heading for the woods and stream. I almost hate to disturb its beauty with each sparkle of ice. I know I am not afraid. I have faith and I surrender all my fears to Spirit, even as I walk in the snow, not really knowing what lies under it.<br><br>I take each step cautiously, but with joy in knowing,<br><br>I am on my way to a new and wonderful life.<br><br>Won't you come out in the snow with me today and make a new and beautiful path? Let's Go!!</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I calmly looked at them and said, "Well, you planted the seeds in my mind and Spirit, and now I am just trying to work through it and understand it. YOU, put the idea there, so the seeds were planted."<br><br>They agreed, that yes, many times someone will plant a seed by saying something or by their actions and we in turn react. That's how the seeds grow. From the energy we give to them. Whether it is positive or negative.<br><br>As I reflect on many things in my life, I know in my heart and soul, that I am planting seeds of love, hope, peace and light. I try very hard not to judge others and to make a difference by sowing seeds of positive energy.<br><br>What seeds do you want to sow, for your children, your grandchildren and for the world?<br><br>Do you think it matters?<br><br>Do you think the legacy we work on now to leave behind, will be a garden of weeds or one of peace and love?<br><br>I feel that our lives touch more than we think. Just imagine how harmony would grow if you plant those seeds and nurture them. Feeding, watering and giving them what they need to grow. Grow them to help make this world a more beautiful place. We can't sit back and wait for others to do it. We have to be responsible by doing our part in making the world a better place for all living things, now!<br><br>Look at some of those seeds that have been planted. If we choose not to feed those negative thoughts and ideas, then in time, they will die out. I choose to be different, to be me, to stand out and not go along with the crowd. I choose to find beauty in all things, and to go deep inside myself to bring out the good.<br><br>We all know, that some of the things our world needs to prosper and to be healthy, are some of the very same things we need. Such as:<br><br>Water<br><br>Air<br><br>Food<br><br>Love, and yes, light.<br><br>Let us be a light to the world. To a world that needs harmony. I choose light. With the September 11th tragedy, many have joined together to observe times of sharing and healing. We experienced a "Peace, love and Balance Meditation day" all over the world.<br><br>I hope you had a chance to lift your Spirit to the Universe in harmony with millions of others and proclaim peace everywhere.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

She would ask her Mother and Father, her Grandparents and her teachers too. She asked why so much, that they finally told her to go out into the forest and find her answer there, knowing that this child was special and the woodland creatures had always adored her, since the day of her birth. She would be safe amid the wonderful things in the forest, so her family was not worried.<br><br>First, she came upon an old turtle and she asked him "Mr. Turtle, why is the moon blue sometimes?"  The turtle replied "my young child, the moon is blue sometimes to heal himself from all the tears he sheds for the sad children all around the world. The color blue is the healing color of the whole Universe." With this the little girl thanked him and skipped on her way.<br><br>She soon came upon a wise old owl, and she asked him "Wise old owl, what is a Universe?" and the wise old owl replied "ahhhh, well, a Universe is all that you see and that, that you cannot see." Puzzled, the little girl asked the owl "but what is it I am not able to see?" The old owl just feel asleep, since it was daytime, and the little girl walked on.<br><br>While walking through the beautiful wildflowers, the little girl looked up and noticed a huge oak tree. It was so tall and big around, she just knew the old oak would have a good answer for her. So she asked, "please Oak, you're so tall and you can touch the sky. Tell me, why is the sky so high?" The old oak looked down at the child and slowly began to speak. "The sky my dear is so high because it's to remind us that we can always reach higher to find our way if we ever get lost. During the day, we see clouds, and they tell us which way the wind is blowing. At night, the stars, they help us to find our way, because of the pictures they hold within them."<br><br>The little girl sat and thought about the oaks reply. The grass all around was nice and soft and she decided to take a nap beneath its branches. As she slept, she saw the clouds and the moon, the stars and the oak, so many wonderful things to remember. She felt as if she had known these things for a very long time. That was the reason she felt so safe being in the forest.<br><br>A magical bird landed onto the large oak and saw the little girl sleeping. The sun would be going down soon and the stars would begin to shine.<br><br>The bird flew to tell the little girls parents where she lay. They came and carried her back to their home.<br><br>The little girl had a smile on her face, so they knew she must have found some answers to her question of  "why." They tucked her in bed, with the moon on her face, knowing another adventure of why<br>would start tomorrow.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

We could hardly believe it had been a few weeks since we witnessed the miracle of their births. Helping to bring puppies into the world is definitely an experience.<br><br>The puppies were Samoyeds. Those fluffy white, big, loveable dogs that sometimes pull sleds out in the Arctic. I fell in love with them years before, adopting our first from a nice home that raised and showed them. Lily was a bit of an outcast because she was too large to show and too old to breed. We loved her and she was a part of our family, just like our little sheltie/border collie, named Dutchess. We had had Dutchess from a pup and she had been with me, through thick and thin, even outlasting a marriage.<br><br>I have had cats and dogs, birds and fish, rabbits and maybe even a few other odd pets. I have always loved animals and felt the compassion and unconditional love they have to share. I even love cows and had one that was my own; they have the sweetest eyes.<br><br>I have had my heart broken when some animals I loved have passed on or when my Mother would take my cat away, because she was a female and back then, it was not a cheap thing to do to have pets spayed and neutered. I have cried many tears over animals, and odd how I cry more for them than many humans.<br><br>Humans have the capacity to think and put thought into action. They have common sense, or most of them do, they can speak, ask for help and do so much more than animals, for themselves. For most animals they have to rely on their eyes and subtle Â“animalÂ” messages to get their point across. They need humans to intercede for them.<br><br>One day, I realized how many animals there were in the world,  just a fraction and how hard it was for us to even place our puppies in the right homes with good people. I then had all my dogs spayed and neutered so we would not help add to the population.<br><br>I have always been the type person to feel the hair go up on the back of my neck when I have seen an animal mistreated. I would get angry and say what was on my mind. I would then cry for the animal. I am one that stands my ground and will stand up for what I believe in, as some of you know.<br><br>We have over the years, taken in many unwanted animals. I started taking in dogs, cats and birds. The birds just kept coming and we at one time had one hundred birds. I had also added to them by buying some and having pairs to breed. I do breed the rare breeds and hand feed the babies, selling them to help feed our gang. I just love the love they give back to me, and you should hear the conversations in our home, between the birds, hehe. We have to behave ourselves and watch our tempers and what we say, because they will always, like children, pick up what they shouldnÂ’t and repeat it.<br><br>I feel good, in my heart, that over the years we have been responsible pet owners. We are not ones to get rid of a pet because its not cute or little anymore or noisy or makes messes. We have raised them with love and have been here now for the older ones to pass on. We love them and stay with them to the end.<br><br>We recently, actually today, had one of our older dogs pass on, she had been sick for a while. We know she is in a better place with our other dogs and pets that have passed and that she is no longer in pain and can now run with the wind once more over the rainbow bridge.<br><br>If you love animals, please remember to have them spayed or neutered. Consider adopting a nice pet from the SPCA or a shelter near you. Help other people spay and neuter also, that canÂ’t afford it. Offer to take the animal for them to the vet. ItÂ’s a small thing to do to help the animals all over the world that are not love or wanted.<br><br>Remember the pets around you today! Give them a hug and say thank you for all the joy and love they have shared with you in your life. I would truly not like to see a world without animals and I do my part to help the wild and the domestic. WonÂ’t you??<br><br>Thank you~*<br><br>Love, light and peace,<br><br>Mysti</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

A conversation may be going well, people are polite and enjoying themselves and then, a new person may join in, and the energy around them changes. You can feel and see the change.<br><br>Occasionally, people just rub each other the wrong way. They are like Yin and Yang. They don't like being in the same room. They feel uncomfortable. One may leave the conversation and the energy returns back to normal.<br><br>That doesn't always mean, that one or the other is negative or bad. Every ones energy vibration is different. Your energy may be fine, then you may cross paths with someone whose energy level is vibrating at a level that is good for them, but it clashes with yours.<br><br>It's like singing. Your voice may be fine when you sing alone. You're on key and sound pretty darn good. Another person may be the same. Then, when the two of you try to sing a duet, it may sound like one of you is off key. It just sounds horrible! One is not better than the other, just that they're different and that's ok.<br><br>Another time you will meet those people that's energy is almost at the same level as yours and you will feel how well you get along and when you sing, it sounds like angel voices.<br><br>Our vibrations change as we become more evolved.<br><br>We may learn many good things and seek wisdom,<br><br>but knowledge and wisdom, are not the same thing. Knowledge is something we may learn from books, in a classroom or from the Internet. Wisdom is something we acquire from learning as we live, from actions and experience. It's from this wisdom, that we realize that we are all different. We learn to accept others for who they are and not just their outside exteriors.<br><br>As individuals, we each have our own vibrations, our own beliefs and our own voice, and that's ok.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Today I Missed a Friend~ My Tribute to My Meeko<br>By Fran Hafey/ Mysti</span><br><br><img src="http://www.jkcc.com/evje/pictures/arcticfox2.jpg"><br><br>Today we had our first few snowflakes, not much at all really, but seeing those pretty white flakes took me back to a time when I was much happier. Just for this moment, I will grieve once more and remember the happy days we shared together and then the healing will come.<br><br>I missed a friend today, when I watched the snowflakes fall and went back to a time when I was putting on my boots, hat, gloves and coat and running outside to enjoy and to feel the first magical snowfall.<br><br>I always had my best friend by my side, she was also happy to see the snow. She would follow me as I walked down the snowy white path to the creek, running a head sometimes but always making sure I wasn't too far behind.<br><br>Sometimes I had to look a bit close to see her, since her white fur blended well with the snowy landscape and her black nose covered with snow. Not a coincidence that her name is Meeko, little white fox.<br><br>I sat down on a log by the creek, watching the fluttering<br><br>snowflakes fall in a beautiful pattern, making everything look sparkly and new. She runs to me and looks in my eyes as if to say, "ok, you're here resting and talking to Spirit/God, so can I run and play and explore?" I pet her head and she instinctively knows its ok.<br><br>We always had this special bond, from the moment she was born it seems. She has always been my little guardian angel.<br><br>I can go back even farther to the day her Mother, Keesha, gave birth to her and her siblings in our bedroom on a few blankets. It was her first and only litter of pups and she was frightened, so I stayed with her. One pup didn't make it, even though I rubbed and rubbed its little body with a towel to get its blood flowing.<br><br>There were five healthy pups. We later had an unfortunate accident and another one of our mother dogs killed two of Keesha's babies, leaving two males and one female. Since I had planned on keeping a girl, well, Meeko was the one.<br><br>As soon as she was weaned, I practically took her from her Mother and made her like my own child. My kids were at ages where they didn't seem to need me as much, so Meeko was my baby. We were inseparable. Even my kids got jealous of how we were so bonded. They loved her too, but she seemed to have something they didn't have. No matter what I did wrong, how I looked, smelt or acted, she loved me unconditionally. She was always there when I cried, was upset or having a bad day. She cheered me up and made me laugh, she was so much joy for me.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I love my children and my grandchildren too, I am a young Nana, but Meeko was like someone I knew from a past life, and she felt like she has been my Mother or a loving aunt. We truly had a heart and soul connection.<br><br>Meeko was a little smaller than most Samoyeds and when she ran she looked like a little white fox, so hence her full name, but it was her spirit and bubbliness that everyone loved so much.<br><br>Meeko, my little white fox, was taken too soon from us at the age of seven, when she was hit by a car on November 6th, 2003. A part of me seemed to go with her that day. I know she is always near and that she is happily running through fields of flowers over the rainbow bridge with her Mother and Grandmother. We live in the country and we are still dumbfounded at how or what happened that she went into the road.<br><br>This was my first experience with the death of someone I loved so much that was a big part of my life.<br><br>Some people have their opinions that people shouldn't love<br><br>animals so much, but I know many more that feel the same way I do. Our pets are very important parts of our lives. They bring us joy and teach us unconditional love.<br><br>I'm glad I have other pets to keep me busy and bring me joy, but none have touched my heart like Meeko.<br><br>So on the snowy days, when the snowflakes fall, I know I will see her running and jumping and saying "Come on Mom, let's go for our magical walk, catching snowflakes on our tongues and sit by the waters edge, remembering and being...best friends.<br><br>Meeko will be missed, but she is never out of my mind and my heart.<br><br>Thank you Meeko for all you gave to me in your lifetime.~<br><br>My healing is going well, my little white fox.<br><br>Today, I missed a friend.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
