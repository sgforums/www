Mirror superstitions probably arose from the time when the first humans saw their reflections in a pool of water and once they had got over their initial shock of seeing someone or something, believed that the image was their soul or spirit and to endanger it would mean risking injury to the other self. Also since ancient times, mirrors were said to have magickal powers, including the power to foretell the future and were considered to be tools or devices of the gods. Thus breaking a mirror would end its powers and bring untold miseries and misfortunes upon the one whose reflection it last held.<br><br>As for the seven-year period, the Ancient Romans believed that life renewed itself every seven years. If the person looking into the mirror were of ill health, their image would break the mirror and the run of bad luck would continue for seven years, at the end of which their life would be renewed, ending the curse.<br><br>But if you do not wish seven years of ill-luck, a variety of folk remedies are available to counter the curse of the mirror, including some crazy ones like taking all the pieces and throwing them into running water or pounding the broken mirror into tiny fragments so that no piece can reflect anything ever again or taking the pieces outside &amp; burying them in moonlight. There is also help for those who are too lazy or too busy, just leave the breakage the way it was for seven hours and then clean it up immediately after the hours are up.<br><br>And just in case you need to look at a few more options, here they are,<br>- Throw salt over your shoulder.<br>- Turn around three times counter clockwise immediately after breaking the mirror.<br>- Burn the mirror or at least blacken the pieces in the flames of a fire. The fragments should be buried after a year.<br><br>One of the most effective method i know which is part of Mirror Magick, is you collect all the shards &amp; dust of the broken Mirror, put them in a glass bottle &amp; place the glass bottle on a sunny window sill or anywhere that got sunshine. The Sun rays will annul the adverse effects of the broken mirror, removing bad luck!<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
