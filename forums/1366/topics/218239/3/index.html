Thus, this 3 fire elements generated more speed to the wishes. Hopefully i am right. Even though i may not be very sensitive to energy. I had felt different during the cleansing (felt like the  bad energy surrounding me had been cleared) and the fiery feeling throughout the ritual.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> <span style="font-style: italic;">opps OCEANOS bro had explained, sorry</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  </strong></span></div>
