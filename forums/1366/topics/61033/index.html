Many perceive it to be an enigma that just can't concretely be proved one way or the other. But there is proof of the supernatural all around us. While strolling through the streets of almost any city in United States or Europe, just look up at some of the magnificent architecture and you're bound to spot a gargoyle leering back at you.<br><br>Gargoyles can trace their history back many thousands of years to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Terra cotta waterspouts were formed in the shapes of animals such as lions and birds to serve the physical function of running the rainwater away from the walls and foundations of buildings, and the spiritual function of protecting from evil forces.<br><br>The idea of monsters, dragons, and other creatures of mythical proportions do have a solid foundation in history. Author and researcher Adrienne Mayor theorized that monster legends date back to nomads discovering fossilized dinosaur bones in central Asia several hundred years B.C.E. Imagine stumbling upon the giant bones of a pterodactyl or a protoceratops? You may have no idea that these bones were millions of years old -- just that they clearly belonged to a giant, powerful beast. From these early discoveries and with the help of folklore, griffins, monsters, and dragons may have been born.</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evolution of Gargoyle</span><br><br>As time progressed and the Pagan roots of gargoyles began to fade from history, new meaning and reason for them began to evolve. "Gargoyles were also interpreted to be a sign of damned souls who were forever caught in stone on their way to hell. So they were inhabited by spirits."<br><br>Gargoyles served to teach a mostly illiterate population about messages the Church was trying to convey about the afterlife. By the Middle Ages, gargoyles were being placed on many of the churches and cathedrals being built. Although the names of many of these sculptures of sacred scarecrows may have been lost to history, a lot of their work is still around today. Apparently many of the artists had quite a sense of humor. According to them, Â“Gargoyles were the only place that carvers and sculptors had any artistic license. So the carvers would often put lewd and obscene sort of figures up at the top of these spiritual places -- and they didn't get caught.Â”<br><br>Gargoyles as we know them today may have their roots in Europe, but over the centuries they have spread around the world, and each country has added its touch and culture to these creatures. "As they evolved in America, they've taken on this whole comic sort of tone. They've really lightened up. They're less evil- and scary-looking and in many ways they reflect American culture,"<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gargoyle Statues in perspective of Art </span><br><br>Gargoyles and grotesques are still carved today by a select few craftsmen. Walter S. Arnold is one such sculptor who still makes these fantastic creatures. Some of Arnold's creations appear on the Washington National Cathedral, which is home to some of the most impressive gargoyles in the United States. Arnold commented on what inspires his creations. He said, "When I was working on the Washington Cathedral for five years, we had an old New Yorker cartoon up in the shop. It was a medieval carving shop, and some patron, a bishop or duke, was in there. The carver was working on a gargoyle, and he had empty flasks of wine lying around the floor. The patron was saying, 'Where do you get your inspiration?'<br><br>"Seriously, it comes from a wide range of things -- first of all, from looking at a lot of sculptural forms from all sorts of cultures and times, looking at people and animals. It has always been a form that's allowed for a lot of creativity and innovation. It's one of the things I like about them."<br><br>So is there something spiritual to gargoyles? Arnold said, "In a way, stone is alive. It's a pure, natural material; each piece is different and has its own character and variations in it. I've spent enough time visiting quarries to have a sense of how beautiful the quarries and the mountains are, and if I'm taking stone out of the mountain, I have kind of a responsibility to create something with it that justifies cutting it out of the mountain."<br><br>How about supernatural? "The artist takes it [the artwork] ninety to ninety-five percent of the way, and then every viewer comes to it with their own perspective. In a way, each viewer finishes it differently. So that part of it happens after it leaves my hands, and it will speak differently to each person. I certainly work to make them come alive and look alive, and some of that is technical, some of that is artistic, and some of it is just my feeling on the pieces."<br><br>Gargoyles are a compilation of many different animals, both real and mythical, the artists' inspiration, and our own imaginations. They can be funny, intimidating, and beautiful -- sometimes all in one piece. Gargoyles serve as a "living" reminder of our Pagan roots and our very supernatural world.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </span></strong></div>
