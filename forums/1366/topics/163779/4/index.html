He is also known The Miracle Worker "El Milagrero". Every December 17 the faithful make pilgrimages from the farthest places on the Island to the Santuario de San Lazaro en El Rincon, just outside the capital, to celebrate his day, present offerings, and and complete penitences.<br><br>An old man nearly naked and bearded, dressed in rags and with a pair of crutches, with his legs full of sores and surrounded by dogs, is the image of San Lazaro which is adored by devotees of the Caribbean archipelago of Cuba.<br><br>The legend says that the Lazato whose image is venerated in Cuba was born in a village near Jerusalem, from a wealthy family. He had an older sister named Marta and the other destined for fame: Maria, owner of the Castle of Magdalon, and this is why she was known as Maria Magdalena, which counts in the story of Jesus that he was the freind of her family and he liked to go there to visit her. The Gospel assures us that Lazaro became ill and died, but on the fourth day Jesus revived him.<br><br>Lazaro had to leave the country and arrived in France, where he was the Bishop of Marseilles, under the the emperor Domiciano. Then the was made prisoner and executed, and this time he died definitely. He is presented wrapped in banages, as was the custom to do with corpses of the Jews, this being the explanation for the interpretation that is associated with the image of the San Lazaro that is adored by the Cubans, which is the religious syncretism with the African deities, he is known as BabalÃº AyÃ©.  </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;"> San LÃ¡zaro: "The Miracle Worker"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/lazaro.jpg"><br><br>" San LÃ¡zaro: "The Miracle Worker " Mojo Kit is Conjured &amp; Blessed by Mambo High Priestess &amp; High Priest Oceanos for immediate use.
