If you have a specific goal &amp; require a tangible result, a custom made Mojo will suit you better. The Mojo Bag is custom made to suit your needs therefore you got to tell me in more details what you want it to do for you &amp; the cost varies.<br><br>As for a Mojo for Prosperity &amp; Monetary Luck or a Mojo for Love &amp; Attraction, they work better solely by itself. If you wish to combine them in one Mojo, i do not recommend it if you desire a tangible effect. For other purposes like "Protection", "Healing" &amp; so on, you can combine them in one Mojo.<br><br>All my Mojo bags are good enough to produce the results &amp; effects one seek, able to create a positive change in one's life. The longer you use the Mojo Bag, the stronger it get as it grows with you morever it can use forever if taken care of well &amp; it is still working fine, best of all there is no side effect at all. The only concern is that you got to wear/carry it, use it with Positive Intents &amp; Faith.<br><br>Feel free to make any enquiry.

It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"? Its many "Uses" &amp; "Effacies". </span><br><br>A mixture of Magickal herbs, talismans, roots, powders &amp; stones in a muslin, flannel,felt or chamois bag that should be carried with you at all times to get a specific desired effect. That is a Mojo Bag.<br><br>Also known as an "Ouanga" ,"Conjure" , "Gris Gris" or "Medicine" bag ,regardless of the area in which the name was derived or the culture you may be familiar with ,they are all used for the same basic thing &amp; prescribe to the same basic principle; To attract to or dispel from the wearer, certain influences. Thus they can be made for just about any purpose under the sun. They imply faith and serve as a link beween that in which you believe and that which you desire.<br><br>Mojo Bags are usually worn around the neck or pinned inside the undergarments so that they are in touch with your skin. However ,in a pocket or bag is also fine in any case. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: darkblue;">"MOJO Bags"</span><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Voodoo%20Products/CHARISMAMOJO.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: red;">"CHARISMA MOJO"<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Voodoo%20Products/CHARISMAMOJOSET.jpg"><br><br>Charisma Mojo Bag is specifically improving your personal relationship with all around you, attract friends, improve communication &amp; interaction with others, give you confidence so you may perform well in all you do, make you charismatic &amp; attractive to all.

It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"? Its many "Uses" &amp; "Effacies". </span><br><br>A mixture of Magickal herbs, talismans, roots, powders &amp; stones in a muslin, flannel,felt or chamois bag that should be carried with you at all times to get a specific desired effect. That is a Mojo Bag.<br><br>Also known as an "Ouanga" ,"Conjure" , "Gris Gris" or "Medicine" bag ,regardless of the area in which the name was derived or the culture you may be familiar with ,they are all used for the same basic thing &amp; prescribe to the same basic principle; To attract to or dispel from the wearer, certain influences. Thus they can be made for just about any purpose under the sun. They imply faith and serve as a link beween that in which you believe and that which you desire.<br><br>Mojo Bags are usually worn around the neck or pinned inside the undergarments so that they are in touch with your skin. However ,in a pocket or bag is also fine in any case. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: darkblue;">"MOJO Bags"</span><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Voodoo%20Products/IMG_1365.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: red;">"ADAM &amp; EVE LOVE MOJO"<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Voodoo%20Products/IMG_1361.jpg"><br><br>Adam &amp; Eve Love Mojo Bag is specifically for improving your existing Love relationship, attraction, to bring a lover to you, or for a marriage proposal.<br><br>If you are currently in a relationship &amp; would like to keep your lover true, discourages rivals, this is a Mojo that would greatly help you.

It will take time for the energy of the Mojo to fully merged with the owner's aura. No worries. Usually this happen because the Mojo Bag is very strong &amp; the wearer is very sensitive to energies &amp; vibrations. Different people has different feel about it, i have clients who felt extreme burning heat emitting from their mojos or cold chilling waves emiting from their mojos, some even felt tingling feelings that went straight up their whole body. Hope these answer your queries. Thanks again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Due to numerous enquiries, Let me explain in more details about Mojo Bags.<br><br>A Mojo bag working is permanent, it is custom made to suit individual needs therefore will work solely for the owner only. In time to come if you need additional work on the Mojo or as &amp; when you feel a need to, you can always bring it back to me to upgrade at additional cost.<br><br>Many may wonder why such great difference in cost between various custom made Mojo bags &amp; their range? The difference in cost is due to the effects one seek, the more the desired effects, the higher the cost. The difference in pcost is also difference in strength &amp; effects. Mainly is the Magickal Herbs, Botanical Roots, Curios &amp; Charms that i use in conjuring the Mojo bag, some items are not easily available &amp; rare which are very costly morever for every Mojo bag, i need to do a Full Voodoo Ritual to bless, consecrate &amp; empower them can take up for around 6-9 hours for simple to normal ritual, 1-9 days for those that require intensive workings (for such my Altar Space have to be set there till then end of the Rites). Other than Altar set up cost for the items use, it require alot of my Time, Power &amp; Energy for each Mojo Bag i conjure.<br><br>From time to time, i will have Special Exclusive Mojo Bag available for a Limited Time &amp; Quantity only! These Mojo Bags are conjured with Rare Botanical &amp; Curios, Consecrated at Various Strong Spiritual Places, Conjured &amp; Blessed by Various Mambo, Hougan, Bruja, High Priest/Priestess &amp; myself. Once they run out, will not be available again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
