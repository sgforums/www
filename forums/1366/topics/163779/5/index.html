It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"?

Its many "Uses" &amp; "Effacies". </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/alligatorfeet.gif"><br><br>Alligator Paw are regularly used in the South to increase gambling luck. Like the ever-popular rabbit foot, also considered lucky for gamblers, the Alligator Paw may worn as a key chain charm or carried in a mojo bag along with such natural curios as rattlesnake rattles, badger teeth, bat hearts, nutmegs, buckeye nuts, Lucky Hand roots, five-finger grass, John the Conqueror roots, and lodestones dressed with magnetic sand.<br><br>The use of alligator paw as gamblers' lucky charms seems to be an American notion, for alligators are indigenous to the Americas. I can find no discernible precedent for the custom in African, European, or Asian folklore, although the "clutching hand" effect of these feet resembles on a larger scale the appearance of the Lucky Hand root, a distinctively African-American gambler's charm. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: darkblue;">"MOJO Bags"</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">"LUCKY BLACK ALLIGATOR MOJO"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/blackalligatormojo.jpg"><br><br>Carry Lucky Black Alligator Mojo Bag with you.
