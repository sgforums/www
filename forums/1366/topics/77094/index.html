Not exactly human, but not quite angel, you walk on earth freely. Half-Angels have no wings, but tend to show some signs. Some ways to notice these are that the girl never menstrates, she cannot bleed, and her touch seems to give of a glow. No one really knows how half-angels are born. Some say that when a child is born, one of the angels blesses her with her gifts. Others say that they are cursed creatures, because half-angels cannot die, while their familly and friends around them do. Hlaf-Angels are very beautiful and Kind, and have the power to speak to animals, but at the same time, sad that they are this way. Some Half-Angels love being human. Being able to see, smell, hear, taste,and feel are all miracles to them. They crave to be more human-all the time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your a Guardien Angel! Guardien Angels are also known as Warrior Angels, because they are the army of God. Not always meaning that they are in war, simply that their job is to protect unwary humans from dark dragons, or other evil demons. Warrior Angels are not always friendly with humans, but they will watch over them all the time. Humans say that when a miracle happens, thank your guardien angel.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

These angels were once upon a time, very loved, and of the highest ranks of all the angels. But, when something terrible happened in their lives, much like the dark-angels, the outcats leave the heavens and move down to earth. Out cats angel are not nessearily evil. In fact, they are quite kind, but filled with greif and guilt unimaginable. Outcast angels are usually formed when they have failed something, and ridden with guilt, they are banned out of heaven, sent down to earth, and live alone. They are always quite and sad, and rarely contact with humans. If a huam befriends an outcast angel, they have a friend for life.</span></div>
