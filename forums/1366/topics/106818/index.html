Alongside with the development of Taoism as a philosophy another more strictly religious interpretation of Taoism was evolving. This 'religious' Taoism had its own temples, priests, rites and symbolic images. Lao Tzu was venerated as a 'saint' and imperial sacrifices were made to him. It drew strongly upon the ideas of yin-yang polarity and of the 'Five Elements' (metal, wood, water, fire &amp; earth).<br><br>During this time there began to develop a pantheon of Taoist Deities which were often venerated as gods. So prominent were astrology, alchemy and divination in this stream of Taoism that it had veered away from philosophy to occultism. This movement was sometimes known as Huang-Lao, after the legendary Yellow Emperor, Huang-ti and Lao Tzu.<br><br>From this form of Taoism emerged very strong alchemical currents as Taoist practitioners at the court of Shih Huang-ti of the Qin (Ch'in) dynasty (221-207 BC) tried to cultivate powers that would transform base metals to gold, and hence would serve as a metonym for the transformation of human qualities to the transcendent. These practitioners were also acclaimed as spirit mediums and experts in levitation.<br><br>Among the important features of Taoist religion were the belief in physical immortality, alchemy, breath control and hygiene (internal alchemy). It supported a pantheon of deities, including Lao Tzu as one of the three 'Supreme Ones'. The Taoist liturgy and theology was much influenced by Buddhism. Its scriptures, the Tao-tsang, consist of over 1,400 separate works totaling more than 5,000 chapters.<br><br>Of special significance to these mystics were the colour red (symbolizing the furnaces of the alchemists), the Manchurian Crane with its red spot of divinity in its crown, and the compound cinnabar (composed of mercury and sulphur) which could be transformed into a silvery liquid; and back again into a solid.<br><br>There is considerable evidence that this religious Taoism came to take on many 'Tantric' elements, in which the worship of yin-yang takes on a distinctly sexual and erotic form. The interplay of yin and yang elements is represented, and celebrated, as a sexual union. There are some scholars who, in fact, believe that the Tantric schools, which later were absorbed into Buddhism, evolved first as Taoist ones.<br><br></strong></div>

The former, led by the three Chang brothers, promised immortality to ordinary people. Hundreds of thousands of destitute people flocked to their banner, holding great public gatherings, confessions of sins and even uninhibited orgies. Although the movement fell apart, it was one of the key factors that de-stabilized the Han dynasty and lead to its downfall.<br><br>However, even in the time of the Six Kingdoms (220 to 618 A.D.) Taoism continued to attract many refugee intellectuals, fleeing from the barbarians in the North.<br><br>Particularly important to the development of Taoism in China was the rein of the Emperor Li Lung-chi ( Hsuan Tsung) who ruled for 44 years and was a fervent adherent of Taoism. Deeply absorbed in its study he tried to create a Taoist state in which capital punishment would be abolished and animals would be treated humanely. He established hospitals for the sick and poor and was an accomplished musician, equestrian, calligrapher and astronomer.<br><br>A true mystic Li Lung-chi once had a vision of Lao Tzu who told him where to find a true likeness of him. The image was, in fact, discovered and replicas of it were made and installed in temples across the realm. He also told his ministers that once while burning incense in a shrine he had been wafted up to Heaven.</strong></div>

It is the eighth largest grotto heaven of the Daoist Ten Large Grotto Heavens and first blessed land of the seventy-two blessed lands in Daoism. Tradition has it that Mao Yin, Mao Gu and Mao Zhong cultivated here during the years 119 B.C to 103 B.C., treated peoples' diseases, attained the Dao, and achieved immortality on Mount Mao. In order to commemorate them, people called Juqu Mountain Three Maos Mountain. Mt. Mao is its abbreviated name.<br><br>Since 265, Maoshan has gradually become a Daoist holy land. Daoist Nun Wei Huacun cultivated herself here from 265-316 and was regarded as founder of the Mt. Mao Sect. From 317-420, Xu Mi and Yang Xi compiled the <span style="font-style: italic;">Scriptures of Highest Clarity</span>. During the years 479-557, Tao Hongjing founded his Daoist organization on Mt. Mao and built several temples with his disciples. The Huayang Temple and Zhu Yang Temple were built at that time. During the years 581-907, Daoism reached its height of power and splendor. Large numbers of eminent priests came here to receive Daoist ordination. Wang Yuanzhi, Pan Shizheng and Sima Chengzhen were the most famous of them. The Taiping Temple, Chongyuan Temple and Ziyang Temple were the largest temples on the mountain. The construction of all of them was imperially mandated. From 960-1368, Maoshan produced many eminent Daoist priests. The patriarchs lasted from the twentieth to forty-fifth generations and the court respected them. Many temples were built at this time. The latest, known as the "three temples and five monasteries," were finished at this time. The Three Temples include Nine Heavens Ten Thousand Blessed Temple, Yuanfu Wanning Temple, and Chongxi Wanshou Temple. The Five Monasteries include Virtue Patron Temple, Benevolence Patron Temple, Jade Morning Temple, White Cloud Temple and Qianyuan Temple. From 1368-1840, Daoism continued to flourish. During the Taiping Movement, Maoshan was besieged by the warring times; 90% of its temples were burnt to ash. During the Cultural Revolution, most of the remaining temples were destroyed, with only some broken walls remaining intact. After 1979, the policy of religions was put into effect. The government appropriated funds to restore the Nine Heavens Temple and the Original Talisman Temple, as well as to build a road leading to the Elder Mao Peak.<br><br>The Nine Heavens Ten Thousands Blessing Temple: located at the top of Elder Mao Peak. Therefore, people call it Top Temple. There are four temples built along the mountain. The first is Guardian Hall, the second is Stored Scriptures Building, and the third is the main architectural complex--Precious Ultimate Origin Temple, which enshrines the Three Mao Perfect Sovereign Brothers. The fourth are Submitting Documents Platform and Two Sacred Hall. In the exhibition room, there are Four Treasures of Maoshan, i.e., jade seal, jade measures, jade talisman and jade ink stone. They are rarities of the Song dynasty.<br><br>Original Talisman Longevity Temple: located at the foot of Jijin Peak where Daoist priests hide seals. So, people call it Seal Temple. Its construction began in the Tang Dynasty and flourished in the Song. During the reign of Emperor Ze, his mother swallowed a silver needle and she was on the verge of death. The court doctors were at the ends of their tether. The twenty-fifth patriarch Liu Hunkang was summoned to the court to make talismanic water for the empress dowager. She spit out the silver needle after taking the holy water. The emperor was very pleased and ordered to rebuild Liu Hunkang's temples and conferred the title of Original Talisman Temple. He also gave jade seals, jade measures, jade talismans and jade ink stones.<br><br>A temple fair at Maoshan has become active since the temples were rebuilt, restoring Daoism to the mountain. The Mt. Mao temple fair begins on the twenty-fourth of November and ends on the eighteenth of March of the lunar calendar, lasting three months. Its activities are rich and varied. It is a place for devotees to carryout religious activities.</strong></div>
