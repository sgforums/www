There are no game mechanics within.  The reason behind this is that The Book of Nod is meant to be 100 percent setting material.  Ideally, Storytellers will use The Book of Nod as a prop in either their Masquerade Mind's Eye Theatre game or their Vampire: The Masquerade cronicles.<br><br>They May also use it to seed their games with an authentic culture:  the culture of the Antediluvians which filters down from Caine himself.  Want to make an Elder seem ancient and ultra-conservative?  Have him quote fromt he Chronicle of Shadows.  Want to give players the sense they are close to the Antediluvians?  Have them find a tablet with a fragment of the Chronicle of Caine on it.  Want to scare them with threats of Gehenna?  Have a Malkavian quote the Chronicle of Secrets to them.</blockquote></div>

Best is you watch the movie after the book.  The movie does injustice to the book, especially book 3.<br><br>Books 4 and 5 follows off book 3, more like the adventures of the vampire Lestat, more entertaining and subplots to Lestat and his misadvantures. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Memnoch book 5 is awfully preachy about the devil and god stuff, very boring.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow.. so many facts about them..... Now that i read them i kinda got more questions marks above my head ler.. =\<br><br>I was guessing if the first vampire.. is he/she a gifted witch but kinda misuse the gift and went into vampirism, like doing bad things and drink blood so he/she can stay youthful? And so that was the first vampire borned? To find the history of vampirism is very hard.. maybe if u go ask the existing one yourself.. hahahx~ But i think there ARE histories of them except that u duno if it's true or not. And there are alot of MAYBEs... Big hole in the histories.. =\ So its like no definite answers..<br><br>And blood drinking vampires..

This combination of her at near death and another medium turned her into the first vampire.  She had a neverending thirst of blood and seeked to make those she loved lived a dammed immortal life including her king.

In a magickal working group, their ability to wreak havoc is increased because of the psychic openness and trust that exist there. But there can be a benefit, as well. Some vampires become aware of their true natures and choose to undertake serious work to transform themselves. As soon as they begin doing so, they become more acceptable working partners and companions. Once in control of their capacity for handling energy, they become extraordinary magicians and healers. Their ability to hold the attention of others gives them the potential to be fine leaders and teachers. Ultimately, the purpose of vampires is not to plague the universe but to facilitate its healing. Vampirism is the dark, or unfocused, side of a certain kind of psychic talent, one which has been developing for many lifetimes. It is destructive only when a vampire either refuses to face the truth about herself and work with her abilities, or when she chooses to play out a sinister role because of the illusion of power it gives her.<br><br>Because of this, many of the vampire characteristics described above are far less evident in the most powerful vampires, the ones who have done considerable work on their inner selves. Many of these are poised, pleasant, competent individuals, with great personal power. They have come to terms with who and what they are, and no longer exhibit the negative qualities associated with "psychic vampirism." 4 Unfortunately, unconscious vampires are far more common than evolved ones, and it is these troubled souls who more usually appear in magickal groups. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>
