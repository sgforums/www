It has fascinated me since my childhood years &amp; i have done quite alot of researchs over the years however this is not the 1st time i am presenting these informations &amp; knowledge to all for sharing &amp; discussion. I done a topic like this briefly in the cyberspace few years back upon a request by a friend from USA.<br><br>Is "Vampire" a myth or fiction? Or do "Vampire" really exist? A scenario of a blood-sucking nightstalker preying on innocent victims suddenly comes to everyone's mind! What is a "Vampiric" person?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">A vampiric person is a person with vampiric traits, primarily blood-craving or a need to consume pranic energy, or for whom vampirism is a deeply-rooted aspect of one's self-identity for whatever reason.<br>I use the term "vampiric person" to skirt the semantic question of which such people (if any) should properly be called "Vampires."</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real-life blood-drinkers and energy-hungerers </span></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">There exist many different kinds of people who either identify or have been identified with the label "Vampire". Generally they fall into three broad overlapping categories: (1) blood-drinkers, (2) psychic vampires and other energy-hungerers, and (3) Vampyre lifestylers.<br><br>Within the vampiric community, the word "vampire" is often used more narrowly to refer to sanguinarians and psychic vampires. The following links pertain to the broader categories of blood-drinkers and energy-hungerers, with an emphasis on, but not limited to, sanguinarians and psychic vampires.<br><br>Yes, "Vampire" do exist, they are neither just Myth nor Fiction or only exist in any Fabricated Media "Rubbish" like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"! "Vampire" depicted &amp; portrayed by the Media over the years has been distorted &amp; exaggerated in many ways! "Vampire" are among us, co-existed in our Human community for centuries...just as "WE" evolved, "Vampire" has gone through evolution to blend in with our societies &amp; communities...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

The "Emotional Vampires" whom you cited that feed of other's feelings are also a form of "Vampire" that fall under category (2) psychic vampires and other energy-hungerers which i mentioned in my previous post &amp; they are the most nasty &amp; large number types of "Vampire".<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Those who live of other people's money are definitely not within our scope of discussion. These are "Human" who commited "Sins" &amp; "Act" of "Evil" , they are mostly labeled as "Loanshark" or simply people who got monetary gains through immoral or unethical act without real genuine hard work or effort...hahaha<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The Real Kind? As in Bloodline "Vampire" whose Family lines of Royalty carried down from centuries, don't think so. Personally i have not acquainted with Any so far but they can be found in UK &amp; some other Western Countries, seldom seen in Asian countries. However my Sister from Australia who is from Inhereditary bloodline of Witches has met one before during a visit with her families in UK. From her account "They" don't look much different with normal human in any way unless its from the "Spiritual" aspect which clearly shown their difference in their Auric field from Normal Human beings. Another i would ilike to add on to this is "They" look younger than their age regardless of gender, never sick their whole life, very Charismatic &amp; Enchanting beings, Certainly these Bloodline "Vampire" do possess some magickal &amp; psychic abilities depending on their age, whether they "Live Forever" i do not know &amp; cannot comment on that but from what i know they live longer than any Human on Earth. They are very private &amp; united beings usually prefer not to have much Human contact unless its needed..<br><br>Well in my life i have met alot of "PSI Vamp" who feed on other's energy &amp; life force in bid to increase their own &amp; quite a few of them are practicioner of various Mystic or Magickal Arts of Dark path. Truly "Evil"...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REAL VAMPIRES</span><br><br>"Real Vampires" - how can this be anything but a contradiction in terms? We all know about vampires. Stock characters of fiction, guaranteed box-office draws, the media vampire has been familiar to us since childhood. Generally speaking, our blood-suckers appear with a tongue planted firmly in one toothy cheek-from Bela Lugosi hamming it up in the 1950's, to last summer's teenage "vamp" movies, to Count Chocula breakfast cereal, the media seldom treat the vampire as truly fearsome. The stereotyped vampire traits are familiar to any child: vampires have big fangs, sleep in coffins, are instantly incinerated by sunlight, and are best dispatched by a stake through the heart. But the most important "fact" that we all know of course is that there are no such things.<br><br>Of course, in terms of the mythical, literary and cinematic conventions, we are correct: there are no "legions of the undead" stalking the unwary. We have explained the folklore with politics, misunderstood diseases, and hysteria, the literary and cinematic images with psychology, history, and sociology. We of the 20th century are confident that vampires could not really exist. But then, most of us are never forced to think otherwise. For a number of people, the concept of vampires becomes a critical and often lifelong concern. To live with, love, or befriend a real vampire is to encounter a set of problems which may demand expanding the boundaries of one's accepted reality. To come to terms with being a real vampire oneself is to face a lifetime's karmic challenge.<br>Some people reading this article already know this. The rest are probably thinking, "Real Vampires, give me a break! Sure, there are some pretty weird people out there, but all they need is a good therapist." Yes, there are people who take on all the trappings of a gothic novel: dressing in black, claiming or pretending to be "vampires" in the supernatural sense, wearing capes, sleeping in boxes, even getting their teeth capped. There are more frightening people who seek to torture or kill animals or human beings in order to gain power, emotional release or sexual thrill, and who sometimes call themselves (or are called) "vampires". But most of these individuals are troubled people who have been attracted by the cultural myths about the vampire: supernatural powers (because they feel powerless), overwhelming sexuality (because most of them have sexual issues and no true relationships), immortality (because they fear aging and death). Individuals like these are the most recent "explanation" for humanity's persistent belief in vampires. But beyond and behind all the folklore, the psychological theories, the role playing, even the traditional spiritual assumptions, lies the real truth about vampires.<br><br>The field of vampirology is complex and mysterious. There are many aspects to the vampire phenomenon, and they would require several books to fully explore. One aspect of vampirism which frequently troubles magickal, spiritual and other small groups, the most common form of vampire, is found among living people who share with us the benefits and disadvantages of physical existence on this plane, yet are not quite human. These people appear on the surface to be somewhat eccentric members of society, yet their outward idiosyncrasies only hint at how different they are from those around them.<br><br>Each of us incarnates for a lifetime with a certain way of relating to the physical world through the vehicle of our physical body. A vampire is a person born with an extraordinary capacity to absorb, channel, transform, and manipulate "pranic energy" or life force. She also has a critical energy imbalance which reels wildly from deficit to overload and back again. This capacity for handling energy is a gift, but the constant imbalance of her own system is the cause of the negative behaviour patterns and characteristics which may be notable about a vampiric person.</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

Blood-drinking and vampirism have been confused to the extent that for the average person, a vampire is defined as something that drinks blood ( such as a "vampire bat" ).<br><br>But when we look beyond casual assumptions to the details of common beliefs, we find something quite different. Throughout both folklore and literature, there is an understanding that vampires require energy or life force. Many old folktales accept that vampires suck blood, yet never describe this actually happening. The victims slowly decline and waste away, and the survivors assume that some evil fiend is draining them of blood. They know that the Bible says, "the blood is the life", and anyone who was losing their life force must be losing blood. Yet, in many instances the vampire's "attack" does not even involve physical contact. In others, it is clearly sexual energy which is exchanged.<br><br>1) Fresh blood is the highest known source of pranic energy (life force).<br><br>2)Human beings have practiced blood-drinking for many reasons throughout history, but drinking blood alone does not indicate that a person is a vampire. Only real vampires can directly absorb the pranic energy in fresh blood, and for this reason some real vampires are attracted to blood and find different means of obtaining it.<br><br>3) However, it is a rare vampire who cannot absorb energy in much more subtle ways.<br><br>This is the mechanism that causes real vampires to inflict harm on others and themselves if they fail to recognize what is happening and do conscious work on transforming their inner natures. Vampires are no more likely to be either malicious or spiritually aware than the general population, but without awareness, they can spend their lives making themselves and others unhappy, and will continue to incarnate in this pattern until they take action to change it. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

Real vampires are identifiable partly because they have a majority of the symptoms, not just one or two. But more significantly, real vampires are distinguished by a certain quality to the energy. While anyone reading a description of the symptoms and behavior patterns might find a few that apply to people he knows, or even to himself, real vampires have a way of standing out vividly to everyone who interacts with them. There are few people who do not know at least one vampire.<br><br>Physically, vampires are usually "night people" on a biochemical level. They have inverted circadian rhythms, with body cycles such as temperature peaks, menstrual onset, and the production of sleep hormones in the brain occurring at the opposite time of day from most people. They have difficulty adjusting to daytime schedules and frequently work nights. They tend to be photosensitive, avoiding sunlight, sunburning easily, and having excellent night vision. Their vitality ranges widely, and they can be vigorous and active one day, depressed and languorous the next.<br><br>They frequently have digestive trouble. Even those with cast-iron stomachs have many issues with food that are rooted in their constant hunger for energy. Contrary to the image of the vampire as thin, many real vampires are troubled by obesity because of a hunger that makes them food addicts, and a system that is sluggish in processing physical food. They are also sometimes troubled by other substance addictions for the same reasons, but since their systems are tuned to pranic energy more than to processing physical substance, they may not be as sensitive to drugs and alcohol as an ordinary person would be.<br><br>Emotionally and physically, vampires are unpredictable, moody, temperamental and overwhelming. The major distinguishing characteristic of real vampires as opposed to ordinary people who share those qualities is the vampire's intensity. Vampires are extremely intense people. They are frequently given nicknames such as "the black hole." When others talk about them (usually to complain about them), vampires are often described by such terms as "needy" , "attention-seeking" ,  "grandstanding" , "manipulative" , "exhausting" ,  "draining" , "monopolizes the conversation" , "jealous" , "huge ego" and so on. A vampire's emotions are deep, fervent, and powerful, and she usually displays great psychic ability and has uncontrolled magickal and psychic experiences. Vampires are also empaths, and while they remain unconscious of their natures, they are frequently "psychic sponges" who simply absorb vibrations from everywhere, with the expected emotional instability resulting. </span></strong></span><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

When the energy does not flow in fast enough -- and it is typical of vampires that the energy never flows fast enough for them -- she will begin manifesting behavior patterns to increase the amount of conscious attention she gets from others. For this reason, some vampires develop a pattern of being aggressively confrontational, or of constantly antagonizing people with whom they have relationships. Nearly all vampires, whatever ploys they use, have a talent for attracting (or distracting) the attention of everyone present.<br><br>Once a vampire overloads on energy, she reverses her behavior patterns. She may become morose, silent, withdrawn and introverted. Some vampires become maniacally cheerful when they are satiated, but even their good moods seem to annoy others, and it is more typical for vampires to be infamous as wet blankets. "Hungry" and "overload" phases can occur within a few minutes or last for days at a time. Vampires are commonly loners, in part because they feel so different from those around them, but also because they have a need to control the degree of contact they have with sources of energy. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

Unconscious vampires have a tendency to reach adulthood with less than the average level of social skill and general finesse, and tend to be selfish and self-centered. The demands of their own energy systems are so distracting to them that it is difficult for them to pay attention to the needs of others. Their relationships tend to be disasters. Different vampires develop different patterns according to what works best for them in their life situation, but several patterns are common.<br><br>The "femme fatale" or "lady-killer" vampire forms a continuous series of sexual connections with one partner at a time, dropping each unfortunate lover as they become too exhausted (or defensive) to support the vampire's energy needs. Other vampires form a long-term relationship with a single person: either another vampire whose energy cycle complements their own, or a person who derives satisfaction from being a psychic servant or martyr. A common pattern, especially in young adults, is to continuously join social, religious, political and magickal groups and either blow them apart or end up being thrown out. Vampires may go through roommates, housing situations, magickal groups, jobs and lovers like so much Kleenex.<br><br>Many people find that they feel "creepy" or "weird" around a vampire. This is usually due to the effects of one's own life force being drawn towards the vampire's vortex. Most people feel uncomfortable and distracted when their energy is pulled away from themselves. In addition to this, a common result of such an energy drain is for the aura to pull in tightly towards the body, and this causes a prickling sensation on the skin -- the " creepy-crawlies ".<br><br>It is no more common for vampires to be psychopaths or killers than it is for any random person on the street. However, a prolonged, or very involved, relationship with a vampire can put a severe strain on the emotional and psychic energy systems of an ordinary person. Folklore suggests that victims of a vampire become vampires themselves. In reality, people who have been seriously "drained" -- that is, have had their own energy pulled off balance into a deficit -- also become psychic vortices which pull life force away from other living things. However, they are never as powerful as a true vampire, and unlike vampires, quickly recover and stabilize. True vampires are born the way they are -- no one can be "turned into a vampire." However, years of energy depletion can lead to health problems ranging from depression and malaise to a suppressed immune system and susceptibility to serious illnesses. Most people will break off the relationship before it gets that far. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>
