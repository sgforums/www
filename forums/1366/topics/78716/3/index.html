Those who are so inclined might try to help a friend or fellow group member explore their inner nature and come to terms with their destructive behaviors. Those who feel victimized can choose to end the relationship. Each case is different, and can only be judged by the individuals concerned. But it is important for anyone involved in magickal or psychic work to understand that vampires are a real phenomenon, and that, like all perils, they should not be greeted with fear or anger. Nothing is evil by nature -- only by choice. Terror of discovery (followed by ridicule or rejection) inhibits the self-development of many real vampires. When they reach out for friendship, they are often reaching out for help.<br><br>A person who believes she may be a real vampire herself has a long and difficult process ahead of her. The most important step on her path is complete self-awareness: of her relationships, patterns, energy levels, and all other personal qualities. The most challenging work may often be summarized in the simplest of terms. Knowledge, awareness, and control are the lessons real vampires must learn in order to harness their abilities. If real vampires are not the immortals of fiction, they can at least be confident of one thing: for better or worse, they will keep the qualities they develop for many lives to come.<br><br>NOTES: For a thorough examination of traditional vampire folklore, see the works of Montague Summers and Anthony Masters.<br><br>Other high sources of pranic energy include semen, fresh fruits and vegetables, and the breath of living animals. Meat -- filled with chemicals, long dead, refrigerated, frozen and "aged" (partially decomposed) as it is -- contains almost none. Many real vampires, aside from drinking blood, are vegetarians.<br><br>For a somewhat flawed but interesting look at blood-drinking and vampirism, see Stephen Kaplan. Leonard Wolf explores this subject from a more philosophical and personal viewpoint.<br><br>This is not to suggest that even evolved vampires are always comfortable to be around. They remain unpredictable, intense, emotional, and altogether overwhelming personalities. Most are remarkable sexually, and all still draw energy, although they can generally control this to some extent. Furthermore, this article is not intended to mislead -- real vampires, even evolved ones, do sometimes drink blood in order to obtain their energy. Those who understand the many ways that life "gives way" to nurture more life will see this as no more unnatural than eating live vegetables or animals for food. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

This form of vampirism falls into the category more of meta-physics and the occult than mainstream science. It seems psy-vamps have the ability to draw out the "chi," "manna," or plain energy of their victims. They do not seem to have the craving for blood found in most other forms of vampirism. In advanced cases, the vampire can choose from which victim to draw and even which types of energy to take. The one with whom I have spoken uses this ability to heal others by feeding from the "negative" energy in the victim's aura. From what I have heard from the "victim/patients," she is quite good at what she does. In less developed cases, the psy-vamp might not even know about this condition. Other people around him or her might feel "drained" from the person's presence, and hence the vampire will usually have trouble keeping friends. A good psychic can usually tell if a person is a psy-vamp. There is no known cure, but a psychic vampire can learn to control his/her feeding habits.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Spirit-Influenced" Vampires</span><br><br>These are, no doubt the most frustrating cases to study because they differ so widely. In the one case study, the vampire was involved in demonology and either erred or made a pact he later regretted. It seems that certain "spirits" or "demons" can give people some of the characteristics of other types of vampires in exchange for partial possession. The new vampire then has certain enhanced abilities and, in exchange, allows the spirit to take over now and then. At first this almost sounds like a form of symbiosis, but the human in the deal soon finds that the spirit usually does things that are morally unacceptable. He seems to be in a constant state of remorse for the things he's done. He wouldn't go into details, but he did hint at murder. Also in this catagory are the vampires who claim to have been changed by a visitation in a dream or by the apparition of a ghostly vampire. Cases in this category are documented in the book _Vampires_Among_Us_ by ???????.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Viral" Vampires </span><br><br>"Viral" vampires are the ones that seem to have the most reason to call themselves vampires. This "virus" is what causes the change to take place. It is passed on through blood, sexual secretions, and occasionally saliva. Transmission is usually deliberate and ritualistic. I have heard of one case where the would-be vampire "got over" the virus, and a few cases where the recievers died during the process. It is unknown if this is an actual virus or if the effects are psychosomatic based on the archetype of the American Vampire. Nonetheless, the effects and changes associated with this type of vampirism are real. The process of change is the traditional exchange of body fluids in a ritual setting. The fledgling commonly expiriences a near-death-experience at some point, sometimes seemingly unrelated to the change into a vampire. Effects of the change include photosensitivity, increased night vision, anemia, dual-personality (one normal personality and another that takes over when the vampire looses it's temper), a blood fetish, a craving for rare red meat, and if the person had any psychic ability, this is increased. Sex drive is first decreased then increased beyond the intensity before the change. Most vampires describe the sensation as like that of being on LSD during a mild trip. From the descriptions, it seems to me to be more akin to the effects of thojune, the halucigen in Absinthe. Either way, the sensuality of a vampire is appearant. Some vampires notice a change in muscle movement. It is more direct, smooth, rapid, and efficient. Most vampires of this variety notice a slowed aging process. Depending on the strain of the virus, all of these changes are present to differing degrees. I have not met any one older than mid-sixties, so longevity is debatable. The one in her mid-sixties I met looked like a sickly mid twenties. Her lack of signs of aging was remarkable, but it remains to be seen how long these vampires live. The oldest one I've heard of anyone actually meeting was in his nineties. He is rumored to have looked not a day over 60.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Immortal Vampires</span><br><br>What can be said? They are elusive. The theory I am going on is that immortals are possibly an extremely powerful strain of the "viral" variety. The characteristics are almost identical, with the exception of intensity. Again, this is a virtually unexplored topic because of the lack of evidence. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

Categorized, the four main areas in which a vampire might be found are the Born, the Created, the Crossbreeds and the Bodiless. Relatively simple terms, they allow for a universal translation and understanding and are not be considered the "true" names by which vampires would care to be known.<br><br>There are also a few different psychic or telepathic abilities that you will see in certain kinds of vampires. They are telepathy (mind reading), empathy (suggestion, hypnosis, and emotion detection), clairvoyance (sensing objects), psychokinesis or telekinesis (mind over matter), pyrokinesis (mind over fire), and rheiki (aura or lifeforce manipulation). In theory, humans too have potential to use these abilities, but it is thought that these abilities are weak and lie latent for the better part of their lives.<br><br>Crossbreeds are capable of developing operant but limited telepathy and clairvoyance and for some odd reason are skilled at rheiki (some almost as powerful as the Bodiless).<br><br>The Born seem to have strong abilities with all of the mentioned skills although extremely talented with pyro and psychokinesis.<br>The Created though, have more agility with telepathy and empathy than the rest, and the Bodiless have mastered rheiki to the point that they could kill with a thought. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

Usually the mother is a human in the case of halfbreeds, but not always. The Crossbreeds are noted for growing either slightly faster or slower than full human children. It depends on which vampire genes they inherited. The genes that encourage faster healing and cell division may make a child grow faster, but the others that discourage bodily aging and slow the metabolism might slow or even stunt it. Growing faster though, does not mean taller just in case you mistook my words. Of course their height would depend on their parents genes, and if one child was to have a father who originated from the medieval period, it is likely that he would not be very tall.<br><br>Their psychic abilities have been known to cause confusion, and many develop anemia at least once or twice within their lives. Jaundice at birth is also common amongst them as well as various anemic deficiency disorders. Hereditary Spherocytic Hemolytic Anemia is perhaps one good example. In some families a plethora of genetic disorders can be linked to a failure in vampire DNA to appropriately connect with human DNA.<br><br>Like the Created, most Crossbreed tend to be of European descent. Their eyes can be more light sensitive and their skin might develop a natural pallor to it as well. Naturally precocious, faster maturing emotionally as well as physically, they learn quicker. Even a small child can be faster and stronger than a normal human twice his or her size. A young child more intelligent than a person twice his or her age. Their awareness of themselves, others, and their surrounding is remarkable, sometimes losing their innocence too early, or holding onto it until the last possible moment. They are more humane than most people with a strong understanding and empathic sensitivity, and yet at the same time, can be as insensitive as a Born in becoming somewhat sadistic due to the vampire instinct in them. If one parent was a Born, then they are often the equivalent of a Created vampire. Crossbreeds often know they are not fully human because of their physical and mental differences from others.<br><br>It is known that many psychic vampires (those who feed off of the life energy of others who are not Bodiless vampires) tend to be Crossbreeds with exceptional ability within the rheiki and empathy abilities. Even the Created and Born tend to fall to psychic vampirism now and then. There are of course human psychic vampires but they are few and tend not to be as adept. In particular cases some Crossbreeds even fall to drinking blood like the Created and Born and others, because of instability, often resort to violence, rape, and murder as outlets for their frustration and instinctive needs. There are many people out there who are Crossbreeds and whether or not this is good or not, I don't know. So far this planet is holding out nicely. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Main Race of "Vampire"</span><br><br><img src="http://www.hondurasri.com/CLON/ancient_trails/interiores/images/bat.gif"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Born</span><br><br>A vampire that was born a vampire is a rare and intriguing being. Currently there are only couple known to exist in the world. You see, for someone to be born a full vampire, both his or her parents would have to be either Created of Born vampires themselves, and that's why chances of it happening are so rare. When a human becomes a vampire, the WVCs I explained about earlier introduces its RNA into the cells of the body, including the reproductive cells, and this in most cases kills all of the eggs or sperm.<br><br>For a female, this means no more children because they cannot create any more eggs. For the male, this is not a problem because most retain the ability produce more sperm. There are very few female vampires that can have children, and very few male vampires that can't have children. If two vampires that are able to have children have sex (and I am talking about one female, and one male), then chances are the female can become pregnant. The resulting offspring, is then born within four to five months. After birth, a Born begins to grow, develop and learn with great speed, maturing at a rate almost three times that of a human. The WVC's RNA found in the Created are completely amalgamated for a Born; it is the Born's very DNA. Their physical abilities are greater than other vampires as well, being naturally faster, stronger, and even more agile. In appearance their skin is pallid with the lightest touch of yellowish tint, and their eyes are generally dilated and pale despite the color. Fingernails and hair are notably thick and fast growing. The way they might respond emotionally might seem strange and at times their sensitivity will no doubt appear "out there". Sometimes they make a sociopath seem emotional, and other times they make manic depressive people seem stoic. Their instincts are stronger and most have an intense fascination for the objects around them. Their personalities are often effected by their constant mood swings that I believe are caused by their quickened and forced emotional growth. Unfortunately a Born vampire's body being completely made out of vampire DNA, is extremely UV sensitive, and even as short a time as 30 seconds would be enough to inflict serious tissue damage to one. They also have no production of red blood cells because of lack of production of erythropoietin, and their digestive systems are made only for the ingestion of blood. They are unable to eat any food, and only a few types of liquids they can handle. Born vampires though, are capable of having children and making Created vampires. Their children if had with humans are often very similar to the Created vampires, and exhibit much the same traits and needs. If a child is had with a Created, then it as well can be considered a Born. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Main Race of "Vampire"</span><br><br><img src="http://bbspot.com/Images/News_Features/2003/08/vampire.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Created</span><br><br>The Created are the vampires who are most commonly subject to fictional writings, and are perhaps the first to come to mind when one mentions the word, vampire. An estimated 2,000 - 3,000 exist in the world. Hundreds of different types, each were once fully human and now their DNA has been changed. Every sub-race is in an effort to survive; the vampire who burns easily in the sun is not as likely to live as long and pass genes as much as one who has a resistance. The characteristics of a parent vampire often predetermines the durability of the child vampire. Also, the nature of the pre-existing conditions of a person greatly influence the outcome of a Created vampire. A black vampire has more sun resistance than a white vampire due to the fact that the black skin is more sun resistant by nature, though for some odd reason vampires are more commonly of northern European descent.<br><br>Color blindness, although a curse to humans, is often a blessing for vampires. Most predatorial mammals are color blind in one form or another and this seems to increase their abilities to hunt. In the case of chemical dependency there may be slight residual effects, mostly psychological, however through time these effects will decay in exchange for the "addiction" for blood. The tendency to form habits previously though will likely cause these vampires to "need" blood more frequently than others. With manic depressents, their emotional instabilities will not be helped in anyway. More often than not they tend to become worse in some way or another for all Created vampires are prone to exaggerated emotional sways. It is important to know however, that during the first five years most vampires who are instable or inneficiently able to fend for themselves will not survive without the assistance of others for very long. In most cases, they are killed. Some Created vampires have the ability to reproduce and eat food, and others do not.<br><br>As a nocturnal species, few would ever go out in the day on a regular basis. In the dark, a vampire has advantages over a human such as the heightened senses, quicker speed and reflexes, and the forever useful psychic abilities. In the day, an advantage such as the sensitive eyes would become sore from the amount of light and could be easily turned against them. Pallid skin tone is a result of their nocturnal habits and anemic condition though with great difficulty they can tan themselves. More often than not, they burn. The sun is harmful to a Created vampire. Not in the sense that it can cause spontaneously combust (with a Created vampire this is an impossibility) and I'm not referring to the dangers of skin cancer either. UV light breaks down vampire DNA and causes aging. Sun block does offer some protection, but it's not always a 100% so.</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.jonasdiemar.dk/gfx/gallery/018.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">On the topic of "fangs," I feel I should point out that there are a few different kinds. The canine teeth are most commonly located where the upper eye teeth of a human are. When changed into a vampire, often a persons eye teeth will fall out to be replaced by these canines, or the original teeth will be slightly forced down further than their original position. Those that come in are typically a little longer and by nature harder and sharper on the tip. One will find that grinding them down takes much, much effort. A Created vampire's teeth are also noted for constant growing to keep up with the wearing down of the enamel. The bottom teeth canines, which in all characteristics are the same as the usual top canines, are only different in which their location is the bottom of the mouth and occur as frequently as left handedness does for humans. It's been known that in a few cases, when a new pair of canines do come in, they might develop too far back in the mouth. If you were to look, you would see them slightly protrude from behind the originals.<br><br>Another version brought to my attention are the incisor fangs, which occur in the same manner as the upper canines, only that they come in where the second pair of top incisors are. There are also some claiming that there are canine's that fold up to the roof of the mouth when not in use, attracting no unwanted attention from suspicious onlookers. When ready to bite, muscle contractions pull these snake-like fangs down and out where they would protrude a little farther from the other teeth.<br><br>There are also, those who have no canines all. These individuals often use sharpened fingernails, knives, or any other tool to make wounds to draw blood from. The vampires who have no canines whatsoever are usually quite old or the child of someone quite old. My guess is that the development of vampire canines was a recent (meaning past two millenniums) development. In an unusual change, even those with sharp teeth have begun to use sharpened objects for drawing blood rather than biting. Biting often bruises and tears the flesh needlessly and would often lead to the excessive loss of blood and even infection of a person. Killing is not desirable if you are wondering the reasons for this change in method.<br></span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;">Regarding the need for blood, I must say, a vampire's bone marrow is very different from that of a humans. During the change from a human to a Created vampire, the cells in which cause the change (which I will speak more on later) collect in the kidneys during the body's attempt to flush them out of its system. When this happens, a reaction of some sort terminates all production of erythropoietin, a hormone that regulates production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Without erythropoietin, the body will produce no red blood cells. As you can see, this is not a desirable predicament to be in, for without red blood cells, one's body will suffer from anemia to oxygen deprivation to shock, and then finally die. Other factors also contribute to the lack of red blood cells.<br><br>A Created vampire in many cases doesn't eat food often enough, if they can even eat at all. To support it's body's metabolism and in an attempt to make up for this, the body will increase the number of red blood cells it destroys and use their material to feed the body. Also to make matters worse, the production of white blood cells in the bone marrow is increased, diverting much of the energy from red blood cell production. So one must seek other sources. Human blood is a the main source of red blood cells and erythropoietin, though pigs and a few various other animals would suffice. A Created vampire would often ingest blood after abstaining from food for a day or more, and when after ingested, the hormone erythropoietin would serve to restimulate red blood cell production.<br><br>Fortunately for Created vampires, chemical changes in their body allows for their metabolism to be slowed and altered to accommodate for the small amount of nutrients in the system. Where areas up to 80% of energy created in a human is lost as body heat, a vampire only loses about 60%. However the fact that many have increased activity in their lives, the production of heat is generally evened out. This accounts for the reason why the Created vampires have temperatures that are lower or higher than 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and why they are so fond of warmth and cold. Another change that helps them is the alteration of the perspiration system. The kidneys themselves are inable to remove excess fluids as quick as required, and being that a vampires diet is usually fluidic, overaccumulation is not desirable. Without a way to release it, the body would become swollen, so the perspiration system is altered so that it can absorb fluid through a process of osmosis from the blood system and release it through the sweat glands.<br><br>The following is a brief explanation of how a human is changed into a Created vampire. To be changed, all one needs to do is receive vampire blood into their circulatory system, either by undergoing a transfusion like process, or by drinking vampire blood.<br><br>The more blood you receive, the quicker the change and often drinking the blood is a much slower process. Total body transfusion will guarantee a complete change within weeks while an injection of 8 ounces may take anywhere 4 years to the rest of their lives to complete the change. Chances of never eating food like a human again if one drank a Created vampire's blood is 65% while loss of one's ability to digest if they had undergone a transfusion only results 3% of the time. Little cells of a virus like nature (simply called WVCs, white vampire cells), comprised almost entirely of vampire RNA, are within the vampire blood and when within the humans circulatory system, they fool the white blood cells into absorbing them where they integrate their RNA. As we've covered before, when the WVCs collect in the kidneys, the reaction that results is the shutdown in the production of erythropoietin, which controls the production of red blood cells within the bone marrow. Within the white blood cells, the WVCs that survive substitute the vampire RNA for the white blood cells RNA, and create more vampire RNA. This manufacturing of vampire RNA allows the WVCs to distribute it amongst all the cells within the body. Throughout a vampires whole life, the WVCs are constantly increasing in numbers and introducing its RNA to other body cells.<br><br>Unlike human's DNA, a vampire's DNA does not suffer from genetic decay, therefore aging doesn't result naturally. A result of this, as perhaps guessed, is that Created Vampires are capable of living far longer than humans. If they survive the first five years, which only 80% do, more than half of those who survive can potentially live close to 200. As stated before though, vampire DNA is broken down when it comes into contact with UV radiation, or light, and this can cause the aging of a Created vampire.<br><br>Some of the abilities of WVCs is that they are highly intolerant of infections and disease, and they can act like white blood cells when it comes to the defense of the body. One problem that arises occasionally from this high sensitivity is allergies. The body becomes highly sensitive to all foreign objects and little things like pollen and even food can trigger irritating and unneeded reactions such as red eyes, rashes, hives, breathing difficulty, and severe stomach pain (another reason why some Created vampires stop eating). Another purpose the WVCs can serve is the regeneration of the body, also known as quickened healing. This is achieved when the WVCs, aware of a collection of platelets at a wound opening, trigger the DNA within the cells surrounding the wound to revert back into a stage where cell division is unchecked and continuous.<br><br>Partial vampires are Created vampires who received a small dosage of WVCs. All throughout their lives they produce more and more WVCs yet for many, they never fully become a true Created. As much vampire as they are, most only receive slightly increased strength and partially enhanced senses. A touch of psychic ability may surface as well, and better health and longer living have been attributed to such. Many Partial vampires however are the result of accidents. A person who was feed upon may have managed to cut and mingle some of the vampires blood within their wounds, and there is much evidence that sexual fluids contain enough WVCs within them that they could change a person enough to be considered a Partial. Saliva however is still under speculation as to whether it could serve as a carrier. </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"><br></div>
