Most of my students will have a dream on the night of their Initiation to the Magickal Path, at times there may be some physical signs &amp; omens indicating certain blessings you got from Divine. At times you may not even have any dreams or signs however you notice a tangible change in you towards everything around you, you become more aware, more sensitive &amp; more at peace with yourself too that is also a form of Blessings you got. At times without expectation, you may even get more, just be complacent about it perhaps its better.<br><br>Your friend got a word "Herb" probably indicate she is more suitable for Nature Magick or Green Witchcraft. Its a sign for her from Divine to guide her in her path rather than a gift. I feel she will grow in time to come accepting her Inner Self thus creating a physical change in her External Self. Like a seedling that grow, it may not be beautiful now but one day she will bloom into a beautiful Flower where she will be admired by all.<br><br>As for you its a message &amp; sign that you are not alone, you are protected by what is hidden, when the time is right what is hidden in the darkness will be revealed. I see it has some links from your many past lives, i see a change too that will give you more strength &amp; security. You were there before may not be from this live just the darkness covered everything there. I see it more of a blessings than gift. A blessing for you revealing a hidden gift that been unlocked but you do not have it literally yet. It will take time but something with strength.<br><br>A good sleep you had in years feel great right, rejuvenating... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>My Special Magickal Blend is available for sales too upon request. I do have many blend like "Healing", "Psychic", "Love &amp; Lust", "Love Attraction", "Magus", "Prosperity" Magickal Tea. These are all hand blend, charged &amp; blessed by me for their individual purposes. The blend you all had that day is especially for my students who are going through initiation with me. Its purpose to calm, heal &amp; clear.<br><br>P.S. Sweetie, your concentration is the strongest that day during the workshop. Its already quite clear to me it seems, probably you have too much expectation so it appeared to be clouded to you. Not everyone will get gifts, some may just get blessings, signs or messages from other realms.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

I seen other psyhic readers in the past and they all mentioned that I have a protection (elderly) that was from my past.  I always thought they meant my ancesters or something.

            <div class='col-md body'>hello everyone!!!<br><br>sorry for the delay.<br><br>First and foremost, thanks to Oceanos for conducting the workshop and for letting me participate! Especially at rather short notice.  Thank you to fornight and MoonIce for participating too....<br><br>Anyway, yup. I might have seen a bit distracted on that day, but really lar, I'm the kind of person who can be quite easily distracted. when I focus I really focus though <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I will never forget the initiation.  After the white sage brush, I suddenly felt infused by an energy.... when our eyes were closed, I felt like we were in a huge white space.... like the room seemed much bigger than it was... and the noise seemed so so far away...and there seemed to be a certain energy wafting around... it was quite out of this world..<br><br>Have to say on the first night my dreams were similar to fornight though.  I too felt surrounded by a calming darkness... and I felt like I was at home there... and I might have dreamt of chakras/auras as well.... can't remember...<br><br>But the second night was the really cool night.... i dreamt of something else... then this old lady appears in front of me... she had a messy, primitive look.... short but wild white hair... a wrinkled, appearance... and she was dressed in this caveman-style clothes.... like a dress with no sleeves... only one shoulder covered... material looks coarse and like animal skin or something....and carrying a wooden staff..<br><br>She said something to me, but I could not understand....the words... but I knew to follow.... followed her to this narrow space... and then I woke up... that was this morning....can still remember it so clearly though....<br><br>oceanos told me earlier may be a lady of wisdom... can tell me more? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
