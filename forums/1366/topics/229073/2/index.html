They are very different from other Pi Xiu from other Masters as Zheng Yang Men : Master Chen Li Yang is the one who brought the Powers of Pi Xiu to the World so Zheng Yang Men is also the Original Source of Pi Xiu. You can feel the difference when you received your Zheng Yang Men : Pi Xiu which exude a special aura that Pi Xiu from other places will not have. If you are sensitive to energy or have spiritual sight you can feel or see it, if not also nevermind as you will get to see tangible results after using it.

Opens intuitive and psychic abilities. In Chinese Beliefs, Culture &amp; Feng Shui, Jade is known to have the power to bring you good luck, ward off evil spirits and keep demons away. Jade has always been prised as precious, they exude very Positive Energy or "Bao Qi", a portent of "Sheng Qi".<br><br>Jade has been adored and revered by the Chinese since time ancient times. From the down of civilization, in spite of the formidable that have fallen upon the Chinese, both sentiment toward jade and the tradition of jade artistry have endured the passage of time and remained undiminished in strength.<br><br>NEPHRITE &amp; JADEITE<br><br>Nephrite<br><br>Chemically speaking a silicate of calcium and magnesium, nephrite belongs to the amphibole group of minerals. Throughout the ages, nephrites has been frequently employed as a working material. Nephritic appears in numerous colors, snowy white, bluish white, yellowish hue, brown, gray, black, green, dark green. Commonly use in jade carving art.<br><br>Jadeite<br>A silicate of sodium and aluminum, jadeite is classed as a pyroxene. Although in class different from nephrite, jadeite shares many characteristics with it, namely a high degree of hardness and firmness, and a luster that lends an appearance of transparency. Additionally, variations is iron content result in brownish-red, dark green, or lavender hues. Presence of minute amounts of chromium yields emerald green. Commonly use in jewelry.<br><br>A  B C JADE<br><br>A, B, C Jade Type or grade A , B, C , commonly use by jade dealers to identify the different type of treatment of the jade.

Good, Authentic Jade don't come cheap, what you pay is what you get.<br><br>Every Piece of LOA Jade Pi Xiu are of A Grade Jade, all are Natural &amp; Unique, handcarved by Skilled Craftmen, none is the same, minor natural flaw in the stone is normal as there can never be a perfect flawless Jade.

He is said to have the power to assist anyone suffering from bad Feng Shui. Those having a period of bad luck should display the Pi Xiu in the home or office as the ultimate Feng Shui cure.<br><br>They are best sat on Chinese Coins or Normal Coins to signify your fortune being protected, thus making it a wealth enhancer as well. Many people prefer using Pi Xiu over Chi Lin, Dragon-head Turtle (Long Tou Gui), Three Legged Toad (Chan Chu) or Chinese Lion ( Foo Gou) because Pi Xiu does not have an anus and only eats but does not dispose.  It has a big and infinite appetite.  So, if you are looking to accumulate lots of wealth (for all businessmen, merchants and housewives out there), and if you intend to only have lots of money luck coming in (and ensure the money never be spent), Current Student who wish to have better concentration &amp; results on their Studies, Pi Xiu is what you are looking for.  Pi Xiu are also known to be very obedient to their owners as they are loyal in nature.  This year 2007 for Feng Shui Placement, you should place your Big Pi Xiu in the South East looking North West as this year the Grand Duke Jupiter (Tai Sui) position is at North West.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

A Metal Pi Xiu is good at deflecting all negativities &amp; bad luck because it exerts Strong Metal Element however it may be too sharp although it protected the owner from harm but it will deflect all negativities &amp; bad luck to the surrounding area or people. As Feng Shui Placement, If place in certain position, it will bring good to Owner but cause harm to others. In event of such placement, at times it will make the surrounding people as in your neighbours fall ill or have accident, the owner in time to come will have conflicts with surrounding people even family members. In event of wrong Feng Shui Placement, Metal Pi Xiu will cause more harm than good to owner, in minor adverse way will make owner &amp; family ill or have accidents. Metal Pi Xiu can be very sharp &amp; not so obedient. For those whose auspicious Element is Metal or those lack of Metal Element, A Metal Pi Xiu will be more beneficial than others however its dependable on the Maker or Master too.<br><br>Stone Pi Xiu is more soft yet protective, obedient, bring in good fortune &amp; prosperity, making live smooth for the owner. Stone are borned of Mother Earth which makes it a very good &amp; natural material. A Stone Pi Xiu exert Strong Earth Element &amp; the Esoteric/Magickal Properties of the stone its made off. A Jade Pi Xiu exert Strong Wood Element, Jade stone itself is very protective as it contain &amp; radiate alot of  "Bao Qi" &amp; Vital Energy "Sheng Qi", very good for Healing, these are just a few of its Natural Magickal Properties.  Jade Pi Xiu will sacrifice itself to save one from dangers which may be fatal caused by bad Feng Shui, Bad Luck or Directed Ill Intents. Jade Pi Xiu will normally dissappear mysteriously or break into pieces even though it is not hurt or spoilt in an accident, to sacrifice itself in order to save the owners life. It would also help you remove obstacles &amp; those facing great problems for a long period of time. This year 2007 is Fire Pig Year, Wood Element strengthen the Fire Element. Adding Wood to Fire, Fire will burn &amp; not be extinguished thus enhance your Luck &amp; Good Feng Shui. For those whose auspicious Element is Wood or those lack of Wood Element, A Stone Pi Xiu will be more beneficial to you than others.<br><br>As for Kai Kuang of Pi Xiu, normally most Master only Blessed &amp; Empower the eyes of the Pi Xiu thats all, so this Pi Xiu is stationary, cannot move. As for me, i will Kai Kuang the whole Pi Xiu, making it alive so it can follow the Owner or bring protection &amp;  wealth to the home. I will do a Ritual to bless &amp; empower mainly the eyes, mouth, feets, head &amp; tail of the Pi Xiu, depending on the needs, some i will do the horn &amp; wings too thus making the Pi Xiu literally alive &amp; movable.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OCEANOS:</div><div class="quote_body">A Metal Pi Xiu is good at deflecting all negativities &amp; bad luck because it exerts Strong Metal Element however it may be too sharp although it protected the owner from harm but it will deflect all negativities &amp; bad luck to the surrounding area or people.</div></blockquote>What do you mean by ''too sharp''?<br><br>It would be helpful if you could clarify...<br><blockquote><strong>As Feng Shui Placement, If place in certain position, it will bring good to Owner but cause harm to others. In event of such placement, at times it will make the surrounding people as in your neighbours fall ill or have accident, the owner in time to come will have conflicts with surrounding people even family members. In event of wrong Feng Shui Placement, Metal Pi Xiu will cause more harm than good to owner, in minor adverse way will make owner &amp; family ill or have accidents.</strong></blockquote>This doesn't only apply to metal pi xiu.<br><br>Basically, ANY fengshui objects which is placed wrongly will have adverse. The stone pixiu is also not spared. But I feel that you sound as if only metal pixiu will be liable to bad placements, stone pixiu also can be placed wrongly.<br><blockquote><strong>Metal Pi Xiu can be very sharp &amp; not so obedient.</strong></blockquote>I'm curious, how did you know the behaviour of metal pixiu??<br><br>Did you talk to it? Did you see its spirit or something? Even if it's metaphysics, people needs tests/results and not blind faith.<br><blockquote><strong>For those whose auspicious Element is Metal or those lack of Metal Element, A Metal Pi Xiu will be more beneficial than others however its dependable on the Maker or Master too.</strong></blockquote>On the contrary, it would also be helpful if you could look at the potential buyer's bazi favourable and unfavourable elements, instead of just recommending stone pixiu for everyone.<br><br>If wood is unfavourable, then don't recommend jade pixiu...etc.<br><br>Thanks for reminding us.<br><blockquote><strong>Stone Pi Xiu is more soft yet protective, obedient, bring in good fortune &amp; prosperity, making live smooth for the owner.</strong></blockquote>Again, how did you know about the pixiu's behaviour?<br><br>I find it hardly convincing.... Like in bazi, earth element day masters are known to be tough, stubborn people who can endure hardships. So, how can stone be soft and protective?<br><blockquote><strong>Stone are borned of Mother Earth which makes it a very good &amp; natural material. A Stone Pi Xiu exert Strong Earth Element &amp; the Esoteric/Magickal Properties of the stone its made off.</strong></blockquote>Isn't brass also a natural element??<br><br>Metals are also found in earth.<br><blockquote><strong>Jade Pi Xiu will normally dissappear mysteriously or break into pieces even though it is not hurt or spoilt in an accident, to sacrifice itself in order to save the owners life.</strong></blockquote>This is also one of the biggest disadvantage of stone statues - they break too easily.<br><br>As you mentioned, one stone pixiu costs $3000. If it's dropped on the floor, there goes your $3000.<br><br>Potent fengshui items need not be too expensive.<br><blockquote><strong>It would also help you remove obstacles &amp; those facing great problems for a long period of time. This year 2007 is Fire Pig Year, Wood Element strengthen the Fire Element. Adding Wood to Fire, Fire will burn &amp; not be extinguished thus enhance your Luck &amp; Good Feng Shui. For those whose auspicious Element is Wood or those lack of Wood Element, A Stone Pi Xiu will be more beneficial to you than others.</strong></blockquote>This is again, a general rule. Doesn't mean that in 2007, wood is favourable for everyone.<br><br>It would be helpful if you could examine who are the people who have wood as their unfavourable element in bazi. These are the people who should not wear jade.<br><blockquote><strong>As for Kai Kuang of Pi Xiu, normally most Master only Blessed &amp; Empower the eyes of the Pi Xiu thats all, so this Pi Xiu is stationary, cannot move. As for me, i will Kai Kuang the whole Pi Xiu, making it alive so it can follow the Owner or bring protection &amp;  wealth to the home. I will do a Ritual to bless &amp; empower mainly the eyes, mouth, feets, head &amp; tail of the Pi Xiu, depending on the needs, some i will do the horn &amp; wings too thus making the Pi Xiu literally alive &amp; movable. Thanks again.</strong></blockquote>According to the master, dotting the eyes with red ink is as good as empowering the whole statue.<br><br>I don't understand why you must empower every body part of the pixiu.<br><br>What is important, lies in the chanting/verses. Not the number of body parts you empower. For your information. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
