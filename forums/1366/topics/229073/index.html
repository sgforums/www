They are the Gate of True Sun (Zheng Yang Men) and Arrow Tower, dubbed as Qian Men (front gate), which stand on the south side of Tiananmen Square.<br><br>It stands at the south end of the Tiananmen Square precinct, and was formerly the front gate of the Imperial City, a part of the ancient city of Beijing. Originally built in 1419, the gate was the south entrance of the Beijing Ancient Inner City during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368-1911). It is the largest well-preserved city gate in Beijing.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Zheng%20Yang%20Men/beijing_zhengyangmenmap01.gif"> <span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Part of Beijing Map, ZhengYang Men is the Head of Dragon.</span></span><br><br>This Gate is built in the center of Beijing, a place of Superb, Excellent Feng Shui &amp; Energy. In Feng Shui, Beijing City is a Dragon &amp; This Gate : Zheng Yang Men is the Head of the Dragon therefore It emit the most excellent Yang Energies. Yang Energy represent Male Energy, Sun Energy &amp; Positive Energy. Zheng Yang Men is the original name of Qian Men also literally translated as "The Gate of True Sun" or "The Gate of Straight Positivity"!<br><br>This gate lies on the same north-south axis as the imperial path through the Forbidden City, and it was the route the emperor took when he went to Tiantan (The Altar of Heaven), in the outer city, to make offerings to Heavenly King (Yu Huang Da Di).<br><br>It is a double gate and the smaller south gate is closed to the public, but the north gate has a very interesting museum on the history of Old Beijing.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">Master Chen Li Yang</span></span><br><br>Today's Zheng Yang Men North Gate has become a Museum where visitors can see Beijing's old city wall, streets, markets and houses through historical photos and relics. One of the more interesting things that is has is a model of the city during Qing times. The man behind this Museum is no other than Renown Master Chen Li Yang who is a descendant of late Imperial Family, he is well known internationally as a Feng Shui Master who is also one of the few in this World who is versed in "Qi Men Dun Jia", an Ancient Mystical Art. Many Architectures Worldwide including Singapore Suntec City, Bank Of China, Taipei 101 and many more are built with regards to his consultation &amp; advices.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">The Mythical Beast Pixiu</span></span><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Zheng%20Yang%20Men/pixiubronze.jpg"><br><br>In ancient China, Pixiu was often seen guarding the Imperial Palace and burial sites of the Emperors to ward off evil spirits. Pixiu has always been regarded as an auspicious creature that possessed the divine power capable of drawing wealth from the five directions. Today, Pixiu may be placed near the main door, wealth sector or window to fend off negative energy and to boost personal luck.<br><br>The Pixiu is also known as the Tianlu (Heavenly Salary) and Bixie (Wards off Evil). It is a Magickal beast in ancient Chinese mythology with a dragon's head, a horse's body, a qilin's feet, and the overall shape of a lion. Its fur is greyish-white, and it can fly. The Pixiu is fierce and a good fighter, and likes sucking the blood or essence of demons and converting it into wealth. It is tasked with patrolling the heavens and stopping demons and diseases from causing chaos. One version of the legend identifies the Pixiu as the 9th son of the Dragon.<br><br>In ancient times, 'the Pixiu' was also used as a synonym for an army (because of its ferocity). One legend does that the Pixiu broke one of the rules of Heaven, and was punished by the Jade Emperor by restricting its food to the wealth all around the world. It could swallow wealth without ever having to defecate. This ability to gain wealth without letting it out was auspicious enough for many Chinese to use jade carvings of the Pixiu as ornaments even today.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Zheng%20Yang%20Men/tianlu.jpg"><br><br>There are two different types of Pi Xiu. The difference is with their horns. The one with two horns is known as Pi Ya (possibly a corruption from bi xie ) and the one with one horn is called Tian Lu (Pi Chen).<br><br>Â•	Tian Lu - is in charge of wealth. Displaying Tian Lu at home or in office can also assist one to avoid fast flowing out of wealth.<br>Â•	Pi Ya - wards off evil. It is also believed that Pi Ya have an ability of assisting anyone who is suffering from bad Feng Shui that is due to having offended the Grand Duke Jupiter (also called as Tai Sui).<br><br>According to Mythology &amp; Legends, Pi Xiu is the ninth offspring of the dragon. Pi Xiu craves for the smell of gold and silver and it likes to bring his master money in his mouth. Statues of this creature are often used to attract wealth in Feng Shui.<br><br><span class="large">Characteristics</span><br><br>Fierce looking and covered with whitish-grey fur, Pi Xiu has the head of a Chinese dragon, but is commonly depicted with only one antler as time passes. Ancient Chinese depictions of Pi Xiu show the male with the single antler, and the female with two antlers. As with the Chinese Phoenix, the common image today is a representation of a single sex. Pi Xiu has protruding eyes and sharp teeth. Its body resembles a Chinese lion and the legs of Pi Xiu are those of a Qi Lin. Looking at the posture of the Pi Xiu, the creature seems to project a sense of strength, elegance and mobility. Its obvious characteristics is its fat body to indicate a full stomach loaded with unlimited amounts of good fortune. Likewise it has a big mouth to gobble up money. Many people like Pi Xiu because Pi Xiu does not have a hole at its bottom so it only eats but do not dispose anything. This mean, Pi Xiu could contain a lot of good fortune and wealth luck for you and your family into your office or home and it stays within your premises and do not dispose any of the luck from your offices or home.<br><br>Its is believed that the common wingless Pi Xiu assist in seeking wealth while a winged Pi Xiu assist students in furthering their studies.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Zheng%20Yang%20Men/pixiu.jpg"><br><br><span class="large">Mythology</span><br><br>The myth of Pi Xiu tells that the creature violated a law of heaven, so the Jade Emperor punished it by restricting pixiu's diet to gold, and preventing the creature from defecating by sealing its anus. Thus, pixiu can only absorb gold, but cannot expel it. This is the origin of Pi Xiu's status as a symbol of the acquisition and preservation of wealth.<br><br>Pi Xiu is also a fierce creature. The large fangs visible in the creature's mouth are used to attack demons and evil spirits, draining their essence and converting it to wealth. Pi Xiu also guards against disease caused by these same evil spirits.<br><br>In tribute to Pi Xiu's ferocity and prowess in battle, The Pi Xiu was synonymous with the army in Ancient China.</span></strong></div>

Pardon my poor writings on Zheng Yang Men. Well if its directly from Zheng Yang Men , Pi Xiu statue Blessed &amp; Empowered (Kai Kuang) by Master Chen Li Yang personally will cost around at least S$3000 - 6000 minimum. It abit pricey but its worth it, what you pay is what you get. His students' work will be alot cheaper but why get his students' when you can get the Master's Work.<br><br>He is looking as good as ever in LV Limited Edition boots, Burberry Polo &amp; Purple CR Coat. No sign of age on his face also, thats the benefit of His Pure Yang practice. I gave him a present this time as a token of our friendship, a personal Chalcedony Eye Amulet Pendant of mine with my blessings. I simply love the energy of the place, very vibrant &amp; positive.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos  </span></strong></div>

However to those who "Fan/Chong Tai Sui", they must carry a Pi Xiu to annul the Adverse Effects created due to offending Grand Duke Jupiter (Tai Sui). Especially this New Year 2007 of "Yin" Fire Pig where accidents, conflicts &amp; natural disasters will be aplenty. Last year 2006 is Year of "Yang" Fire Dog is still not that bad, "Yin" Fire can be more devastating &amp; destructive. The Fire Element in 2007 is "Yin" Fire symbolizes a candle flame &amp; represents tension, temperamental emotions, agitations, &amp; illusions. Whilst the Yang Fire in 2006 symbolizes the sun &amp; represents openness, optimism, warmth, politeness &amp; care.  The Yin fire is candle flame, and a spark of Fire. A spark of Fire can start a Big Wild Fire that is unstoppable, destructive &amp; devastating. That is why Accidents &amp; Conflicts will be aplenty. A Pi Xiu possess the Power to avert &amp; deflect such Adverse Happenings, protect the Owner from all harms &amp; evil.
