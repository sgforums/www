We're all learners.<br><br>Learners for life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>From all your posts, you simply give a feeling that you are just trying to be learner to that master that you are quoting.  Its not only me. Most of us feel so.  Are you just trying to find faults?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cyberr1981:</div><div class="quote_body">I always believe in questioning way of learning.<br><br>Not all things in metaphysics are correct.</div></blockquote>Questioning is good but believing in this attitude does not mean you can be rude. People are also entitled to question what you learnt also.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cyberr1981:</div><div class="quote_body">I think you misunderstood me.<br><br>I' was merely conveying what my master says. He says that to empower a fengshui object, you don't hve to chant every body part.<br><br>Don't mistaken, I'm not trying to say I'm expert. I feel that he must have a reason for saying so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>Copied the way you ask oceanos....How your master know just like that can liao?  He talk to the Pixiu??  Ask the Pixius like that enough or not?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cyberr1981:</div><div class="quote_body">I've got a brass pixiu that is very shiny that it looks as if it's gold-plated.<br><br>mine has also been kai guang by another master, he used red ink to dot the eyes. before that, the pixiu's eyes were covered with a piece of cloth.<br><br>he told me that pixiu when made of metal, is the most potent than when they're made of semi-precious stone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>How your master know?  He talk to stone pixiu and then talk to metal pixiu, then compare notes?  He got use some kind of instruments to test the energy level of both? Got trial and test? How? It will be good if he can explain in detail.  The way you put it seem like everyone should use metal pixiu only, regardless whether your bazi is suitable for it or not.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It is immensely popular Feng Shui Cure due to its many advantages. Pi Xiu is the ninth son of the Heavenly Dragon and has different names depending on where it is being sighted. According to Myth &amp; Legends, Pi Yao lives in the heaven, Pi Xiu lives on earth and Pi Kan lives in the sea. All of them brings the same blessings and possess the same properties. Pi Xiu has protruding eyes and sharp teeth. Its body resembles a Chinese lion and the legs of Pi Xiu are those of a Qi Lin. Looking at the posture of the Pi Xiu, the creature seems to project a sense of strength, elegance and mobility. Its obvious characteristics is its fat body to indicate a full stomach loaded with unlimited amounts of good fortune. Likewise it has a big mouth to gobble up money. Many people prefer using Pi Xiu over Chi Lin or other Mythical Beasts because Pi Xiu does not have a hole at its bottom so it only eats but do not dispose anything. This mean, Pi Xiu could contain a lot of good fortune and wealth luck for you and your family into your office or home and it stays within your premises and do not dispose any of the luck from your offices or home. They are best shown sitting on chinese coins to signify your fortune being protected, thus making it a wealth enhancer as well. It has a big and infinite appetite. For the naturally businessmen, merchants or housewives out there, if you intend to only have lots of money luck coming in and ensure the money never be spent, Pi Xiu is what you are looking for. Pi Xiu are also known to be very obedient to their owners as they are loyal in nature. Its is believed that the common wingless Pi Xiu assist in seeking wealth while a winged Pi Xiu can also assist students in furthering their studies.<br><br>The Pi Xiu provides a minimum of six blessings as follows:<br><br>1. Ushers good luck and fortune<br>2. Generate good feng shui or earth luck<br>3. Elevating wealth and riches<br>4. Protects individuals and home<br>5. Drives away evil, obstacles and hardship<br>6. Brings windfall luck<br><br>In the olden days, Pi Xiu was devoted as guardian of homes of the emperor and high officials. Because of its capabilities to drive away evil and ushering wealth, it would benefit those earning a living in the bank, finance companies, foreign exchange markets, entertainment circle, casinos, business, betting, service industry and stock market. It brings good luck all year round.<br><br>Pi Xiu has many functions and can be placed in different locations of your premise according to your needs:<br><br>1. Place a Pi Xiu anywhere in your living room (best in the east sector and lower than eye level of the tallest family member) if you intend to renovate your existing house or move into a new home/premise to overcome obstacles and guard your family against bad feng shui due to alterations. It ensures good health to your family.<br><br>2. If you desire good fortune, protection from evil spirits, power to counteract wicked people and overcome bad luck, you may place it at your work desk, reception or important area of your living room. At the same time, a Pi Xiu could ensure authority for managers when placed in Northwest sector of your workdesk.<br><br>3. For those who travel long distance frequently, place it facing out directly at the main door (or placing one in your car) to prevent injuries, accidents and ensuring successful and fruitful journeys with good business deals. Putting a Pi Xiu in this position will also promise good fortune that enters your house being trapped in the stomach of Pi Xiu and its fierce look can ward off evil spirits. It could also identify wicked/vile people "Xiao Ren" and prevent them from harming you.<br><br>4. You may place it at the sector where the annual "Tai Sui" (Grand Duke Jupiter) resides to appease the bad influence or effects. Pi Xiu is excellent in helping people who are experiencing bad luck due to bad annual stars. In 2007, the direction of "Tai Sui" is at North West.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>
