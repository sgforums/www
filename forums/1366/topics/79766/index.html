Again i feel a need to speak up when it has reached the Limits of not only One's Tolerance but that of the Masses, All religions &amp; the Righteous Spirit of Justice!<br><br>Bruin or Bruit?

What has your cognitive process derive? To me according to my own perspective of it, Its literally a plain case of "Blasphemies &amp; Insults to all Religions &amp; Aspersion of other individuals who possess the same Human Rights as the latter". All who witness these can be your own Judge! Is the Latter An Authority to comment on One's Religions &amp; Beliefs through Insults &amp; Labelings? From the highlighted excerpts in "Red", By his words, he has greatly insulted &amp; scorned the existence of Churches, the Beliefs of Christianity &amp; that of Islamic Beliefs by Misusing the Name of Omnipresent "Allah". I hereby beseech all Christians &amp; Muslims to speak up &amp; clarify such wrongful representations of their Beliefs &amp; seek to redress such a malignant accusations &amp; Malicious Aspersion casted by the Latter! Is this the Work of a Malefic Force in making? Personally from all the issues occurring recently, i would deemed it as an "YES" because of the aplenty evidences provided by various sources &amp; the increasing numbers of victims which were unrefutable in eyes of Masses...Justice will prevail &amp; we can make this happen &amp; see the Light of Clarity by giving your views now regardless adverse or positive, need not take sides or make a stand but only your views in all conscience...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span> </strong><br></div>

It's what bear said. Everyone has their rights to what they chooses to believe in, but one should not purposely insult another's believes... Critising is one thing, calling it names is another. I'll hardly think of his refering to my believes as "new age bullcrap nonsense" (quoted in exact words) as something less than an insult. He has his right to choose to not believe, but not to put down somethings and some people  that does not agree with him. "your crystals and whatever charms may be nice... for a laugh... as a belief? it's yours... you can be spooky to the people around you who will treat you as some kinda nut... " You may feel that he had the right to express himself, i think though that it should have been a priviledge  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  and not his right to comment, as his expressing himself is aimed at demeaning others.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  The barbs contained within his words are sadly unmistakable, though much i wish that with my (not so fantastic) command of language, I had misunderstood... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You state your view, I respect that.

I'll hardly think of his refering to my believes as "new age bullcrap nonsense" (quoted in exact words) as something less than an insult. He has his right to choose to not believe, but not to put down somethings and some people  that does not agree with him.

Misunderstanding do happen &amp; occur often due to difference in understanding of words &amp; language! However somethings are true as blue, facts &amp; reality, again it has already been shown! If you think otherwise you can always choose to stay away but refrain from making insolent remarks &amp; demeaning comments to hurt others! Personally we are all peace loving beings on Earth but however sometimes circumstances are not within our control so we are forced to defend ourselves not only for us but for the sake of Masses &amp; those who have suffered in silence for a long time! All religions teaches us to be good but sometimes when "Evil" strike again &amp; again, we left with no choice but to retaliate to a certain extent! Hope everyone who see these in here, do think about it? Are we stating the facts? So who is committing sins now? I am greatly saddened by all these &amp; its not healthy! For the past months, i been keeping mum over all these &amp; act as if i have not heard such things but they simply don't repent furthermore stirring things up by provoking &amp; making other verbal insults openly, Does their actions lowered "Us" in the standing of right thinking members of society? "yes", they did. So what do you all think about it? "Forgiveness" has already setted in for a long time but they refused to take it only...What can we do? So be it...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
