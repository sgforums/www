She told me that she has a black spot in the middle of her tounge. It seems that people like her are gifted. Whatever she says will definately come true. She is able to predict 4d numbers very accurately and can also predict the fate of an  individual's next action. But her powers will only come into effect when she says it unconciously without thinking. Its like for no reason she suddenly tells somebody that this number will come out in the next draw. And it strikes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
