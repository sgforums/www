Many of us feel like we are very firmly "in our bodies", but if you are not "grounded", or 'connected' to the earth, it is hard for energy to flow fully through you. When you are "grounded", energies can flow freely through your own energy field -- and you can draw on this energy.<br><br>When you are not "grounded", the energy you are able to draw on and utilize is just your own, and of course that is limited. Being "grounded" allows unlimited energy to flow through you and this increases your ability to receive energy.<br><br>The energy you receive daily varies in frequency. When you are not Grounded, there is a limit to the what kind of energy that you can receive. When you are Grounded, you become aware of the other kinds of energy that occupy the same space that you do, but are unseen, and not even guessed at, by most people.<br><br>Grounding the way that your energy flows focuses your attention. It quiets "inner dialogue" and allows the energy to flow through the body.<br><br>When you are not Grounded, you feel scattered. Being Grounded means that you are present and living in the moment, which is very useful when doing any type of spiritual work. It includes bringing all of your thoughts and feelings into harmony and balance. It is a place of stillness.<br><br>Grounding everyday makes it easier to accomplish what you are trying to do. When you are not Grounded you might be "absent minded". Do you constantly misplace your keys, glasses, etc.? Then you are not Grounded!<br><br>When you are living in the moment, in the present, and are Grounded, the little things in life flow smoothly, and evenly. You are going with the energies of the moment and not against them. Try it and see what happens.<br><br>GROUNDING EXERCISES<br><br>It is important to practice Grounding every day, even several times a day, until it becomes easy and of a second nature.<br><br>Get yourself in a comfortable position in a chair or perhaps laying down. Take a few deep breaths and let them out slowly. Imagine light coming into the top of your head and moving down and throughout your entire body. Fill yourself with the light. After you do this, imagine a cord or roots coming out of the base of your spine and going deep into the ground, securing you to the Earth, yet allowing you freedom of movement. Let the light move into the top of your head and out of the roots or cord, almost like breathing. You might also wish see the light coming out of your feet. Grounded correctly, you will feel a solid connection with the Earth; you will notice the weight of your body against the chair, ground or whatever.<br><br>You may like to use one of the following ideas:<br><br>Use nature as a help. Go out and sit under a tree or dig in your garden.<br>Eat lightly before meditating</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Grounding your energy is essential in all forms of practice! Lying on our back against a Tree trunk &amp; Eating food can also help to ground you! A person who is not grounded may feel light headed &amp; giddy, their energy level may become low &amp; unbalance in time! Centering of energy is also essential so that your energy will not be scattered! Scattered Energy is not good as it makes one vulnerable to Negative energies in the environment &amp; psychic attack!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
