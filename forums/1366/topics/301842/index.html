Tarot Workshop is no longer available under my LOA Services untill further notice as i got no time to hold the workshop.<br><br>Marseille deck is one of the famous 3 Tarot Decks. Look simple but carry deep meanings. All Tarots are alive in their own ways Spiritually at different levels &amp; with different kinds of energy. Every Individual deck is special.<br><br>1. All Decks have different meanings at different positions not only Marseille. It posed a different meaning for different individuals who can get same card but it varies depending on the querent's issues &amp; situations, none is the same. Tarot is a psychic tool, it greatly lies with the intuition &amp; power of the reader. Readers who are only relating the basic card meanings directly from books is never accurate at all, reading would be shallow &amp; superficial.<br><br>2. Different Readers have different style of reading &amp; some might have their own kind of spread. There are different ways of shuffling the card irregardles the number of times or in whichever way the reader is comfortable with, some reader don't even allow the querent to touch their cards. Shuffling cards is to allow querent to put in their personal energy or intention regarding their issue so the cards are able to tap into it.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
