              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>I am a research student in NUS currently working on a thesis topic on local neopagans (e.g. wiccans, celtic or hellenic worshippers or those who practise the craft). I hope that adherents to the mentioned religion/ community would help me out in giving your take on how you engage with this religion. As the current academic literature on this topic is lacking in substance since most of the academic works tend to focus on the major religions, I do hope that you will help out in enlightening and educating others by telling your experience.</p>
              <p>Overall,</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The trajectory of the thesis will be
              focused primarily on the poetics of the religion (i.e. how adherents to
              neopagan religion like wiccans connects to and/or perceive their
              practices). Since this topic is rather new even to myself, I would love
              to learn more through conversing with you and other like-minded
              neopagans on the culture and the interesting experiences that you and
              others may have encountered throughout the course of your practice thus
              far.</span></p>
              <p>Also,</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I understand the sensitivity regarding
              the topic and how you may not want to get involved in
              fear of being exposed given that the religious climate in Singapore is
              predominantly conditioned under the four main religions. However, I can
              assure you that all particulars of the informants will be kept
              confidential, not even known to the professors as pseudonyms will be
              used throughout the research process (from interview to print).<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Please
              do not hesitate to enquire more on the details of my research if need
              be. </span></p>
              <p>Rgds,</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Merry Meet Edmund,</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I just got back from overseas. At this point of time, my work schedule is very packed.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I have already responded to your letter of enquiry regarding your interest in Neopagan in Singapore previously.<br> <br>As with all spiritual practices, none or very few are keen to be presented at any form of Exposure that invade their privacy. Wicca is just part of these spiritual practices globally which can be quite controversial in our local society. "Real Wiccan or Witchcraft Practicioner", none will be willing to have any form of Exposure. I am sure you will not be able to get anyone unless those young dabblers or wannabes who will not be able to provide you much information that are of validity. Firstly you got to understand such practice is not open to the masses, It is a traditional practice of secrecy.  Anyone that is initiated into a Wiccan or Witchcraft tradition they are often expected to keep certain things secret. In many Wiccan traditions the words "to ever keep secret and never reveal" forms part of their initiation vow &amp; law that preside it. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>While I appreciate your individual’s need for these information, I regret that i will not be able to provide you with any details or views. I feel that it will not be in my interests to provide you with any details or make any representations. Neither do i encourage anyone to do so.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Last but not least, I would like to thank you for your interest. Happy New Year!</strong></span></p>
