It is rare in Bangkok, Bones, Broach and Chandeliers.<br><br>Because garnet is less commonly recognized as a family of gems as opposed to a single stone, much of the modern symbolism surrounding it pertain in large to the red versions of garnet. The garnet family of semiprecious stones encompasses a variety of colors with the exception of blue. The name garnet comes from the Latin word for seed or grain: "granatus." Such a name was given to the red garnet for it's close resemblance of a pomegranate seed. The pomegranate is occasionally referenced in Greek Myth as a gift of love that is continually inviting (see mythology of garnet) garnet is still associate with and symbolic of the seeds of a pomegranate. Garnet also remains a symbolic gift of love for the eighteenth anniversary of marriage. It is also a gift for two-year anniversaries.<br><br>Garnet as a Birthstone<br>In most customs garnet is the birthstone for the month of January, namely in the Modern, Ayurvedic, Traditional, Hebrew, Roman and Arabic traditions. Additionally garnet has also been recognized as an alternative birthstone for the month of November. People who are born in January and associated with garnet often have a tendency towards being energetic (when motivated), deep down sincere, and can be devoted if they are self-driven to do so. As a birthstone, garnet is a protective and guiding gem.<br><br>Garnet and Astrological Signs (Zodiac)<br>Garnet possess characteristics that are highly coveted by particular star signs. The garnet stone is a companion, charm and alternative for various zodiac signs. Because of it's affiliation with January and the alignment of planetary figures during this time, it is also the counter part for Aquarius ( January 20 - February 18 ). For the same reason of affiliation, garnet is recognized  as a birthstone and charm for those who fall under the sign of Capricorn ( January 20 - February 18 ). It is very much a crucial stone for these two signs in Western Astrology. Garnet's relation with other zodiac signs is as a lucky charm. For Leo (July 22 - August 22), Gemini (May 21 - June 21) and Virgo (August 22 - September 22) garnet serves as a lucky charm and a object of fortunate kismet. It is also noted as a celestial gem for Scorpio (October 23 - November 21) and Aries (March 21 - April 20). Garnet is the stone ruled by Saturn and is often associated as a companion for Mars. In Hindu Astrology, garnet is reminiscent of the north node of the moon, also known as Rahu: a celestial body similar to Saturn that is also governed by Aquarius which is, in turn, presided over by Lord Shiva god of chaos and one within the trinity.<br><br>Garnet and Day, Hour and Color<br>Garnet is not associated with a specific day of the week but is symbolic of the 11:00 a.m. hour. It is important that those who are born in January or under one of the star signs mentioned above (and others) who have garnet earrings, bracelets, pendants, amulets, rings or other garnet jewelry reflect or adorn their jewelry at this hour.<br><br>Garnet and Religious Symbolism<br>Garnet is representative of the tribe of Judah, one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel.  Judah was the name of the kingdom of the south and included Jerusalem, it was ruled by descendants of king David.<br><br>Some Gemstones, gems, crystals and minerals have been believed to be a sleep aide, to have an effect on dreams, sleeping, dreaming, insomnia, sleeplessness, nightmares, foretelling, rest, resting, psychic development, consciousness and mental energy. Others have been said to work in the unconscious mind and the spiritual plane and seem to bring mental, ESP, emotional, physical, sleep transition, soothing to the spirit and can sometimes stop sleep disorders such as Sleep Apnea, snoring, tossing and turning, stress relief, energy, disturbed sleep or sleep walking.<br><br>Garnet is associated with a whole family of  gems which all contain similar physical, chemical and healing characteristics. The most popular form of garnet is found in varying shades of dark red to a dazzling reddish brown. Garnet has a very detailed history in it's healing properties and lore. It is known especially to aide with blood and circulatory ailments. It is also recognized as a great protector and a useful instrument in meditation and guidance. For these reasons garnet plays a very utile role in dreaming and sleep.<br><br>Garnet and Sleep<br>Physically, garnet is believed to help open up and purify passages connecting to the heart. The way blood is regulated and the frequency and consistence of circulatory agents are in part related to falling and maintaining sleep. It is said to also aide in the connection of our conscious mind to our unconscious (as in sleep).  It is the mediator between the thoughts journey from reality of the awaken individual to the premonitions present in dreams. Garnet has been recognized as a stone of luminescence, but it also gives light to the darkness of the undiscovered portion of daily activities. It's energetic vibrations not only protect, they also bring to the surface creativity from within.<br><br>Garnet and Dreaming<br>It has been found by healers that garnet both induces imagination and creativity but it also assists dreams to reveal past life experience. Garnet  is said also to attract love and strengthen bonds. It's protective qualities allow for the unanswered to be revealed in dreaming. Along with physically helping circulation, garnet also helps an individual circulate through their dreams and find or encounter their deepest concerns. Garnet is another stone that provides protection from nightmares but even more specifically, it protects the individual from being attacked, wounded, mugged or murdered in their dreams. It also helps to confront and dealing with that which ultimately needs to be addressed. The energetic vibrations from the earth are stored within the garnet and provide a shield of positive energy that repels negative energy. Garnet is said to also help an individual to take knowledge gained in dreams and apply it to life in a balanced and creative way. </strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This section is intended to uncover references in history to gems, gemstones, minerals, crystals, precious metals and semi-precious stones and to investigate the role they played in the development of the cultures in which they were utilized. We believe examples of royal jewelry and ancient jewelry from anthropology, sociology and archaeology from the ancient societies of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome and especially the work of Pre-Columbian American cultures of the North American Indians, Aztecs, Mayans, and Incans to be of craftsmanship that has not been equaled since. Where possible in our history of jewelry, weÂ’ve tried to include methods of manufacture, materials and technology. From the bible, commerce, celestial beliefs to modern crystal collecting.</span><br><br><img src="http://www.facetrough.com/select/Color%20Change%20Garnet/ccg2425r.jpg"><br><br>The documented use of garnet and reported findings of garnet jewelry have been evidence of the wide-spread availability and importance of this semiprecious jewel throughout history. Some of these findings of garnet use do not solely pertain to jewelry and healing crystals. In fact, in India during a rebellion on the Kashmir territory, tribal soldiers fired at the British army with garnet bullets. The effect of this type of ammunition was thought to be more fatal and more efficient for battle. In even earlier writings garnet had been mistaken for rubies and were said to fend off evil spirits. It is also noted that Crusaders adorned garnets as protection in battle and a symbol of safe return to their loved ones. Garnet has also been noted to adorn the belongings of powerful royalty. Some of these include the wives of the Russian Czars, Queen Victoria of Great Britain and Mary Queen of Scots.<br><br>Garnet and Ancient History<br>Garnet jewelry has been found that date back to the Bronze Age (~3000 BC). The majority of this ancient jewelry was a very primitive style of lapidary found among the graves of a village of lake dwellers. Other documentation of ancient jewelry containing garnet have been found among remains located in Sweden between 1100 and 2000 B.C., in Samaria around 2300 B.C. and in Egypt in 3100 B.C.<br><br>Garnet and Greek History<br>As early as the later years of 400 B.C., garnet jewelry was found in Greece. More specifically, signet rings found (in this area of Europe) were discovered. It is believed that Greeks were the first to use garnet at this capacity. Garnet has also been documented as a largely admired treasure in Greece during the 3rd and 4th centuries. The other history that Greece holds with garnet is it's role in providing the root nomenclature for the garnet family of stones.<br><br>Garnet and Egyptian History<br>As mentioned above, garnet had been found as early as 3100 B.C. in Egypt. It has further been noted that early Egypt popularly adorned garnet in amulets and talismans. Garnet was also believed to buried within the tombs of the dead for protection and light through the passage of after death experience.<br><br>Garnet in Biblical History<br>It is believed that in n the Old Testament when Noah set forth in the Ark he utilized garnet to light his path and to illuminate the Ark. The garnet is also one of the twelve stones, that represent today's birthstones, that adorn the breastplate of the high priest Aaron (Exodus 39). The original breastplate of the High Priest was said to be made by Moses in mid 1200 (B.C.) according to divinely inspired instructions he received during forty days in the wilderness. Around the middle and late 1300 (B.C.) twelve stones had been chosen to be representative of the twelve tribes of Israel. (Exodus 28: 17-21) Among these stones garnet was chosen as the gem representing the tribe of Judah one of the sons of Jacob. These two biblical references became part of the first association of a particular semi-precious gem with a particular month. Garnet is also believed to have been worn by King Solomon in times of battle.<br></span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

Documents dating from this time period state that garnets had been believed to protect one from poisons. Other sicknesses were believed to be cured by garnet including those dealing with blood and infection. Many curing huts of the Middle Ages were believed to carry garnets. Often mistaken for rubies, garnet was found among corpses found to date back to the Middle Ages.<br><br>The ancient mythology beliefs, crystal mythology, and references to crystals, minerals, metals, semi-precious stones and rocks in Greek, Roman, Native American, and Egyptian Mythology are many. There are also Mineral Legends, mining folklore, heroes in mining, myths about jewelry, stories of buried treasure, Vedic Myths, and more. We have gathered the best legends, mythological references and rock folklore in this section of JewelrySupplier.com.<br><br>The mythology and legends surrounding garnet date back as far as prehistoric times. There has been said to exist a village of "lake dwellers" around the area now known as Europe who fashioned neck ornaments from it. Garnet was also among the first semiprecious stones to be mentioned in writings ancient times. It also has a deep history with warriors and journeyers. Garnets have been known, for centuries, to contain compelling healing powers and majesty in their luminescence and adornment of  the powerful. The name garnet comes from the Latin word for grain or seed: "granatus." It took on this name for it's similarity in looks to a pomegranate seed. Pomegranate's association and symbolism with garnet has been a long standing one and has been referenced and related to in many works of literature up to and including those of Greek Mythology. Garnet has also been know to used as bullets (India rebellion of 1892) because of the belief of the severity of their effect on a victim It's rich mythical and historical background contribute to the brilliance of it's beauty.<br><br>Garnet and Greek Mythology<br>Many of the names of the various stones of the garnet family evolve from Geek nomenclature (litho-meaning stone in all of the gems ending in -lite, such as Rhodolite). This isn't the only relationship that Ancient Greece has had with relationship with garnet. The pomegranate, in very close relationship and symbol of garnet, is referenced in Greek myth. These references have given garnet some of it's legendary characteristics. The most notable reference where garnet is thought to be symbolized by a pomegranate,  involves Hades and Persephone. It is as follows: After Hades had abducted Persephone and taken her down into the underworld, Zeus, on the behalf of Demeter, commanded him to release her. Zeus sent Hermes to ensure the safety of Persephone's passage. Hermes found Persephone seated next to Hades. Upon the sight of Hermes, Persephone was elated to be released from underworld. Hades knew he must head the command of his brother and had no choice but to let her go. Hades was eager to ensure her return. Before leaving, Hades gave, as a gift to Persephone, a pomegranate. She willingly accepted it and Hades knew that once she experienced the sweetness of the ripened seeds that she would return to him. In fact Persephone did return to Hades for three months of every year forever. Persephone's return caused the winter to arrive for the three month for which she remained with Hades. The pomegranate (and garnet) is associated with eternity in many Greek Myths. Many have associated the gift of the pomegranate seeds with the gift of fine garnet gems. It's meaning has given symbolism to garnet as a gift of love's attraction, a gift of quick return or as a gift of  estranged love. This myth gave partial rise to the belief that garnet is a stone for loved ones who travel and a crystal that can heal the broken bonds between lovers.<br><br>Garnet Legends<br>Garnet has long been associated with fire and illumination for many ancient cultures. It is said to be a jewel with the capacity to illuminate the night sky. Garnet was believed to be hung in the Ark by Noah to light the path and the inside of the boat. There are many similar legends that involve garnet and it's lighting capabilities. Eastern Indians rubbed garnet on themselves in order to obtain their glowing qualities. Another legend references an elderly lady who came upon an injured bird in her path during her travels. She took the bird home with her to nurse it back to health. After it's recovery, it flew away. The lady thought she'd never see it again when it came to her house bearing for her a gift. It dropped on her lap a red colored stone which she put at her bedside. To her surprise, she awoke in the night to see it shinning as bright as a torch showing the creature's gratitude for her kindness. Garnet has also been said to light the palace of the medieval monarch of Abyssinia It continually remains a symbol today of faith, truth and light. It has been known to be buried, in jewelry form (necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, pendants and amulets) with the dead of Scandinavia to light their passage to the next life.<br><br>Garnet and Modern Myth<br>Garnet has been used by various Indian tribes to enhance the potency of fire and to heal and enlighten their people. Among these tribal groups are Mayans, Aztecs, certain African tribes, Native American and South American Indians. It has also been said that garnet has been ground up into a soft silky mass and heated to act as a medicinal remedy for fever (even yellow and other dangerous forms of fever). Many healers continue to use garnet today as a supplimental cure for nightmares, attacks, jaundice and unclean auras.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Garnet gets it's name from the Latin word "granatum" meaning seed or grain. A red seed being associated with those of a pomegranate. The color and gem quality of the different types of garnet also can vary depending on the region from which they come. These color varieties are caused by impurities of manganese, iron, calcium, and other elements. Some garnets can range in transparency and some have even been known to naturally contain within them a mineral fiber star-shaped image. Throughout history some garnets have been mistaken for rubies because of their tendency to exhibit a different shade of color when viewed from different directions under certain light conditions. Garnet is a semiprecious stone that is brilliant in jewelry but it also has played a very important role in the abrasives industry because of the graininess in a particular type of garnet (used for smoothing or grinding other things).  It has been the abrasive of choice because of it's cost efficiency, ease of clean up and ability to be recycled. Below you will find physical and chemical properties that are general to garnet and properties of the other members of the garnet family.<br><br>Physical Properties of Garnet<br>As mentioned above, garnet can range in color form the common, yet dazzling, deep reds to bright orange and lime greens. Different types of garnet include Almandite, Andradite,  Cachemirine, Grape, Grossular, Imperial, Malaya, Mandarin, Mozambique, Pyrope, Rhondolite, Spessartine and Umbalite. Garnets can be found in both igneous and metamorphosed rock which are those produced under the conditions of intense heat (such as volcanic or crystallization due to heat conducted from magma). Scientists can actually calculate the amount of heat a host rock has endured by studying the garnet from which it came. With a specific gravity between 3.5 and 4.2 and a hardness ranging from 6.5 to 7.5, garnets has held the reputation of being both utile in the abrasive industry and a brilliant gemstone. Garnet is known as being a very efficient substitute for sand and mineral slag in blast cleaning treatments. It's specific gravity and hardness contribute to the reduction of dust and material usage. Although garnet itself is more expensive than sand or slag, it's efficiency and the amount needed for treatments make a garnet blast operation less expensive, not to mention cost effective because of it's ability to be recycled and reused. Among the various types of garnet their is a range of rarity and brilliance. Varying in transparency and color saturation, the garnet family has exhibited it's magnificence in the gemstone and jewelry industry as well.<br><br>Chemical Properties of Garnet<br>Within the garnet family there is a complex variety of different compounds and elements such as silica, aluminum, calcium, iron and magnesium. The chemical symbol for garnet is also a little complex: [Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn]3  [Al, Fe, Mn, Cr, Ti,V]2  [SiO4]3. Garnets can possess any variety of the metals listed in the first bracket (that give up 2 electrons) in conjunction with those of the second bracket (that give up 3 electrons), while the third (silicate) bracket remains constant throughout. This mixing and matching of elements is what gives the garnet it's rainbow of coloration (a rainbow without blue, that is). The bonds formed between these different types are the cause of it's various hardness. Garnets have been found to crystallize in the isometric system in octahedrons (eight faced axes), dodecahedrons (twelve faced axes),  trapezohedrons (twenty four faced axes) and even hexoctahedrons (forty eight faced axes). </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

The year's first flower.</span><br><br><img src="http://www.mawddwy.freeserve.co.uk/flowers/a30123.jpg"><br><br>If you ever ask which flower is most commonly associated with the beginning of the year, the answer is almost always the snowdrop. With plant knowledge becoming increasingly popular, it is fashionable to condemn ubiquitous and simple flowers, like the snowdrop, while quoting a preference for a more unusual plant. There=s nothing wrong with this is if it an expression of true feeling, but if it is merely a thoughtless, regurgitated, statement for the sake of fashion, effect and elitism, as recently encouraged by some particularly irksome, television gardening programs, then I think it is time to review the origins of those opinions. At the risk of causing controversy, I have plans to elaborate on this subject in a future article. Other plants offer earlier floral tributes than the snowdrop, but its endearing simplicity and long standing position in our minds as the first sign of increased day length and the winter=s demise is a tradition which is hard to break.<br><br><img src="http://www.southernexposure.com/Merchant2/graphics/OHG/Galanthus%20elwesii%20revised%202002.jpg"><br><br>Snowdrops and other bulbs have a common denominator; they possess the ability to overcome periods when conditions are hostile and can select the most opportune time for growth. Because they survive and grow so well in diverse climates, appearing then disappearing, it is no wonder that bulbs have become respected and have entered into the lore of man. From a biological point of view, a bulb is nothing more than a food storage organ - a large bud consisting of a small stem with numerous modified leaves attached to it. The leaves contain thickened bases where the food is stored and the roots arise from the bottom of the stem.<br><br>Earliest records show that snowdrops were originally catalogued as a type of violet; a bulbous white violet. The snowdrop=s present botanical and generic name of Galanthus derives from two Greek words translating as &gt;milk= and &gt;flower=.Snowdrops also had a historical association with purity and their flowers were described in poetry of classical Rome from the first century AD as being similar to Astars brought down from heaven@.<br><br><img src="http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_SM/0014-0302-2703-4827_SM.jpg"><br><br>The common snowdrop, Galanthus nivalis, was known for centuries throughout Europe, but when soldiers returning from the Crimean War in the 1850s brought back bulbs of G. plicatus, a desire was created amongst plant enthusiasts to find more new varieties. It soon became the most fashionable plant among Victorian plant hunters with Turkey becoming one of the main areas to be searched. Today, the craze for snowdrops continues with collectors and enthusiasts still hoping to produce new hybrids, or find new forms in a forgotten corner of a derelict garden.<br><br>There are specialist bulb companies who offer a wide range of snowdrops, but it is important to ensure that they offer cultivated stock as opposed to wild collected bulbs. In common with other items which have become collectible, snowdrop mania has, at times, tempted less scrupulous traders. At the expense of the native flora, vast quantities of snowdrop bulbs can be imported from countries such as Turkey and then sold very cheaply. We-re all keen on a bargain, but at what expense?</span></strong></div>

By now the fat reserves, which have been built-up during the summer and autumn will be lowering, leaving less insulation against the cold and creating a higher demand for food to keep the animal warm.<br><br>The cold weather has killed, or driven many of the animals such as insects and worms into hibernation or down deep into the soil where it is warmer than the frosty surface. The activity of Squirrels is greatly reduced (they do not hibernate). The Hedgehogs are now deep in hibernation under logs, trees, outside sheds etc. Badger cubs are born in January/February but are not seen until March. Pipistrelle Bats are in hibernation. Common Frogs are also in hibernation in the water or on land. Due to the cold freshwater temperature the activity of fish and invertebrates are greatly reduced. In very cold weather many species of fish would tend to congregate in the deeper areas of slow moving water where it is warmer, and less energy is needed to stay in the same position.<br><br>January is a very quiet month with regard to plants. Many seeds are lying dormant waiting for winter to pass. The deciduous trees are without their leaves. However some small Beech and Oaks keep their brown and dry leaves. Catkins begin appearing on Hazel . Holly and Mistletoe berries are still seen. Flowers such as Snow drops, Winter Heliotrope, Persian Speedwell, begin appearing during the month of January.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

The answer I would propose is simple; just treat it the same way you treat 4th of July (or for those readers outside of the US -- substitute an appropriate national holiday).  Solitary Practitioners simply don't need to ruffle other peoples feathers by denouncing conventional holidays.<br><br>According to the Green Rose Tradition New Year's day is November 1st.  If you follow a Norse tradition rather than the Celtic you would celebrate New Year's at the Winter Solstice.  Modern day Wicca has taken the four Norse holidays (equinoxes and Solstices) and conjoined them with the traditional Celtic (the four fire festivals of Samhain, Imbolc, Beltaine, Lughnasad).    </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
