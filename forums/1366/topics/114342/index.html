You won't spare your efforts to consolidate your present love relation. Possibility of beautiful reunions with friends. Take precautions for avoiding a robbery or a burglary. You'll enjoy much energy; nevertheless, try not to squander it, especially by flying into big angers; try to preserve your serenity, do yoga or meditation every day.</div>

You won't be spared pecuniary or family problems; show common sense. Don't overstep your limits for you won't be immune to overwork. You'll have good ideas and it will be necessary to put them immediately into practice. No question to withdraw into your shell: you'll take audacious initiatives and you'll lead an active social life; however, it will be necessary to avoid trusting everybody too easily.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tiger<br><br>You won't be afraid to solicit the support of influential persons in order to promote your projects. On the amorous plane, you'll have enough courage to make this declaration which has been waited for since a long time. Try to limit yourself to the strictly indispensable spendings and to renounce all the rest. You'll be in very good physical shape. Family concerns may disturb you: you'll have difficulty dialoguing with your children; by reaction, you'll lock yourself up in reproving silence, but this unfortunately won't be a good solution!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbit<br><br>You'll probably have original, unusual ideas in more than one field; hurry to exploit them. In your work, don't hesitate to take some audacious initiatives. Risk of insomnia: go without stimulants and eat lightly in the evening. It will be necessary to establish a tailor-cut budget and adhere to it at all costs. The stars will help you solve your small difficulties on the affective plane; the misunderstandings between you and your partner will be rapidly dispelled, and your amorous sky will become sunny again.<br></div>

You won't spare your efforts to consolidate your present love relation. Possibility of beautiful reunions with friends. Take precautions for avoiding a robbery or a burglary. You'll enjoy much energy; nevertheless, try not to squander it, especially by flying into big angers; try to preserve your serenity, do yoga or meditation every day.<br><br></div>
