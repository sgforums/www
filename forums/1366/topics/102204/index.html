Rather, youÂ’re probably quite gregarious, impulsive, fun loving and expressive. You may have a hard time making up your mind -- Vanillas are known for never saying no, even when they probably should. Vanilla types also tend to take a romantic, hopeful view of life.

In fact, it may be hard for a no-nonsense Butter Pecan type like you to express yourself at all, even though youÂ’re privately quite sympathetic and observant. No doubt you like to plan ahead and take charge, which means you're often over-committed.

No doubt you have a devoted circle of friends who rely on you for the right answer to any moral dilemma. Like Chocolate Chip types, you tend to set high standards for yourself, but you are also somewhat shy and reserved. And you don't like to admit it, but you're also a tad pessimistic. Maybe you're just disappointed that no one can seem to live up to your own sense of responsibility and forthrightness. When it comes to romance and relationships, Strawberry types do well with optimistic, outgoing Chocolate Chips.

No doubt you've got a competitive streak a mile wide. The good news is that it brings out the best in you by forcing you to live up to your own demanding standards. Still, you can be rather unforgiving at times with those who don't share your vision and drive. Friends value your magnetism, charm and originality. When it comes to romance and relationships, Chocolate Chips are best off with high-achieving Butter Pecans and empathetic, insightful Chocolates. Fun fact: Chocolate chip ice cream lovers tend to also indulge in other Â“chunkyÂ” flavors, such as Cookie Dough, Mint Chip and Rocky Road.<br><br>You scored 0% Chocolate<br>If you're a Chocolate ice cream type, you are flirtatious, charming and even a little dramatic. No doubt you're an intuitive and sensitive person who puts a high value on family, relationships and romance.

Still, your liveliness and your trusting nature have earned you many admirers and friends.
