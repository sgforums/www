            <div class='col-md body'>i am like the cloud, free and easy, living life in my own pace, flowing along with the wind, pissing on people and striking em dead when i have sex. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><blockquote> ◎Your life is represented by the cloud of freedom, so you enjoy your unrestricted life very much. You are somewhat of a perfectionist, and like kind and committed people. You are talented, outstanding, and enjoy literature, art, and other broad interests. However, execution ability is something you need to focus on. ◎<br><br>Your characteristics, subconscious, and behavior modes, according to your fate and destiny, are represented by the cloud. You are born seeking perfection and have an interest in literature and many other things. You are talented and learn well; you have a quick reaction, sharp observation, and good analysis and communication skills. You like to find out the facts and reasons behind everything, and have unique analysis and judgement, but lack execution and action abilities. The cloud floats around from one place to another along with the wind, so your way of thinking is very active and creative because there are many things you want to do. The shape and appearance of the cloud is ever changeable, therefore you can adapt to a new environment with a different status and role. Regardless of how bad the situation can be, you gradually adapt and then eventually change the environment. You adjust quickly, but give the impression that you are not sincere with your words because you always say different things to please different people. The cloud flows continuously, hardly slows down, so you have a strong ability to think and plan, but less ability to take action. You have many expectations in life and the ability to improve, but hardly take the necessary actions. You like gentle and kind persons, dislike hypocrites, and admire those who are mature, responsible, trustworthy and keep their words. In your entire life, regardless of the flow or direction, you are always able to keep an innocent, true heart to overcome all kinds of difficulties.<br><br>◎Health Analysis: The function of your nephridium water system is weaker.◎<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, the function of your nephridium water system is weaker. Your physical strength is not as good as others, and you always feel tired and have cold hands and feet in the winter. You have had no major problems when you were young, but over age 40, additional care of your nephridium water system is needed, or it may easily lead to blood pressure, anemia and heart problems, or even insomnia, accidie, cranial nerve anemic, hearing problems, kidney problems, urocystitis, urethrits, heart and blood vessel problems. Therefore, you should avoid fatigue, maintain a stable and regular lifestyle and schedule, and sleep and wake early in order to protect a congenitally weaker nephridium water system system. Also avoid iced and cold drinks and reduce the frequency of sexual activities in order to maintain good vitality.<br><br>There's a saying that all disease starts from the mouth, which means many human diseases are related to food. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, food can be divided into gold, wood, water, fire and earth (concept of the five elements). You seem to prefer the salty flavors, especially in seasonings, which means your cells are filled with too much water element. This negatively affects your health, fortune and career, so we suggest you try different foods to balance your diet and nutrition, which leads to harmony in life and a balance of yin and yang based on the five elements. In addition, if you have recently felt unlucky or things were not going smoothly, then you are probably affected by bad spirit, which caused bad luck. The best solution is not to eat meat and fish for a period of time until the bad spirit goes away. The bad spirit tends to stay with those who eat meat and fish, and also chicken, duck, green onion, garlic, leek and other spices, so a vegetarian diet can help change your luck.<br><br>◎Health Analysis: Your cardiovascular function is weaker as well.◎<br><br>your cardiovascular function is weaker as well, which caused minor problems like pimples, mouth and tongue sores when you were young. But over age 40, your cardiovascular function requires additional care, or you might have major problems such as blood pressure problems, hem sterone problems, unusual heart rhythm, eye pressure problems, and other abnormal functions leading to heart diseases, stroke, or loss of vision. Therefore, it's very important for you to maintain a stable schedule for your life, avoid fatigue, and, most importantly, do not to stay up overnight. If possible, have a blood test and electrocardiogram periodically and pay more attention if there's any family history of hereditary palatine canal system and cardio diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, apoplexy, cerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, etc. Try to eliminate iced and cold drinks in order to avoid losing your vitality.<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, your spirit and the physical strength tend to be weaker than others with less energy. Your friends can often play, dance, or study all night without any sleep, but only one night without sleep makes you extremely tired and weak. You don't like running or outdoor activities, have poor sleep quality, and tend to be more emotional and sentimental.<br><br>If you want to change your destiny and fate, you better sleep before 23:00, and five minutes of sun every morning, but avoid the strong sunlight between 12:00~15:00. You will sense a major change and difference if you are persistent. If you are able to develop the good habit of sleeping and waking up early, it will completely change your fate and destiny with better health, more wealth and happiness coming into your life.<br><br>◎You and your love interest are mutually attracted and love each other equally. She fully respects you in every way, so you will get along very well. Your love is full of romance, so to be your companion is to be blessed with love and happiness.◎<br><br>In romance, according to our analysis, you are easily attracted to someone you admire in your heart, but you often end up empty-handed because it's quite difficult for both parties to fall in love at first sight. Generally speaking, women do not have deep first impression of you, so they need time to discover your inner beauty. You, however, tend to like a person at the first sight, but not after a period of time. Therefore, if you are still waiting for a good romance, try to show your inner beauty by doing more activities, establishing better habits, and socializing with more people. This way you can express your inner beauty naturally all the time, which makes your romance go more smoothly.<br><br>In the journey of life, your romantic or marriage partner might be introduced by relatives and friends, or through matchmaking. You tend to be inexperienced in love, unable to express yourself, and do not know how to actively pursue someone without being too sticky or giving up easily. You have opportunities but are afraid to get hurt, so eventually it is not easy for you to have the spark of love. If you are still seeking your love partner don't rush because someone nearby likes you, so as long as you pursue the relationship sincerely, the happiness is yours.<br><br>◎Career and Wealth Analysis: You know how to make money, but it is not easy for you to hold onto your money.◎<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, you know how to make money, but it is not easy for you to hold onto your money. Your life is more philosophical, so you are not stingy with yourself, family or friends. You spend what you have even when you are financially tight, and are generous when you are financially comfortable. Because of this, it's not easy for you to save your money. In addition, you maybe convinced easily by friends to make some financial investments that cause you to lose money. You like to make many friends, so you easily lose money if you cannot evaluate risk or reject people when they approach you for investment. You will spend most of your wealth doing things you want to do throughout life because you consider only money spent as the wealth actually owned by you. Afterwards, you will not bequest much to your descendants.</blockquote></div>

You like wise and trustworthy people. You are smart, enthusiastic, well-behaved and a quick learner, however your enthusiasm usually doesn't last long.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>Your characteristics, subconscious, and behavior modes, according to your fate and destiny, are represented by the stars. There are many stars in the sky, but not as bright as the sun and moon, so you do not like to show off. You do not like to make decisions and often wait for the opportunities to come to you.<br><br>You are born intelligent and clever, but cannot quite stick to what you do. You have short-lived enthusiasm, are interested in many things, but lack the determination and perseverance to carry it through. In addition, you show a very strong and obvious reaction between love and hate, and willing to sacrifice for one and totally block out the other. You like mature and dependable persons, dislike frivolous behavior, and admire people with artistic talent and those who can enrich your spirit.<br><br>Your entire life is like the stars, stable, secure, and without uncertainties. You are most afraid to be covered by the dark cloud that reflects the down time of your life, during which you may be unappreciated, unaccepted, and face many unexpected obstacles. Although very painful, as long as you face these challenges, learn from others and do not complain or blame others, you will learn and grow, and then become the brightest star in the sky.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Health Analysis: The function of your nephridium water system is weaker. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>According to your destiny analysis, the function of your nephridium water system is weaker.

You don't easily like a person at first sight, but more likely to love them after a period of time. Your romantic interest may easily like you at first sight, but may decide to leave you after a period of time because they do not want to be second priority in your life.

Then true romance will come your way.<br><br>In the journey of life, your romantic or marriage partner is not easily found by love at first sight. You need to spend time together and interact in a neutral setting before the possibility of love. The relationship might start from working together, and time spent together planning or meeting regularly. You tend to concentrate and focus on career and work, so you may marry later in life. If you are still seeking your love partner, among those around you, someone who has a deep understanding and strong ability might be the one.

For example, manager, general manager, high level management, plant manager, government or legal official, auditor, investigator, soldier, police officer, non-profit organization volunteer, etc. These types of jobs might not have the same professional training required for the corporate world, but will offer personal growth and teamwork challenges. If you choose these types of jobs, then your work will go smoothly, but you may lack the professional training for an executive position in the future. You should further strengthen your professional training because you have good management skills, but might not understand technical staff well enough or have a strong foundation for important decision-making. Jobs in other fields that require creativity or working independently are not suitable for you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Wealth Analysis: You know how to make and save money, so you are seldom short of cash. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>According to your destiny analysis, you know how to make and save money, so you are seldom short of cash. You knew the importance of the money since you were very young, so you started working earlier than others. Therefore, you were making money with investments while others were spending money and enjoying their lives. In addition, you were born very clever, and will not spend money if unnecessary, but when it comes to business investment, you are not stingy because you always wanted to be your own boss. You will be investing most of your wealth to establish your business. Afterwards, you will not bequest much to your descendants, instead you will donate money to a charity or hospital because you think your descendants gain wealth by working hard on their own.<br></div>
