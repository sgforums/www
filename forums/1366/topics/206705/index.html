            <div class='col-md body'>Hi oceanos, yea thx! I thought it was only available in chinese, yea so thx.<br><br>Heres mine.<br><br>Â�Â�Your life is represented by the grand castle with a devoted spirit, so you like to help others without asking for anything in return. You keep your word and you like kind and determined people. You look like an easy-going person but you are actually quite determined. It's hard to tell what's on your mind and you tend to keep a low profile.Â�Â�<br><br>Your characteristics, subconscious, and behavior modes, according to your fate and destiny, are represented by the castle. You will naturally protect yourself, but can accept others. You are amiable and smart, but a bit dull.<br><br>You understand things clearly, but tend to keep your viewpoint inside your heart. Although a castle is impressive and imposing it also seems unchangeable. People will neglect your contribution until you leave your original position or give your feedback, only then will they discover your importance. You have your own viewpoint, but are willing to cooperate with others and give them the stage and opportunity to perform. A castle is has defense function, so you are more defensive and others are unable to enter your inner world.<br><br>Your appearance is very amiable, but you are very rigid in your heart and will persist and not give up. You admire people who are heroic, dominating and a bit arrogant, but also respect those who are unselfish and lenient with others. Your entire life is like a solid castle, devoted society, never asking for any payback, and being supportive of others. You will have many good friends in the down times of your life.<br><br>Â�Â�Health Analysis: The function of your stomach and intestines is weaker.Â�Â�<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, the function of your stomach and intestines is weaker, which caused minor problems like bad breath, upset or bloated stomach, and diarrhea when you were young. But over age 40, additional care of your stomach and intestines is needed, or it may lead to major digestive system problems such as esophagus infection, stomach or intestinal infection, gastric ulcer, hemorrhoids, intestines polyp, diabetes. Therefore, you should avoid fatigue and stress, maintain a stable lifestyle and schedule, sleep and wake early, eat regular meals at regular hours, don't drink alcohol, and consume less acidic food and drink in order to protect a congenitally weak digestive system.<br><br>There's a saying that all disease starts from the mouth, which means many human diseases are related to food. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, food can be divided into gold, wood, water, fire and earth (concept of the five elements). You seem to prefer the sweet flavors of desserts and other sweets, which means your cells are filled with too much earth element. This negatively affects your health, fortune and career, so we suggest you try different foods to balance your diet and nutrition, which leads to harmony in life and a balance of yin and yang based on the five elements. In addition, if you have recently felt unlucky or things were not going smoothly, then you are probably affected by bad spirit, which caused bad luck. The best solution is not to eat meat and fish for a period of time until the bad spirit goes away. The bad spirit tends to stay with those who eat meat and fish, and also chicken, duck, green onion, garlic, leek and other spices, so a vegetarian diet can help change your luck.<br><br>Â�Â�Health Analysis: Your liver and gall is weaker as well.Â�Â�<br><br>Your liver and gall is weaker as well, so you tend to tire easily and can't do labor-intensive jobs. You may have had irritability and acne when you were young. But over age 40, your liver and gall require additional care, or you may have problems such as cholesterol and triglyceride, abnormal liver, liver or gall deceases, or even suffer a delining immune system, which leads to failing eyesight. Therefore, it's very important for you to pay attention to your liver and gall and maintain a stable schedule for your life. Monitor your glycerin level, consume less alcohol, avoid fatigue, and most importantly, do not to stay up overnight.<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, you are a night owl as you seem to be more energetic and inspired at night, so you tend to sleep late and get up late. However, sleeping and waking up early is extremely helpful to your fate and destiny, even though it's not easy for you. You don't easily offend others as you don't like to be the one on top. You better stay away from alcohol if you want to change your fate and destiny, as it drains your energy quickly and negatively affects your fortune. If you are able to develop the good habit of sleeping and waking up early, it will completely change your fate and destiny with better health, more wealth and happiness coming into your life.<br><br>Â�Â�The way you get along with your girlfriend or wife is more like friends in an equal position looking for a mutual balance. You have your own territory, friends, and also insist on your own opinions, so some disputes and disagreements are unavoidable.Â�Â�<br><br>In romance, according to our analysis, you are easily attracted to someone you admire in your heart, but you often end up empty-handed because it's quite difficult for both parties to fall in love at first sight. Generally speaking, women do not have deep first impression of you, so they need time to discover your inner beauty. You, however, tend to like a person at the first sight, but not after a period of time. Therefore, if you are still waiting for a good romance, try to show your inner beauty by doing more activities, establishing better habits, and socializing with more people. This way you can express your inner beauty naturally all the time, which makes your romance go more smoothly.<br><br>In the journey of life, your romantic or marriage partner might be introduced by relatives and friends, or through matchmaking. You tend to be inexperienced in love, unable to express yourself, and do not know how to actively pursue someone without being too sticky or giving up easily. You have opportunities but are afraid to get hurt, so eventually it is not easy for you to have the spark of love. If you are still seeking your love partner don't rush because someone nearby likes you, so as long as you pursue the relationship sincerely, the happiness is yours.<br><br>Â�Â�Career and Wealth Analysis: You know how to make money, but it is not easy for you to hold onto your money.Â�Â�<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, you know how to make money, but it is not easy for you to hold onto your money. Your life is more philosophical, so you are not stingy with yourself, family or friends. You spend what you have even when you are financially tight, and are generous when you are financially comfortable. Because of this, it's not easy for you to save your money. In addition, you maybe convinced easily by friends to make some financial investments that cause you to lose money. You like to make many friends, so you easily lose money if you cannot evaluate risk or reject people when they approach you for investment. You will spend most of your wealth doing things you want to do throughout life because you consider only money spent as the wealth actually owned by you. Afterwards, you will not bequest much to your descendants.<br><br>hmm....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â�Â�Your life is represented by the sword of power, which means you will head for success after gone through many difficulties in your youth. You are a person of leadership and justice, quite devoted, and able to work under great pressure. You are also very generous and you like well-behaved and wise people. With your leadership ability, you can break through any dissatisfying situation. Â�Â�<br><br>Your characteristics, subconscious, and behavior modes, according to your fate and destiny, are represented by the sword. You are a bit bossy and dominating, but have leadership ability.<br><br>You are capable and talented, with a great sense of justice and righteousness, and willing to help others for the sake of justice. Like a sword, you are able to cut through a difficult or unsatisfactory situation and eventually change your fate and destiny. You may hurt yourself carelessly with a double-edged sword if you are too aggressive and pressuring people around you. You may be dominating with your appearance, but have a loving heart to protect the weak with a sense of justice and fairness.<br><br>However, a good sword needs to be molded and sharpened, so those that cannot pass the test and process only become scrap iron. Being determined and unafraid of the challenges, not blaming others, and learning and growing are the essential elements to become a respected leader. You like intelligent people with artistic talent and dislike hypocrites. You admire those who are willing to sacrifice and dedicate themselves to others with a sense of justice. As long as you pass the challenge and test, your entire life will be unaffected by any storm or blocked by any obstacle to become a winner.<br><br>Â�Â�Health Analysis: Your cardiovascular function is weaker.Â�Â�<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, your cardiovascular function is weaker, which caused minor problems like pimples, mouth and tongue sores when you were young. But over age 40, your cardiovascular function requires additional care, or you might have major problems such as high blood pressure, high hem sterone, unusual heart rhythm, eye pressure problems, and other abnormal functions leading to heart diseases, stroke, or loss of vision. Therefore, it's very important for you to maintain a stable schedule in your life, avoid fatigue, and, most importantly, do not to stay up overnight. If possible, have a blood test and electrocardiogram periodically and pay more attention if there's any family history of hereditary palatine canal system and cardio diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, apoplexy, cerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, etc. Try to eliminate iced and cold drinks in order to avoid losing your vitality.<br><br>There's a saying that all disease starts from the mouth, which means many human diseases are related to food. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, food can be divided into gold, wood, water, fire and earth (concept of the five elements). You seem to prefer bitter flavors like black coffee and chocolate, which means your cells are filled with too much fire element. This negatively affects your health, fortune and career, so we suggest you try different foods to balance your diet and nutrition, which leads to harmony in life and a balance of yin and yang based on the five elements. In addition, if you have recently felt unlucky or things were not going smoothly, then you are probably affected by bad spirit, which caused bad luck. The best solution is not to eat meat and fish for a period of time until the bad spirit goes away. The bad spirit tends to stay with those who eat meat and fish, and also chicken, duck, green onion, garlic, leek and other spices, so a vegetarian diet can help change your luck.<br><br>Â�Â�Health Analysis: Your liver and gall is weaker as well.Â�Â�<br><br>Your liver and gall is weaker as well, so you tend to tire easily and can't do labor-intensive jobs. You may have had irritability and acne when you were young. But over age 40, your liver and gall require additional care, or you may have problems such as cholesterol and triglyceride, abnormal liver, liver or gall deceases, or even suffer a delining immune system, which leads to failing eyesight. Therefore, it's very important for you to pay attention to your liver and gall and maintain a stable schedule for your life. Monitor your glycerin level, consume less alcohol, avoid fatigue, and most importantly, do not to stay up overnight.<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, you are a night owl as you seem to be more energetic and inspired at night, so you tend to sleep late and get up late. However, sleeping and waking up early is extremely helpful to your fate and destiny, even though it's not easy for you. You don't easily offend others as you don't like to be the one on top. You better stay away from alcohol if you want to change your fate and destiny, as it drains your energy quickly and negatively affects your fortune. If you are able to develop the good habit of sleeping and waking up early, it will completely change your fate and destiny with better health, more wealth and happiness coming into your life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â�Â�There is a background difference between you and your love partner, so it's not easy for her to really understand you. The things you care about she might think totally unimportant and vice versa, so you tend disagree easily over small things.Â�Â�<br><br>In romance, according to our analysis, you are not easily attracted to anyone because you need to spend some time together before you can love someone. Generally speaking, you make a good first impression, especially you seem progressive and have outstanding ability. But after going out for a period of time, you transfer your passion to work, and your romance starts to cool down. You don't easily like a person at first sight, but more likely to love them after a period of time. Your romantic interest may easily like you at first sight, but may decide to leave you after a period of time because they do not want to be second priority in your life. Therefore, if you are still waiting for a good romance, try to conceal your outer beauty in order to find more sincere and suitable lovers who aren't just attracted to your looks. Then true romance will come your way.<br><br>In the journey of life, your romantic or marriage partner is not easily found by love at first sight. You need to spend time together and interact in a neutral setting before the possibility of love. The relationship might start from working together, and time spent together planning or meeting regularly. You tend to concentrate and focus on career and work, so you may marry later in life. If you are still seeking your love partner, among those around you, someone who has a deep understanding and strong ability might be the one. As long as you pursue the relationship with a sincere heart, happiness is right beside you.<br><br>Â�Â�Career Analysis: Most of your jobs, in any industry, require some leadership and management skills, teamwork.Â�Â�<br><br>Most of your jobs, in any industry, require some leadership and management skills, teamwork; your career may also involve non-profit government organizations. For example, manager, general manager, high level management, plant manager, government or legal official, auditor, investigator, soldier, police officer, non-profit organization volunteer, etc. These types of jobs might not have the same professional training required for the corporate world, but will offer personal growth and teamwork challenges. If you choose these types of jobs, then your work will go smoothly, but you may lack the professional training for an executive position in the future. You should further strengthen your professional training because you have good management skills, but might not understand technical staff well enough or have a strong foundation for important decision-making. Jobs in other fields that require creativity or working independently are not suitable for you.<br><br>Â�Â�Wealth Analysis: You know how to make and save money, so you are seldom short of cash.Â�Â�<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, you know how to make and save money, so you are seldom short of cash. You knew the importance of the money since you were very young, so you started working earlier than others. Therefore, you were making money with investments while others were spending money and enjoying their lives. In addition, you were born very clever, and will not spend money if unnecessary, but when it comes to business investment, you are not stingy because you always wanted to be your own boss. You will be investing most of your wealth to establish your business. Afterwards, you will not bequest much to your descendants, instead you will donate money to a charity or hospital because you think your descendants gain wealth by working hard on their own.<br><br>Split into 2, as it was too long.

            <div class='col-md body'>Your life is represented by the stars of power and always the focus of attention, but people think you are sometimes unapproachable. You like wise and trustworthy people. You are smart, enthusiastic, well-behaved and a quick learner, however your enthusiasm usually doesn't last long. ◎<br><br>Your characteristics, subconscious, and behavior modes, according to your fate and destiny, are represented by the stars, not only delicate, yet with femininity. There are many stars in the sky, but not as bright as the sun and moon, so you do not like to show off. You do not like to make decisions and often wait for the opportunities to come to you.<br><br>You are born intelligent and clever, but cannot quite stick to what you do. You have short-lived enthusiasm, are interested in many things, but lack the determination and perseverance to carry it through. In addition, you show a very strong and obvious reaction between love and hate, and willing to sacrifice for one and totally block out the other. You like mature and dependable persons, dislike frivolous behavior, and admire people with artistic talent and those who can enrich your spirit.<br><br>Your entire life is like the stars, stable, secure, and without uncertainties. You are most afraid to be covered by the dark cloud that reflects the down time of your life, during which you may be unappreciated, unaccepted, and face many unexpected obstacles. Although very painful, as long as you face these challenges, learn from others and do not complain or blame others, you will learn and grow, and then become the brightest star in the sky.<br><br>◎Health Analysis: The function of your stomach and intestines is weaker.◎<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, the function of your stomach and intestines is weaker, which caused minor problems like bad breath, upset or bloated stomach, and diarrhea when you were young. But over age 40, additional care of your stomach and intestines is needed, or it may lead to major digestive system problems such as esophagus infection, stomach or intestinal infection, gastric ulcer, hemorrhoids, intestines polyp, diabetes. Therefore, you should avoid fatigue and stress, maintain a stable lifestyle and schedule, sleep and wake early, eat regular meals at regular hours, don't drink alcohol, and consume less acidic food and drink in order to protect a congenitally weak digestive system.<br><br>There's a saying that all disease starts from the mouth, which means many human diseases are related to food. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, food can be divided into gold, wood, water, fire and earth (concept of the five elements). You seem to prefer the sweet flavors of desserts and other sweets, which means your cells are filled with too much earth element. This negatively affects your health, fortune and career, so we suggest you try different foods to balance your diet and nutrition, which leads to harmony in life and a balance of yin and yang based on the five elements. In addition, if you have recently felt unlucky or things were not going smoothly, then you are probably affected by bad spirit, which caused bad luck. The best solution is not to eat meat and fish for a period of time until the bad spirit goes away. The bad spirit tends to stay with those who eat meat and fish, and also chicken, duck, green onion, garlic, leek and other spices, so a vegetarian diet can help change your luck.<br><br>◎Health Analysis: The function of your nephridium water system is weaker as well.◎<br><br>The function of your nephridium water system is weaker as well. Your physical strength is not as good as others, and you always feel tired. You have had no major problems when you were young, but over age 40, additional care of your nephridium water system is needed, or it may lead to blood pressure, anemia, heart problems and unsmooth periods, or even insomnia, accidie, cranial nerve anemic, hearing problems, kidney problems, urocystitis, urethrits, gynecologic problem, heart and blood vessel problems. Therefore, you should avoid fatigue, maintain a stable and regular lifestyle and schedule, sleep and wake early, go outdoors and get more sunlight, and avoid deep-fried foods in order to protect a congenitally weaker nephridium water system. Also avoid iced and cold drinks and reduce the frequency of sexual activities in order to maintain good vitality.<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, you are quite straight forward with a majority of things as long as you know how to deal with them, but you are not interested in knowing why you have to do them. You are a person of action who doesn't like to drag things out, but this can result in hasty decisions.<br><br>If you want to change your destiny, take a daily bath which allows you sufficient time to think and reflect, which helps you to make the right decisions. As long as you can think twice before acting, your destiny will be changed thoroughly with more health, wealth and happiness coming into your life.<br><br>◎In your relationship, you are mutually loving and respectful of each other. Your love is full of romance and happiness. Your future partner will also help you with financial management, and contribute fortune and wealth as he has the luck to help his wife. ◎<br><br>In romance, according to our analysis, men tend to fall in love with you at first sight but lack the confidence to go after you. If they dare win your heart, the romance heats up quickly, but you have many disagreements because you tend to have a temper and be in a higher social position. Generally speaking, you make quite a good first impression of you because you are capable and charming, but men may feel you are too high to reach. As a result you don't cherish or learn how to maintain a relationship. Therefore, if you are still waiting for a good romance, try to conceal your outer beauty in order to find more sincere and suitable lovers who aren't just attracted to your looks. Then true romance will come your way.<br><br>In the journey of life, your romantic or marriage partner tends to be very different from you. You don't easily have a spark of love with any colleague, but do easily start a relationship with someone from a different background and environment. You are mutually attracted to your differences, but you have to overcome the wide gap together. Therefore, it's better to think twice about your ideal partner when it comes to marriage. If you are still waiting for romance, consider people around you who are unlikely candidates and they might be the possible one. As long as you sincerely give a little hint, the happiness is right beside you.<br><br>◎Career Analysis: Most of your jobs, in any industry, require some creativity, communication and critical thinking ability.◎<br><br>Most of your jobs, in any industry, require some creativity, communication and critical thinking ability. For example, R&amp;D, marketing, sales, etc. As long as you keep turning your ideas into action, your value in a company is irreplaceable. If you choose jobs that require critical thinking ability, your work will go smoothly (jobs that are labor intensive are not suitable). You tend, however, to think from only your own point of view, so you may lack a broader perspective for higher management. You should further strengthen your experience, and if you want to reach the next professional level, then you should be more understanding and considerate of other employees and communicate more, in order to improve your leadership ability.<br><br>◎Wealth Analysis: You know how to make money well through investment or starting a business.◎<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, you know how to make money well through investment or starting a business. You knew the importance of the money since you were young, and knew it's very difficult to be rich depending only on a salary, so you learned about investment earlier than others. Therefore, you were making money with investments while others were spending money and enjoying their lives. Born very clever, you will not spend money if unnecessary, but will be relatively more generous to your children. You will invest most of your wealth or reward those around you throughout life. Afterwards, you will bequest most of your wealth to your children and relatives.</div>
