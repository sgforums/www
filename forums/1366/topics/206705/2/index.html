            <div class='col-md body'>Your life is represented by the sun of wealth, very kind and generous, which means you are very lucky to live a comfortable life, and very helpful to your partner. You are a person of passion and manners, and like wise and trustworthy people. As a person of sunshine, you are enthusiastic and generous, and also a leader type, not a follower.<br><br>Your characteristics, subconscious, and behavior modes, according to your fate and destiny, are represented by the sun. Bright, warmhearted, generous, and not fussy about details, you do not like to make small social circles and believe firmly in justice.<br><br>The sun is the leader in the sky, so you have natural leadership ability, and the desire and dedication to perform and sacrifice as long as you have the respect and support from others. The sun shines everywhere, so you also like to be fair and make sure everyone is covered and shares the profit. The sun revolves regularly everyday in its orbit, so you are a very disciplined person who rarely quits halfway, and no one can force you to do something you don't want to do.<br><br>You like honest individuals who keep their promises, dislike opinionated people, and admire peope with artistic talent and those who can enrich your spirit. Your entire life is like the sun, subject to public focus and attention, yet striving relentlessly. The sun in the cold winter is the most difficult time of your life, but you can bear it and flourish eventually.<br>_____________________________________<br><br>Health Analysis: The function of your respiratory system is weaker.<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, the function of your respiratory system is weaker, which caused minor problems like allergies, runny nose, cough, cold, chest pain, diarrhea and constipation when you were young. But over age 40, additional care of your respiratory system is needed, or it may lead to nasosinutisis, asthma, bronchopneumonia, bronchitis, intestines polyp and proctitis. Therefore, you should avoid fatigue and smoking, maintain a stable, regular lifestyle and schedule, and sleep and wake early in order to protect a congenitally weaker respiratory system.<br><br>There's a saying that all disease starts from the mouth, which means many human diseases are related to food. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, food can be divided into gold, wood, water, fire and earth (concept of the five elements). You seem to prefer the spicy flavors in food like spicy hotpot and Sichuan dishes, which means your cells are filled with too much gold element. This negatively affects your health, fortune and career, so we suggest you try different foods to balance your diet and nutrition, which leads to harmony in life and a balance of yin and yang based on the five elements. In addition, if you have recently felt unlucky or things were not going smoothly, then you are probably affected by bad spirit, which caused bad luck. The best solution is not to eat meat and fish for a period of time until the bad spirit goes away. The bad spirit tends to stay with those who eat meat and fish, and also chicken, duck, green onion, garlic, leek and other spices, so a vegetarian diet can help change your luck.<br>_____________________________________<br><br>Health Analysis: Your liver and gall is weaker as well.<br><br>Your liver and gall is weaker as well, so you tend to tire easily and can't do labor-intensive jobs. You may have had irritability and acne when you were young. But over age 40, your liver and gall require additional care, or you may have problems such as cholesterol and triglyceride, abnormal liver, liver or gall deceases, or even suffer a delining immune system, which leads to failing eyesight. Therefore, it's very important for you to pay attention to your liver and gall and maintain a stable schedule for your life. Monitor your glycerin level, consume less alcohol, avoid fatigue, and most importantly, do not to stay up overnight.<br><br>According to your destiny analysis, you are a night owl as you seem to be more energetic and inspired at night, so you tend to sleep late and get up late. However, sleeping and waking up early is extremely helpful to your fate and destiny, even though it's not easy for you. You don't easily offend others as you don't like to be the one on top. You better stay away from alcohol if you want to change your fate and destiny, as it drains your energy quickly and negatively affects your fortune. If you are able to develop the good habit of sleeping and waking up early, it will completely change your fate and destiny with better health, more wealth and happiness coming into your life.<br>_____________________________________<br><br>You are willing to be devoted, dedicated and sacrifice for a relationship. Your love is full of romance, so to be your companion is to be blessed with love and happiness. When the passion cools down in romantic love, many problems emerge, which require your tolerance and wisdom to overcome.<br><br>In romance, according to our analysis, men usually like you at first sight. If they win your heart, a romance develops quickly, but doesn't last long because it's difficult to maintain the same level of passion from beginning to end. Generally speaking, you make a good first impression because you are charming and capable, but over time your passion is replaced by arguments. You are often admired, but are not satisfied with what you have, and your romantic partner may be very sticky if you want to break up. Therefore, if you are still waiting for a good romance, try to conceal your outer beauty in order to find more sincere and suitable lovers who aren't just attracted to your looks. Then true romance will come your way.<br><br>In the journey of life, your romantic or marriage partner may appear easily, and most possibly someone in your life and social circle. It could be someone introduced through school, work, or community association. You may marry early, so if you are still seeking your love partner look among the people around you; the person who is most handsome and attractive might possibly be the one. As long as you sincerely give a little hint, the happiness is right beside you.<br>_____________________________________<br><br>Career Analysis: Most of your jobs, in any industry, require some professional training or expertise.<br><br>Most of your jobs, in any industry, require some professional training or expertise. For example, finance banker, accountant, engineer, lawyer, government official, consultant, etc. As long as you gain more professional experience and new industry knowledge, your value in a company will be irreplaceable. If you choose jobs that require professional training, your work will go smoothly (jobs that are labor intensive are not suitable). You tend, however, to think from only your own point of view, so you may lack the broad perspective for higher management. You should further strengthen your experience, and if you want to reach the next professional level, then you should be more understanding and considerate of other employees and communicate more, in order to improve your leadership ability.<br>_____________________________________<br><br>Wealth Analysis: You know how to make money and save money, so you are seldom short of cash.<br><br>According to the destiny analysis, you know how to make money, and also know how to save money, so it's not easy for you to be short of cash. You knew the importance of the money since you were very young, so you started with your investments earlier than others. Therefore, you were generating and accumulating more money and wealth through investment while others were spending money and enjoying their lives. In addition, you were born very clever, and will not spend money if not necessary, but you are very interested in investing business, and very keen to be your own boss with your own career. You will be saving majority portion of your wealth, to invest in the real-estate or to establish your own business. Afterwards, you will bequest most of your wealth to your busband and relatives.<br>_____________________________________<br><br>Rough analysis quite true liao...
