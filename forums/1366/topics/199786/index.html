            <div class='col-md body'>Hi does anyone know what is the correct term for dream log? It's something like a diary or log that you record the dreams you had while sleeping..<br><br>Meanwhile, I had this dream last night.<br><br>I was being stalked by a crazy schoolgirl. So I tried avoiding her, running around in the MRT station. This MRT station was very futuristic, with many platforms with trains going in different directions. This might be the scene say 100 years later. So I finally managed to get rid of her, then the setting changes.<br><br>I was sailing at my local yacht club that I used to go to. There were many other sailors heading back to shore as the sun was setting. Suddenly my leisurecraft was capsized by strong winds and water kept rushing in despite me trying to upright the boat. My boat sank quickly and my leg was trapped. I tried very hard to break free but I kept sinking in until I hit the bottom. At that time I remembered clearly that I was telling myself that I was not going to die in such a manner, but in the end things just blacked out.<br><br>Can anyone intepret this dream for me?(Namely Oceanos since he's the only pro I know around =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet aRcTiC_sTaR,<br><br>The dream log/diary/journal will help you to remember your dreams and work with them - put a notebook and a pen next to your bed. When you wake up, try to write down immediately all you can remember, BEFORE you talk to your partner or start to get up. You will be surprised how much your subconsciousness has to tell you. The dream diary is an important key to yourself. It can be any notebook or journal something you like to be used as a Dream Journal.<br><br>Thanks for your post. I will decipher your dreams when i am free.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

They can be suppressed urges or memories or might even be messages our minds and bodies are trying to tell us. Thus it is a good idea to keep a record of our dreams as they can help us understand our lives better .Feel free to post your dreams here too as the meanings can than be deciphered and you can than  understand yourself better and lead a more rewarding life.</span></div>

In time to come peace &amp; stability will come but you got to persevere with a positive heart. You are seeking goodness in life with ease with positive outcome in everything you do in your heart &amp; subconcious mind.<br><br>Recurring dreams attempt to alert each of us to specific "signs" in our lives and continue to do so until we actually receive and understand its purpose. Once we accept what the dream is trying to convey and acknowledge its true meaning, the recurring dreams will cease. It may also be precognitive patterns from our Past many lives as in "Deja vu dreams" or a reflection of our subconcious mind. These dreams may appear as frustrating because they do recur, however i don't much of an issue unless its to a point you can't get to rest at all &amp; affect your health. If in such case, i would suggest you go for "Energy Healing" or " Past life Regression" for the recurring dream to cease.<br><br>This is not only my Dream Deciphering Analysis for you, also part of it is from my Intuitive Reading of you. Stay positive. Hope these are of help to you. Thanks.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
