I started this Topic to create awareness &amp; as a Q &amp; A board for any queries &amp; doubts pertaining to "Spell" &amp; "Magick".<br><br>There are four definitions of the word "spell". The gothic word "spill", means a saying, story, or piece of news. The word for the narrative of God, gospel is derived from this.<br><br>The second definition comes from the Anglo-Saxon word "spellian" meaning to recount, to write out something.<br><br>The third meaning is related to the old English word "speld". A speld is a thin rod of wood used to point, such as a teacher would use. These rods were also called wands.<br><br>The last definition describes a period of activity or work.<br><br>A spell is giving time to recount something that spells out your desire. It is driven by the will of a person or Intent. A desired goal is attainable. Words, symbols, and tools are combined to form a ritual. Power is raised and directed out to the Universe to do its work. The wand focuses the energy that has been bound together. This is where the term "spellbinding" comes from.<br><br>Welcome to the Witching Hour...

Belief in and the use of spells are universal and have been an integral part of religious practices since ancient times.  Methods vary according to culture but all spell work is based on ritual.<br><br>Spells are closely related to Prayers, which are rituals consisting of a petition to the Gods or deities (whatever the religion or faith) for a desired outcome.  It involves the visualization of a goal, a statement of desire for the goal, and ritualized movements of body positions (e.g., the bowing of the head, the clasping of the hands, the closing of the eyes etc).  In magick, spells are closely related to various methods of mind power such as:  creative visualization, positive thinking, and positive imaging. All of which emphasize our mental images of the goal and our identification with it, repetition of our intent to achieve this goal, projection of our will, and the invocation of spirits, deities, or the divine force for their aid.<br><br>Spells can be beneficial or harmful and can be worked on people, animals, and nature.  Their purposes are limitless and include:  healing, love, money, success, fertility, longevity, and protection from disaster, ill fortune, and evil.  They can also be used to exorcise ghosts and spirits, for victory in battle, truth in divination, weather control, and the accomplishment of supernatural feats.  When directed against enemies, spells can be used to cause illness, destruction, bad luck, depression, loss of love, impotence, barrenness, failure and even death.  Spells can be cast to affect the self, or directed to affect another person.<br><br>A positive spell is often called a blessing, although such archaic terms as bewitchment and enchantment are still sometimes used.  Negative spells are generally known as hexes or curses.  A binding spell is one intended to prevent harm, avoid danger, or to stop someone from performing particular acts (e.g., halting a murder, preventing a rape, or even stopping the spread of gossip &amp; other abuses).<br><br>In almost all cultures, Witches, Sorcerers, Witch doctors, Magicians, and other magically empowered peoples such as in the perspective of Asian like Bomoh &amp; so on, cast both beneficial and harmful spells as the need dictates.  However in contemporary Paganism and Witchcraft, a set of ethics exists in some traditions that prohibits the use of curses and negative spells against another. The acceptability of binding &amp; other baleful spells are divided, and are widely debated throughout the community.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

How do Spell works?<br><br>An act of magick requires a ritual and a spell.  The spell consists of words or incantations (sometimes called a charm or rune); the ritual is a set of actions performed while the words are being spoken.  The ancient Egyptians believed words were so powerful that speaking them would bring about the desired goal.  Words and names of power were vital to Egyptian magick and had to be pronounced correctly and with the proper intonation.  In Western magick the ultimate name of power is the Tetragrammaton, YHWH (Yah-weh), the sacred name of God.<br><br>A spell-casting ritual raises power and energy through a combination of visualization, meditation, identification, body movement and projection of will.  The success of a spell rests on the energy and will power raised, together with the skill in which they are focused and projected.  Words, chants, songs, and movements, objects such as ritual tools, effigies, poppets, cords, and candles, as well as materials such as parchment, herbs, oils and others, all facilitate spell casting.<br><br>In contemporary Witchcraft spell casting is performed within a magick circle (see Circle Casting).  Many covens work spells as part of their regular meetings, though each coven may use differing techniques.  To start, the goal of a spell is stated and some Witches write it down.  The act of writing down the goal emphasizes the positive thinking techniques and helps to bolster the will power to achieve the goal.  Any preparations for the ritual are made such as lighting coloured candles or mixing herbs and oils.  Each action generating energy and increasing will power concentration toward the goal.<br><br>In healing or love spell rituals, an herb filled poppet or cloth doll might be used to identify the likeness of the object of the spell.  To aid the likeness, the doll may be marked with the persons name or astrological sign, or even stuffed with personal hair or nail clipping taken from the object.  A photograph of the person might also be used.  If a doll or poppet is not being used, then a mental image or thought form is created.  If the spell is being work by a group, all must agree on the image and hold it firmly in their minds.  Power and energy is then raised by various means, including:  chanting, dancing, tying knots in cords or clapping hands.  Drums, rattles, and the playing of music may also be used to raise power.<br><br>Witches invite higher forces to work with them in implementing a spell.  This is usually some aspect of the Goddess or God together with the forces of the elements.  Other deities may be called upon whose aspects best suit the nature of the spell.  For instance, a money making spell might be addressed to Â“MathÂ” the God of wealth and increase, similarly for a love spell Â“AphroditeÂ” might be called (see Gods and Deities).<br><br>While performing the ritual the Witch focuses intense concentration and will power into achieving the goal, and when the psychic power and energy being raised is at its peak, it is then released and directed towards the goal while visualizing and seeing the results being accomplished.  Once the spell has been completed the ritual ends with a psychic cleanup to banish and ground any remnants of psychic energy.  This is normally done with the Â“cakes and wineÂ” ritual, after which the deities and elements are thanked and the circle banished.<br><br>Hope all these can give the masses a clearer picture of Magick &amp; Spell.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Definitely Experience will play a part in perspective of a Practicioner or a layman, Magick &amp; energies will work better in term of speed &amp; result if the Caster is a practicioner however these can be compensated by the Time, Day, Items &amp; Tools used  by someone who is a layman. With a choice of best Day , Time , Charged Items &amp; Tools will definitely bring about Best result for any Spells which practically can be casted by anyone, any age &amp; of coz any religions, hassle-free. White Magick can be used for any good cause to help anyone to make their life better. Divine will only render help to those that need it &amp; of coz with Intent of the subject whether for good or bad cause. There will never be any side effects if its meant to be unless its not meant to be by forced upon. Anyway personally i do not encourage the use of Dark Magick in any ways.<br><br>Hope all these answer your queries...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

Let me explain before our minds run wild or assume anything.<br><br>First let us destroy the myths of wizards throwing around lightening bolts doing battle with evil sorcerers, and all other such nonsenseÂ’s.  Magick is a force utilising power, wisdom and knowledge.  It is both more and less powerful than the ignorant can suppose.  Magick can only be used to change the changeable, for instance - it can be used to cure a sickness but not to replace a lost limb.  Magick is not a power to be used in place of our other powers, meaning those of our physical, mental or emotional abilities.  Nor is it a crutch for the weak or an ego-boost for the inadequate.  Magick is an art and skill unto itself.  It needs to be learned then trained to develop, and that takes time and patience.<br><br>If we believe that everything and all originate from the same source, then the ability for using magick must be retained within us all.  Magick then is a forgotten art passed down through aeons of reincarnations and it resides inside us all, although some are born blessed with certain gifts &amp; stronger abilities. However magick is a skill that needs to be re-learned and trained if it's to be used well, effectively and wisely.<br><br>In modern days magick is used not only in ritual ceremonies, but also on a daily bases during spiritual communication with the Goddess and God.  It is used daily for healing purposes and perhaps more frequently for personal purposes like reducing negativity, protection and improving the self.  It can also be used for many other purposes as determined by the individual while bearing in mind Â“The three fold lawÂ” which is very subjective &amp; individual with regards to the many other Traditions around other than Mainstream Traditions like Alexanderian or Gardnerian.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

This law relates to the use of power and energy, for when used, power is returned to the sender, three times the level it was sent out.<br><br>Used in relation with the ethos, Â“Do what thy wilt, though it harm noneÂ” (as stated in the Wiccan Rede), witches take great care when preparing and casting spells that no harm should come to others because of it.<br><br>The nature of this three-fold return can perhaps be better understood when considering the cause and effect principle of a spell.  LetÂ’s take an example Â– someone comes to you in distress with a problem, you help by sending out positive energy and the problem is successfully resolved.  This automatically makes you feel good about yourself and influences your thoughts; thus your state of consciousness is altered.  In turn your thoughts stir the emotions, which has a physical effect in the body by causing glandular secretions to enter into the blood stream.  The resulting state of mind and body lifts your spirit, which is what makes you feel good.  Thus with the act of a single good deed, you have been effected three times, in mind, body, and spirit.  This then is your three-fold response to the return of positive energy.  Now consider your response had you sent out negative energy or something went drastically wrong?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.blaskan.nu/Bilder/witchcraft.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Due to the recent emergence of many Controversial Topics in my haven which are mostly pertaining to the Darker Aspects of Magick. I have the urge to pen down an exposÃ© on Wicca, Witchcraft &amp; Magick.<br><br>The "Evils" associated with Paganism, Witchcraft, Satanism and the Black Arts, but like many misinformed people, alot had a preconceived view of the subject.  Many would had expected me to be writing about Ritual Sacrifices, Sexual Orgies and Evil Spells etc. However you are all wrong.<br><br>In my years of Practice, I have found nothing to indicate any of the above.  Far from it, instead I have found a whole community of like-minded peoples, from all walks of life, from all positions in society and all over the world, working together in a common goal.  "The understanding of Life and Nature, Evolution and the Mysteries of the Universe."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.crystalforest1.homestead.com/files/wicca.gif"><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>In my years of practice, I can perceive nothing evil, detrimental to society or harmful in anyway.  Sure, I have found many writings denouncing "Witchcraft" as evil, but most of these writings come from peoples of other faiths and religions.  Just by reading these writings, the obsessional characteristics of the writers become apparent and to my mind at least, most do not lead to credence.<br><br>So if witchcraft is not about evil, then what is it about? Many may ask &amp; there are many ways to answer these queries. "Wicca" is a Religion that is commonly perceived &amp; known to be in association with "Witchcraft". so i shall briefly touched on it to give a clearer picture.<br><br>"Wicca" is a contemporary spiritual religion, based on and reviving the ancient pre-Christian pagan religions of Europe.  Wiccans believe in a divine force or power as the source of all.  It is both immanent and transcendent while encompassing the whole universe.  Therefore the world and all aspects within the world, "nature" and "life itself" in particular, are considered sacred.<br><br>Wiccans use ancient and modern ceremonies, rituals and shamanic practices to attune themselves to the natural rhythms of nature, the world, and the universe in their efforts to commune with this divine force.<br><br>Hope all these can give the Masses a better understanding of Wicca, Witchcraft &amp; Magick.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
