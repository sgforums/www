            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I have been seeing the number 911 for some time most notably on clocks. Many times when i surfing the net, i unintentionally(subconsiousnessly) take a look at the computer clock and it displays 9:11.  Other times, when i open my handphone and there it was 9:11.<br><br>I did a research on the net and found that i was not alone. There are many people who claims that they keep repeatly seeing the same number e.g 11:11,<br>444, x:11 (where x is an integer)... etc. There are also people who claimed they see this often after the terroist 9-11 attacks. If you google it, you can see lots of links.<br><br>From what i see, 911 means certain things<br>1) 911 is an international SOS no. which u call for help<br><br>2) In numerology, 9+1+1 = 11 =&gt; special mystical awareness, spiritual enlightenment, higher powers communicating to you, your inner subconsiousness hinting something to u,...blah blah blah.<br><br>I supposed that the meaning is to seek spiritual help from beings in the higher realms??? Quite appropriate because i have been down and out for several years. Lots of internal struggle, indecisiveness, fear and insecurity.<br>Can someone provide a more specific and detail explanation for this? I'm not kidding.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Help me if u can i feeling down and i do appreciate you being around<br>Help me get my feet back on the ground.<br>Can u pls pls help me.<br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet Walrus,<br><br>Welcome to my haven, hope you will enjoy your stay in here.<br><br>Actually i do not quite understand what you mean. I think you are asking why there is always a repetitive sets of numbers shown to you. It is as if some unseen force turns your eyes to the number 911 notably on clock...<br><br>The recurrence of such numbers is a subtle and constant reminder that something Magickal, something Divine is happening, Its liken to a sign. It may be a form of reminder or message from the Angelic Realms. Whatever your belief, acknowledge that God/Spirit/Angels are telling you, you are on your path and to say, "Thank-you" for them talking to you.<br><br>The angels seek to give us answers and guidance in so many ways, and when they call our attention to number sequences, it is a true sign of their love and power. The more you notice these signs, the more frequently they will show up in your life. Once you understand the signs' meaning, and once you accept that they are not coincidences, but purposeful events, you will enjoy even closer communications with your angels.<br><br>For you, I feel its like a reminder or message telling you its time for you to make a major decision &amp; great change in your life before it is too late.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi oceanos,<br><br>Thanks for the reply,<br><blockquote><br>Actually i do not quite understand what you mean. I think you are asking why there is always a repetitive sets of numbers shown to you.

If i were to think of "i want to see the number 911", it will not appear to me. It is seeing it unknowingly without the thought of it. But my is not as freaky as those on the net claims. They see it in the bills, car plates, apartment number almost everywhere...<br><blockquote><br>It may be a form of reminder or message from the Angelic Realms. Whatever your belief, acknowledge that God/Spirit/Angels are telling you, you are on your path and to say, "Thank-you" for them talking to you.<br></blockquote>This God/spirits/Angels... what to say, i'm not a christian.  And how to know what message are they trying to tell me?<br>Btw, are you psychic/Clairvoyant? Prehaps you can help me by asking them the meaning of it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><blockquote><br>For you, I feel its like a reminder or message telling you its time for you to make a major decision &amp; great change in your life <strong>before it is too late</strong>.<br></blockquote>Don't make me scared leh - "before it is too late" as if there is a date-line. Once this date-line expires, then i'm finished. I'm already very kanchong already. Feel like running out of time already. Those changes i want to make, those decisions to be made and those restrictions i want to break. There are not as easy as they seem to be. It is against all odds.<br><br>Regards,<br>walrus</div>
