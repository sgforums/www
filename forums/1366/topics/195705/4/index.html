You can address the doll as if you are talking to that person, requesting a change in attitude, influencing the person to act in accordance with your wishes, your desires.<br><br>Once in possession of an authentic Voodoo doll, you can request the doll to call upon powerful forces known as Loa. You can perform a simple but effective ritual to fulfill a specific dream, an urgent desire. This timeless ceremony is carried out to persuade the spirits to exert their influence in this world.<br><br><span class="large">Voodoo: Ancient Religion of Africa</span><br><br>Voodoo means "Spirit of God." It's a system of beliefs originating in Africa. It is estimated that Voodoo has over fifty million followers worldwide. Voodoo flourishes in Brazil, Trinidad, Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, New Orleans and in private homes in every country in the world.<br><br>Voodoo believers accept the existence of one god. Below this almighty god, spirits (Loa) rule over the world's affairs in matters of family, love, happiness, justice, wealth, revenge.<br><br>Today, a significant percent of the population of New Orleans partake in Voodoo rituals. The practice of Voodoo involves the blessing of a Voodoo doll by an experienced practitioner which allows the possessor of the doll to contact the spirits directly - requesting fulfillment in love, finance, career, family matters, etc.<br><br>We call upon these spirits from our hearts, summoning the gods, urging them to respond.<br><br>For anyone who is searching for a solution to a difficult problem, who is trying to mend a conflict, return a lover, accumulate wealth... Loa awaits your call.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Voodoo%20Products/voodoodollssubheader.gif"></div>

The Media Portrayal has given Voodoo a bad name &amp; infamous impression to the Masses. However, these are not true, misintepretations by the Masses are caused by Misrepresentation by the Media.<br><br>The truth is Voodoo &amp; Spirit dolls are mainly for good &amp; positive use as in healing, protection &amp; many more. The fact is they can be used for just about any purpose. It is the practitioner who works the doll. Benevolent or Malevolent intent comes from the heart of the magickian, not the doll. None of the Voodoo or Spirit Dolls neither other items should be feared at all as they are all made, blessed &amp; charged with "Positive Good Energy" to aid you in your needs &amp; desires.<br><br>Voodoo, Hoodoo, Voodoo/Spirit Dolls are still controversial to many who shun them. The Voodoo religion/practice has a big image problem not only in the United States but globally. Horrific, darkly mysterious rituals have become emblematic of Voodoo. The understanding of Voodoo here is largely shrouded in ignorance, mystery and fear.<br><br>Voodoo is a practical religion, playing an important role in the family and the community. One's ancestors, for instance, are believed to be a part of the world of the spirits, of the Loas, and this is one way that Voodoo serves to root its participants in their own history and tradition. Another practical aspect of Voodoo ceremonies is that participants often come before the priest or priestess to seek advice, spiritual guidance, or help with their problems. The priest or priestess then, through divine aid, offer help such as healing through the use of herbs or medicines (using knowledge that has been passed down within the religion itself), or healing through faith itself as is common in other religions. Voodoo teaches a respect for the natural world.<br><br>Unfortunately, the publicÂ’s perception of voodoo rites and rituals seems often to point to the evil or malicious side of things. There are healing spells, nature spells, love spells, purification spells, joyous celebration spells. Spirits may be invoked to bring harmony and peace, birth and rebirth, increased abundance of luck, material happiness, renewed health.The fact is, for those who believe it, voodoo is powerful. It is also empowering to the person who practices it.<br><br>The Truth is Voodoo is mainly use for Good, These Powerful Voodoo &amp; Spirit dolls could bring you all that you desire &amp; deserve if they are use for positive purpose.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
