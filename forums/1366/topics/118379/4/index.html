There are many Covens Locally but do they last? Underground Group &amp; Cult, a more established one Like The Coven of Cythrawl perhaps you heard of it, their Missionary &amp; High Priest decided to make Singapore their headquarter but not long after due to some unforseen events they withdrawn from here.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Catholics used the same bible as Christians... That is 4-related religions. All 4 religions talked about the existence of Satan, and satanic bible is but related to these religions only.

There are many Covens Locally but do they last? Underground Group &amp; Cult, a more established one Like The Coven of Cythrawl perhaps you heard of it, their Missionary &amp; High Priest decided to make Singapore their headquarter but not long after due to some unforseen events they withdrawn from here.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>Well.... I think MacDonaldisation may have lost popular appeal but I wouldn't say its something that is no longer global. The culture is still there, its just facing stiffer competition.

The European Vampire was meant to scare away potential womanizers amongst noble families in Europe. There are indeed people who drink blood, but scaling walls, turning to bats are all rubbish meant to scare women, especially married ones from being led astray by others. The werewolf is a sad case of human borned with more hair.<br><br>It's funny if you even explore further. Some of the ghosts, or creatures are meant to keep children at home at night so that they will not become food of wild animals. These are lies made by parents to keep mischievious children from danger. Those sea monsters are even bigger lies to children, to keep them from the waters, the forest monsters from the woods etc.<br><br>Like I said any mention of them makes me laugh like crazy since theoretically, they are lies spread by adults to children.<br><br>If you want answers to these creatures, seek the religiously educated men from their own fields. They would have some of the answers you never expected.
