            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Book Of Were-wolves -- SABINE BARING-GOULD</strong><br><br>This strange series of sermons was preached at Strasbourg in the year 1508, and was taken down and written out by a barefooted friar, Johann Pauli, and by him published in 1517. The doctor died on Mid-Lent Sunday, 1510. There is a Latin edition of his sermons, but whether of the same series or not I cannot tell, as I have been unable to obtain a sight of the volume. The German edition is illustrated with bold and clever woodcuts. Among other, there are representations of the Witches' Sabbath, the Wild Huntsman, and a Werewolf attacking a Man.<br><br><div>code:<pre>http://www.blackmask.com/books66c/werewolves.pdf</pre></div></div>

The assumption of the form and characteristics of a wolf held to be possible by witchcraft or magic<br><br>At the Center of Biomedical Research in Guadalajara, Mexico geneticist Dr. Luis Figuera is studying a Mexican family with a rare genetic mutation that causes fur like hair to grow all over their bodies. This werewolf disorder has mysterious resurfaced for the first time since the middle ages. The gene that causes the mutation lay dormant for centuries. It can be passed through either parent in the "X" chromosone. This is known as the "Werewolf Disorder".<br><br>In the Aceves family...32 members...all have this disease. They live in a mountain town named Zacatecas in Mexico. The hair covers much of their body...even in females. Some members of the family have more hair than others.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><img src="http://www.prairieghosts.com/werewolf1.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">WEREWOLVES &amp; IMMORTALITY:<br><br>Werewolves are immune from aging and from most physical diseases due to the constant regeneration of their physical tissue. They can, therefore, be virtually immortal. However, they can be killed by any wound that destroys the heart or the brain, or any form of death that causes brain or heart damage (such as hanging or other oxygen-deprivation methods).<br><br>THE MIND OF A WEREWOLF :<br><br>Though primarily a true wolf while in wolf form, there is some proof that the werewolf retains enough knowledge to assist his killing; recognition of victims, evation of traps, and human cunning have all been seen on werewolf cases.<br><br>BECOMING A WEREWOLF:<br><br>There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being givin the power of shape shifting through sorcery, being cursed by someone who you have wronged in some way (called Lycaeonia curse), being bitten by a werewolf, and being born to a werewolf. In each case, the blood becomes tainted or cursed.<br><br>DAMNATION:<br><br>A person who becomes a werewolf against his will (birth, curse, or bite) is not completely damned until he tastes of human blood. Once he does, his soul is eternally damned and nothing may redeem him. Even without tasting of human blood, however, as long as the taint lays upon the immortal soul, it cannot enter Heaven, and will remain chained to the mortal plane upon death.<br><br>WEREWOLF PACKS:<br><br>Like real wolves, werewolves can live alone for many years, yet the instinct for a pack often leads them away from their secretive lifestyle, into revealing their nature to a priest or close associate, or converting another to werewolfry for companionship. This is when the otherwise cagey werewolf opens himself to dection! Werewolf packs cause immense destruction. A pack consists of one werewolf who became a werewolf through sorcery, birth, or curse - in other words, his is the original tainted blood. This werewolf is called the Alpha werewolf. The remaining werewolves in the pack are called Beta werewolves because they became werewolves through the bite of the Alpha and carry the Alpha's tainted blood.<br><br>ALPHA &amp; BETA WEREWOLVES:<br><br>The relationship between Alpha and Beta werewolves is a complex one. Once a subject is bitten by a werewolf, his or her life and death are doomed to the werewolf curse. The victim does, however, have some hope - as long as they themselves do not taste of human blood, the curse is reversible. If the Alpha werewolf is killed - through some action of the Beta - the Beta's curse is broken. It is important to note that whether the Beta werewolf was bitten by the Alpha werewolf himself or by another Beta, it is the Alpha who must be destroyed - the source of the original tainted blood. It is also an interesting note that since Betas and Alphas share common blood, an Alpha cannot physically harm a Beta of his own bloodline by his own hans without inflicting the same injury upon himself. However, if a Beta is harmed or killed by another, it does not affect the Alpha.<br><br>SYMPTOMS OF WEREWOLFRY:<br><br>When hunting for a werewolf it is important to remember that your biggest clues will come through your suspects personalities. Becoming a werewolf is not transparent, no matter how the victim tries to hide it. The tainted, sub-human blood appearence. Therefore, look for symptoms in your human suspects that include increasing violence, increasing aggression, unprovoked rages, insomnia, restlessness, and other bizarre behavior. Unfortunately, over time these symptoms can be brought under control, so do not rely on them exclusively. </span><br><br><img src="http://www.prairieghosts.com/werewolf2.jpg"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: violet;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet John Ching,<br><br>Native American Indians do have their fair share of Werewolves, Shapeshifters are widely known in the Native American Culture! They are not only subjected to Wolves but all Creatures of the Wild. Shapeshifting touches the very soul of the Indian. Brothers in nature, it is quite natural for him to feel as one with the spirit animal sounds in his chanting, just as he feels Earth Mother's heartbeat in his drumming. They are commonly known as "Skin walkers". In some tribes, shamans use shapeshifting in a more serious manner.  Wearing feathers, or the hide of his guardian spirit, the shaman would perform the animal's actions to will his workings &amp; do his biddings. Shapeshifting to his wolf counterpart was an asset to the Indian in warfare...Shapeshifting is alive and well today, right here in our own society. Werewolves in their Native American Name would be known as "Limikkin".  Almost every Culture or Race has traces of Lycanthrophy that existed since the dawn of Mankind... To believe or not is really up to you...<br><br>Hope all these answer your queries, Have a nice day!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
