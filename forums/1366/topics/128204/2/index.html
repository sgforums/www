Cover seeds/gather soil around base of seedling, and water with a mix of water and fertilizer.<br><br>As your plants grow, you will need to thin them out.  Do this a few at a time until you have a strong, perfect circle.<br><br>You will also need to secure them to keep them from bending and breaking.  (A good idea would be to place tall stakes in the ground when you plant the seeds so you don't have to worry about damaging the roots of your sunflowers by placing stakes into the ground.)  Secure the stalks to the stakes with strips of soft cloth, taking care not to do so too tightly and damage the stalks.<br><br>You might like to line the outside of your sunflower circle with a circle of rocks, or perhaps a tier of marigolds.  Plants that climb, like morning glories or moonflowers, can also be planted along the outside of the circle and trained to grow up the sunflower stalks to create a magickal hideaway!<br><br>Create a ritual for harvesting your sunflowers; the best time to harvest them is when the petals have fallen off.  Ask the plants permission before cutting, and leave a gift in the ground.  Cut about 1 - 2" from the head of the flowers then hang them in a dry place so the seeds will dry and can be harvested for next year. </span></span></div>

The Whitethorn (also known as the may tree or hawthorn) is a particular favourite of fairies as is the oak. Lone trees are often fairy trees and give off a magical air. They are often gnarled and mysterious in form. Fairy trees are honoured as the fairies gather around them at certain times of the year.<br><br>Other fairy trees and shrubs include the rowan, bramble, ash, blackthorn, elder, birch, apple, hazel, aspen, bay, broom, lilac, willow, alder, holly, pine, scots pine and beech.<br><br>Fairies love flowers and when assembling a fairy garden these are the flowers and herbs which fairies especially love:<br><br>Golden ragwort  Briar rose<br>Verbena Clover<br>Cowslips Rosemary<br>Thyme Lavender<br>Daisies Buddleia<br>St.Johns wort Foxgloves<br>Hyssop Yarrow<br>Lemon balm Angelica<br>Pansies Wallflowers<br>Roses Soapwort<br><br>This is by no means a complete list but gives a general idea.<br><br>Keep a small (or large!) area of your garden wild and uncultivated. Also, make a small fairy altar ( a section of a tree, or a log perhaps) where you can leave gifts for them. Suitable gifts are natural items, such as - seashells, pinecones, acorns, anything that glitters. Leave gifts of food - berries, honey, cake, ginger, home-baked bread or any sweets. Please make your offerings of food and gifts aesthetically pleasing and give them with love and respect.<br><br>Do not expect the gifts to disappear - fairies take away the spiritual essence of our gifts. Replace the gifts regularly.</span></span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dedicating the Fairy Garden</span><br><br>In one of the fairy days and hours, walk around the dedicated area of garden with an athame pointed at the borders. Sprinkle the perimeter of the garden with salted spring water.<br><br>Then anoint yourself with Fairy Oil and say the words:<br><br>Fairy host, from the wild,<br><br>Come and tend this plot awhile;<br><br>Come dancing from the hollow hill<br><br>To raise the power and do the Lord and Ladies will.<br><br>Make your revels in my garden,<br><br>May this soil be fairy trodden.<br><br>Each herb and flower, each garden tree,<br><br>Set each lovely spirit free!<br><br>May all be hung with globes of light,<br><br>From deepest Elfame, fair and bright.<br><br>Fairies heed this pledge I tell,<br><br>To honour you and treat you well.<br><br>Conclude your ritual with the following:<br><br>In the name of the Lord and Lady , I declare this garden a sanctuary for the spirits of nature and the children of the Lord and Lady.<br><br>When you have finished leave a gift on the altar.</span></strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> splash!<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v331/ac_splash/bluemermaid.gif"><br><br></div>

Many common herbs do more than add flavor to your meals: they go into overtime to work on asthma, arthritis, and insomnia.<br><br>Here's a quick list of nine herbs that are easy to grow, followed by advice on how to get started. Holly Shimizu, a renowned horticulturist and garden designer, gives a green "thumbs up" to these.<br><br>1. Mint<br>Aromatic spearmint and peppermint do more than add a little zest to your cup of tea: they are also a traditional treatment for gallstones. The oils of these effective antioxidants ease muscle tightness, and chewing on mint sprigs can relieve an upset stomach.<br><br>2. Rosemary<br>Distinguished by its narrow, spiky leaves and piney scent, rosemary varies in color from shiny dark green to pale gray-green all over. Known as the herb of remembrance, rosemary contains several antioxidants that help prevent aging in cells and may work against Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>3. Lemon balm<br>Also known as melissa, lemon balm relieves chronic fatigue syndrome and can be helpful in treating migraines. A tea made with lemon balm can also work as a sedative and a stomach soother. Its bright green heart-shaped leaves give off a lovely lemony scent.<br><br>4. Thyme<br>Thyme's pungent scent comes from the oil in the small oval leaves. Apply a compress of thyme leaves to the aching muscles in your neck,shoulders, and back if you're prone to tension headaches. A cup of thyme tea taken up to four times a day may be effective against bronchitis and whooping cough.<br><br>5. Sage<br>Available in numerous varieties, sage is a strongly aromatic, bushy plant with spiky purple flowers. Loaded with anti-inflammatory compounds, sage is effective against carpal tunnel syndrome. Steep two teaspoons of dried sage in a cup of boiling water and gargle with it (after it has cooled) to treat mouth and throat inflammations.<br><br>6. Oregano<br>The robust taste of oregano comes from its soft, oval leaves that grow in pairs along the stem. Its power punch of antioxidants can help maintain the immune function of those who are HIV-positive. Good for arthritis, asthma, and emphysema, oregano also contains seven compounds that lower blood pressure.<br><br>7. Parsley<br>A rich source of the bone-strengthener flourine, parsley works to prevent osteoporosis. Apply crushed parsley leaves to reduce the black and blue colors of a bruise. Parsley comes in two varieties: curly parsley and the taller, flat-leaf Italian parsley. Eat a sprig for a quick breath freshener and to aid in digestion.<br><br>8. Lavender<br>Fragrant flowers characterize the spiky leaves and colorful blooms of lavender. Aromatherapists routinely use oil of lavender for pain; mix a few drops of lavender oil with a tablespoon of vegetable oil and massage the painful area. Sprinkle a few drops on your bed sheets to help you sleep, or relax in a warm bath scented with lavender oil.<br><br>9. Catnip<br>The downy, gray-green leaves of catnip are a favorite of cats, so keep this herb off your windowsill if you don't want your cats playing in your plants. A member of the mint family, catnip has a mild tranquilizing effect on most people. Try a cup of catnip tea about 45 minutes before bedtime to induce sleep.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: All these herbs can grow from one to three feet tall, so keep them trimmed. Herbs are safe moderate doses, but like any medicine, some can be harmful when taken in frequent, large doses. Herbal oils are intended for external use only. Keep such oils away from small children who might be tempted to taste them.</span></span></strong><br></div>
