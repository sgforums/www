In term of Relationships, its really very subjective at times neither within our means &amp; control, I think friends around you will appreciate your care &amp; concern for them but again do not be affected by these negativities around you or you will invite &amp; increase the bad vibes in your life...causing you alot of troubles... If you wanna know more about Relationship &amp; linkeage between peoples in term of metaphysical perspective maybe you can have a look in my  <a href="http://magick.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=74516" rel="nofollow">~*~ SOUL MATES ~*~ TwiN FLaMeS</a>...
