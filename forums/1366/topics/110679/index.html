On behalf of ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~, I decided to organise an event to gather all the kind &amp; compassionate people to do our part in helping to heal these sadness, grieves &amp; pain of the victims &amp; families of Tsunami Disaster. There is dawning global awareness of the destructive ecological consequences of our civilizationÂ’s uncontrolled development. That might explain for the cause of recent Tsunami Calamity, Is the Mother Earth angry &amp; hurt? We shall get to the core of these problems by "Healing Mother Earth, Healing the Heart of the Earth"! The best way in which each of us can contribute towards earth healing, is in caring for the planet as a whole. Earth healing practices, projects, and meditations, are one way to help.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/HealingEarth.gif"><br><br>The Â“Earth Mother Gaia HealingÂ” meditation by me, Oceanos, is best if it is performed by as many people as possible while we heal the Mother Earth, Mother Earth &amp; the Universe will heal us of all the pains, hurts &amp; sadness we accumulate through our daily lives at the mean time with intent we will channel these wonderful positive Healing Energy toward the Tsunami victims &amp; families globally! We will radiate these unconditional Love &amp; Healing Energies to all Beings on this Earth. All of us from the White Brotherhood, as well as all the Ascended Masters &amp;  Light Beings from every corners of the Cosmos, will be joining us, blending our energie of Encompassing, Unconditional Love &amp; Healing with us to work towards the same goal to "Help &amp; Heal Victims of Tsunami, Heal Earth Mother".<br><br>I hereby invite everyone to join us in this event irregardless of background, religions &amp; age. We need more people to be able to build a bigger Cone of Power &amp; Healing Energy to be send out from the Universe through us to Mother Earth &amp; every Beings on Earth that in need of these Love &amp; Healing Energies.<br><br>This event is absolutely free except you have to put in some efforts, compassion &amp; time to make yourself available &amp; turn up for the event. All Candles &amp; Incenses are sponsored by me, as for venue i have already found a sponsor, Refreshments wise i would greatly appreciate if anyone could sponsor. Do support &amp; participate in this event &amp; help the Needy doing a good deed by showing Love &amp; compassion to all the unfortunate peoples globally in this New Year 2005. By me alone &amp; all of you in my Haven its not enough, we need more people to be able to channel more Love &amp; Healing Energy. If you cannot make it for the event do send us your Love &amp; Healing energies to us on the day &amp; time of this event no matter where you you are with intent &amp; compassion, it will be greatly appreciated by us, all the victims of Tsunami, the Universe &amp; Mother Earth.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Brightest Blessings,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>
