First, there is the physical body, which you can see and is tangible. It is solid and has a shape, a color and a texture. The second and third bodies are the mental and the spiritual which are intangible and merge with the physical body. Our true nature begins to take on a physical form in our face. It is where our emotions and our state of health are first revealed. And, as Shakespeare pointed out in his play Macbeth: Â“ThereÂ’s no art to find the mindÂ’s construction in the face.Â” For the face is truly an opened book.<br><br>For thousands of years, the ancient sages wondered if our facial features could determine our fate or personality. They began to compile individual studies, one feature at a time, to see if there was a direct correlation between facial features and specific fates. In ancient Greece, Aristotle wrote extensively on physiognomy categorizing his findings into six chapters that included physical characteristics of face, body &amp; voice. The Classical scholars, such as Homer and Hippocrates, wrote of face reading as an ancient method of practical philosophy. In the Middle Ages physiognomy was combined with astrology and became part of the divination arts. By the 18th &amp; 19th century it was used in Europe as a separate study of criminology where facial features were used to identify potential criminals. In the 20th century it was lost to folklore and superstition. But, face reading has reemerged in the 21st century as a guide in psychoanalysis or, as a tool for a competitive edge in the executive boardrooms of corporate America. It is no longer a parlor game. The continuos interest in face reading has given credence to an art that the Chinese have always known has been an important guide in human understanding.<br><br>In China, the father of face reading is often credited to the philosopher Gui-Gu Tze, who lived during the Warring State Period (481-221 BC). His book Xiang Bian Wei Mang is still in print to this very day and is studied by serious students of physiognomy.<br><br>The Chinese art of face reading is a very involved system that classifies facial features individually by judging the color, shape and disfigurements of specific areas of the face. Basically, the face is partitioned into 108 areas. Each area is a specific age &amp; life situation and by observing the Five Elements of the productive/destructive cycle and the Taoist theories of yang &amp; yin, it may be possible to predict events, diagnosis illnesses or to understand a personÂ’s personality.</span></strong><br><br></div>

If you have ever wondered what that mole on your face, neck, back or thigh means, read on.<br><br>Some say that the moles on our bodies are in reality secret imprints carried over from our previous lives, stamps of some past karmic deed meant to ripen in this life, good as well as bad. Others contend that moles are messages of good fortune and misfortune that reflect important turning points of our life. Each noticeable mole on our body carries a hidden meaning, or depicts some secret obstacle or unexpected help from someone.<br><br>In certain traditions, the messages of moles were so significant it could even be read as bringing bad luck to the family, or so highly revered that the member of the family with the mole would be highly revered. Many cultures contend of course that the larger and more prominent the mole, the greater its power. Another widely held belief is that lighter-coloured moles spell better fortune. Here is what the Chinese generally have to say about moles on our body.</span></strong><br></div>

The one on the middle left indicate will bring forth disaster upon you. The one on lower right belly also indicate lonely &amp; unhappy at old age.
