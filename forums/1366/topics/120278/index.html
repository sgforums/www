Such beads were etched black-and-white or brown-and-white, with symbols comprised of circles, ovals, square, waves stripes, lines and various other symbolic patterns. Most dZI beads has shiny black &amp; white design. To the Tibetans, each of these symbols represents a specific meaning. They are precious possession to the Tibetan, with so many fascinating stories of its mystical power attributed to it.<br><br>dZi beads play an important role in Tibetan culture. They have been found also in neighbouring countries around Tibet. In ancient times, dZi beads are precious jewelry which is used for barter trade. Tibetans believe dZi beads to possess the power to bring about good influence associated with protection, prosperity, attracting wealth, fostering good health and ward against evil.<br><br>These beads were etched dating back a few thousand years ago. New dZi beads is said to be those that were etched recently. Since the material used for both the OLD and the NEW beads is Agate, the difference between them lies in the TIMING the etching were done. Formed under the earth a long time ago, Agate is one of nature's precious gifts to mankind and has been well accepted as a stone that radiate good "Energy" &amp; "Vibration",and is believed to bring about good influence associated with protection, health &amp; propserity. The price of dZi beads is based mainly on its quality. The size, the skin texture, the clarity of the etched lines and its overall appeal are among some factors to consider when buying a dZi bead, be it an old or a new piece.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span></strong></div>

Mostly Fakes are made of Glass, Plastic &amp; other synthetic materials &amp; of coz they don't radiate much vibration at all. Even Real DZI beads there are grading whether its a NEW or OLD Bead, Low grade, Medium grade, High grade or Super grade, these Relics are just like precious stones. Slight difference can make vast difference in its value. Well its hard for a layman to see the difference but with a reliable source &amp; if you are sensitive to energy, you can easily tell a difference between NEW &amp; OLD Beads with the explanation of the owner.<br><br>Thanks for your interest &amp; reply, Hope all these answer your queries.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.garudatrading.com/media/DZIMAN.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">There are many interpretations concerning the dzi's origin. Since they are usually found buried in the ground, it is generally thought that they were made and worn by people in prehistoric or neolithic times. There are more mystical interpretations, some being that the dzi were once worm-like insects which, when frightened, froze and turned to stone. Other stories relate how the dzi were once ornaments of the demi-gods who threw away when they became damaged, which accounts for why so few of the beads are in a perfect unblemished state. They were said to appear in miraculous ways, sometimes as presents from local deities to humans who had rendered them service and appearing out of rabbit holes or on bushes which bore them like fruit. The dzi is either worn as a single bead about the neck, mainly for its auspicious or medicinal value, or in a traditional necklace interspersed with coral, pearls, amber or turquoise, or even, if the owner is fortunate to have a collection of dzi, a whole necklace is made from the stones. Dzi are also used when applying gold to thankas or writing in gold, to burnish it and bring out the sheen.<br><br>Many jewels are worn for their medicinal properties. It is said that dzi protects its wearer from strokes and other sicknesses, as well as from evil influences. If, while it is being worn, the bead is in any way damaged or broken, it is taken as a sign that the bead has performed its task and absorbed the shock of the super-natural attack, though the dzi is then rendered useless for any further protection.<br><br>Precious pills or "Fa Yao", which contain most of these ingredients, also play an important part in curing many physical disorders. The Rinchen Ratna Samphel, (the Precious Wish Fulfilling Jewel), is compared to a precious jewel from the king of medicines. It contains over 100 different ingredients including Ngochu Tsothel, (a preparation of purified mercury, surplur and sixteen different metals and minerals developed by the thirteenth century Tibetan scholar, Khedup Ugen Rinchen Pal), as well as seventy other ingredients such as purified gold, silver, copper, iron, lead and lode-stone. More notably the pill contains gems as coral, turquoise, pearls, lapis, lazuli and dzi. The precious jewels are detoxified and then ground into a fine powder to be mixed with a number of other organic and mineral materials.<br><br>The awe and fascination with which Tibetans regard the etched agate beads they call "dZi" must be something similar to ancient man's obsession with beads, which has been revealed in the beautiful specimens that have survived from antiquity. That beads played an important part in the religious, social, and economic spheres of the ancient world is well known. DZi beads occupy a similar place in Tibetan cultural life to this day.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span></strong></div>

It is said that dZi protects its wearer from strokes and other sicknesses, as well as from evil influences. If, while it is being worn, the bead is in any way damaged or broken, it is taken as a sign that the bead has performed its task and absorbed the shock of the super-natural attack, though the dZi is then rendered useless for any further protection. Turqoise is often worn for physical well-being, to purify the blood and protect the liver. A change of colour in a turquoise is said to reflect the state of the wearer's health. It grows paler and greener as the owner sickens, and loses its colour and intensity entirely at their death. However it recovers its beauty and strength of colour entirely when given to a new owner. In much the same way, when given as a love token, its colour remains strong and bright as long as the lover's affection lasts.<br><br>Gems and precious metals also constitute a vital ingredient in making of Tibetan traditional medicines. The reddish-brown pearl is considered the most effective of all the organic and metallic drugs - medicines containing pearls are said to cure brain diseases and extract poison. The cool nature of turquoise is believed to help liver ailments and blood pressure and is said to possess a detoxifying quality. Gold is believed to prevent poison from affecting the organs of the body by causing it to slide down like water poured on a flower petal. Silver is supposed to dry and stop the flow of blood and pus, coral is used for fevers, sapphire for leprosy and extracting poison from the system. Coral is said to help migraine, brain disorders, fainting spells and seizures.<br><br>Precious pills, which contain most of these ingredients, also play an important part in curing many physical disorders. The Rinchen Ratna Samphel, (the Precious Wish Fulfilling Jewel), is compared to a precious jewel from the king of medicines. It contains over 100 different ingredients including Ngochu Tsothel, (a preparation of purified mercury, sulphur and sixteen different metals and minerals developed by the thirteenth century Tibetan scholar. Khedup Ugen Rinchen Pal), as well as seventy other ingredients such as purified gold, silver, copper, iron, lead and lode-stone. More notably the pill contains such gems as coral, turquoise, pearls, lapis lazuli and dZi. The precious jewels are detoxified and then ground into a very fine powder to be mixed with a number of other organic and mineral materials.<br><br>This is but one of many different Precious Pills in Tibetan medicine administered for general well-being as well as specific ailment. The Rinchen Ratna Samphel is said to guard against illness caused by different spirits as well as being an antidote, combatting all types of poisoning, high blood pressure, blood clots, ulcers, primary stages of cancer, strokes and paralysis. Unlike western medicines the therapeutic effect of pills such as these cannot be attributes to one active ingredient. It is the exact combination of the different organic substances and minerals that is of benefit. If one asks a Tibetan doctor how this works it is related back to the four different principles of therapeutic action - the tastes, the eight natural powers, the seventeen secondary qualities and the three post digestive powers.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

It is inconceivable to most Tibetans queried told the same set of stories concerning the origin of dZi. Offered first was the belief that in ancient times dZi were the ornaments of semi-gods who threw them away whenever they became blemished even slightly; this is said to be the reason that hardly any of the beads are found in perfect condition. Next came the story involves a man who saw one of these 'insects' high in the mountains and threw his hat over it to capture it. When he removed the hat, the 'insect' had become petrified. In its place lay a dZi. Other stories relate that dZi were encountered in the high mountains by someone with especially good karma who managed to catch them. But in coming into contact with the human touch, the dZi petrified. Other tales are told of dZi being found in slaughtered animal horns or in cattle dung. Dr. R. Nebesky-Woikowitz (1952) recounts in 'Prehistoric Beads From Tibet,' a legend from Ngari, Western Tibet. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.garudatrading.com/giddydzi.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">It is believed that dZi originated from a mountain near Rudok. In ancient times, they were said to flow down its slopes like streams. One day, however, a wicked woman ;cast the evil eye' on the mountain and the flow immediately stopped. And to this day, so the legend claims, the characteristic black and white stripes of the dZi are still seen where the dZi once issued. The 'insect' theory of the origin of dZi seems to be very widespread and is cited to explain various peculiarities. This, the Tibetan claim, is why sometimes a great number of dZi are found forming a kind of 'nest'. Some believe that even after the beads have been unearthed, some will continue to move about for a little while. In any case, to the Tibetan, the dZi is not man-made bead, but a precious jewel of supernatural origin.<br><br>Because it is magic, the dZi has the power to protect its wearer from catastrophe. Just as jadee is worn to forestall accidents and turquoise is worn to purify the blood and protect from jaundice, so is the dZi worn to ward off attacks by evil spirits which might cause sudden sickness and death. Not only are dZi worn in the traditional (Central Tibet) woman's necklace with read coral, pearls and a gold charm box studded with turquoise but also about the neck on a shot cord by both men and women (and usually faced on either side by a red coral). Women will generally have a few more coral and turquoise beads in this strand as well but the minimal prerequisite is the dZi to serve as protection to its wearer. If the bead should somehow become broken while it is being worn, this is taken as evidence that the bead has done its job and absorbed the shock of the supernatural attack intended for its wearer. This renders the dZi useless for any further amuletic protection. This is why any broken dZi is no longer pure. dZi bead are also used by Tibetan doctors as an ingredient in some of the pills they make to treat epilepsy. An unbroken dZi is made broken and part of it is ground up along with various herbs to make the pills.<br><br>Many stories circulate among the Tibetans concerning persons who have sold a valuable dZi only to fall ill or die sometime thereafter. This causes Tibetans to be very unwilling to sell dZi of high quality even for the high sums which one hears quoted in the market for the various types.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

One belief is that dZi beads were dropped to the earth by gods or other supernatural powers and that they remained animate in the form of insects until captured by humans.<br><br>While there are different stories about tabular-eye beads, almost all groups associat them with protection against the evil eye (a common concern among most early cultures). These beads stir something very primitive and archetypal in all of us and even people who have never seen them before and have no idea of their value are attracted to them. Humans have always been fascinated with their own image and especially with beads that look back at them.<br><br>The type of tabular-eye bead is called Ninda Kar Sum, which is translated as 'sun, moon, and stars, the three.' This powerful symbol represents all the important celestial bodies: sun, moon, and stars and nothing catastrophic is supposed to be able to happen to a person wearing it.<br><br>The Tibetan from whom we purchased this bead was told, 'Put this on and I will shoot you. Nothing will happen. It can't hurt you.' We laughed with our friend because since tabular eyes are much older than guns, they may not have been designed to protect against gunshots. Besides, if the shooter have been wrong, he would have been able to keep our friend's money and the bead!<br><br>Although dZi beads has been around for thousands of years however Prices of dZi beads over the past Decade have steadily risen, especially on the more specialized pieces. Around Four years ago I have heard a story of a car accident in Taipei. Taiwan involving four people. All were killed except the one dZi wearer. The story has escalated since. I read about it a year later as a bus accident and heard it recently in India as a plane crash! Seriously, demand increased as revered Tibetan Buddhist Lamas visited Taiwan and spoke of the many benefits of dZi beads to health and business. Owners of dZi beads have often said to me,'Bring much luck,' and 'do good business everyday.' To them, dZi beads represent both status symbols and hope for the future.<br><br>During one of my overseas trip, i was buying malas (Buddhist rosaries), turquoise and a few dZi, and my friend saw a bead he really wanted. We didn't buy it. Anyway, over a year later, the same bead was offered to us again for a slightly higher price. We were obviously intended to have it, and it was after daily wearing of this bead that we noticed an upturn in our Lives. Is this fate? So who can really say ? </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

Many Tibetans will regard almost any etched agate and some natural agate beads as some kind of dZi, or at least in the dZi family. But not all etched agate beads are regarded as real, or as Tibetans would say, "pure" dZi. Certain patterns found on etched agate beads are universally recognised by Tibetans as belonging to "pure" dZi. These include besides the familiar "eye" patterns (two-eyed, three-eyed,five-eyed,six-eyed,nine-eyed,etc), circle and a square ( "dZi", earth door-sky door" ), a double wave form ( "dZi", round with tiger stripes" ), a configuration similar to a British crown ( "dZi", round, nectar of immortality bowl ), and others dZi with other patterns such as strips, waveforms, and their combinations are generally regarded as real dZi and of Tibetan origin but valued much less highly than the more desirable patterns listed above. The nine-eyed dZi seems to be the most highly preferred.<br><br>There is another set of criteria for evaluating dZi which became apparent in the course of interviewing informants. In addition to a desirable pattern, a dZi should also have a healthy shape. Beads which are too thin ( "anemic looking" ) or are not round in cross section are less desirable. A shiny surface and deep colors increase the value of the dZi. Most prefer as close to a true black and white as possible, although some prefer a deep rich brown. Opacity is a consideration; one should not detect translucence when the bead is held up to the sun. A "pure" dZi should not have internal flaws in the patterning caused by differences in the underlying agate which results in uneven whitening. Finally, the bead may not be badly chipped or broken.<br><br>Lastly, it has been said that the dZi Stones can only be owned by a person with great merit and good karma.<br></span></strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
