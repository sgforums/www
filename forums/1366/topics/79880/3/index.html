Those don't know whole thing, better don't comment. Those not involved better to stay quiet. Those who are supposed to be comforting friends, act as a listening ear and nothing more. What to settle is between them, both are adults. Need not have anyone by the side avenging and smoothing out paths for either of them nor is there a need to describe someone's personality until that terrible. People have feelings too.<br><br>One more thing, susan didn't cry to me. I persistantly asked her what was going on. Reluctant at first to tell, then slowly as she tried to choke the whole d*mned situation out, her eyes went watery, her nose and face reddish and her voice shaky. She was in tears when she finish telling us her predicament. She was still persistant that maybe there was her fault somewhere, at first. Then thought settled liaoz, friends again, skali kena called names somewhere in public. How would she feel?<br><br>She is not a public amusement, nor had she a terrible personality. No need to treat or describe her as either. She did not come to us crying, she came to us with a burden in her heart. She too, wanted to trust, but how too? When she was assured everything was settled, then what happened? If your trust was faulted as such and you, your personality and thinking were described until her state, how would you feel? Would you have taken it lying down like she had tried?
