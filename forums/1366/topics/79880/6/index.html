At the very least, you were smart enough to find a nick that describes u so perfectly. Jumping into a situation without knowing fully what is going on, just so you can feel the heat. Then go around asking people if u really can be sued... If u so scared, then dun chap ji kar lar. self so scared le, still wanna act hero, serve 'justice' ar, who u think u are? Have u at the very least heard what the other side have to say?<br><br>I flamed? Who did I flame? I was somewhat reluctant to post on this matter until I saw this thread. Dun believe, go dig up the blind lead blind thread. Read every page, see my name there anywhere? I replied to this thread coz my name was mentioned by thhong, i replied to sylvia that i too, hope for peace. Then at the same time (so i was abit lazy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) stated that i hope people like U, who have had no whatever to do with the situation, not present in any of the scene, pls stay out! Also telling thhong that susan did not come crying to us. Is i kpo asked her why she looked so terrible, then keep making her say. She say until she cry one lor. People who know susan will know the tremendous amt of stress she already is in lor. This kinda thing, you think she can take meh? I'm not trying to flame thhong lor, just point out to her. First time say her, she upset but public apology.<br><br>Thought was over, then second time, in this forum, someone jie ti fa hui. Insult susan's personality at the same time belittled our believes. Susan saw and was terribly upset but never say anything. Third time, that someone post inside shoutbox, which led to the blind led blind thread. between the second and third time, she was once again called names inside the shoutbox, but that was unfortunately not noted down, so i shall not include it in my analysis here, except to say that- susan did wonder if it did happen. Asked thhong, and was told that thhong never said anything, and susan believed. Then after that tot is settled le, skali few days later in the shoutbox the third incident happen. So... who instigated the post in the shoutbox? Susan posted then the "I forgive" thread and somehow found herself being called a 2-headed snake in the blind lead blind thread... really makes one wonder doesn't it?<br><br>Thhong was hurt, susan was hurt. Bear came in and make a big fuss. In shoutbox maligned susan of purposely hurting her friend. Was unfortunately traced and that was how that thread started.<br><br><strong>Did oceanos or me go into shoutbox or thhong's forum and kick up such a fu(king fuss? </strong>We tried to comfort and console our friend..., then? Someone come in and stomp on our tails, keep on scolding our friend lor. Oceanos too, had been called names but he tolerated it. This time, insult his believe, insult his craft. Inside the blind thread and now again kena said to be adding oil to fire... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> If me also ren wu ke ren, tell me, ur name means nothing to you meh? haiz~ His friend is human, got feeling, mine is not?

Where the heck is he?<br><br>Forget it lar, explain to u also no use. you so determined to be on their side le, haiz~ i wonder why i even bother to waste my time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
