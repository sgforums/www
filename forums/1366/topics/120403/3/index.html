            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>What a beautiful Morning! Didn't sleep much last night, However i don't feel tired at all maybe thats because i am getting old, old people don't need to sleep much.<br><br>So much strifes these days, maybe thats why causing alot of unhappiness around. Shroud with Mist of Chaos everywhere, why is that so? Maybe all these will End with the End of these Mischief Makers who will meet their Makers soon...hahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Again why do i bother? Divine is Fair, They will get their Deserts in a way or another whether its physical or emotional, there is always a price to pay for everything.<br><br>Well nothing is personal in my perspective, many may misunderstood however i simply don't care for I AM the way I AM, even if others misunderstood in any ways, i don't find the need to explain anything as Time will Tell who has Good intent &amp; who has Ill intent. Maybe I AM as controversial as My Craft or simply i have an eccentric way to deal with Things &amp; Stuffs which is simply My Way! Those who knows me will know, trust, have utmost Faith in me as I AM the kind of person who will render unlimited help to those who in needs of it &amp; present my friends with my most genuine friendship not forgetting my utmost faith in them. But at Times in Life you may have mistrusted some so-called friends! At first you try to tell yourself maybe they did not do it intentionally but Time has Tell, Again &amp; Again such crappy shits kept occurring so you start to wonder if you had put the Wrong Faith in the Wrong Persons. Did they do it out of Jealousy or simply because of Fear. Human tends to fear the unknown, Fear of anything they can't seem to understand. However are all these Ill-intented Actions necessary causing so much Chaos, hurting so much people. Are these People "Evil"? Now i would say they ARE! But it don't Matter anymore, nothing more said can help in any ways. There is no need to explain to me or anyone anymore neither anyone can help you in any ways. It has come to the State that nothing can reverse anymore. So my last words to "YOU" is "GoodBye"!<br><br>Hmmmm its great to breathe in the fresh Morning Air....so Relaxing... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
