Quite often Companion Soul Mates will come together for a project such as writing a book, starting a business, or even assisting one to get through a particular trial or lesson in this life. Once the project is finished, often the relationship ends as well leaving both parties scratching their heads wondering what happened.<br><br>Companion Soul Mates can and do join together as Life Partners, especially when the Twin Flame is not present in this lifetime or when for whatever reason the Twin Flames cannot be together in this life. Companion Soul Mates are still in the "teaching each other lessons" mode and this is one of the major differences between a Companion and a Twin, but weÂ’ll get into those differences further on.<br><br>Often Companion Soul Mates are confused with a Twin Flame for sometimes there is not a lot of karma left between the couple, however, whenever there is any karma left to work out then the relationship is still within the boundaries of the Companion Soul Mate realm. Companion Soul Mates have known each other in many lifetimes and have loved many times. Generally when you meet a Companion Soul Mate there is an immediate attraction, Love At First Sight if you will, although sometimes there is the opposite because of the remembered hurts of the past, but this is far rarer. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

Twin Flames love each other with no expectation of the other and with no conditions attached to the giving of that love. It is easy to say that you love someone unconditionally but you need to ask yourself could you love this person if for some reason they could not remain with you? Could you give your love to this person with no expectations, not even that the love will be returned or even recognized? Can you love this person for no other reason than there is simply no other option available to you? If you can answer a resounding (and honest) yes to all of the above then you are experiencing unconditional love. But be careful here my friend for Spirit is listening and may put that love to the test, Spirit may require that you prove yourself worthy of this love and place you in a situation wherein you must truly discover if this is an unconditional love by separating you, sometimes only temporarily sometimes permanently, depending on what lessons you have to learn in this lifetime.<br><br>Which brings us to another point, Twin Flames are earned not a given, you must prepare yourself to be able to join with your twin flame, it is not an automatic, it is a gift. And as a gift, it is truly a privilege to know your Twin Flame but you must be ready. How do you become ready you ask? Well you will have to learn to love deeper than you ever thought possible and that usually means meeting, loving and losing "near twins" which are in reality Companion Soul Mates. Are you brave and strong enough to be able to risk loving with your heart and soul just to have the dream shattered? If not then seeking your Twin Flame is not for you for you must deepen your capacity to love before you can know unconditional love and that means experiencing pain as well as joy. The more pain you have experienced the more joy you are capable of holding within. Sometimes the cup of love must be completely shattered before it can be built strong enough to hold the love of your Twin Flame. Steel is tempered through flame and your heart must be tempered through pain before it is strong enough to protect the love of your Twin.<br><br>When Twin Flames come together they become one, they are not like each other, they are the mirror image of the other. They think alike, they hold the same values and often their life experiences are very similar, sometimes they will actually look like each other. By that they will have similar builds, bone structures and features. This is not however a guide as to whether you have met your Twin Flame or not.<br><br>Twin Flames do not teach each other, they learn together and help each other learn the lessons that have been set before them in this lifetime. When Twin Flames come together they join forces and are capable of overcoming obstacles the average mortal could not begin to face. They are so filled with unconditional love, they literally glow with it and have much to share with others. They are the inspiration that poets write about and singers sing about.<br><br>Another warning I would give at this point is that it is important that we avoid the trap of measuring each relationship against what we believe a Twin Flame to be. For by doing this we lose the opportunity of experiencing all the love that is placed in front of us. Keep in mind that no matter what, if we are to be with our Twin Flame then it will happen and by experiencing the loves placed before us by Spirit we are preparing for the day that we meet this special, special person. We also need to keep in mind that we are not destined to meet our Twin Flame in each and every lifetime. The chances of meeting this one perfect mirror is very slim, it does happen and it seems to be happening more now than ever before, but there are no guarantees.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

A Karmic Soul Mate can be a family member, (Parents, Brothers, Sisters, Cousins, etc.), a close friend, a romantic relationship, basically any relationship that has impacted our lives in any way. With these people, we always have lessons to share and these relationships can at times not be completely comfortable. Although these people invoke deep feelings (positive or negative) we seldom develop a long-term romantic relationship with a Karmic Soul Mate for these are generally more for lessons and growth rather than a life partner romantically speaking.<br><br>The thing to keep in mind here is that Karma comes in positive and negative forms so just because a relationship is "Karmic" it doesn't mean that it has to be negative. Sometimes we are simply here to say thank you or to return a favour given in a past life time. I know that I am repeating myself on this but it is just so important that we remember this small, yet important point.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">How do you know if the one you are with is the right one?</span><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span style="font-style: italic;">By Stephen Petullo</span><br><br><img src="http://www.soulstirring.org/images/anma-soulmates.jpg"><br><br>It is a popular belief that there is one ideal soul mate out there for everyone and if you could just find each other, you would live together forever in bliss. A similar theory is that we all have another half and we are not complete until we unite with that person. Based on my past-life regression research and that of others I respect, I regret to inform you that this is simply not true. Instead, we all have many soul mates and they compliment rather than complete us. Of course, some are much more compatible than others so it is up to us to choose carefully.<br><br>How do we know if the one we have chosen is a good match?<br><br>Sometimes our love lives unfold harmoniously and we have no doubts about our choice of a partner. Other times challenges within the relationship cause us to wonder if it is worth it. If you are questioning a past or current relationship, there are three things you can do to gain more awareness about whether or not someone is right for you.<br><br>1) Find out the karma between you: discover and release the root cause of relationship blocks through past life self-regression. What have you come together to complete? What do you owe each other? What long forgotten past-life events are causing conflict between you now? What specifically do you need to forgive each other for? Simply gaining awareness about the long forgotten karmic reasons for relationship problems can be enough to overcome them for good. If you do not believe in reincarnation, you can still benefit from regression by perceiving information as symbolism during the process or by pretending reincarnation is real, much like you pretend a novel or movie is real when you are reading or watching it.<br><br>2) Stop and look at your love life from a different angle. Use regression, meditation or at least quiet contemplation to get in touch with what you are really feeling. This will help you perceive your situation more clearly, uncover your fears and motivations, and decide on your best approach.<br><br>3) Pay attention to your love life cycles. Each of our love lives follow predictable cycles that can be accurately outlined through numerology. Sometimes your timing will be conducive to compatible, rewarding relationships and at other times it will not be. By observing your love cycles you will know what lies ahead which will help you be prepared and react with love rather than fear. This awareness can also help you take the appropriate action at the appropriate time when you are single and looking.<br><br>Chances are, if you are perceiving the situation clearly and realistically you may intuitively know if someone is right for you. If there is no question, gaining awareness through the methods above will confirm your feelings and will make your bond stronger. If you have doubts, more awareness and clarity about your situation will help you decide what is best for all involved. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
