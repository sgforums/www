            <div class='col-md body'>Ask any witch what they need to cast a spell. Often the answer you get is... well, the witch her/himself, her/his intention, strong focus and will etc, but often it is mentioned that the tools are not a necessity. However, that is subjective and highly debatable. No matter how much people tell you that they do not use tools for a spell they cast, they would more or less own at least one tool under their name, and yes- candles included as well.<br><br>Personally, I subscribe to the believes that tools do hold power and through workings, consecrations etc. will accumulate energy that could actually amplify one's personal energy during workings. Needless to say then, one's ritual tool is a very VERY personal thing. They offer you an avenue for your focus as well.<br><br>Basically, this thread will act as a list of the common tools used and explain a little bit of the tool's background/uses.<br><br>Common Tools:<br>Athame<br>Altar<br>Bell<br>Besom (Broom)<br>Bolline<br>BOS (Book of Shadows- a personal journal recorded with spells, info etc.)<br>Candles<br>Cauldron<br>Censer<br>Chalice<br>Cord<br>Divination tools (Crystal ball, runes, tarot etc)<br>Herbs<br>Incense<br>Jewellery<br>Pentacle<br>Robe<br>Staff<br>Sword<br>Wand<br><br>The above are the most common tools used in workings, and while it is not necessary to have the complete set before starting the working, it is most definitely not advisable that the kitchen knife used to butcher last evening's meal or other mundane tools be used to substitute magickal ones...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Athame</strong><br><br>Pronounced Air-ta-may. One of the more basic tools of a witch and decribed by some as a symbolic representation of a witch's powers. It is traditionally a black-handled, double-edged knife with magickal symbols etched onto either the blade or the handle. Black absorbs power and is said to denote the otherworldly nature of the instrument. The double blade is coz an Athame is said to cut both ways, it can be used to create or destroy. (Reminder of power working 2 ways and of balance) An Athame is used to cut in the astral world, not in the physical. (Although this point is highly debatable). More often than not, the edges of the Athame is kept dull, for practical (and safety) reasons, whilst a bolline is used for any cutting/carving etc.<br><br>Of masculine energy and element fire (altough some traditions do associate it with air), the Athame is an instrument of command and power manipulation. Thus, it is not used to invoke or call upon deities. It can be used to cast a circle, call the watchtowers, used in the Great Rite, initiation etc. A tiny amount of energy is stored into the handle of the Athame during ritual, which can be called upon later. Some people do store energies of a ritual within the handle- for later use. The power stored within is your personal power and thus should not be handled by others. As with most other ritual tools, the Athame's power would increase through your touch and useage.<br><br><strong>Altar</strong><br>Any surface, usually (but not always elevated), that had been suitably prepared and dedicated to ritual work, worshipping or at times decorated to help in path-workings of the individual. Generally in Witchcraft, the altar varies with the seasons, workings and can be as eleborate or as simple as the individual wants it to be.<br><br><strong>Bell</strong><br>Hand bells or chimes are more feminine in energy wise and is used to mark significant moments in a ritual. Also used to invoke the Goddess, elements or entities. Also can be used for protection, prosperity and warning (especially in cases of wind chimes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) If you are not especially inclined to the fae folk, note that the ringing of bells is said to be a great repellent as their ears cannot stand the ringing of bells.<br><br><strong>Besom</strong><br>Besom is a Witches broom. Not the type you use in your kitchen, more of the type you can see the cleaners using on the road. The round bottom is symbolically feminine and the stick is symbolically masculine thus representing a union or a balance. It's said to be made of birch, ash or broom herb with willow binding. Used predominately for cleansing, brusing around the ritual area. Not physically sweeping but more of sweeping the air few inches away from the floor- more of a psychic cleansing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> (It's an effective minor psychic clearing as well as a great stress reliever as you run around in your room batting  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  "flies" from high corners and laughing about how ridiculous you feel and think you look) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Myth has it that if you see a mist surrounding your besom, someone (or something astral) is trying to make contact/has a message for you<br><br><strong>Bolline</strong><br>A curved white handled knife that is used for cutting herbs, cords and inscribing symbols. The white handle (and shape) effectively distinguishes it from the Athame.<br><br><strong>Book Of Shadows</strong><br>Basically a book or collection of notes a person keeps (traditionally and preferably by hand). Comprises of usually well... spells, of course. Other things included are information on magickal symbols, mythological stories, inspirational quotes, own rituals and workings, herbology, dream scenarios, path-workings, meditations, pictures even, favored recipes, DIY info for special projects, potions, lotions, magickal waters, incense recipes and a whole <strong>LOTS</strong> more other stuffs. Basically, is what makes you tick... you get the idea... right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>Candles</strong><br>Search the room of any witch and you'll find candles. Heck, search the room of a non-witch, and you make find loads of candles too, but that is besides the point. Candles are the most basic tool, coz... well, candle spells are the easiest to cast. Effective too. Hand-dipped candles are, of course, more powerful as you can tailor what goes into the candle and you know what went on during the process etc. Remember to annoint, cleanse and charge the candle appropriately before each use. Choose carefully too. Black is used for cursing, or breaking hexes. Yellow for creativity/intelligence. Gold for wealth, represents God. Silver representing psychic powers, Goddess. Red for passion, energy, drive. Pink for soft romantic love or friendship. White represents purity but is supposed to be all-purposed so in case you ran out of the color you desire, can for the moment use white to substitude. The list goes on and on...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cauldron</strong><br>"Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> A cauldron is a tool of transformation, belonging to the water element and representing the feminine. A symbolic representation of the womb, ever fertile, it speaks of immortality, reincarnation and inspiration. Ideally, a cast iron pot with three legs that separates the cauldron from the fire, a stout handle and an opening smaller than the body of the cauldron. Used for scrying and making potions etc.<br><br><strong>Censer </strong><br>An incense burner. Some of them looks like one of the scales, chains connecting to a dish in which the incense smokes. Reason being, some workings, e.g space clearing, would require you to waft the incense smoke in most parts of the room,the chains let you direct the censer where you want it to go, comfortably and without risk of burning your hands. Masculine in energy and belongs to air/fire energy series.<br><br><strong>Chalice</strong><br>A smaller version of the cauldron in the representation of the eternal feminine, of water energy. Used to hold water during ritual, spells and workings, or to hold the ritual wine.<br><br><strong>Cord </strong><br>For cord magick. Some practise wearing it as a belt for their coven robe, with their tools hanged upon it. Usually the color of the cord would symbolise a person's 'rank' in their coven. The cord can be used to mark the diameter of the working circle, used in knot magick, for hand-fasting etc. Some traditons practise that when the witches died, their cords are loosened and buried with them, for it never leaves their possession. To some, it also symbolizes their unbreakable connection with the divine.<br><br><strong>Divination tools</strong><br><br>Things like tarot cards, oracle cards, runes, crystal ball and pendulums are so called divination tools. Used to gain more insights into one self or more commonly featured in hollywood, to see into the future~ Actually, everyday omens or things can also be used for divination, things like tea leaves, cd player, books, maybe even animals or insects, nature is a great source too~ Like a lake, colored rocks or even plain rocks, or maybe a campfire? The possibilities are endless!<br><br><strong>Herbs</strong><br><br>May be made into concotions, teas, brews, potions and baths. The uses of herbs are endless. Things like maybe camomile and lavender to relax, peppermint and eucalyptus to invigorate etc. It all depends on one's creativity in using the herbs/plants. Say rose can be used for love spells, Sage, and lemon, is good for cleansing, dragon's blood can be used for exorcism, Aloe vera is good for burns. Everyone knows at least a few of these~! And Wicca, being closely related to a nature-based practice, utilizes the herbal lore to out best advantages.<br><br><strong>Incense</strong><br>Incense fills the room with a particular smell and can change the mood of a room fast. Light up some sandlewood for a calmer feeling, for instance. Or some strawberry, maybe rose or the more flowery ones to put yourself in a more romantic mood? How about ylang-ylang or even a teeny bit of dragon's blood for that amorous feel? ;p Incenses can help you focus and some can help in ways like cleansing. Incenses are also quite often used as an offering.<br><br><strong>Jewellery</strong><br>Think of a with and see a black cat, cone hat and broom stick, complete with a huge shinning pentacle. Think of a new-age witch, and you get the image of someone so overloaded with jewellery, you get the impression that christmas is coming- even in the middle of march. Jewellery is very personalized thingy, pentacles are good for protection, harmony or even prosperity. The equal armed cross is good for balance and harmomy. A cat pendant can be used for seeking of knowledge and insights, dragons can be used to protect. Rose quartz can be used to find love, clear quartz to amplify, citrine for money or success spells. You get the idea... The thing is, do NOT touch someone else's jewellery without their permission! It is most extremely rude. Usually a witch/wiccan's jewellery is enchanted, by touching, you can be said to 'taint' the piece of jewellery's energy, altering it someway. Causing extra work for the owner, and most times, bad luck to yourself, cause as you come in contact with the jewellery's energy, so does it's energy come in contact with you... Is that too confusing...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being lazy, and since it didn't seem that anyone was remotely interested, I thought to leave this thread in peace <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> However, someone *ahem* <span style="font-style: italic;">kindly</span> *ahem* reminded me to finish off what I have started, so... enough of me nonsense and let's complete the inventory.<br><br><strong>Pentacle</strong><br>Look below, got a post on pentacles already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> and... Nope, it's not evil.<br>Pentacles have been used to symbolise the 5 elements (so-called coz' each of the 4 points symbolizes elements and the topmost point symbolizes spirit). Is used by many as a symbol of powerful protection, as a representation of a faith, or a tool of evocation. In tarot, can be used to represent $ matter, spirituality, and the element earth. Some altars have a wooden/copper disk with a pentacle inscribed, often it is used for charging tiny objects e.g rings, pendants, stones, sweets. Some also uses it to hold food, things like bread, cakes, fruits etc.<br><br><strong>Robe</strong><br>A Robe is something like a cloak that some magickal folks choose to don prior to starting their rituals. It is said that the robe represents a shift of the mindset of an indivudual from mundane to magickal. Indicating a change in states and a conscious decision to move out of the ordinary and enter into a state ready for magickal works. Some says that a robe is used to maintain equality, as underneath the robe is the naked body we are born into and everyone is equal, no social classes. It have also been stated that Robes were used as guises during the burning times so pagan folks could escape to the meeting place for their rites without attracting too much attention.<br><br><strong>Staff</strong><br>A staff is a symbol of authority, smybolizing power, action and the force of will to stand fast in support of our believes and goals. Some may see it as a larger version of a wand and it can be indeed used as such. Staffs and swords are used commonly in dragon magick, among others...<br><br><strong>Sword</strong><br>A sword is a symbol of responsibility. It represents an individual's ability to wield power over the physical and personal aspect of the self, just as it requires balance to hold a broadsword and swing it around without toppling yourself in the process. Also once a sword is set into motion, it is hard to halt the swing and the momentum, just as great care must be utilised when setting some events into action. It can be used to cast a circle and is often used like a huge athame- although it is far more safe to use an athame than a sword during a ritual (think sweeping everything off the altar and almost beheading your fellow covenmates). Swords are also commonly used in dragon magick.<br><br><strong>Wand</strong><br>Wand can be used to bind the energy of a spell together. The Goddess and the God can be invoked with the wand, it is used to direct energy and to draw symbols, and some also uses it to stir their cauldron. The wand and the athame are basically interchangable, and using which one, is at times more of a preference than any other logic reasoning. Wand is masculine in energy and said to represent fire although some traditions would use it to represent air.<br><br>There are many more "tools" that magickal folks use, some are as common as... well... telephones. Some though are less commonly used like... scourges. It all depends on what an individual chooses to use. Which ever the tool, the most important is still the individual her/himself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Blessed Be and May the light of the Gods shine on you.<br>Merry Spellcasting~!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://nightgoddess.com/images/pentacle.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large">The History of the Pentagram/Pentacle</span><br><br>By Lady Hawkwind<br><br>The pentagram, or five-pointed star, is one of the favorite symbols witches and magicians love to use as a symbol of their religion. It has been so widely used throughout the past that the word Â‘pentacleÂ’, also originally meaning a five-pointed star, has become the familiar pentacle often used as a disc or plate of metal or wood, usually engraved with magickal symbols, on many a WiccansÂ’ altars, and used in magickal rites.<br><br>The reason why the pentagram is regarded as the symbol of magick is because its five points represent the Four Elements of Life (Earth, Air, Fire and Water) plus Spirit (or Ether/Aether) the Unseen, the Beyond, and the source of occult power. For this reason, the pentagram should be drawn with the one point up, the point of Spirit presiding over the other four. It is Mind ruling over the World of Matter. The lower four points representing the world, or man, and the higher point representing spirit. In the pentacle, with the star encircled, the circle surrounding the star means the universe, or Cosmic Egg. Symbolically, the entire pentacle means that man is the microcosm (little world) of the macrocosm (the universe as a whole). The four points placed below the upper point represent the physical man Â– Earth, Air, Fire and Water. This becomes the idea of Spirit before Man Â– the seeking of the spiritual, the Mysteries within, returning to the Goddess and God. Placing the two points up, although we remain the microcosm of the macrocosm, it represents more the mundane Man Â– Man before Spirit Â– the seeking of the material, the loss of the Mysteries in search of gain from the world.<br><br>The apple has been revered throughout history as being sacred of the Goddess. In modern mythology, the apple became associated with the Tree of Knowledge, which Eve took and ate. The reason the apple is considered associated with the Goddess is revealed by cutting through the center of the apple. Hidden in the appleÂ’s core, is a natural pentacle. This is the sign of the Goddess Kore (Core) Â– the Greek Holy Virgin, the inner soul of Mother Earth (Demeter). Just as Kore the Virgin was hidden in the heart of Mother Earth and represented the World Soul, so her pentacle was hidden in the apple. Kore is also an alternative name of Kali.<br><br>The pentagram has long been associated with many of the mystery schools, Wicca (Witchcraft) and magick. It is the simplest pattern of star shape that can be designed with but a solitary line; hence it is sometimes labeled "the Endless Knot." Additional titles are "the Goblin's Cross", "the Pentalpha", "the Witch's Foot", "the Devil's Star", "The DruidÂ’s Foot", and "the Seal of Solomon" (more appropriately characterized by the hexagram). It was known as the Endless Knot, because it can be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper, though it requires concentration and care to draw a symmetrical figure!</span></strong><br></div>
