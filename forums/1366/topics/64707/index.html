Pertaining to the guarantor case, I would suggest he get a reading from me to have a more clearer picture of his current situation &amp; i will provide him with a resolution to solve it! As for his sickness, i would suggest him to have healing with me or other healers whom he feel comfy with...However he will also have to continue his medical treatment! Reiki or other forms of alternative healing can only reduce his pain, strengthen him &amp; enhance his chance from being cured completely... I feel currently he is very depressed &amp; negative...his heart chakra is rather blocked &amp; heavy...he has problem with communication with people too... he has suffered from heartbreak previously has also cause him a permanent detriment in a way... This is my intuitive reading about him... Well there is only so much we can do to help him...so ultimately is his choice...he must have the intent to help himself before we can do anything more... Have a nice day!<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>
