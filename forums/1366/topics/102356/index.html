The soul, or the core of the lifeforce that resides within your body(often in the chest and brain), and the energy, which isn't as concentrated and is that field which your aura is made of. The energy is interchangeable between objects both living and non living, where areas the soul is found only in living beings, and rarely would ever leave it's body. Whenever you touch something, hold a conversation with someone, pet an animal, your energy is intermingling and you can come away with more, less, or the same amount as you did before. Living beings can survive without a soul, perhaps explaining comas, but they cannot live without life-energy. For some particular reason, this life-energy keeps the body itself alive, while the soul keeps the mind alive. A Bodiless vampire, as we will now cover, can feed off of life-energy, but rarely feeds off of souls. While taking life-energy from someone, it can be done in degrees to where the person notices nothing to seriously draining them to the point of death. They have a strong presence and can be felt easily, even by a human if they aren't shielding themselves.There are a few different theories on how the bodiless came to be. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

The Bodiless species have the capability to posses a human's body; for the whole life, or for a period of time. When for the whole life, they will absorb the soul of an infants body into their own. Almost all of the time, they will suffer corporeal amnesia. This occurs when for some reason or another, the Bodiless are unable to remember who they are due to a psychic and psychological memory block that the body builds up in defense to its takeover. This block dissolves around the ages of as early as 9 to as late the mid 20s. This is called the Wake, and with it comes the memories of previous bodies, and knowledge of one's abilities and needs for life-energy. Rarely the Bodiless will do a temporary takeover of the body, and when they do, they would choose the body of an adult. At this stage, they would rarely be able to absorb the soul for the adult's soul is too large and set on a particular vibration pattern. Neither could they eject the soul from its body because the body recognizes the soul as its animator and without it would cease to move. If they fail in absorption, The Bodiless will instead cover the soul, and wrestle for control of the body. This is also known as being possessed.<br><br>The Bodiless however can only keep up for so long and is driven off after a time. Possessions that last a long time, even for decades are commonly misdiagnosed as Fugue amnesia because in these particular cases, the Bodiless denies the body's soul of any thought as a means of control. When the possession is over, the person has no knowledge of what happened during then, just like a Fugue amnesiac.When a Bodiless does have control of a human body, the body will remain human, but the Bodiless inside will continue to feed off of the lifeforces of others. Occasionally one will find a Bodiless that feeds off of blood at the same time because life-energy is concentrated around it.<br><br>The Bodiless also have a longer life span than a normal humans when in body. Where areas a normal human commonly lives to be around 70 and can potentially live past 100, a Bodiless who has attained a human body from infancy commonly lives to 100 and can potentially live past 120 while within that body. Outside of a body, it is unknown how long a Bodiless is capable of surviving and it is unknown how long they live in total of all experience in and out of bodies. Newborn Bodiless vampires can be made by a person or vampire learning to take control of bodies and feed from life-energy. This is often done when a Bodiless teaches them, but it has been known that a few (almost always either a vampire or a crossbreed) have learned for themselves</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

It is estimated to become "complete in adult bodies" after "a year to a year and a half...." Adipocere was once thought to be caused by the body's fat turning literally into soap; actually it is due to the decomposition of the fat into insoluble salts of fatty acids, producing a yellowish-white substance popularly known as "grave wax." It usually forms in the face and buttocks, but may affect any part of the body. Depending on the subsequent conditions, the body may eventually take on the leathery effect of mummification, or may in time decompose completely.... (Many of the "incorruptible" bodies of saints are only temporarily preserved and are later found to be reduced to skeletons)....<br><br>In certain European (e.g., Slavic) and other countries the discovery of a preserved corpse may provoke a bizarre response. Some people believe such preservation means the person is one of the "undead," so they may drive a wooden stake through the corpse's heart and then burn the body to end the imagined ghoulish activities of the "vampire".... </span></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: violet;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></strong></div>

His rabid vampire thesis appears in the issue of the journal Neurology released Monday.<br><br>Gomez-Alonso said he had always assumed vampires were fictional creatures from Europe's superstitious past.<br><br>"Then one day I saw a classic Dracula film," he said. "I watched the film more as a doctor than as a spectator, and I became so impressed by some obvious similarities between vampires and what happens in rabies, such as aggressiveness and hypersexuality."<br><br>Gomez-Alonso said he began his research by looking into statistics on rabies symptoms, and found that 25 percent of rabid men "have a tendency to bite others."<br><br>He then went to the history books and found that early tales of vampirism frequently coincided with reports of rabies outbreaks in and around the Balkans, stretching back to a particularly devastating epidemic of rabies in dogs, wolves and other animals in Hungary from 1721-28.<br><br>Ticking down the characteristics most frequently associated with vampires, Gomez-Alonso said he believed he could explain almost all of them as symptoms of rabies.<br><br>The vampire's famous aversion to garlic and to mirrors could be ascribed to hypersensitivity, which comes with rabies infection, according to his theory.<br><br>"Men with rabies ... react to stimuli such as water, light, odors or mirrors with spasms of the facial and vocal muscles that can cause hoarse sounds, bared teeth and frothing at the mouth of bloody fluid," he said.<br><br>In the past, he contended, "a man was not considered rabid if he was able to stand the sight of his own image in a mirror."<br><br>The vampire's voracious sexual appetite and nocturnal habits -- depicted in movies and on television as the suave Count Dracula appearing on a moonlit balcony -- could be attributed to the effect of rabies on the parts of the brain that help regulate sleep cycles and sexual behavior.<br><br>"Hypersexuality may be a striking manifestation of rabies," Gomez-Alonso wrote in his article, adding that "the literature reports cases of rabid patients who practiced intercourse up to 30 times in a day."<br><br>The common association of vampires with animals such as wolves and bats could be explained by the fact that those creatures are susceptible to, and often the source of rabies infection, and can exhibit the same snarling, bloody-mouthed visage as an infected human.<br><br>"It would be imaginable that men and beasts with identical ferocious and bizarre behavior might have been seen as similar malign beings," Gomez-Alonso said.<br><br>He said even the vampire's fatal kiss, the bite itself, could be traced to rabies.<br><br>"Man has a tendency to bite, both in fighting and in sexual activities," Gomez-Alonso says. "The intensification of such tendency by rabies increases the risk of transmission, as the virus is in saliva and other body secretions."</span></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: violet;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

All throughout their lives they produce more and more WVCs yet for many, they never fully become a true Created. As much vampire as they are, most only receive slightly increased strength and partially enhanced senses. A touch of psychic ability may surface as well, and better health and longer living have been attributed to such. Many Partial vampires however are the result of accidents. A person who was feed upon may have managed to cut and mingle some of the vampires blood within their wounds, and there is much evidence that sexual fluids contain enough WVCs within them that they could change a person enough to be considered a Partial. Saliva however is still under speculation as to whether it could serve as a carrier. </span></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Hope all these can answer answer your queries...

Shortly after his death, he began to leave his tomb at nights, and to roam the countryside with a pack of hellhounds, spreading plague as he went. For many days, the country-folk were terrorized thus. No one would go outdoors at night, and everyone was afraid they might have the misfortune of meeting this vampire.<br><br>As terrorized villagers are wont to do, they gathered together to come up with a plan to get rid of this vampire. Many were afraid that "the ignorant among them, if ineffective action were taken, would soon be sucked of their blood by the dead monster. The more cautious, however, prudently considered that possibly, if a remedy were applied too late, the infected air, tainted by continual contact with the plague-bearing corpse, would result in widespread disease and death."<br><br>Ten daring young heroes were sent for. Upon receiving their orders, these men exhumed the corpse, cut it up, and burnt it. The plague ceased immediately following the cremation.

One particular vampire, name unknown, tormented the village of Liebava. The Bishop of Olmutz instigated an investigation. Each night, a sentry would be posted at the top of the church tower overlooking the cemetary.<br><br>One evening, the vampire was spied emerging from his tomb. He draped his shroud across a tombstone and left. The sentry came down from his post and spirited the shroud back up the church tower.<br><br>When the vampire of Liebava came back and saw that his shroud was missing, he flew into a great rage. The sentry called down to the vampire that he had the shroud. The vampire ran over to the church tower and proceeded to climb the ladder. Just as he got to the top, the sentry slammed a hammer into the vampire's head. The vampire fell to the ground, insensible. The sentry hurried down after him and cut off his head with an axe.<br><br>Needless to say, the nightly attacks upon Liebava ended </span></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: violet;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.darkest-destruction.com/ZvioLetBat.gif"></div>

Another i would ilike to add on to this is "They" look younger than their age regardless of gender, never sick their whole life, very Charismatic &amp; Enchanting beings. However encounter with such Bloodline "Vampire" is scarce &amp; very remote. " Psychic Vampires " are what we tend to have alot of encounter with in our Daily lives &amp; "They" feed on Other's Energies, Emotions &amp; Life-force in bid to increase their own. They are the most large in numbers &amp; quite a few of them are practicioners of various Mystic or Magickal Arts of Dark path....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there was once in a book, i read about how the idea of vampirism came about<br><br>i only remember vaguely anyway<br><br>it was said that, at that time, sometimes people lost consciousness, and due to the lack of medical knowledge, they were often written off as dead and buried unknowingly alive. after a while, the victim wakes up, tries to claw himself out of the grave, while biting on his own arm, due to hunger and whatever la<br><br>so that could contribute to the idea of vamps.<br><br>also there are deseases which makes people look really pale, pigment stuff.. or make them adverse to sunlight.<br><br>thats what the book said anyway. some guide to the supernatural. coolest supernatural guidebook i've read.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet dumbdumb!,<br><br>Well What you mentioned is not without facts but did occurred but very remote as in Medical cases. Voodoo Zombies is probably closer to what you cited, they are raised from the dead by Voodoo priest, without free will or a soul to do their bidding. However, one modern theory is that the zombie never really died but was the victim of a drug that lead to unconciousness/malfunction of brain. True enough some Biological Deficiency &amp; Diseases of Mankind can make a person look vampish &amp; intolerant of the sunlight which i did discuss in my VAMPIRE ~ Truth or Fiction ~ Part I. thanks for your reply...have a nice day...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br></div>
