I will post a General Reference on Personal Luck in 2006 for Dog &amp; Tiger soon, so pop by have a look when you are free. The Water Dog is laid-back, instinctive, motivated by self-indulgence and philosophical, clever but lazy. 1986 Tiger Element is Fire. The Fire Tiger is very independent but dramatic, self-reliant, giving, motivated by enthusiasm and is quirky. Dog is highly compatible with Tiger however in this match, there is a clash of Elements. Definitely will have clash of characters that may lead to conflicts.

However unlike other signs, 2006 is your year to learn self-reliance, and to trust your "gut feelings" when dealing with others. Listen to your inner voice which you have been neglecting &amp; kept it inside you.<br><br>Don't confuse that with being impulsive! This is a very bad year to speculate in the stock market, or rush from "couch potato" SLEEP mode to an "iron man" competition, or any other risky activity. Also, if you have a good romance now, don't take your partner for granted, appreciate who you have; Dragons should not look for new romantic partners in 2006, its not advisable.<br><br>Mostly, invest your time and resources in what you already have. By making steady improvements in yourself, your home, your career, and your relationships, you'll be ready for a dynamic 2007.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be.<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

The hard work you've invested in the past is ready to pay off. Doors will open perhaps more than you're used to; don't let that go to your head. Simply accept your fortune with gratitude, and keep working hard.<br><br>There's only one Code Red Sign in 2006: You're likely to attract members of the opposite sex...in droves. If you're already in a relationship, don't think that "new" always means "better." If you're not in a relationship, date only casually in 2006; things may not be what they seem, in romance. Be careful in handling affairs of the heart if not may lead to unanticipated outcomes &amp; results.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

First and most importantly: Don't rush into anything.

Consider your other options, especially in the first few months of 2006.<br><br>The one and only way that you can get into trouble this year is if you confuse windfalls with stable income. Don't loan money; don't invest unless you can lose every cent of it and not lose sleep at night. Don't commit to car or house payments expecting 2006's trends to continue. In 2007, they will level off.<br><br>Conserve everything that comes your way this year.
