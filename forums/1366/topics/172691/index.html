The lunar cycle is about 29.5 days. In order to "catch up" with the solar calendar the Chinese insert an extra month once every few years (seven years out of a 19-year cycle). This is the same as adding an extra day on leap year. This is why, according to the solar calendar, the Chinese New Year falls on a different date each year.<br><br>Chinese New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are celebrated as a family affair, a time of reunion. The celebration was traditionally highlighted with a religious ceremony given in honor of Heaven and Earth, the gods of the household and the family ancestors depending on your Dialect Group, Cultures &amp; Beliefs.<br><br>The Offerings &amp; Prayers to the ancestors, the most vital of all the rituals, uniting the living members with those who had passed away. Departed relatives are remembered with great respect because they were responsible for laying the foundations for the fortune and glory of the family.<br><br>The presence of the ancestors is acknowledged on New Year's Eve with a dinner arranged for them at the family banquet table traditionally. The spirits of the ancestors, together with the living, celebrate the onset of the New Year as one great community. The communal feast called "surrounding the stove" or weilu. It symbolizes family unity and honors the past and present generations.<br><br>Fasten your seatbelt. 2006 can provide some huge and positive leaps forward!<br><br>Chinese New Year starts on January 29th this Year. 2006 is the Year of the Fire Dog.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br></div>

The dog is reliable, loyal, and a little stubborn, but also trustworthy.<br><br>He steps in boldly where work needs to be done, and stays there until it's completed.<br><br>In other words, you have a chance to make steady progress in 2006. Don't put your attention on "get rich quick" schemes like MLM or frivolities.<br><br>Use 2006's energy to move forward towards your written goals, especially your five- and ten-year goals. This Year  can definitely build a foundation for your Brighter future.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">SOLID, LONG-TERM WRITTEN GOALS</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">I stress on written goals, because the Year of the Dog will only support goals that are well thought-out, clearly defined, and fit into your larger plans for your life.<br><br>Invest time and money in the "BLUE CHIP" aspects of your life.<br><br>First, repair anything that needs attention (or will need it in the near future), if you use and rely on it steadily.<br><br>This includes home improvements, car maintenance, classes to advance your career, time with your children, and a regular, weekly "date" with your spouse or partner.<br><br>If you're hoping to fall in love, find a job or career that will last, or move into a house that will be your permanent home, 2006 is ideal. However, be sure that you've set very specific, well defined goals.<br><br>For example, if your goal is a new house in 2006, have you thought about which location it should be in, and which neighborhood? Have you considered how many bedrooms, bathrooms, and the size? Have you at least discussed your plans with your banker pertaining to Bank Loan? Ar you financially capable?<br><br>Every long-term goal that has a serious plan of action with it, can make good, solid progress in 2006.<br><br>However, if you pursue spur-of-the-moment tangents, they may disappoint you just when you're lulled into a sense of security. The Year of the Dog often teaches us to stick with what's tried-and-true, first.<br><br>In 2006, if you don't support the things in your life that you usually take for granted, they can become significant headaches instead. In real life, dogs often bark loudly when they want your attention; if you're neglecting an important area of your life, it will become a priority by mid-2006 if you don't address it early.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Does your wardrobe need adjustment, cleaning, or an update? Have you had the same hairstyle for more than two years? Does your business card represent your career goals as well as what you do right now? Have you optimized your Fame area with symbols of red or fire?<br><br>Look at areas of your life whether personal or professional that you've neglected. If you've been meaning to catch up on your springcleaning, clearing the clutters in your life, tackle it early in 2006. Early adjustments &amp; changes will definitely prevent any unwanted events from happening.<br><br>Dogs and Dog years seems tend to draw a line between what's working and what isn't. There's nothing in between, very direct. Also, a yang year like 2006 can have aspects that seem harsh and unreasonable. Something that has its good &amp; bad. It's black or it's white. It's your path, or it's something you shouldn't even try.<br><br>You can prune your activity list voluntarily, or wait for it to become a crisis in 2006. Stick with your long-range goals and the most productive steps to achieve them.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">TAKE NO RISKS</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">2006 is not a year for risks. For example, the stock market may appear to make stable growth in early 2006, but during the second half of the year, the Year of the Dog may dictate a startling correction in some investments, beware caveat emptor applied, if there is a need to make any investment do it with extra care.<br><br>Windfalls and lucky breaks are possible in 2006, but they're most likely to occur in areas where you've prepared a solid foundation.<br><br>For example, you'll see entertainment stars become "overnight" successes, but most of them have worked hard for it be it three, five, ten or more years to achieve this. (And, if they haven't, the Year of the Dog almost guarantees that they'll vanish as quickly as they leaped into the spotlight.) I see chances some of the Common Popular Idol Faces in the Entertainment scene will disappear in the Year of Dog.<br><br>Likewise, prepare for unusual weather patterns again in 2006. Be sure that your insurance is current if not calculate your finance &amp; get a New Policy. If a disaster or major adverse event struck suddenly, do you have any plan &amp; resolution for your entire family? This year may not be as peaceful as it seem, full of unpredictable changes globally.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Then, break those goals into lesser goals, with steps to take in the upcoming year.<br><br>Those are the areas in which you can make solid, even dramatic progress.<br><br>In Feng Shui terms, be sure that your Fame area is energized with the appropriate colors, elements, and symbols. The other two areas to focus on are Family/Stability (also called Security) and your Career area.<br><br>Energize your Power Position with the color red, or with candles and similar fire symbols.<br><br>Enhance your Feng Shui luck with dog figures, pictures, and symbols.<br><br>2006 can be a year of tremendous foundational work, leading to soaring successes in the future. Or, if you're not prepared with written, long-range goals, 2006 can be a year of spectacular and embarrassing failures.<br><br>If you're ready for 2006, it can be a year of dramatic and sometimes quiet achievements.

The rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog , and boar rotate annually. In ancient China, it was believed that people would have the characteristics of the element and the animal that ruled the year of their birth just as modern astrologists believe that people born under a certain sign of the zodiac will have common characteristics. The dog is associated with benevolence and good fortune. There is a Chinese proverb that says if a strange dog follows you home, your house will be blessed with prosperity.<br><br>According to legends in Ancient times, Buddha asked all the animals to meet him on Chinese New Year . Twelve animals came, and Buddha named a year after each one of them. He told that the people born in each animal's year would have some of that animal's personality.<br><br>People born in the Chinese New Year of the Dog (1922, 1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006) possess the best traits of human nature. They have a deep sense of loyalty, are honest, and inspire other people's confidence because they know how to keep secrets. But Dog people are also somewhat selfish, stubborn and eccentric. They care little for wealth, yet somehow always seem to have money. They can be cold emotionally and sometimes distant at parties. Dogs are compatible with those born in the Year of the Horse, Tiger and Rabbit.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

In other words, quit procrastinating; your resources including minor health issues may not be reliable in 2006, may lead to serious health issues if you choose to neglect them. Plan ahead!<br><br>Also, don't turn to unhealthy habits to relieve stress. I'm especially talking about overspending or at the other extremely obsessive about money. Instead should relax more, take up yoga, meditation, walk on the beach, spend time with your family, go movies, go to concerts, or find other ways to bring peace and serenity to your life.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Romance and financial improvements will open up for you if you shed bad habits. Do not be a willing party involving business or issues that are none of your concern. Most importantly, don't use the past as the basis of your future expectations.<br><br>Don't let stress take charge in 2006. In other words, quit procrastinating; your resources including minor health issues may not be reliable in 2006, may lead to serious health issues if you choose to neglect them. Plan ahead!<br><br>Also, don't turn to unhealthy habits to relieve stress. I'm especially talking about overspending or at the other extremely obsessive about money. Instead should relax more, take up yoga, meditation, walk on the beach, spend time with your family, go movies, go to concerts, or find other ways to bring peace and serenity to your life.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>sounds tempting i must say <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><span class="small">but is it?</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

The Water Dog is laid-back, instinctive, motivated by self-indulgence and philosophical, clever but lazy. 1986 Tiger Element is Fire. The Fire Tiger is very independent but dramatic, self-reliant, giving, motivated by enthusiasm and is quirky. Dog is highly compatible with Tiger however in this match, there is a clash of Elements. Definitely will have clash of characters that may lead to conflicts.
