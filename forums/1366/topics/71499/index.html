The Celtic Dragon deck is devoted to bringing the "radiant, sinuous energy of the dragon" to life within the traditional structure of the tarot. Each card shows one or more dragons interacting in a way that reflects the card's meaning.

Pollack was inspired by tribal and prehistoric art from around the world to draw these pictures and place them within a tarot context. They arose from her encounters with sacred art, stories and places. Each card shows the image in a gold-colored frame with the number and name at the bottom. The suits are aspects of nature: trees, rivers, stones and birds. The royal court cards have been removed completely, replaced by the Place, Knower, Gift and Speaker cards of each suit. The Shining Tribe Tarot was orignally published as the Shining Woman Tarot, after the figure on the World card (see left). Pollack changed the name to honor tribal wisdom and to recognize the "tribe" of tarot lovers the world over. This deck comes with the companion book The Shining Tribe Tarot: Awakening the Universal Spirit (360 pages). Pollack describes each card in detail and also offers a vision of the tarot written in her usual lucid, inspiring style. </span><br><br><img src="http://www.learntarot.com/sq6birds.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">This Deck energy is rather heavy, not recommended for begginner, very Tribal wild feelings!

The original was printed from fine metal engraving plates and hand-colored. The name of the cardmaker F. Gumppenberg is given on the ace of cups (coppe). Tax stamps of the period can be seen on the ace of swords (spade). The card titles are in Italian, and majors are numbered in Roman numerals except for the Fool and Death cards. Numbers for the minor arcana are given in the upper left and lower right corners. The suit symbols follow the Spanish style in that the indiviudal wands (bastoni) and swords are shown separately on the numbered cards. In an interesting reversal of the norm, the Lovers card shows a woman between two men. This deck is published by Lo Scarabeo of Italy.</span><br><br><img src="http://www.learntarot.com/lmmaj20.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">A beautiful Work of Art...Simple yet not shallow at all...A rather White deck...For one who are interested in getting a deck with a more balance energy!

The four characters are the four Hebrew letters that correspond to YHWH and are transliterated IAUE or Yahweh. Yahweh is the name of the Almighty Father in Heaven that people commonly call "The LORD" or "God". The reason we see "LORD" and "God" in our bibles is because of a Jewish tradition that the name Yahweh was not be spoken for fear that the name be blasphemed. However, the scriptures declare that His name should be exalted (e.g. Ps 68:4) and the third commandment forbids this practice. The Preface of some bibles will admit why they change His name. Nearly all will cite tradition and familiarity as the reason. This, I believe is wrong. Sometimes people pronounce the tetragrammaton as "Jehovah". But Jehovah could never be the right pronunciation. On this web site, the name of Yahweh is used in reference to the Heavenly Father because in the scriptures we are told to praise, exalt, bless, love, teach, preach, anoint, assemble, believe, give thanks, honor and call on His name.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ Magical Sliver Pentacle Series ~*~</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">~*~Tetragrammaton Pentacle ~*~<br><br><img src="http://www.silverenchantments.com/images/Pentacles/tetragramaton_1661_3.8-150.jpg"><br><br>One of the most important texts of occidental magic was Eliphas Levi's "The Magic Ritual".<br><br>It is the source of this pentacle, believed by many to be one of the most powerful pentacle designs ever conceived - sometimes known as the Tetragrammaton.<br><br>"Tetragrammaton" is a Greek word that represents the letters Y. h.

J. Conway says that the idea for the Celtic Dragon Tarot came to her while working on her book Dancing with Dragons. Conway asked artist Lisa Hunt to help her realize her vision as the two of them had worked together on the Shapeshifter Tarot. This new project turned out to be a labor of love for both of them. The Celtic Dragon deck is devoted to bringing the "radiant, sinuous energy of the dragon" to life within the traditional structure of the tarot. Each card shows one or more dragons interacting in a way that reflects the card's meaning. The images draw on the landscapes, symbols, history and culture of the Celtic countries Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The Celtic Dragon deck is only available as a boxed set that includes the book A Guide to the Celtic Dragon Tarot also by Conway. </span><br><br><img src="http://members.aol.com/LisaHunt67/Images/4CD.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">I got one of this Powerful, yet beautiful Deck &amp; i love it, I work very well with Dragon energy!
