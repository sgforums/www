It is not an evil symbol and does not represent the devil or Satan.  The Pentacle is an ancient symbol dating back tens of thousands of years.  It's five points representing the Elementals.  The four lower points denote the Elementals of Earth, Air, Fire and Water with the fifth top most point signifying Akasha - the Spirit or the Divine force that creates life from the four Elementals.  The circle around the pentacle symbolizes wholeness, protection and the unending cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth.<br><br>~*~ Tetragrammaton ~*~<br><br><img src="http://www.actosdeamor.com/image135.gif"><br><br>This is four Hebrew letters (Yod, He, Waw and He) called the "Tetragrammaton". The four characters are the four Hebrew letters that correspond to YHWH and are transliterated IAUE or Yahweh. Yahweh is the name of the Almighty Father in Heaven that people commonly call "The LORD" or "God". The reason we see "LORD" and "God" in our bibles is because of a Jewish tradition that the name Yahweh was not be spoken for fear that the name be blasphemed. However, the scriptures declare that His name should be exalted (e.g. Ps 68:4) and the third commandment forbids this practice. The Preface of some bibles will admit why they change His name. Nearly all will cite tradition and familiarity as the reason. This, I believe is wrong. Sometimes people pronounce the tetragrammaton as "Jehovah". But Jehovah could never be the right pronunciation. On this web site, the name of Yahweh is used in reference to the Heavenly Father because in the scriptures we are told to praise, exalt, bless, love, teach, preach, anoint, assemble, believe, give thanks, honor and call on His name.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ Magical Sliver Pentacle Series ~*~</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">~*~Tetragrammaton Pentacle ~*~<br><br><img src="http://www.silverenchantments.com/images/Pentacles/tetragramaton_1661_3.8-150.jpg"><br><br>One of the most important texts of occidental magic was Eliphas Levi's "The Magic Ritual".<br><br>It is the source of this pentacle, believed by many to be one of the most powerful pentacle designs ever conceived - sometimes known as the Tetragrammaton.<br><br>"Tetragrammaton" is a Greek word that represents the letters Y. h.

J. Conway says that the idea for the Celtic Dragon Tarot came to her while working on her book Dancing with Dragons. Conway asked artist Lisa Hunt to help her realize her vision as the two of them had worked together on the Shapeshifter Tarot. This new project turned out to be a labor of love for both of them. The Celtic Dragon deck is devoted to bringing the "radiant, sinuous energy of the dragon" to life within the traditional structure of the tarot. Each card shows one or more dragons interacting in a way that reflects the card's meaning. The images draw on the landscapes, symbols, history and culture of the Celtic countries Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The Celtic Dragon deck is only available as a boxed set that includes the book A Guide to the Celtic Dragon Tarot also by Conway. </span><br><br><img src="http://members.aol.com/LisaHunt67/Images/4CD.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">I got one of this Powerful, yet beautiful Deck &amp; i love it, I work very well with Dragon energy!

The four characters are the four Hebrew letters that correspond to YHWH and are transliterated IAUE or Yahweh. Yahweh is the name of the Almighty Father in Heaven that people commonly call "The LORD" or "God". The reason we see "LORD" and "God" in our bibles is because of a Jewish tradition that the name Yahweh was not be spoken for fear that the name be blasphemed. However, the scriptures declare that His name should be exalted (e.g. Ps 68:4) and the third commandment forbids this practice. The Preface of some bibles will admit why they change His name. Nearly all will cite tradition and familiarity as the reason. This, I believe is wrong. Sometimes people pronounce the tetragrammaton as "Jehovah". But Jehovah could never be the right pronunciation. On this web site, the name of Yahweh is used in reference to the Heavenly Father because in the scriptures we are told to praise, exalt, bless, love, teach, preach, anoint, assemble, believe, give thanks, honor and call on His name.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ Magical Sliver Pentacle Series ~*~</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">~*~Tetragrammaton Pentacle ~*~<br><br><img src="http://www.silverenchantments.com/images/Pentacles/tetragramaton_1661_3.8-150.jpg"><br><br>One of the most important texts of occidental magic was Eliphas Levi's "The Magic Ritual".<br><br>It is the source of this pentacle, believed by many to be one of the most powerful pentacle designs ever conceived - sometimes known as the Tetragrammaton.<br><br>"Tetragrammaton" is a Greek word that represents the letters Y. h.
