The feeling or Energy surge you felt is the Energy of you Mojo Bag that is reactivated after my Recharging &amp; its remerging &amp; infused into your Aura(Etheric Body), Warm feeling is felt when the Energy has already settled in, do not be alarmed by it!<br><br>Well Sharp Energy is too strong...Over active &amp; prickly which in a way good as it can protect you well but however may cause harm or problem to others who touch your Mojo bag thats the reason why i told you Mojo bag are very personal do not let others touch it! Anyway i have already calmed its energy down when i did the recharging on it &amp; enhance its intents &amp; energy which you want for its purposes!<br><br>I did recommend to you my Own House brand ~Magickal Incense~ which can Cleanse &amp; recharge your Mojo bag from time to time, you can have a look in <a href="http://magick.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=71499" rel="nofollow">~*~ EsOtErIC AlChEmIsT StOrE ~*~ </a>, There are 5 types of Incense empowered for different magickal purposes!
