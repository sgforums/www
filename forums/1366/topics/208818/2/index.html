They now meet twice a month to investigate and search for<br>paranormal activity in Milton Keynes.<br><br>Karen said: "Some of the people are 'sensitive' so they can hear or<br>feel spirits in the room - that's how they help us.<br><br>"Other people can act as a medium to contact the spirits."<br><br>At the end of the investigations the group collates the information<br>and look for any conclusions.<br><br>But Karen is aware that a good sense of humour is crucial.<br><br>"We are really weird and spooky people," she joked.<br><br>Halloween"They are a great bunch of people and we have about 10-15 core members.<br><br>"When we go out to some places there's nothing there.<br><br>"Even if you go in you have to have the understanding that it could be fake.<br><br>"We find out what it is rather than saying it's paranormal straight away.<br><br>"A door could slam if someone left the window open.<br><br>"It could be a fox and not a Banshee."<br><br>On Friday night they will spend four hours searching Bletchley Park.<br><br>Previous investigations have lasted up to nine hours and involve the<br>use of sophisticated thermal cameras.<br><br>Karen said: "We do it at night, not because that's when the spirits<br>are out but because it is a lot quieter and there is less disturbance.<br><br>"One night we stayed in Bletchley Park until 7am when a mist came out<br>and then suddenly disappeared.<br><br>"And we saw lots of activity up at the Black Horse pub in Great<br>Linford. If your house is old then we could come over and we would<br>probably find something." But Karen offers some assurance for people<br>who believe their house may be haunted.<br><br>She said: "I got into it because I had a little girl who lived in my<br>house and 'passed over'.<br><br>"I was living by myself and it scared the hell out of me, but then I<br>started talking to her and it all stopped. When you get into spiritual<br>work you get into a different side of it, like messages from the grave<br>that allow people to know they are ok."<br><br>But there are dangers for anyone who tries to tamper with the 'other<br>side'. I don't do Ouija boards because unless you're in total control<br>you are opening the door up to anyone," Karen warned. You could get<br>someone who's not a very nice person and because you can't close the<br>door they could stay with you.<br><br>"You should only do it in a controlled environment."</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Ghosts and necropants</span></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Museum of Sorcery &amp; Witchcraft in west Iceland, where visitors can observe obscure magical objects and learn how to scotch ghosts, is steadily growing in popularity.<br><br>The Witchcraft Museum in HÃ³lmavÃ­k, Strandir, opened in 2000. Â“The Strandir area has always been notorious for witchcraft and that sparked the idea of the museum,Â” Sigurdur Atlason told icelandreview.com. He is the manager of Strandagaldur, the company behind the museumÂ’s exhibitions.<br><br>The Witchcraft Museum has gained popularity in recent years, last year it had 8,000 visitors. So far mostly Icelanders have visited the museum, but tourists are becoming increasingly interested.<br><br>Â“All the information is in Icelandic, English, German, French, and by next summer in Italian too,Â” Atlason says. He adds: Â“It is important to us that tourists from all nations can enjoy the exhibitions.Â”<br><br>In HÃ³lmavÃ­k visitors can learn about the witch hunt in Iceland in the 17th century, take a look at magical objects on display and take part in scotching ghosts on special ghost days. The most popular object in the museum are the so-called necropants.<br><br>Â“Necropants are part of a complicated sorcery for gaining money,Â” Atlason explains. Â“The owner of necropants had to make a deal with a male friend while still alive about digging up his body after a natural cause of death, skinning it below the waste and wearing the skin as necropants.Â”<br><br>Atlason continues: Â“Then the necropants-owner would have to steal money from a poor widow and draw a magical symbol on a piece of parchment. After placing both in the necropantsÂ’ Â‘pouch,Â’ the owner would magically come into possession of money.Â”<br><br>The original idea of the Witchcraft Museum was to spread the exhibitions out over the Strandir area. Apart from HÃ³lmavÃ­k there is a magical exhibition in BjarnafjÃ¶rdur fjord called the SorcererÂ’s Cottage.<br><br>Two other exhibitions are planned: One in TrÃ©kyllisvÃ­k inlet, where sorcerers used to be burned alive, and another one in HÃ³lmavÃ­k to be finished in 2011, comparing the witch hunt in Iceland and in the rest of Europe in the 17th century.<br><br>Â“In Iceland mostly men were accused of witchcraft, while in Europe mostly women were burned alive after being condemned as witches,Â” Altason says. </span></strong></div>

He does, however, have a big one in his living room. It's brown, weighs some 40 pounds and is hollow in a few places. Oliver said he thinks it's worth big bucks. ''This is no ordinary rock,'' he said. At a glance, local geology buffs haven't been able to identify the rock Oliver came across while clearing underbrush on property in north Abilene. ''It's about to drive me crazy,'' Oliver said. ''I want to find out what it is.'' Months ago, ''I picked this thing on up and I thought, 'What the ... ''' Oliver said. Because the rock looked so odd, Oliver said, he took it home and hosed it off. It's smooth but not perfectly round and about a foot and a half in diameter. Oliver said he took it to the geology departments at Hardin-Simmons University and McMurry University. Professor Richard Schofield said that in his 22 years with McMurry's geology department, he's never seen anything like it. In looking at the rock, he couldn't determine its composition, age or origin. Its partial hollowness could be from weathering, Schofield said. As for its value, Schofield said, ''It could be nothing, but I can't say with any certainty.'' He suggested Oliver send the rock to Texas A&amp;M University, where staff could cut a sample to study.<br><br>Charles Lightfoot, a longtime member of the Central Texas Gem and Mineral Society, said the most common rocks in the Abilene area are fossils and agate, a striped gemstone. ''It's hard to say what he found,'' Lightfoot said without having seen Oliver's rock. A diamond in the rough, Oliver likes to think.</span></strong></div>
