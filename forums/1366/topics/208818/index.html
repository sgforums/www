But I Didn't'</span></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Barely school-age when relatives labeled her a witch, Naomi found herself cast out on the streets. Her story is a common one in Congo.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By Edmund Sanders, Times Staff Writer<br>August 29, 2006 </span><br><br>KINSHASA, Congo Â— Naomi Ewowo had just lost her parents when her family branded her a witch. She was 5.<br><br>After her mother and father died unexpectedly less than a month apart, Naomi's care fell to relatives who struggled to cope with the tragedy. They sought counsel from a neighborhood "prophet," who warned that a sorcerer was hiding in their midst. Soon all eyes turned on the family's youngest, most vulnerable member.<br><br>"They blamed me for killing my parents," said Naomi, now 10, nervously swinging her short legs under the seat of a chair. The girl eventually was cast out by relatives and lived on the streets until she moved to a rescue center three months ago.<br><br>"They say I ate my father. But I didn't. I'm not a witch."<br>On a continent where belief in black magic and evil spirits is common, witch hunts are nothing new, usually targeting older, unmarried women. But in the Democratic Republic of Congo, there's a new twist to this ancient inquisition. A majority of those said to be involved in witchcraft and sorcery are children, and such allegations against them are the No. 1 cause of homelessness among youths.<br><br>Of the estimated 25,000 children living on the streets of Kinshasa, the capital, more than 60% had been thrown out of their homes by relatives accusing them of witchcraft, child-welfare advocates say. The practice is so rampant that Congo's new constitution, adopted in December, includes a provision outlawing allegations of sorcery against children.<br><br>A rise in religious fundamentalism, revival churches and self-proclaimed prophets is one cause. More than 2,000 churches in Kinshasa offer "deliverance" services to ward off evil spirits in children, the group Human Rights Watch says.<br><br>"Some prophets who run these churches have gained celebrity-like status, drawing in hundreds of worshipers in lucrative Sunday services because of their famed 'success' in child exorcism ceremonies," the group said in an April report.<br><br>But chronic poverty is the real culprit, some experts say. Decades of dictatorship, instability and war have unraveled the nation's social fabric, tearing apart traditional family and tribal support systems. It's no coincidence that the vast majority of accused children come from poor, broken homes. Most are orphans or have lost one or both parents to divorce or abandonment.<br><br>When relatives are unable or unwilling to cope with an additional mouth to feed, they may look for ways to get rid of the child, said Charlotte Wamu, a counselor at Solidarity Action for Distressed Children, which assists street children. In Africa, kicking out a family member, even a distant relative, is considered shameful, but allegations of witchcraft provide a convenient and hard-to-disprove justification.<br><br>"It's always the stepmother who finds witchcraft in the stepchild, not in her own," Wamu said. "The sorcerer is your dead brother's child, never yours."<br>Naomi, the only child of her father's second marriage, said his family never accepted her or her mother.<br><br>When Naomi's parents died in 2001, relatives took her from one prophet to another searching for a way to cast out her "evil spirits." Sometimes the exorcism consisted of a quick prayer, other times it was more involved.<br>One preacher locked Naomi in a room for three days without food or water, the girl recalled. "I wanted to try to sneak some water, but I thought that would only make my problems worse," she said.<br><br>She was probably right. Child-exorcism ceremonies can include brutal treatment, including beatings, burnings and the use of saltwater, orally and anally, to "purge" the children, the group Save the Children says.<br>One self-described prophet in Kinshasa, Pakoki Keni Emmanuel Suliman, began an interview with a robust prayer and ended it with a sales pitch for black-market diamonds, which he kept tucked inside his wallet.<br>From his Promised Temple church, which he runs from his home, Pakoki showed off one of his clients.<br><br>"Did you let the evil spirit back inside you?" the burly, bearded preacher bellowed at a quivering 9-year-old boy. "You must confess! Tell the truth! Then I will pray for you one more time." The boy dutifully confessed that since his last exorcism he had "killed" two people. His older brother has been treated several times as well.<br><br>Pakoki said he never accepted money, though relatives were required to buy white sheets, at $18 apiece, which were waved and draped around the children during the exorcism.<br><br>"I pray and they are cured," he said.<br><br>The forced confessions leave many children confused and guilt-ridden.<br>"They start to believe they've done something wrong or that they really are witches," said Evariste Kalumuna, head of the rescue center that took Naomi off the streets. He said that when he disciplined the children, they sometimes threatened him with their so-called powers.<br><br>"They say: 'Look out. I'm a witch. I'll hurt you,' " Kalumuna said. "Believe me, if they really were witches, I would have been dead a long time ago."<br>When asked recently, Naomi at first insisted that she didn't believe in witchcraft. Later, she accused her paternal grandfather of sorcery, saying he visited her and her mother in their dreams.<br><br>With a low, raspy voice and intense almond-shaped eyes, Naomi is a natural storyteller, reenacting her mother's death-bed scene as though it were the plot of one of the Nigerian soap operas she occasionally gets to watch on television. She imitated her mother's frail voice crying out the grandfather's name before dying.<br><br>Such dramatic tales have worsened relations with the family.<br>"We're convinced she's a witch," said Rachel Nazombo, 25, Naomi's eldest half-sister.<br><br>Naomi's eight half-siblings share two cramped rooms in an eastern Kinshasa slum. Proudly displayed on the living room wall is a magazine advertisement for something the family can only dream of: a Western-style kitchen, with a stainless steel oven and wood-paneled cabinets.<br><br>The siblings say the death of their father and Naomi's mother is proof of witchcraft. Even in a country where life expectancy has dropped to 42 years because of disease and poverty, premature death is often difficult to accept. Two deaths occurring so close together can only be caused by an evil spell, the family members say.</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">What is their evidence against Naomi? Local preachers and prophets confirmed their suspicions, they say. And a 3-year-old cousin once screamed Naomi's name during a nightmare. According to the family, Naomi also confessed to witchcraft when confronted during a family meeting a year ago.<br><br>When told that Naomi denied being a witch, Nazombo shook her head.<br>"She's hiding herself," the sister said. "You don't understand how tricky people who live in the night can be."<br><br>After her family threw her out, Naomi survived on the streets by selling what little extra clothing she had. Later she sold charcoal and resorted to robbery before being brought to the center by an outreach worker who had found her.<br>Wamu, her counselor at the center, began visiting the family to discuss reunification. Relatives stiffened when they saw Naomi and Wamu approach. Some refused to even look at the girl.<br><br>On a recent evening, Wamu returned for her fifth visit, this time without Naomi.<br>"The family should live together," she pleaded.<br><br>"We want to help her find a better life, but first she must cast out the bad spirits," Naomi's older half-brother responded. "She refuses to be helped."<br>Before accepting Naomi, the family wanted several preachers to verify that she was not a witch. Wamu discouraged the idea, knowing that eventually they would find a prophet who claimed to see evil spirits. Instead she emphasized the family's obligations to the girl.<br><br>They sat quietly for a moment. "We know it's our responsibility," said Flory Nazombo, 23, the eldest male in the family. "She's our sister. We can't abandon her." He promised that someone in the family would visit Naomi to discuss coming home.<br><br>Wamu nodded and wrote out her telephone number for the young man. It was the opening she had been looking for.<br>As she left the home, Wamu was flush with hope, though fewer than half of attempted reunifications succeed.<br><br>"I think we made some real progress tonight," she said. "It went well."<br>Three weeks later, no one from Naomi's family had visited her. The brother had not called. And Wamu was making plans for a sixth visit.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">" A rise in religious fundamentalism, revival churches and self-proclaimed prophets is one cause.

Some accuse it of being un-Islamic, while others have denounced the items as fakes.<br><br>The exhibition has drawn tens of thousands of visitors. Officials say the approximately 100 items on display include a preserved mermaid; the shrivelled skeletal remains of a half-woman, half-snake; a goblin trapped in a bottle; and other creatures from Malay folklore.<br><br>Amzah Umar, chairman of the Selangor Museum Board, said the organizers and the owner of the exhibits have agreed to Ripley's request to examine the items.<br><br>"They have written to us for permission to analyze the items. A team from U.S. will be coming to conduct scientific tests," he told The Associated Press. "This will put to rest any allegations that the exhibits are fake."<br><br>He didn't say when the tests would be conducted.<br><br>Syed Abdullah Al-Attas, a popular ghost hunter and head of the Paranormal Seekers Malaysia group, on Wednesday lodged a police report against the museum, demanding the exhibition be shut down immediately because the exhibits were merely replicas and animal carcasses.<br><br>The items belong to religious teacher Safuan Abu Bakar, who was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper on Friday that he planned to bring a "langsuir" - a deadly Malay banshee - to life in three weeks to silence doubters.<br><br>"We are currently facing opposition from religious bodies but I will bring the exhibit to life. I will place the langsuir on a tree and bring it to life to let observers see it fly and screech," he was quoted saying.<br><br>Safuan could not be reached for comment.<br><br>Amzah stood firm on the museum's decision to hold the exhibition.<br><br>"Our exhibition is aimed at educating the public on the existence of the supernatural world. It is not against Islam. We should take it as education and entertainment," he said.<br><br>The exhibition is expected to end Oct. 4, but Amzah said the museum may close it by Sept. 15 ahead of the Ramadan fasting month for Muslims, who make up about 60 per cent of Malaysia's 26 million population.<br><br>"It's not proper to hold such an exhibition during fasting month," he added.<br>The museum has said it expects a million visitors to the exhibition.</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;"><span class="large">Practitioner of ancient folk healing advertises on TV</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By David A. Fahrenthold</span>, WASHINGTON POST </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">CHELSEA, Mass<br>THE healer's commercial turns up occasionally on Spanish-language television here, slipped in among spots in which a telephone calling card hops around a giant map of Latin America, or in which a young girl's ear-splitting shrieks describe getting satellite TV channels Gratis! Gratis! Gratis!<br><br>His ad, in contrast, starts out so somberly it appears that it should be for antidepressants. "If it feels like the roof is falling in on you ..." a voice says as a picture of a woman with head in hands is shown.<br><br>Then, things get a little weird: The commercial shows a statue of the Virgin Mary, another statue of an Indian in a headdress, a plate with apples arranged on it. The announcer talks about brujeria Â— witchcraft Â— love, and a man called Hermano Santa Cruz.<br><br>"Money comes in, and good luck returns," with his help, the ad promises. Then, in the manner of any good personal-injury lawyer, the commercial ends by showing the addresses and phone numbers for two local offices.<br><br>"Brother Holy Cross" is probably not the only person in Greater Boston laying claim to a centuries-old tradition of religiously tinged folk healing, which has survived in America's Latino diaspora despite years of hoaxes and scams perpetrated in its name.<br><br>But he does seem to be the only one with his own commercial.<br><br>"I'm always leery about people who do things like that," said Elizabeth de la Portilla, a professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, after she was told about the ad. De la Portilla has studied practitioners of these healing traditions, who are often called curanderos after the Spanish verb curar, to cure.<br><br>A bit of background: Experts say there are many folk-healing traditions in Latin America and the Caribbean, born out of the collision of Old World and New World religious beliefs and medical traditions. Historically, the healers were used by rural people who didn't have access to doctors, or by people who were seeking treatment for conditions that modern medicine didn't recognize, such as a baby made fussy or ill by the evil eye.<br><br>Now, de la Portilla and other experts said, the healers are still sought out in some Latino communities around the United States, often for physical ailments as well as problems with relationships and work. They can offer prayers, teas made with mint, chamomile or other herbs Â— or simple talking.<br><br>"People want magic. What they don't understand is that there is no magic. It's work," said de la Portilla, explaining that often a healer's most powerful skill is asking questions and helping clients talk about their problems. "The point is to get you to heal yourself."<br><br>Or, as Bertha Valdez, a curandera in San Antonio, said: "All the problems are inside of our head, OK?"<br><br>But one thing about their profession hasn't changed: Because healers are supposed to be located through family connections or word of mouth, it is still considered bad form to advertise. People who do, often through ads in Spanish-language newspapers or appearances on talk radio, are often thought to be scam artists who promise healing but really just want to fleece their clients.<br><br>So, then, to ask Hermano Santa Cruz himself. One of the addresses in his commercial is in Chelsea, a heavily Latino suburb of Boston. The Chelsea office turns out not to be an office at all but a ground-floor apartment decorated with Christmas ornaments and weavings of the Virgin Mary.<br><br>The first time a reporter visited, he was ushered into a back bedroom, where a man wearing a white doctor's coat sat behind a small table. The healer said he was too busy to talk. He said he would call. He did not call.<br><br>The next day, though, when a reporter called back, Hermano Santa Cruz said he had five minutes.<br><br>He explained the kinds of things people sought him out for: problems at home, problems with children, "strong negative energies." He talked about the kinds of healing he offers: repetitions of Catholic prayers, and treatments using sunflowers and apples and white sugar.<br><br>"There are people who believe" in these methods, said Hermano Santa Cruz, who said he is Colombian. "There are people who don't believe. It's like religion."<br><br>And the most important question of all: Why is someone in his line of work advertising on television?<br><br>To this healer, though, the apparent cardinal sin didn't seem to be a big deal.<br>"Porqu no?" he asked. "Why not?" </span></strong></div>

They now plan to have a contractor construct a plaque with the Wiccan pentacle _ a circle around a five-pointed star _ to be added to the Veterans' Memorial Wall in Fernley.<br><br>"The VA still has not determined yet if a Wiccan symbol can go on the headstone," said Tim Tetz, executive director of the Nevada Office of Veterans Services.

Dark and light.<br><br>Through lace curtains, a shaft of light casts an eerie glow onto the<br>altar. A spindly, wooden red devil dominates the table, towering over<br>the potbellied Hindu elephant deity Lord Ganesha and statuettes of<br>Merlin, Buddha and Shiva.<br><br>This is the room where Ignacio Cobix casts spells of life and death,<br>love and spite.<br><br>His timber house is a block from Lake Catemaco, where Mexicans come for<br>boating, fishing, bird-watching and spiritual cleansing. Catemaco is one<br>of three major villages in the Los Tuxtlas region south of the port of<br>Veracruz. Like neighboring San AndrÃ©s Tuxtla and Santiago Tuxtla,<br>Catemaco is shaped by virescent volcanoes and magic realism. Here, hexes<br>and blessings are muttered in the same breath.<br><br>Myths and legends flourish as lushly as the waterlilies in the lagoon:<br>Tales of water spirits. Tales of la Virgen del Carmen. Tales of the devil.<br><br>"You have bad energy around you,'' Cobix tells me in Spanish. "You need<br>a cleansing.''<br><br>Tonight is supposedly ideal for an aura cleansing. The magic will be<br>strong when midnight ushers in the most important day of the year for<br>the residents of Los Tuxtlas.<br><br>"The people believe that the first Friday in March is the first day of<br>creation, the first Friday in history," local anthropologist and<br>raconteur Raymundo GonzÃ¡les says. "It's a potent day for magick. All the<br>high witches are here for the gathering tonight."<br><br>Every year, witches convene for the annual Brujos Convention in<br>Catemaco, an area many regard as the center of magick.<br><br>Mexicans believe there are three types of magick: black, white and red.<br><br>Curanderos practice white or red magick, using plants or the spiritual<br>world to heal. Most feared are the brujos, or brujas if female, who<br>practice black magick.<br><br>Curanderos, or shamans, are bound by the law of nature and karma to<br>never do harm.

They make bad things happen, and from<br>what I've seen, it works," says John Todd, a Houstonian who lives in<br>Veracruz.<br><br>"In Mexico, there are three levels of illnesses. The first is spiritual.<br>The second is emotional, such as sadness, and the third is physical. In<br>the United States, people turn to doctors and pills to treat physical<br>illnesses. But they don't treat the emotional and spiritual. Mexicans<br>believe you must treat all three."<br><br>I had asked my guide, AndrÃ©s Huesca Tapia, to find a brujo. He laughed,<br>pointing to the young men on dusty motorcycles zooming up and down the<br>road to Catemaco.<br><br>"Pick one," he said. "Those men are roving billboards for the brujos.<br>They're everywhere."<br><br>Now we find ourselves in a waiting room, commanded by a woman with ebony<br>eyes. She introduces herself as Ignacio Cobix's confidante, housekeeper<br>and mother.<br><br>"I knew from the start my son was gifted," she says. "A mother just<br>knows these things. Even Mel Gibson came seeking his advice. He was in<br>Catemaco, filming a movie about the Maya. You wouldn't recognize him,<br>unshaven with a thick black beard. I didn't care for it. But I<br>recognized his eyes. He has beautiful blue eyes."<br><br>Almost everyone in Catemaco claims that Gibson "was here." And maybe he<br>was. It's a dime-size town, divided by winding roads and houses with<br>peeling paint. At the center of social activities is Lago de Catemaco, a<br>massive bowl of water formed millions of years ago by now-extinct<br>volcanoes. With peaks poking through gray mists, the sierra casts an<br>eerie aura over steel-blue water.<br><br>I am sitting on a creaking chair, waiting for the brujo. Minutes later,<br>a young man with puppy eyes walks out of a side room and waves us<br>inside. Sitting behind a writing desk is the gran brujo, sober and<br>boyish in appearance.<br><br>"A brujo can never marry," his mother had told me earlier. "My son can<br>have relationships, two at the same time if he wishes. But he can never<br>wear gold jewelry. Ever."<br><br>Gold is a symbol of vanity. Wearing it would anger the spirits and drain<br>him of his power.<br><br>Where he's most powerful, Cobix says, is in his cave, about an hour's<br>boat ride across the lake. Last year, German journalists filmed him<br>there, performing a ritual. He shows pictures of the cave, surrounded by<br>vines.<br><br>Caves are cradles of mysteries. According to local legend, the devil's<br>cave is somewhere in Los Tuxtlas. It leads from the real world to the<br>world of the dead.<br><br>"We can go there," Cobix says. "I'll charge only 2,000 pesos. Usually<br>it's more."<br><br>Seeing my stunned look, my guide intercedes and tells Cobix that I can't<br>pay $200.<br><br>Cobix nods his head, understanding, but doesn't budge, so we leave.<br><br>"Come back tomorrow," he says on our way out the door. "I'll do an aura<br>cleansing. You need it. Normally I charge people 300 pesos. For you, 200<br>pesos."</span></strong></div>

We pass<br>tobacco fields in San AndrÃ©s Tuxtla, where tourists can visit one of<br>several factories to see how the large, floppy leaves are cured and<br>rolled into prized cigars.<br><br>With its serene, bone-white colonial main square, Santiago Tuxtla<br>attracts those curious about El Negro, an ancient Olmec sacrificial<br>stone believed to channel powers.<br><br>El Negro is only one reason to visit this old village, where men pass<br>the afternoon beneath swaying coconut trees, playing cards. Mexico-based<br>author David Lida, who wrote about the witches of Los Tuxtlas, had<br>suggested that I call on an ancient woman known as DoÃ±a Julia. Of all<br>the brujos, she had made an impression on Lida.<br><br>But first, El Negro and Shirley MacLaine.<br><br>"Shirley MacLaine was here. She heard about its power. She wept when she<br>placed her thumb on El Negro's forehead," says museum director Juan JosÃ©<br>Palagot Perea, standing in front of the oblong stone sculpture with a<br>flat, almost baby face.<br><br>I've heard many versions of this story. Some people say the New Age<br>guru-actress actually lay on El Negro, face up with her arms to the side<br>for full effect.<br><br>"No, no, she didn't do that," Palagot says, chuckling. "She simply<br>placed her thumb here."<br><br>He directs me to put my left thumb about an inch from El Negro and close<br>my eyes.<br><br>Seconds later, darkness is colored by pulsating red light. I feel<br>lightheaded. And in my mind's eye I am flying high above mountains. Are<br>these images induced by sunlight pouring from a window overhead? I can't<br>be sure.<br><br>My guide, AndrÃ©s, is next. Descended from Aztecs, he has high cheekbones<br>and tanned features framed by lustrous, long, inky curls. A former<br>professor, he traded his job in Mexico City for the slower pace of a<br>small fishing island in Veracruz.<br><br>AndrÃ©s starts to cry, a quiet shower that lasts five minutes before he<br>opens his eyes. Embarrassed, or overwhelmed, he turns, waving us away.<br><br>"I'm sorry, so sorry" he says. "This is too much. I need to go outside<br>to get some air."<br><br>When AndrÃ©s returns, the museum director smiles and nods his head<br>knowingly. "I didn't tell you beforehand what you might see because I<br>wanted you to discover for yourself," he says. "Some people see the<br>color red, others pyramids. Some even sense they're flying over a great<br>expanse of hills back in time. And others see a cave with a man, El<br>Negro or one of the ancients."<br><br>Leaving the museum, I spot another Olmec stone head in the main square.<br>It's a colossal figurehead with a helmet over flat, jaguarlike features<br>and bulbous lips. Even now, this ancient civilization, the oldest in<br>Mexico, has a hold on the people of Veracruz.<br><br>As we wave goodbye to the museum director, I remember to ask about DoÃ±a Julia.<br><br>"Ah, yes, she was one of the greats. But she's no longer here," he says.<br>"She died last year."</span></strong></div>

The movie set was still up when we drove into the<br>private nature reserve. It's easy to see why Gibson chose this<br>dew-drenched rain forest on the northern shore of Lake Catemaco.<br><br>Nanciyaga is one of those places where you can be one with nature but<br>not in the wild. The reserve is riotously lush with native fauna, a rain<br>forest with the luxury of a restaurant and nearly rustic cabins for $75<br>per night, which includes mud facials, mineral baths, boating and other<br>activities. Nanciyaga attracts Mexican crooners and movie stars seeking<br>to renew mind and spirit.<br><br>"People come here to be close to nature," guide AgustÃ­n Rafael DomÃ­nguez<br>says. "But they also want to be spiritually healed. Magic is a tradition<br>we have had for generations. We were told magic exists. Some people<br>don't believe. I don't know why. It's not the magic they see in the<br>movies. It's more about the aura, the energy between nature and man.<br>Herbs and plants have the ability to cleanse us, cure us. Why is that so<br>hard to grasp?"<br><br>Eager to illustrate his point, he takes me to the wooden hut of AsunciÃ³n<br>IxtepÃ¡n, one of three white shamans who perform aura cleansings, or<br>limpias, at Nanciyaga.<br><br>Dressed in a flowing white dress against the jungle backdrop, IxtepÃ¡n<br>exudes Mother Earth. She directs me to follow her through a beaded<br>curtain into the hut, where there is an altar laden with colorful<br>pictures of saints and wooden crosses. I feel at ease, unlike the<br>sensation that washed over me when the brujo Cobix performed the aura<br>cleansing.<br><br>Warmth rather than dampness. Lightness rather than weight. Cobix had<br>rubbed an egg over my arms, neck and head, then brushed a long bundle of<br>leaves over my body while whispering an incantation that I couldn't make<br>out. Afterward, he instructed me to throw the egg on the side of the<br>road to get rid of the malady. He took the 200 pesos, then sent me on my<br>way.<br><br>IxtepÃ¡n turns me to her. She places her hands on my head. Warmth<br>radiates from her to me. A mother's womb. She starts to pray:<br><br>"Father, Son and the Holy Ghost, please protect her, give her a house,<br>food and a job. Let nothing go amiss in her household. Remove all bad<br>spirits. Luck be with her."<br><br>She finishes by brushing herbs and citrus leaves along my back and<br>shoulders. The leaves feel soft and cool. Their heady fragrance makes me<br>think that perhaps this is something like aromatherapy or herbal medicine.<br><br>"Now, be strong and go in peace," says IxtepÃ¡n, placing an herb-filled<br>amulet in my hands.<br><br>Life is ironic. I learned later that the picture on the amulet is of St.<br>Ignatius, in Spanish Ignacio, the same as the brujo Cobix.</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm DNA testing of the jenglot...<br>i m sure that the scientist does not have a genomic (DNA) library of jenglot and have to make new one.<br>maybe by studying the cells of these jenglot will provide direct evidence that these creatures are indeed alive <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

A jenglot is a vampire-like creature resembling a small human with long hair. It is being shown at several museums, including the ongoing Pameran Misteri, Jin, Hantu dan Keranda at Sultan Alam Shah Museum, Shah Alam. Â“We had obtained the ownerÂ’s permission to examine the creature and had them X-rayed. One showed the presence of bones in its arms,Â” said Syed Abdullah. Â“We want to know if this creature is for real. The owner bought the jenglot in Indonesia for between RM5,000 and RM30,000.Â” Zafarina, who had examined the teeth of a 2,000-year-old human artifact discovered in Gua Niah, Sarawak, last year, said she needed a month to examine the jenglot. Â“From the naked eye, the creatures looked like they were constructed. Â“The hair looks like it was implanted while the body parts pasted together. The teeth are not as old as the body parts.<br><br>What I can do is run a DNA test on samples of the hair and bone, and see if they match any living species in the data bank. That should take a month. I hope it will shed some light on the creature.Â” Syed Abdullah also hoped that someone would agree to examine a Bigfoot footprint they discovered in Kota Tinggi, Johor, several months ago. He said they had approached a few research organisations, including one in Singapore, but their efforts were hampered by high cost. Â“We canÂ’t afford to carry out the test as it costs thousands of ringgit. If thereÂ’s an expert willing to help us, we welcome it.Â” </span></strong></div>

Most cults originate from very remote areas of Papua New Guinea.<br>A common trend you find is that these villages do no have access to goods and services in their area and being deprived, they believe in illusions and other means to avoid the reality of the hardships they face.<br><br>The three villages are in the Wain-Erap Local Level Government Council, close the Nawaeb District Headquarter, which is about 90 kilometers from Lae and another 20 kilometers from the Highlands Highway.<br><br>Yet the accessibility into the second city is about 6 to 8 hours walk from the respective villages into Boana Station.<br><br>The 320 villages were charged by the Nawaeb Police and are doing community work around the District Headquarters at Boana station.</span></strong></div>

"There are still lots of undiscovered flora and fauna species that live in the area."<br><br>The small bird can be distinguished from its closest relative Â— the yellow-breasted brush finch Â— by its solid black back and the lack of white marks on its wings.<br><br>"There are about two to three new birds found in the world every year," Thomas Donegan, the British half of an Anglo-Colombian research duo who discovered the bird in January 2004, told The Associated Press on Monday. "It's a very rare event."<br><br>To access the bird's isolated habitat, Donegan and partner Blanca Huertas regularly hiked 12 hours into the nearly impenetrable jungle, depending on helicopters to drop off supplies at mountain peaks 10,000 feet above sea level.<br><br>"We first went to Yariguies about three years ago," Donegan said. "It's a huge patch of isolated forest that no one knew about, not even in Colombia."<br><br>The new finch, the size of a fist, is native to Colombia's eastern Andean range and considered by its discoverers to be near threatened and in need of close monitoring to prevent it from becoming endangered.<br><br>One of the two birds caught by the team was released unharmed after they took pictures and DNA samples, while the other died in captivity.<br><br>Donegan said this was one of the first time researchers were able to confirm a new bird without having to kill it.<br><br>The last new bird discovery in Colombia was a Tapaculos species found in the south last year.<br><br>With as many as 1,865 different species, Colombia has long been considered a bird watchers' paradise, albeit a risky one because of the country's four-decade-old civil war.<br><br>In 1998, rebels kidnapped four American bird watchers who were later found unharmed</span></strong></div>
