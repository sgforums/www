It was succeeded by Renaissance architecture, a revival of Roman formulas, at varying times in Europe, beginning in Florence in the 15th century. A series of gothic revivals began in mid-18th century England, triumphed in the 19th century and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.<br><br>Stone Gargoyles are really adorable, these night creature of the Medieval Age.<br><br>Thanks for your interest &amp; reply.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
