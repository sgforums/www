Do You need Love? Do you want to find New Love? Have you ever wonder what is that thing missing in your Life? Is It Love? Lover's Tiffs &amp; Quarrel? Communication breakdown? Any Love Issues? I may be able to help you if you let me to, Invite Love into your Life!<br><br>Many may wonder What is Love Spell? How do Love Spell work? How to make Love Spell work for you?<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/LOVE%20SPELLS/12Heart.gif" alt=""><br><br>Individuals who are inquiring about love spells approach me often, in my opinion, magick of any kind should never be taken lightly, especially love spells. Magick or the act of casting a spell opens a door and creates a window of opportunity, and often it is a small window or timeframe that we are working with, but in many cases it is just enough to allow things to flow and manifest into fruition!<br><br>When someone cast a love spell or even ask for help from a reputable practitioner it is crucial to understand that in order for your desire to manifest it has to be allowed to flow, once the work is done and the request has been made unto the Goddess, in most cases when I weave a love spell I call on Venus, the ultimate weaver of the web of love! As well once she has granted my request I repay her favoritism by burning thanksgiving incense unto her and I always give back something from myself as a gesture of good will.<br><br>The exchange is very important because that is indeed what keeps the energy flowing freely, if you the think of it in this manner, money is a universal energy, and we exchange money for services that we receive, believe it or not when you pay your gas, electric or phone bill it is an exchange of energy between you and your provider, the provider gives you a service that is important to your survival and in return you give back to that provider by paying your bill and insuring that the provider will be able to continue supplying you with the services that you so desperately need.<br><br>I know that we have become spoiled, because there is not one individual reading this article who would want to live without heat or the air conditioning, and as long as you can make the exchange you will not have to! Energy goes both ways and the energy that we exchange with the universe is in my opinion equally if not of a greater importance than paying the electrical bill.<br><br>When a love spell is cast, we call upon a collective universal consciousness, you have to look at it this way, if all you ever did was withdraw funds from your bank account without making any deposits your bank would become displeased in a very short period of time, picture the universe as one big bank, and the Gods as bankers, it is okay to make requests and withdrawals, but please make certain that you are doing your part by making a deposit every once in a while.<br><br>Believe it or not one of the easiest ways for us to give thanks is rolling around in our heads, mental energy, whispering an incantation, saying a prayer or meditating for the good of mankind, these are all easy ways to make a deposit into our universal bank accounts, now if you choose to get creative volunteering at your local homeless shelter, working with the underprivileged, or simply making a donation to your favorite charity is an excellent way as well. The most important thing is that whatever method you choose must come from a sincere place within and just like with everything else make certain that your motives are honorable and pure.<br><br>As a practitioner that offers services to a wide array of people I cannot always count on my clients giving thanks unto the Gods and the Universe, so I take it upon myself to always give thanks on their behalf, part of the reason that I choose to do this is because my karma is at stake every time that I cast a spell, whether it is for me or for someone else, I want to make certain that the Gods know that any assistance that they provide me with is greatly appreciated. When working with love energy it is very important to make sure that you turn on your love magnet, especially in cases where you may be trying to reconnect with someone where the relationship ended on a bad note, you cannot expect to exhibit the same behavior and have your lover eating out of your hands, in order to be effective you must change the pattern of energy that you are working in.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>I believe that in the Matters of the Heart, the main reason some people stray or even cheat is done out of boredom and sometimes it may very well be that the love has ended, in the case of the latter I have found this to be unfounded and untrue with the bulk of the people that I work with and in most situations the love is there but the true interaction and understanding is not!<br><br>Part of the way that someone can turn on their love magnet is to learn to tap into their love energy, love is an emotion that is felt, it comes from the heart, one of the ways that I turn on my love magnet is pretty much like setting the stage for a play, or using props in a circle to allow the practitioner and participants to attune their will and to direct their energy, let's face it if you came out of a bad relationship where your partner was always upset, mad or self centered to a point that you felt there was not enough room in the relationship for the three of you, you, him and his ego, you would more than likely go and look for just the opposite, unless you were one of those individuals who gets their jollies from being controlled, hurt and unhappy!<br><br>So let's say that you are an individual who comes to me seeking help to reunite with your lover, and of course it is on your mind as to what you can do while the spells are being cast or while you are waiting for the energy to manifest, try surrounding yourself with love, pretty flowers, scented oils, red and pink candles, for the love and sexual energy, blue candles for peace, harmony and tranquility or you could just sit there and be the same miserable piece of work that you were before contacting me or you can get motivated and put forth the much needed energy towards manifesting your desires and goals. You need to mirror or portray just the opposite of what sent your mate packing in the first place, set the mood and project the image!<br><br>When you have sex with someone, your soul and aura intermingle, intertwine and interlock, if it is a casual thing the energy tends to fade after a while, however if it is serious and it has surpassed the physical into the emotional a link has been created between the two of you that will become stronger and stronger as time goes on, For example if your Love One feel unwell you will not feel good too, if him/her is in a bad patch, you will be affected too. You will be able toÂ know each other behaviour prior to actions, if something bad going to happen to your partner, you may just feel it instinctively.<br><br>Being intimately involved with him/her a link had been created that bonds two person together, and through that link your partner can pick up on the changes in your behavior and mood even if he or she is not with you physically at the moment, this is why it is so very important to tap into those feelings of love, exude and project positive emotions, because on some level even if he/she may not be aware of it he/she will feel that energy and it will most certainly aid you in your plight of reconnecting with him/her and rekindling the spark between you, in essence you are programming the response that you wish to receive from him/her.<br><br>You have to understand the reasons that your relationship ended, by developing an understanding and by knowing the motivation behind the action you can work towards manifesting change, if things ended on a bad-note you may not have the benefit of first hand knowledge from your mate, however you are an intelligent being and if you study the situation long enough you will be able to determine where things went wrong and work towards repairing the damage.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Merry Meet To All,<br><br>EVERY REACTION REQUIRES AN ACTION! Action is required you cannot expect to sit back and do nothing and just expect your lover to come running back to you with his heart in his hand, action is required in order to set the wheel spinning in a positive direction, now I agree that there is a point where inaction is the best approach, this normally comes during the time that one may wait for their results to manifest from a spell casting, or it may be during a period where you are plagued with self doubt and uncertainty, your heart will know when the time comes for you to make your move, until then work on yourself, your mind, your body, your spiritual being , your body is your temple, it is your fleshy home, take a look at it very closely and you may find that there is no time like the present to start making some very much needed home improvements!<br><br>When working with magick of any kind there is always a danger of crossing the line and manipulating someone's free will, possibly forcing him or her to do something that may or may not be in their best interest, and it has been my experience that it doesn't really matter what type of magic or spells that you are casting the fact of the matter is that you will manipulate the energy in one form or fashion, after all that is exactly what Witches do, we manipulate the elements to achieve and to accomplish a certain desired result, however when working with love spells in particular you must go to great lengths and be careful not to cross that fine line and do anything that may result in a backlash, if your motives are not truly pure you are best to leave it alone because it will come back to sit upon your stoop and to weigh heavily upon your heart.<br><br>If you have asked yourself the following questions and you find that your answers are of a positive nature you can relax because you are pretty much on the right track and you are relatively safe moving forward with a love spell.<br><br>1. Am I motivated by love for this person?<br><br>2. Do I truly hold his or her best interest at heart?<br><br>3. Am I committed to learning and growing together with this individual on all levels?<br><br>4. Am I willing to accept responsibility for my actions in this relationship?<br><br>5. Am I committed to doing the work that is required of me to fulfill my obligations to this person spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically?<br><br>6. Am I motivated out of envy for what he or she may have or hold with another?<br><br>7. Are my actions pure of heart?<br><br>8. Am I motivated by need or greed?<br><br>9. Am I open to the lessons that the universe may have in store for this person and me and am I committed to putting forth the effort in learning those lessons and to grow and to allow him or her to grow freely and without restraint?<br><br>10. If the universe grants my request and opens the door for me, do I have the courage within to walk through that door and to handle the responsibility that is given to me with love in my heart and fire in my spirit?<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Merry Meet To All,<br><br>As I have already said if your answers to the Questions in my previous post are of a positive nature you are safe to move forward, some things that you may want to keep in mind, spells, especially love spells take time and will not manifest overnight, the best approach is to develop a sense of knowingness that the universe has heard your cry and that your request will be granted, do not second guess yourself, and do not fret or worry over the least little thing, look at it this way you know how irritating it is for someone to question you about something or a subject that you feel that you are an authority on, well my feeling is that the Gods just might feel the same way, so be patient and trust in yourself, trust in the universe and learn to believe in the powers that be.<br><br>When casting a love spell it is much better to put it out into the universe with confidence, raise the energy and set it free upon the winds of change, and when the time is right and when you least expect it that door will open and you will have the opportunity to experience firsthand the thrill of witnessing magick in the making! Also try and remember that no matter how much you feel compelled to tell your best friend, a co-worker or your mother, the best thing is to keep your spells and magickal workings to yourself, there is an old saying in the craft, "Nothing succeeds like a secret"<br><br>If you tell someone who is judgmental and scoffs at you it will impact the end result, it tarnishes what you held with high regard and takes away from the momentum of the energy!<br><br>I wish nothing but happiness for each and every one of you, and this charge I lay!<br><br>Speak not of your magickal workings lest the spell be broken, trust not the ways of the wicked, guard and keep sacred that which you hold dear, fear not love for through love all things are possible, let go of anger and deceit, follow your path with mind in heart, and love will surely find its way to you, be true to yourself with your feet planted firmly upon solid ground, stray not from your convictions or detour from your path for dedication is required for love to manifest and to last!<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Merry Meet To All,<br><br>What must we do to make Love Spell work? I shall elaborate more pertaining to this.<br><br>The loss of a relationship can truly be as devastating as loosing someone to death, at least in death there is closure, but often wounds from a separation remains an open sore festering and infectious, impacting every future relationship that we attempt to have and if we do not effectively go through a release the baggage that we carry can become compounded, building a wall to big or large for us to cross and sending us in a tailspin where we are forced to repeat our lessons over and over again until we have learned from them and have grown spiritually!<br><br>In most cases when I work with a client who is seeking to reconnect with a loved one there is little or no communication between them, and the ones who are lucky enough to have communication with an Ex-partner or spouse is usually dealing with a very negative or hostile situation.<br><br>Communication is a very important part of the process, and if you cannot vocalize it, you need to learn to project your message in the form of thought and visualization. This is a very easy process as you may possess pictures or other items that will help you tune into your loved ones energy. Pictures are a great tool for the individual who lack mental skills such as creative visualization, and even if you do not possess a picture you can use other tools such as an article of clothing, a trinket or a gift that he or she may have given to you.<br><br>Clothing can be an extremely useful tool especially if his or her scent is still present as it will help you key into that part of your mind that relates to his or her energy.<br><br>I am very gifted psychically so tuning into my clients energy when I conduct a session with them is very easy, the trick to it all is to get my client focused. While working with Spell energizing the goals, by doing so with energy is focused and the force behind the intent is more intense and will ordinarily manifest a lot sooner. Client must learn to focus their will for the sake of their on agenda.<br><br>When you ask questions that perpetuate the negative aspects of a situation the only thing you will accomplish is reinforcing your love spell in a negative manner, you are literally taking away from the positive energy and force that you put into motion. No matter what type of spell that you do or have done for you, you should always consider it completed and look at things as if your goals have already manifested! This way you are constantly lending strength to your plight and the energy can and will flow unrestricted!<br><br>Simple things that you can do when you are in the waiting stages and you are anticipating your love spell to manifest itself into reality is to write down the positive aspects of your mate or the situation that you are dealing with, by putting it down on paper you give life and new meaning to your words. You can also use a releasing technique which is to write down the negative aspects without thinking or pondering them too much and then burn the paper, parchment works best for this.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>The bottom line is this, you will only get as much out of a spell as you put into it, if you focus on the negative aspects of your unique situation and if you are constantly asking questions that emphasizes the negative you might as well expect negative results to manifest because that is exactly what you are setting yourself up for.<br><br>Most recently I had two totally different situations where I had worked a good while with each individual in an attempt to reunite them with a loved one, although each situation is unique and they are from different backgrounds they both reacted the same way, they seemed to be calm, cool and collective throughout the process, but the very moment their partners reappeared it as if they forgot everything that I had to say and reverted back to their same old behavior which played a role in their breakups to begin with!<br><br>Love spells are tricky enough and when someone is determined not to allow the energy to flow freely it can almost become impossible for their desires to manifest in a positive manner. When you cast or have a love spell cast on your behalf throw it to the four winds, give it freely to the universe and the universe will return it unto you three fold. If you have a desire to reconnect with an old lover, ex-husband or wife your focus should be all about that instead of focusing on their relationship with their new love.<br><br>The more you worry about the individual that he or she is with the stronger their bond becomes, you are lending strength to enemy troops and the result will be the demise of all your hopes and dreams. You may as well be the ring bearer at their wedding, because you are pushing your partner right down the aisle and into your competitions wide-open arms!<br><br>Trust is a very important factor, self trust and trust in the universe is essential in acquiring a positive outcome to any love spell that you may do or have done for you, you must learn to develop a sense of knowingness, a belief that what you are asking for will manifest within your life, you must develop a sense of worthiness, a belief that you are fit to have and to hold that which you seek.<br><br>You have to let go of self doubt as it is cancerous and will only reinforce the negative principals and opinions that you have of yourself. Self-inviting Negativities will not aid but jeopardise your success. You have to learn to project a positive self-image, and by project I mean you must learn to come across as a very positive individual, people who are positive will exude that energy, you will shine and when you shine you will pull positive people and situations into your life!<br><br>if you were with someone who left you ask yourself why? Why did my mate leave me? What role did I play in the loss of my relationship? When you think about it logically you may discover that he or she left because the situation became unbearable, too negative! People who are positive possess a desire to be around other positive people, like attracts like.<br><br>Believe it or not If you are negative you will attract and draw negative energy by the bushels to yourself and if you lack the will to change you will end up very cold and lonely!<br><br>So I will end this brief but loved filled words by saying this, stop asking the questions that fuel the negative energy and start asking the ones that promote healing and good will towards a positive outcome. It is not that I hate answering your questions, I hate answering the questions that undermine your goals, because it will only hold you back and slow you down.<br><br>MayÂ the DivineÂ blesses each and everyone of you, The Universal LoveÂ Energy finds you entwined in the arms of the one you Love thus inviting Love into your lives!<br></span></strong></span>
