Remember i once told you my Mojo don't get missing for nothing. It probably blocked something bad thats coming your way. Your Mojo Bag is a special request with a strong Heavy energy, when something like that got missing it means something which probably for a start what you are experiencing it now based on your current situation is just the start of a passage, More will come your way.<br><br>No one is not suitable for anything unless they chose to, if you would take a little care in whatever you do probably many things can be avoided. Why would i ask you why when its your personal choice. Suit yourself till we meet again, The Mojo Bag has done alot for you in the past &amp; you yourself understand it well, when you get pass a river you dun abandon your raft coz if you ever gonna cross another river again there will be no raft. Divine don't render help for nothing unless they are needed &amp; appreciated, if not other challenges &amp; obstacle will come your way thats part of Karma of Life...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Just like Lemon tea with the lemon. Mojo Bag's energy will merged &amp; grow with owner's energy, Its not easy to build up that kinda energy &amp; its disappearance is a great loss. If i remember correctly you got the bag from me around a year plus ago, you did thanks me previously for the Results &amp; Effects which is almost immediate change to your situation then.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Maybe you can book a Tarot session with me to find out your current situation &amp; what to come however i feel that it more important for you to get a new Mojo Bag from me, No point crying over spilled milk. Probably this time round you will need abit of Luck, Healing &amp; Protection which i will suggest to be added for your Mojo Bag, again that is up to you whether you want to get it or not, i leave it to you. Mojo Bag disappearance in your case i feel it probably outlived its uses &amp; had to go after it blocked something bad for you.
