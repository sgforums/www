As the Title suggested, I am going to decipher &amp; unravel the Secret of Your Life through Numbers. How do i go about it? I am using one of the most Ancient method of the Old Path that existed since the dawn of Mankind &amp; Civilisations which is the "Science of Numbers ~ NUMEROLOGY". </span><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/CSW_Bar.gif"><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">What is Numerology?<br><br>Numerology is the science of numbers and belongs to the path of Occult Sciences . The Hindus, Chaldeans and Egyptians were the masters in the Science. The science of numerology was probably born in Ancient Egypt. With an oral tradition prevalent in that time and place, there is little written evidence of what exactly was taught in the so-called "Mystery Schools" of the Era.<br><br>It is still a mystery for us how they were able to arrive at such accurate calculation without any instruments . In this universe every planet, star and every human being is assigned a number. When a person is born there is certain numerological vibration which is resultant sound from all the celestial bodies in the universe. This vibration effects our life and destiny. We are all governed by the Laws of Nature or the God if we like to call it that. Each number has Electro- magnetic power and can influence every area of our life. Numerology can help us to synchronize our lives in accordance with higher laws of Nature. </span><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/CSW_Bar.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">In simple words, Numerology is the study of numbers, and the occult manner in which they reflect certain aptitudes and character tendencies, as an integral part of the cosmic plan.<br><br>All you need is the birth date and the complete name of an individual to unlock all of the secrets that the numbers hold. You will be amazed by the results you get if you apply the Laws of Numerology in your life, opening the windows of knowledge and watch miseries vanish from your lives unfolding events during different phases of your lives!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos<br><br></span></strong></div>

At Times, You are the idealist, and you do everything in your power to live up to your ideals in order to be a good example for others to follow &amp; for the good of others on the whole. You are extremely aware of your every "imperfection" inside you whereby you may restrain too much emotions &amp; anger inside which may suddenly erupt out when it overflowed &amp; exploded, sharp at times. However you are not the type who take things to heart unless its of great importance. Your heart is full of Love, Forgiveness &amp; Joy. Naturally you are a teacher full of wisdom however you must learn to let go of people or places when you have fulfilled your role with them thus your work is done, you should move on as there are other works to be done elsewhere....<br><br>Soul Urge Number = 9<br><br>A Major part of your life revolves around giving and receiving love. Your desire, however is not only for yourself but for others like your families or friends, for the good &amp; benefits of all.

You emanate forgiveness, compassion and understanding. Your charming and generous personality brings you love and good luck in abundance.

You tend to express yourself through your dressing varies from distinctly bold strong colours to subtle romantic colours depending on your mood &amp; enviroment.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Well people like you whose Birth Name is under the strong Influence of Number 9 tend to have quite abit of leadership qualities with confidence &amp; strength however at times may be too overpowering due to the existence of strong Fire element other than Earth element. You are both emotional &amp; full of inspiration. My personal Advice to you is that Gold will enhance your Luck &amp; abundance, Yellow &amp; Earthly tone dressing will be extremely lucky for you.<br><br>Thanks for your interest, hope my complimentary Name Analysis Reading is of use to you...

You have the ability to let go of anything or anyone in order to further your growth while accepting all these unexpected changes with high adaptability. Because of this ability, coupled with a talent for translating new ideas into logical, useful explanations made you very quick-witted at times &amp; have your very own perspective of things.
