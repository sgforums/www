The purpose of this stone is to protect its owner from the evil eye. What is the evil eye, you might ask?<br><br>The evil eye is the name for a sickness transmitted -- usually without intention -- by someone who is envious, jealous, or covetous. It is also called the invidious eye and the envious eye.<br><br>The evil eye belief is that a person -- otherwise not malefic in any way -- can harm you and your possessions by *looking at them* with envy and praising them. The word "evil" is unfortunate in this context because it implies that someone has "cursed" the victim, but this is not the case. A better understanding of the term "evil eye" is gained if you know that the old British and Scottish word for it is "overlooking," which implies merely that the gaze has remained too long upon the coveted object, person, or animal. In other words, the effect of the evil eye is misfortunate, but the person who harbors jealousy and gives the evil eye is not necessarily an evil person per se.  You can display this eye indoor or outdoor, house, car, etc.<br><br>~ Karkadann<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Knotline.gif"></span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="small">*By Law, ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ make no claims as to the mystical and esoteric abilities of products.

Early humans regarded eyes as the wondrous objects filled with Magick, and reverence for eyesight has been expressed since earliest ages.<br><br>An Ancient religious site excavated in Mesopotamia became known as the Â“Eye TempleÂ” due to the thousands of votive figures found within it. These figures, which were made in about 3000 B.C.E, were dominated by large, mystical eyes. Another ancient belief that persons, spirits or even animals can inflict harm with a glance which is Â“Eye of MaliceÂ” or more commonly known as Â“Evil EyeÂ”.<br><br>To keep Evil Spirits and Evil Eyes at bay, the Old Ones constructed &amp; conjured various charms &amp; amulets for placing or wear. Many of these Amulets &amp; Charms bore resemblance to the Eye. The Eye is also a very prominent symbol in Free Masonry, Pagan, Esoteric Practice and Various Culture.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/SGFORUMS/indian-bar.gif"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">~*~ LOA Magickal Charms &amp; Amulets Series ~*~ </span><br><br>~*~ Ojo de Dios ~*~ GOD'S EYES<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Picture035.jpg"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">One of such Amulets and Charms till today is known as Ojo de Dios, or the plural, Ojos de Dios ( the Spanish *j* is silent, or a light *h* sound, so roughly pronounced *oh-ho's-day-DEE-ohs*), which is Spanish for Eye of God, or Eyes of God, are made by native peoples of Mexico and South America.

She is often referred to as "the court of last appeal".  She is also known as the Patron Goddess of Cats. She is unique to Brazil, although she is beginning to appear in some Voudon Hounfors (Houses). Originally she was probably a Kongo deity but research into that area is difficult. Some treat her as a separate Orixa. Some treat her as a female path of Exu. Whatever your inclination, her energy is powerful and seductive.<br><br>Pombagira is one of many aspects of the Orixa ExÃº (Eleggua).<br><br>Offerings : <span style="font-style: italic;">Champagne, chocolate, cigars eggs, apples, strawberries, perfumes, combs, mirrors, flowers (especially roses), drinks, cigarettes, etc. .  She, like Exu, likes to eat hot foods.  She is very fond of roses, but it is best to remove the thorns before offering them to her.</span><br><br>Colors and Day of the Week: <span style="font-style: italic;">Her colors are red and black and white, depending on the path.  We use Friday as her day, since it's the first day of the weekend.</span>[/color]<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> THIS IS A UNIQUE  SPIRIT DOLL DEDICATED TO POMBA GIRA. POMBA GIRA ALWAYS LOVE CATS, HER FAVORITE ANIMAL. She is 11" Tall, handmade, consecrated &amp; blessed by Mambo High Priestess. This Spirit Doll is of exceptional aesthetic quality of artistic, appealing look with very strong &amp; vibrant energy to invoke the Power of Ancient Orixa to aid you in your daily live. Every Spirit doll is unique with their own energy, none is the same. This is the ONE &amp; ONLY Piece Exclusively available at ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ Good Luck!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span><br></blockquote>I dreamt about her last night!!!!  I don't know why......I dreamt that me and my colleague were going to a place (for makan I think), then we saw her right in the front way of this shop which was like a living room. My colleague was stroking her because she found her very cute and pretty. As for me, I was astounded (Oceanos had once briefly explained to me about how powerful this Pomba Gira is) and tried to stop her from doing that.  I was like almost scared that Pomba Gira might get angry at us for being disrespectful to her and i quickly dragged my friend away from the shop.<br><br></div>

Since we only use a small percentage of our brain when awake,it is possible that we are asleep,the brain is able to tap into all that hidden potential and aid us in making our lives better.</span></div>

Dreams can be good or bad but what appears in your dreams might not play out directly its true intended meaning. That is why some dreams are fragmented or distorted,making it hard for us to know the messages it is bringing us. That is why we need to decipher what the dreams mean as not all dream are that straight forward. Anyway,you can always post your dreams here in LOA and me and Oceanos will try our best to help you when we have the time or if you feel uncomfortable letting everyone see the contents of your dreams,you can always PM us. Anyway, you can always order a Dreamcatcher from Oceanos if the bad dreams continue.Dreamcatchers can encourage those who do not dream to start dreaming again and for those who keep having nightmares like you,they can trap them in its web like structure and prevent you from having any unnecessary bad dreams.<br>A good thing to take note of is to keep a small booklet beside your bed so you can record your dreams in them the moment you wake up as we tend to forget our dreams very quickly.<br>May the new year bring more joy and love into your life,Cutie.<br></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
