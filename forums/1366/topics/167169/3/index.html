What we today call Voodoo and think of as mere superstition was actually an animist religion called Vodu or Voudou, originating in West Africa with the Yoruba tribe and on the Caribbean island Saint Domingue. It had arrived in New Orleans during the French colonial period with the slave trade. In 1718, Nouvelle Orleans was founded by the Quebecois explorer Bienville, and from those early days this belief in spirits and the power of nature had been the strength of the enslaved. Eventually, even the Europeans and the Creoles in New Orleans (natives of European origin, French and Spanish) came to fear Voodoo. The leaders in Voodoo were the male doctors (like Dr. John) and the female queens(like Marie Laveau) who eventually reigned supreme in New Orleans.<br><br>All Voodoo is said to have roots in the West African spirit-based, snake-worshiping, animist faith called "Vodu" (possibly from the Dahomey tribe); Vodu was a term which meant "the gods." Animism was a belief in spirits who lived in nature and resided in natural objects, such as in trees.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/Vodou_altar_detail.jpg"><br><br>What is Santeria?<br><br>This is a form of Voodoo which incorporates elements of Catholicism and comes from Cuba. Other Caribbean islands have developed their own form of beliefs. Obeah is Voodoo from Jamaica, while Shango is Voodoo from Trinidad.<br><br>What is Orixa, Orisa, Orisha?<br><br>Orisha, also spelled Orisa and Orixa is a spirit that reflects one of the manifestations of Olodumare (God) in the Yoruba spiritual or religious system. This religion has found its way throughout the world and is now expressed in several varieties which include Anago, Oyotunji, CandomblÃ© and SanterÃ­a/Lukumi. These varieties or spiritual lineages as they are called are practiced throughout areas of Brazil, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, Mexico and Venezuela. As interest in African indigenous religions (spiritual systems) grow, Orisa communities and lineages can be found in parts of Europe and Asia as well. While estimates vary, there could be more than one million adherents of this spiritual tradition worldwide.<br><br>These traditions originated several thousand years ago from the Yoruba people of West Africa, who stresses alignment between Human and Ori. OrÃ­ translates as head, but also to one's spiritual intuition and personal destiny. Ase, which also spelled "Axe", "Ashe" or "Ache" is the life-force that runs though all things, living and inanimate. Ase is the "power to make things happen". It is an affirmation which is used in greetings and prayers, as well as a concept about spiritual growth. Orisha devotees strive to obtain Ase through Iwa-Pele or gentle and good character, in turn they experience alignment with the Ori or what others might call inner peace or satisfaction with Life.<br><br>Yoruba were brought to the New World during the Maafa or African Slave Trade along with other West African ethnicities. Yoruba's religion beliefs were most popular among the spiritual expression of African populations of the New World because a large number of Yoruba were captured and sold into slavery. Many Yoruba priests chose to be captured and sold into slavery so that Africans would have spiritual support in the New World.<br><br>Orishas include Shango, Olokun, IfÃ¡, Yemoja, Osun, Obatala, Ogun, Oko, Soponna, Oya and Esu, among countless others. The Yoruba also venerate their Egungun, or Ancestors. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;">"Voodoo &amp; Spirit Doll Series"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif"><br><br>~*~ La Amour Voodoo Doll ~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/LAAMOURVOODOODOLL.jpg"><br><br>This La Amour Voodoo Doll is handmade, blessed , and created by the Mambo High Priestess.

The remarkable system of methods they developed is today known as "shamanism," a term that comes from a Siberian tribal word for its practitioners: "shaman" (pronounced SHAH-mahn). Shamans are a type of medicine man or woman especially distinguished by the use of journeys to hidden worlds otherwise mainly known through myth, dream, and near-death experiences. Most commonly they do this by entering an altered state of consciousness using monotonous percussion sound.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/SGFORUMS/NativeAmericanaltar.jpg"><br><br>What are Animal Totems?<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/SGFORUMS/NativeAmericananimaltotem.jpg"><br><br>In earlier days we understood that we were simply a part of the earth. We knew we were only one small part. Now many think humans are the greatest and most important part. But still, we are only a part of the earth, only a part of nature, only a child of Mother, only a part of Spirit.  We used to know respect of Nature and killed only what we ate and used only the skins of what we killed and ate. We did not waste life nor disrespect spirits but honored and thanked them for providing us with life, nourishment, and comfort. In earlier days we gave recognition to the power of the animal spirits by wearing skins, masks, mimicking, singing praise, and prayers to specific animals. We painted the animals on our homes, caves, death chambers, and asked the Spirit to guide us to the animal that we consumed and bless the spirit of the animal we kill for we are a predator in the part of Nature and we honored the spirit of our prey. These acts allowed us to remain linked to the animal guides and to accept the power they offer us in lessons, in life, and in death. It reminded us that all animals, were our sisters, brothers, and cousins and most importantly our teachers and our friends. It reminded us that we too are animals with spirit.<br><br>The Natural Power of animal totems has not been lost. They still hold the power and the knowledge we can use. Only we must remember how to be One with Nature and all that is, has been, and will be. Cultures of the past understood the connections. We must not lose this connection now that we are 'cultured'. For what was will always be and all those cultures could not have been wrong. There is a reason that Spirit has put all of us together, has given us so many healing stones, and has given us medicine, for the body and the spirit. We are all one. Using Animal Totems will allow you to see  and love the earth better, to know life better, to know yourself better, and to commune better with Mother and Spirit. You can be healthier and happier physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually in understanding and honoring your animal totems.<br><br>Animals come to us because they have a lesson we need to learn a power they are willing to share with a friend.  They seek to give us a gift of understanding, universal love, energy, and knowledge.  In general, animals remind us that we are part of the earth; that each creature has a place; that each creature has a skill of it's own; that we have instincts given to us from Mother, wisdom born to us that we must awaken.  The Animal  Totem that comes to you offers you power and wisdom if you will learn to communicate with it, with respect, trust, and understanding. Developing a relationship with a live animal totem takes time, practice, patience and could be very dangerous. Having an animal totem does not mean that you are to pet the animal or even be with it physically. Having an animal totem means that you have lessons to learn and a powerful spiritual friend.<br><br>Each animal has it's own special power and message,  for each animal has a powerful spirit and an inherent skill.  Animal Spirits choose a person to be a companion to, a friend to,  not the other way around. Animals are wondrous happy creatures...<br><br>What are Rain Sticks?<br><br>Rainsticks for centuries have been used in ceremonial rituals by various groups to bring rain to badly needed areas. Their name describes the soothing rain-like sound that these instruments produce. The rain stick was used by these groups to illustrate to the Gods that rain was badly needed. Held by either end, and tilted slightly, small pebbles inside will trickle down through sharp thorns to create the sound of rain falling from the heavens. Rain sticks are made from wood skeletons of dead Quiso or Copado cactus plant. The cacti grow in the northern deserts of Chile, and have a short plant life of about seventy years. When the cacti die, artisans in Chili gather the deadwood called Normata and hand select branches suitable for Rain sticks. Each Rain stick is unique and hand crafted to recreate the original look and sound of those used centuries ago. Today, the Rain sticks have a variety of uses; from musical instruments to home decorating. Because of their variety of uses and uniqueness, rain sticks make the perfect gift.<br><br>According to South American legend, rainsticks are played to serenade the gods as a reminder that rain is welcomed.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;">"Shaman Spirit Series"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/SGFORUMS/PipeBar.gif"><br><br>~*~ Totem Spirit Rainsticks ~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/TOTEMSPIRITRAINSTICKS.jpg"><br><br>These Totem Spirit Rainsticks are handmade by Native Americans using Traditional Ways with various Natural Mediums, Wood-fired Clay beads, Leather, Furs, Feathers &amp; Animals Totems/Shamanic Symbols!

Their large heads represent intelligence of a higher order and their strong bodies ground them to the earth. They are the uniting force between the mundane and the divine and hold the teachings of right action joined with prayer. </span><br><br>Both the bulls and the cows have horns as well as humped shoulders. Horns grow out of the head and extend to the sky indicating a connection with a higher intelligence. Humps are often symbolic of stored energy locked within the body.<br><br>The buffalo's humps are located at the shoulders. In man the shoulders hold our personal energy which expresses itself through our hands. Whatever we touch or hold onto is connected to the energy stored in the shoulders.  Shoulders carry responsibility or joy. What we carry within is manifested outwardly.  The buffalo teaches us how to eliminate our burdens by directing our energy in a balanced way.<br><br>When defending against danger, the cows will form a defensive circle around the calves and the bulls will form a circle around the cows. This symbolizes the buffalo's mutual respect for one another as well as their protective instincts to defend and honor life.<br><br>To the Plains Indians it was a symbol of sacred life and abundance. It gave the gift of life to others by sacrificing its own. It provided meat for food and hides for clothing and shelter. When tribes prepared for a buffalo hunt prayers of gratitude were offered up to great spirit. After the hunt ceremonies were performed that honored the buffalo's spirit. Without the aid of buffalo these tribes would not have survived the harsh winters.<br><br>Buffalo's can be unpredictable and dangerous when provoked. Those with this totem need to remember to see the good in all things and not let their frustration store up inside them.<br><br>The buffalo reminds us to give thanks for what we have, to respect all life forms and to honor the integrity of our own divine essence. It is a symbol of equality, sacrifice and service and can show us how to live in a state of understanding, acceptance and joy. It helps us release our self pity and awakens abundance within our consciousness.  Buffalo is a powerful medicine to have and serves as a stepping stone towards healing our imperfections and reconnecting with mother earth and father sky<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Eagle</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The eagle is a sacred messenger, carrying our prayers to the Creator and returning with gifts and visions for the people. Eagle feathers aid medicine people in calling on this connection when they need to contact spirit for healing.</span><br><br>Eagles are majestic birds with a powerful presence.  Although they can be social birds they do require isolation from human encroachment to breed in the wild.  If a human strays to close or touches their nest, they are likely to abandon it. Both male and female incubate the eggs and share in the duties of raising its young.<br><br>The eagle is incredibly patient. Often seen perched in a tree maintaining the same position for hours at a time,  eagle teaches those with this totem how to master the art of patience in every area of their life.   Within the energy of patience "all things are possible."<br><br>Eagles are good at feeding themselves from the land and still soar to great heights in the sky. They teach us how to move through life without becoming attached to anything.   They show us how to accept what comes our way and see everything as a gift from great spirit.  They have excellent hearing and can hunt as much by ear as by sight. To those to whom eagle comes, the ability to hear spiritually and psychically will awaken<br><br>Eagles have sharp beaks and strong jaws.  They remind us to pay attention to our speech and how it affects others.  Our words as well as the tone of our voice should be examined.  Eagle asks us to maintain a prayerful connection with Spirit, to keep our minds focused on what is important in life.  Maintaining this attitude removes judgement from our consciousness.  Without judgement we speak with encouragement and kindness towards others. Lessons associated with judgement are part of this medicine.<br><br>Eagles have excellent vision.  Perched high in a tree they appear to analyze and observe everything.  If Eagle has blessed you with its presence in some way, you are being given potent gifts of clarity and vision to use for the good of all people helping to bring forth the light out of the darkness. Eagle also serves as a reminder to those with this totem to communicate with Great Spirit daily so the gifts Eagle offers you can be utilized fully.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Wolf</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When a lone wolf is spotted in the wilderness it embodies the energy of freedom.  When seen in a pack it embodies a sense of community. If wolf appears to you alone or in a pack it is asking you to acquire the same within your own life.  In spite of their negative press wolves are actually friendly, social and highly intelligent.</span><br><br>The wolf's senses are highly developed. Their intelligence is marked with excellent hearing, sense of smell and strong feeling. They are determined as well as cunning and use these skills for the benefit of the pack. The  howl of the wolf is primal and penetrating. They howl to find other pack members or to let wolves from outside of the pack know their territory boundaries.  If you hear a wolf howl it might be telling you to stand your ground and defend your boundaries.<br><br>Wolf teaches you to have a balance between the needs your family has of you and the needs you have for yourself.  They are totally loyal to the pack but do not give up their identity to the pack. If wolf appears in your life you are being asked to look at where you are being too dependent and where you may be too independent. In both family and community there needs to be a balance.<br><br>Wolves convey much with their bodies. If they are angry, they may stick their ears straight up and bare their teeth. A wolf who is suspicious pulls its ears back and squints. Fear is often shown by flattening the ears against the head. A wolf who wants to play dances and bows playfully. Their body language is symbolic for those with this medicine.  Man also uses body language to convey messages.  The study of this art can increase perception in those with this totem.<br><br>Wolves hunt in packs, relying on endurance to run down weak and older animals. They have been known to run 35 miles a day in pursuit. They are the epitome of stamina and strength. With an extremely well developed societal organization, they act together to hunt and raise their young. They do not fight unnecessarily and often go out of their way to avoid fighting. Sometimes a growl, a glance, a posture is all that is necessary to determine dominance. Wolf teaches those with this medicine to know who you are and to develop strength and confidence in what you do. </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/SGFORUMS/PipeBar.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Only "BUFFALO", "EAGLE" &amp; "WOLF" Spirit Totem Rainsticks are available, from 16" to 26" Tall, (Height &amp; Diameter varies), some can be hanged.
