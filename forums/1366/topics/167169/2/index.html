What we today call Voodoo and think of as mere superstition was actually an animist religion called Vodu or Voudou, originating in West Africa with the Yoruba tribe and on the Caribbean island Saint Domingue. It had arrived in New Orleans during the French colonial period with the slave trade. In 1718, Nouvelle Orleans was founded by the Quebecois explorer Bienville, and from those early days this belief in spirits and the power of nature had been the strength of the enslaved. Eventually, even the Europeans and the Creoles in New Orleans (natives of European origin, French and Spanish) came to fear Voodoo. The leaders in Voodoo were the male doctors (like Dr. John) and the female queens(like Marie Laveau) who eventually reigned supreme in New Orleans.<br><br>All Voodoo is said to have roots in the West African spirit-based, snake-worshiping, animist faith called "Vodu" (possibly from the Dahomey tribe); Vodu was a term which meant "the gods." Animism was a belief in spirits who lived in nature and resided in natural objects, such as in trees.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/Vodou_altar_detail.jpg"><br><br>What is Santeria?<br><br>This is a form of Voodoo which incorporates elements of Catholicism and comes from Cuba. Other Caribbean islands have developed their own form of beliefs. Obeah is Voodoo from Jamaica, while Shango is Voodoo from Trinidad.<br><br>What is Orixa, Orisa, Orisha?<br><br>Orisha, also spelled Orisa and Orixa is a spirit that reflects one of the manifestations of Olodumare (God) in the Yoruba spiritual or religious system. This religion has found its way throughout the world and is now expressed in several varieties which include Anago, Oyotunji, CandomblÃ© and SanterÃ­a/Lukumi. These varieties or spiritual lineages as they are called are practiced throughout areas of Brazil, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, Mexico and Venezuela. As interest in African indigenous religions (spiritual systems) grow, Orisa communities and lineages can be found in parts of Europe and Asia as well. While estimates vary, there could be more than one million adherents of this spiritual tradition worldwide.<br><br>These traditions originated several thousand years ago from the Yoruba people of West Africa, who stresses alignment between Human and Ori. OrÃ­ translates as head, but also to one's spiritual intuition and personal destiny. Ase, which also spelled "Axe", "Ashe" or "Ache" is the life-force that runs though all things, living and inanimate. Ase is the "power to make things happen". It is an affirmation which is used in greetings and prayers, as well as a concept about spiritual growth. Orisha devotees strive to obtain Ase through Iwa-Pele or gentle and good character, in turn they experience alignment with the Ori or what others might call inner peace or satisfaction with Life.<br><br>Yoruba were brought to the New World during the Maafa or African Slave Trade along with other West African ethnicities. Yoruba's religion beliefs were most popular among the spiritual expression of African populations of the New World because a large number of Yoruba were captured and sold into slavery. Many Yoruba priests chose to be captured and sold into slavery so that Africans would have spiritual support in the New World.<br><br>Orishas include Shango, Olokun, IfÃ¡, Yemoja, Osun, Obatala, Ogun, Oko, Soponna, Oya and Esu, among countless others. The Yoruba also venerate their Egungun, or Ancestors. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;">"Voodoo &amp; Spirit Doll Series"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif"><br><br>~*~ Pomba Gira ~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/POMBAGIRA.jpg"><br><br>Pomba Gira is a Powerful Orixa Protectress and she will help you when you are truly desperate and no other Orixa will cooperate. She is often referred to as "the court of last appeal".  She is also known as the Patron Goddess of Cats. She is unique to Brazil, although she is beginning to appear in some Voudon Hounfors (Houses). Originally she was probably a Kongo deity but research into that area is difficult. Some treat her as a separate Orixa. Some treat her as a female path of Exu. Whatever your inclination, her energy is powerful and seductive.<br><br>Pombagira is one of many aspects of the Orixa ExÃº (Eleggua).<br><br>Offerings : <span style="font-style: italic;">Champagne, chocolate, cigars eggs, apples, strawberries, perfumes, combs, mirrors, flowers (especially roses), drinks, cigarettes, etc. .  She, like Exu, likes to eat hot foods.  She is very fond of roses, but it is best to remove the thorns before offering them to her.</span><br><br>Colors and Day of the Week: <span style="font-style: italic;">Her colors are red and black and white, depending on the path.  We use Friday as her day, since it's the first day of the weekend.</span></span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;"> THIS IS A UNIQUE  SPIRIT DOLL DEDICATED TO POMBA GIRA.

This where a person will ask a favor a saint, and<br>then, in order to repay the saint after the favor has been granted, one<br>must make a pilgrimage to the shrine of that saint, and take a milagro and<br>leave it there.

In many of the churches one can see wooden statues of various saints, the Virgin Mary, or of Christ. On these figures the people often pin small metal images of arms, legs, animals, praying figures or other symbols of their prayers. These Milagros serve to remind the saint of the person's prayers of to thank the saint for prayers that have been answered. Horse or sheep figures may be left to ask for help in healing a sick animal or for fertility. Students may leave a open book asking for divine intervention in their grades. Hearts are often left to thank the saint for answering the prayers of the lovelorn. </span><br><br></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: darkblue;">"Milagros Cross Series"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/hollyBar.gif"><br><br>~*~ THE MIRACLE CROSS / MILAGROS CROSS ~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/MilagroCross.jpg"><br><br>This Sacred "Milagros" Cross measures 8 1/4" tall x 61/2" wide and 3/4" thick.
