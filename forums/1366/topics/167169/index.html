What we today call Voodoo and think of as mere superstition was actually an animist religion called Vodu or Voudou, originating in West Africa with the Yoruba tribe and on the Caribbean island Saint Domingue. It had arrived in New Orleans during the French colonial period with the slave trade. In 1718, Nouvelle Orleans was founded by the Quebecois explorer Bienville, and from those early days this belief in spirits and the power of nature had been the strength of the enslaved. Eventually, even the Europeans and the Creoles in New Orleans (natives of European origin, French and Spanish) came to fear Voodoo. The leaders in Voodoo were the male doctors (like Dr. John) and the female queens(like Marie Laveau) who eventually reigned supreme in New Orleans.<br><br>All Voodoo is said to have roots in the West African spirit-based, snake-worshiping, animist faith called "Vodu" (possibly from the Dahomey tribe); Vodu was a term which meant "the gods." Animism was a belief in spirits who lived in nature and resided in natural objects, such as in trees.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/Vodou_altar_detail.jpg"><br><br>What is Santeria?<br><br>This is a form of Voodoo which incorporates elements of Catholicism and comes from Cuba. Other Caribbean islands have developed their own form of beliefs. Obeah is Voodoo from Jamaica, while Shango is Voodoo from Trinidad.<br></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;">"Wanga Dolls"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/LoveWangaDoll00.jpg"><br><br>Made &amp; Blessed by High Priest Oceanos, these "Wanga Doll" are based on nkisi fetishes from Africa, and are pretty much reinterpreted in New Orleans as "Powerful Voodoo Fetish Â” that unite the power of gris-gris and of voodoo dolls.

And from what i have read in older books on folklore, in earlier decades, it was only the left hind foot of the rabbit that was considered lucky and the bearer had to rub it to activate the luck. In addition, some people back then believed that the rabbitÃ•s foot was a source of protective magic in addition to bringing good fortune.<br><br>Images of the lucky rabbit foot were most common in the era before World War Two. The foot charm depicted on a "Good Luck" postcard of the 1910s (tied with a red ribbon, much as raccoon penis bone charms are tied), and on several North American Good Luck Coins of the 1930s.<br><br>As for the foot itself, a circa-1940 mail order catalogue from the Standard O and B Supply Company, a Chicago-based distributor of African-American hoodoo material, offered undyed rabbit foot charms "made with a metal band and a link to attach on chain." The Johnson-Smith Novelty Company offered identical charms in its 1941 catalogue.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/bwrabbitfoot.gif"><br><br>The advertisement shown here goes these one better and promises a free vial of Van Van oil with each rabbit's foot; the formula is a Louisiana hoodoo favourite that "clears away that evil mess" and increases the strength of any good luck charm to which it is applied. Since none of the older catalogues or ads mention any colour when describing rabbit's foot charms, it can be assumed that the items were undyed and came only in natural tan or white.<br><br>Symbolic representations of the rabbit foot have become rare now, possibly due to the contemporary interest in "animal rights." But while Johnson-Smith no longer offers rabbit foot key chain charms for sale, traditional rabbit foot charms, both dyed and undyed, are still manufactured and remain part of the hoodoo stock in trade. Contemporary conjure bags in my collection that contain rabbit foot charms include a "Fast Luck" bag and a "Wishing Bag." The rabbit feet in these bags are natural in colour and not dyed.<br><br>Why is the rabbit foot lucky? Rabbits are swift and they reproduce prolifically, but the luck of the rabbit foot is monetary and sexual; as far as i know, it is not related to swiftness or fertility. There is considerable evidence that the lucky rabbit foot is a remnant of an African clan totem, an importation related somehow to Br'er Rabbit, the famous protagonist of an African trickster-god myth-cycle.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Knotline.gif"></span><br><span style="color: blue;">Authentic Rabbit Foot comes in a set complete with Instruction Scroll &amp; a vial of Van Van Oil for anointing in a beautiful box or chiffon bag. Individual charm is available too for addition in Mojo bag or other Magickal purposes.

For long periods, these 'roses' live in desert regions, growing and reproducing as any other plant until the environment no longer supports an adequate existence. When this time has come, the flowers and leaves are dead and fallen, they lose moisture and the drying branches curl inwards, forming a round ball. They retract their roots from the soil and allow the desert winds to carry them across the desert, until one day they arrive in a damp place where they can continue to grow and spread. The ball then expands again, opens flat on the ground and deposits its seeds, which germinate. Once watered, the dried-up looking young plants soon begin to bud. You could say they feel their way through this process, as they don't necessarily remain in the first place they stop, but feel into the nature of the place to see if it is adequate to enhance growth. There they may stay, and grow, or indeed they may move again many times. </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/ROSE_OF_JERICHO_00.jpg"><br><br>Magickal Uses:<br><br>Used for Peace, Power, and Love.<br><br>A Rose of Jericho in the home will remove bad influences and brings peace, power and abundance. It will bring peace, power, and riches to your home while chasing away evil and bad luck.<br><br>Directions:<br><br>Place the Rose of Jericho in a bowl of water in your home.
