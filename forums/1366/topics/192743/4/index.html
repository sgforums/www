            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>What is "True Evil"? Does anyone know?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">English Definition of "Evil":<br>1.[n] morally objectionable behavior<br>2.[n] the quality of being morally wrong in principle or practice; "attempts to explain the origin of evil in the world"<br>3.[n] that which causes harm or destruction or misfortune; "the evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones"- Shakespeare<br>4.[adj] having or exerting a malignant influence; "malevolent stars"; "a malefic force"<br>5.[adj] tending to cause great harm<br>6.[adj] morally bad or wrong; "evil purposes"; "an evil influence"; "evil deeds"<br>7.[adj] having the nature of vice </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Is There "True Evil"? I would say "Yes" coz "Evil" grow from One's Heart &amp; One's become "True Evil" when they commit certain deeds &amp; actions whether it is voluntary or involuntary to hurt others whether by Word of mouth or Act! "True Evil" existed in Human civilisation...in Human Nature since the beginning of Mankind. Spirit World or Other Realms are neither "Scary" nor "Evil" but Human are....<br><br>Why is One's "Evil"? I also dunno perhaps "Evil" formed when One's has "Fear", "Jealousy" in their heart &amp; through their Actions they commited "Sins" through Malicious Rumours or even by making assumptions &amp; labelings on others without any substantial evidence or proof... "Fear" &amp; "Jealousy" are just two of the Flawed Human Nature which in my Perspective can give a Clearer picture or Example in our discussion here.<br><br>What is "Fear"? Fear erupt mostly when One is not familliar with certain aspects of things &amp; they are scared of unknown or in an alienated setting, anything they do not know or cannot accept &amp; have Doubts, they tend to assume &amp; label which mostly lead to "Malicious Rumours" or "Slandering" etc. Its probably kinda "Silly" &amp; "Shallow" but again that may be their Ways of Expressing as Acts of "Self-Defence"; or "Warding"!<br><br>What is "Jealousy"? Jealousy erupt mostly when One is Envious of another's advantages or goodness which may be the latter's "Knowledge", "Popularity" &amp; etc.<br><br>When these two Flawed Human Nature is extremely noticeable &amp; prominent in One's Heart, One become obsessed &amp; may just become "True Evil" in bid to hurt Others through their own avenue &amp; commit "Sins"...Hasten their own "Karma" &amp; incur "Karma Debts" in their lifetime!<br><br>When we are young, during Childhood years we feel so carefree...so happy...with no worry &amp; naive nature...so pure...so innocence! As we grow older, problems &amp; issues keep erupting although we tried to stay happy but sometimes its beyond our control! Human Nature tends to warp &amp; change through times till its no longer pure...its tainted mostly...some may become Evil &amp; Cunning...<br><br>Ghosts or Discarnate are not Scary...But Humans are...they can just shift &amp; change anytime without any warnings...any signs! Isn't it true...I fear human...people more than ghosts or spirit...cause at times people are out to hurt you while Ghost or Spirit wouldn't if you never stand in their way Whereas people may hurt you even if you did nothing wrong at all...Maybe Roots of Human nature are selfish &amp; evil in most...thats why...Sorrow, Sadness, Jealousy &amp; Fear seem to be making it way to one's heart &amp; occupied a place in it...I don't have a concrete answer neither do i have the right to prove &amp; make you believe that what i said is true... again this is only my perspective of it...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
