For reiki attunement its only the Universal Life force! There are various form of Reiki, however only USUI REIKI is the pure &amp; most ancient Healing power! Yeah getting a good teacher is of utmost importance coz if the teacher is a good Reiki healer so the students that He/She attuned will be just as good as well through self cultivation of latter! Reiki attunement is like fine tuning of ones major Charkras.....in a way like adding on a switch so that by pulling the switch.....The Universal Life Force of Reiki can flow down to the healer easily like a snap of the finger!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Transferrance of energy may be not the same when it reaches the latter, however it will also be dependable on how receptive can the student be! In my perspective, Whether its of Pure USUI REIKI anot is essential, the Lineage is of ultimate importance......Down the line then energy that ones received get more &amp; more diluted in a way not so strong as the Mother Power! My Lineage is from Mrs Takata therefore not too bad still very pure..... Locally there are alot of Reiki Masters however few are actually from good Lineage of USUI REIKI! Over the years there are alot of sub branches of Reiki like Tummo Reiki(make use of Kundalini energy which is part of Tantric).....Angelic Reiki......&amp; many more!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Well everyone can learn Reiki, if you are one that blessed with the Healing gifts its a plus point if you are not it is also ok! Taking on the pain &amp; karma of your patient is true.....you will definately encounter such things in your practice thats why it is important to cut off links with your patient after healing sessions &amp; do cleansing on yourself! If you don't cut off link, the patient will continue to receive healing energy from you! Btw the Link i meant is the Astral link between you &amp; your patient's  Astral/Etheric bodies that are connected during healing!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Hope all this answer your queries!

All of us who are attuned to the Usui Reiki are in his direct lineage. Reiki was re-discovered by Dr Usui, Mrs Takata was the one who brought Reiki to North America and from there it spread to the rest of the world. Let us not pin labels on which teachers are more 'branded' or from which lineage. If you were taught by some other Masters, where do you think these Masters received their attunements? From their Masters' masters' masters'? Would that not ultimately lead to Dr Usui? (of course I'm only talking about Usui Reiki)<br>This hands on healing has been around longer then Dr Usui, Christ used it and so did Buddha.<br>Proper attunement is important. But I would say that during attunements, the Reiki Grand Masters (Usui, Takata) and Reiki guides will be there to help with the process. Once your chakras are aligned and opened, the universal energy will flow through your hands.<br>Well, this is only my opinion. I hope I did not offend anyone.</span><br></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OCEANOS:<br></div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: blue;">Good Morning Doremi,<br><br>Well what i meant is my lineage is from the originator of the Reiki system of Dr Mikao Usui! My Lineage from Mrs Takata assured the purity of my Reiki, Mrs Takata is the Grand Master of my Lineage! </span><span style="color: red;">In my perspective</span><span style="color: blue;">, lineage or "pedigree" is very important as it keeps the connection to Dr Usui "pure"! If your lineage is of other Masters, the Purity of essence of  Usui Reiki will be more diluted! An example would be you have a cup of orange juice.....you keep adding water into it as more &amp; more water are added......the orange juice get more &amp; more diluted......Less concentrated than it was before!<br><br>Well the Harmonic Concordance World Meditation was held at alot of places globally! Its new energy is great, vibrant &amp; very much need at this time on this Earthly realm!

Anyway there are alot of other school of thoughts &amp; Various Factions of Reiki has surfaced over the years whose Roots are still traced back to its originator "Usui Reiki"! One thing for sure, the 1st attunement is the most crucial &amp; critical to make anyone a reliable reiki practicioner, don't you reckon that? Its not just about whatsoever Labels or Brands that matters its in One's heart, the Heart of Reiki that reside in our very Flame of Life as a Lightworker, our work &amp; responsibilities, neither do i comment on any Reiki Masters nor let alone recommend any!<br><br>Thanks for sharing your views &amp; clarify further on the Attunement &amp; Historical background of Reiki. True the Healing Hands of Light are evident in almost all Religions since dawn of Mankind which transcends Time &amp; Space Continuum! Grand Reiki Masters, Reiki Guides, Ascended Masters including the 26 Masters of Light &amp; Angelic Guides like Metatron can be present during an Attunement, everyone will feel &amp; react differently, unpredictable as its all in the Divine Plan i would put it that way! Do pop by often &amp; i would greatly appreciate if you could share more about Reiki with us in here...
