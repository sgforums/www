They migrated widely, particularly to Europe, where they worked as farm laborers, metalworkers, scrapdealers, and horsetraders. They also made a living as entertainers, fortune tellers, and grifters. Persecuted by the Nazis, and discriminated against to this day, the Rom have a long tradition of magic and shamanism. As Leland points out, these practices have parallels with those of other traditional pagan cultures around the world.<br><br>Gypsies are an amazing people Â– the only group of people living in every corner of the earth without the benefits of power, money, armies, or ever fighting a war. Wherever you travel Â– to the plains of Hungary, the steppes of Siberia, the gates of Marakesh, the highlands of Guatemala, for the frozen tundra of Alaska Â– everywhere you'll find Gypsies. They are always on the move and have an ever abiding need for freedom and independence. Where did they come from? Some believe they are the last survivors of Atlantis. Others suggest that their ancestors are the people of the biblical town of Babel. To the gypsies it does not matter. They readily learn the language of their host country, but no government and no monarch has been able to break the Gypsy spirit Â– not with gifts of land and seed and not with brutal persecution. Gypsies have a deep and abiding respect for creation Â– for Mother Earth, and for life everywhere, in all its variety. Therefore, gather only those leaves and flowers or only those portions of a root, bark or fruit, that is really needed.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gypsy, Romany, Witchcraft &amp; Magick</span></span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/GYPSYWITCH.jpg"><br><br>AS their peculiar perfume is the chief association with spices, herbs &amp; flowers, so sorcery is allied in every memory to gypsies. There is something more strangely sweet and mysterious in the scent of cloves than in that of flowers, so the attribute of inherited Magick Power adds to the romance of these picturesque wanderers. Both the spices and the Romany come from the far East--the fatherland of divination and enchantment. Other than Fortune Telling, cartomancy, crystal ball &amp; tea leaves reading, Gypsies are wellknown for their prowess in Love Magick &amp; Charms.<br><br>As it was of old so it is to-day--<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ki shan i Romani--<br>Adoi san' i chov'hani.<br>Wherever gypsies go,<br>There the witches are, we know. </span></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;">"Love Magick Series"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif"><br><br>~*~ "Miel Rosada Amor" LOVE WITCHES HONEY~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/LoveWitchesHoney01.jpg"><br><br>THIS PERFECT MAGICKAL POTION IS TO ATTRACT LOVE TO YOURSELF, TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE ONE YOU WANT, TO MAKE FRIENDS, TO GET THE PHONE CALL YOU WANT AND TO MEET THAT SPECIAL PERSON, ETC.<br><br>ADD ONE TO TWO TSP.

And from what i have read in older books on folklore, in earlier decades, it was only the left hind foot of the rabbit that was considered lucky and the bearer had to rub it to activate the luck. In addition, some people back then believed that the rabbitÃ•s foot was a source of protective magic in addition to bringing good fortune.<br><br>Images of the lucky rabbit foot were most common in the era before World War Two. The foot charm depicted on a "Good Luck" postcard of the 1910s (tied with a red ribbon, much as raccoon penis bone charms are tied), and on several North American Good Luck Coins of the 1930s.<br><br>As for the foot itself, a circa-1940 mail order catalogue from the Standard O and B Supply Company, a Chicago-based distributor of African-American hoodoo material, offered undyed rabbit foot charms "made with a metal band and a link to attach on chain." The Johnson-Smith Novelty Company offered identical charms in its 1941 catalogue.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/bwrabbitfoot.gif"><br><br>The advertisement shown here goes these one better and promises a free vial of Van Van oil with each rabbit's foot; the formula is a Louisiana hoodoo favourite that "clears away that evil mess" and increases the strength of any good luck charm to which it is applied. Since none of the older catalogues or ads mention any colour when describing rabbit's foot charms, it can be assumed that the items were undyed and came only in natural tan or white.<br><br>Symbolic representations of the rabbit foot have become rare now, possibly due to the contemporary interest in "animal rights." But while Johnson-Smith no longer offers rabbit foot key chain charms for sale, traditional rabbit foot charms, both dyed and undyed, are still manufactured and remain part of the hoodoo stock in trade. Contemporary conjure bags in my collection that contain rabbit foot charms include a "Fast Luck" bag and a "Wishing Bag." The rabbit feet in these bags are natural in colour and not dyed.<br><br>Why is the rabbit foot lucky? Rabbits are swift and they reproduce prolifically, but the luck of the rabbit foot is monetary and sexual; as far as i know, it is not related to swiftness or fertility. There is considerable evidence that the lucky rabbit foot is a remnant of an African clan totem, an importation related somehow to Br'er Rabbit, the famous protagonist of an African trickster-god myth-cycle.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Knotline.gif"></span><br><span style="color: blue;">Authentic Rabbit Foot comes in a set complete with Instruction Scroll &amp; a vial of Van Van Oil for anointing in a beautiful box or chiffon bag. Individual charm is available too for addition in Mojo bag or other Magickal purposes.

What we today call Voodoo and think of as mere superstition was actually an animist religion called Vodu or Voudou, originating in West Africa with the Yoruba tribe and on the Caribbean island Saint Domingue. It had arrived in New Orleans during the French colonial period with the slave trade. In 1718, Nouvelle Orleans was founded by the Quebecois explorer Bienville, and from those early days this belief in spirits and the power of nature had been the strength of the enslaved. Eventually, even the Europeans and the Creoles in New Orleans (natives of European origin, French and Spanish) came to fear Voodoo. The leaders in Voodoo were the male doctors (like Dr. John) and the female queens(like Marie Laveau) who eventually reigned supreme in New Orleans.<br><br>All Voodoo is said to have roots in the West African spirit-based, snake-worshiping, animist faith called "Vodu" (possibly from the Dahomey tribe); Vodu was a term which meant "the gods." Animism was a belief in spirits who lived in nature and resided in natural objects, such as in trees.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/Vodou_altar_detail.jpg"><br><br>What is Santeria?<br><br>This is a form of Voodoo which incorporates elements of Catholicism and comes from Cuba.

It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"? Its many "Uses" &amp; "Effacies". </span><br><br>A mixture of Magickal herbs, talismans, roots, powders &amp; stones in a muslin, flannel,felt or chamois bag that should be carried with you at all times to get a specific desired effect. That is a Mojo Bag.<br><br>Also known as an "Ouanga" ,"Conjure" , "Gris Gris" or "Medicine" bag ,regardless of the area in which the name was derived or the culture you may be familiar with ,they are all used for the same basic thing &amp; prescribe to the same basic principle; To attract to or dispel from the wearer, certain influences. Thus they can be made for just about any purpose under the sun. They imply faith and serve as a link beween that in which you believe and that which you desire.<br><br>Mojo Bags are usually worn around the neck or pinned inside the undergarments so that they are in touch with your skin. However ,in a pocket or bag is also fine in any case. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: darkblue;">"MOJO Bags"</span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/MINIMOJO.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">I have created 5 types of simple yet powerful Mini "Mojo Bags" for general usage as listed below: </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Love Drawing-Wear to bring all kinda Love &amp; attention on your way!

It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"? Its many "Uses" &amp; "Effacies". </span><br><br>A mixture of Magickal herbs, talismans, roots, powders &amp; stones in a muslin, flannel,felt or chamois bag that should be carried with you at all times to get a specific desired effect. That is a Mojo Bag.<br><br>Also known as an "Ouanga" ,"Conjure" , "Gris Gris" or "Medicine" bag ,regardless of the area in which the name was derived or the culture you may be familiar with ,they are all used for the same basic thing &amp; prescribe to the same basic principle; To attract to or dispel from the wearer, certain influences. Thus they can be made for just about any purpose under the sun. They imply faith and serve as a link beween that in which you believe and that which you desire.<br><br>Mojo Bags are usually worn around the neck or pinned inside the undergarments so that they are in touch with your skin. However ,in a pocket or bag is also fine in any case. </span><br><br><span style="color: purple;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Black Alligator Paw"?

They migrated widely, particularly to Europe, where they worked as farm laborers, metalworkers, scrapdealers, and horsetraders. They also made a living as entertainers, fortune tellers, and grifters. Persecuted by the Nazis, and discriminated against to this day, the Rom have a long tradition of magic and shamanism. As Leland points out, these practices have parallels with those of other traditional pagan cultures around the world.<br><br>Gypsies are an amazing people Â– the only group of people living in every corner of the earth without the benefits of power, money, armies, or ever fighting a war. Wherever you travel Â– to the plains of Hungary, the steppes of Siberia, the gates of Marakesh, the highlands of Guatemala, for the frozen tundra of Alaska Â– everywhere you'll find Gypsies. They are always on the move and have an ever abiding need for freedom and independence. Where did they come from? Some believe they are the last survivors of Atlantis. Others suggest that their ancestors are the people of the biblical town of Babel. To the gypsies it does not matter. They readily learn the language of their host country, but no government and no monarch has been able to break the Gypsy spirit Â– not with gifts of land and seed and not with brutal persecution. Gypsies have a deep and abiding respect for creation Â– for Mother Earth, and for life everywhere, in all its variety. Therefore, gather only those leaves and flowers or only those portions of a root, bark or fruit, that is really needed.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gypsy, Romany, Witchcraft &amp; Magick</span></span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/GYPSYWITCH.jpg"><br><br>AS their peculiar perfume is the chief association with spices, herbs &amp; flowers, so sorcery is allied in every memory to gypsies. There is something more strangely sweet and mysterious in the scent of cloves than in that of flowers, so the attribute of inherited Magick Power adds to the romance of these picturesque wanderers. Both the spices and the Romany come from the far East--the fatherland of divination and enchantment. Other than Fortune Telling, cartomancy, crystal ball &amp; tea leaves reading, Gypsies are wellknown for their prowess in Love Magick &amp; Charms.<br><br>As it was of old so it is to-day--<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ki shan i Romani--<br>Adoi san' i chov'hani.<br>Wherever gypsies go,<br>There the witches are, we know. </span></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;">"Divination Series"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif"><br><br>~*~ SPANISH GYPSY DIVINATION CARDS~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/SPANISHGYPSYCARD.jpg"><br><br>The Spanish deck of 50 cards is a popular deck used for fortune-telling by Gypsies.
