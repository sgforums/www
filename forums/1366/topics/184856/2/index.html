He is also known The Miracle Worker "El Milagrero". Every December 17 the faithful make pilgrimages from the farthest places on the Island to the Santuario de San Lazaro en El Rincon, just outside the capital, to celebrate his day, present offerings, and and complete penitences.<br><br>An old man nearly naked and bearded, dressed in rags and with a pair of crutches, with his legs full of sores and surrounded by dogs, is the image of San Lazaro which is adored by devotees of the Caribbean archipelago of Cuba.<br><br>The legend says that the Lazato whose image is venerated in Cuba was born in a village near Jerusalem, from a wealthy family. He had an older sister named Marta and the other destined for fame: Maria, owner of the Castle of Magdalon, and this is why she was known as Maria Magdalena, which counts in the story of Jesus that he was the freind of her family and he liked to go there to visit her. The Gospel assures us that Lazaro became ill and died, but on the fourth day Jesus revived him.<br><br>Lazaro had to leave the country and arrived in France, where he was the Bishop of Marseilles, under the the emperor Domiciano. Then the was made prisoner and executed, and this time he died definitely. He is presented wrapped in banages, as was the custom to do with corpses of the Jews, this being the explanation for the interpretation that is associated with the image of the San Lazaro that is adored by the Cubans, which is the religious syncretism with the African deities, he is known as BabalÃº AyÃ©.  </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;"> San LÃ¡zaro: "The Miracle Worker"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/lazaro.jpg"><br><br>" San LÃ¡zaro: "The Miracle Worker " Mojo Kit is Conjured &amp; Blessed by Mambo High Priestess &amp; High Priest Oceanos for immediate use.

Many people believe that a Ritual Bath will put an end to adverse conditions and open the way for Luck, Love, Money, and Happiness to enter their lives. Those who use these Magickal Bathsalts in Spiritual Baths dissolve half the contents of a packet in a tub of water and pour the liquid over themselves as they recite with Intenetion, a wish, a prayer, or one of the Psalms. We also know folks who dissolve these Magickal Bathsalts in a pail of warm water for bathing or use a Magickal Floor Wash to rid the home of Negativities and to bring about their desires in Financial Matters, Luck, Romance, or Games of Chance.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF RITUAL BATHING AND CLEANSING</span><br><br>The use of herb baths, mineral bathsalts, and floor washes has been a part of hoodoo practice for a very long time. Generally speaking, they combine elements of African and European magical, religious, and witchcraft traditions and also a bit of Native American plant lore.<br><br>The oldest ritual baths and cleansings known to mankind are those involving pure water (typically running fresh water or sea water) and decoctions made from water to which has been added salt, minerals, herbs, roots, and tree barks.<br><br>Herbal baths are often used when sickness is present, and are pan-cultural in their distribution. The African belief in foot-track magic -- causing good or evil to another through their foot track -- additionally calls for regular ritual cleaning of not only the person but the doorstep and yard, in order to remove harmful materials such as Goofer Dust or War Water, which may be laid down in the path by an enemy.<br><br>Since the 20th century, mineral bathsalts, liquid washes, spritzers, and other modern bathing and cleaning supplies have been manufactured in convenient forms for use in magickal cleansing and purification rites. The basis for these modern hoodoo products is typically an anointing or dressing oil. Root doctors traditionally name their oils after the conditions they are believed to cause or to cure. Thus, by extension, Peaceful Home Bath and Floor Wash, like Peaceful Home Oil or Bathsalts, is said to bring about contentment and an end to resentment in the family, while Crown of Success Bathsalts, like Crown of Success Oil, is believed to enhance one's good fortune in school, career, business, and public life.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/floorwash.gif"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE ROLE OF BATHING AND CLEANING IN HOODOO SPELL-WORK</span><br><br>In hoodoo terminology, performing a ritual or spell is often called "doing a job." The simplest jobs may involve bathing or anointing oneself or cleaning the house in a prescribed way. In these cases, the entire job consists of bathing a set number of times or washing down the walls, floors, and door step of the home or place of business in a ritual manner. Generally, the disposal of used bath water or floor wash from such work consists of throwing it to the east at or before sunrise, accompanied by a short, formulaic recitation.<br><br>If a bath is intended to draw in good luck, it is common for the conjure to tell the bather to rub the body only in an upward direction after pouring the bath. If the bath is for the removal of evil conditions, the client may be told to bathe by rubbing in a downward direction only. In either case, the used bath water, enhanced by the essence of the bather, may become an ingredient in further spell work, ritually sprinkled, used to wipe away enemy tricks and witchcraft spells, or be added to floor wash.<br><br>Ritual floor-washing is likewise divided into two classes of work: washing to draw in good luck, and washing to remove evil. To attract good fortune, business clients, store customers, or a lover, one scrubs the front doorstep inward, to draw in what is wanted. When spiritually cleaning a home or business premises to rid it of evil conditions, one works from the top floor of the building down to the bottom floor and from the back of each floor to the front of each floor, ending at the front doorstep, which is usually given special attention and scrubbing. The used wash-water may be thrown into the front yard, toward the East, or, if preferred, the washing-out may continue down the house-path toward the road and conclude by throwing the water to East at the border of the property.<br><br>More complex hoodoo spells done to improve one's condition in life in various ways might comprise dressing an amulet, burning candles and incense, or fixing up a mojo bag to be carried on the person. Spell work directed against enemies may involve laying tricks or throwing down materials for the victim to step over. Very strong jobs of both these types may take on the characteristics of elaborate magical rituals -- and in many cases when such a complex job is undertaken, ritual bathing forms the prelude to doing the job and a second ritual bath or a ritual house-cleaning followed by a ritual bath is the concluding act which marks its close. </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/pentacle-bar-long.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: green;">&gt;*&lt; Prosperity Magickal Bathsalts &gt;*&lt;<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/IMG_0761.jpg"><br><br>This Prosperity Magickal Bathsalts is to help One heal issues of Poverty consciousness &amp; bring in Prosperity consciousnesss.

The remarkable system of methods they developed is today known as "shamanism," a term that comes from a Siberian tribal word for its practitioners: "shaman" (pronounced SHAH-mahn). Shamans are a type of medicine man or woman especially distinguished by the use of journeys to hidden worlds otherwise mainly known through myth, dream, and near-death experiences. Most commonly they do this by entering an altered state of consciousness using monotonous percussion sound.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/SGFORUMS/NativeAmericanaltar.jpg"><br><br>What is Shamanic Smudging?<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/sage-bundle.jpg"><br><br>Shamanic smudgingÂ—or just smudgingÂ—is an age-old tribal tradition which has been used for centuries to create harmony and peace. There are many different shamanic smudging ceremonies, and different tribes use a variety of herbs for smudging.<br><br>To define it more clearly, shamanic smudging is the burning of herbs or incense for cleansing, purification, protection of physical and spiritual bodies, banishment of negative energies and creation of sacred space. You can use smudge sticks (herbs that are tied into a bundle for easier handling), braided herbs and botanicals (like sweetgrass) or loose herbs (burned on charcoal or mugwort, or in a firepit). Shamanic smudging releases the energy and fragrance of the herbs and botanicals so they can heal, cleanse and purify.<br><br>In many traditions, shamanic smudging involves a four directions ceremony or prayer, which sends specific kinds of smoke or prayers into the four directions. Different tribes have different smudging prayers that Â“programÂ” the smoke to do a specific action, such as cleansing or aiding in divination.<br><br>In general, shamanic smudging can be used in daily life for practical purposesÂ—to restore physical, mental and emotional balance; to shield against negative energies; to cleanse yourself, your magickal tools and your space; and to restore you sacred space.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;">"Shaman Spirit Series"</span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/SGFORUMS/PipeBar.gif"><br><br><span style="color: green;">~*~ Great Creator Spirit Smudge Bundle ~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/IMG_0806.jpg"><br><br>These ~*~ Great Creator Spirit Smudge Bundle ~*~ are 10" long. Herbs, such as Cedar, Sage, Sweetgrass, and other combinations of herbs are also used, such as Dried Lavender are burned in smudging ceremonies. The herbs are dried and burned in a shell, shallow bowl made from the earth, or a "Turtle Shell". They are also tied in a bundle forming a Wand or Stick.<br><br>It is said that the Cedar Tree is The Creator's favorite tree, this is why the Cedar tree stays green all year long, and the pleasant scent it gives is used in ceremonies during prayer to The Creator. Most often a feather Wand is used to direct the smoke over and around the person smudging to clean themselves. Smudging rids your surroundings and your self of any negativity.<br><br>Ceremonies must be entered with an open heart, so one may be guided by the spirits to enter the sacred realm of knowledge. The cleansing of oneself and the environment that surrounds you is very important. Before one can be healed physically, emotionally, or spiritually, they must first be cleansed of any negative energy. </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/IMG_0807.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/SGFORUMS/PipeBar.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;"> THESE UNIQUE GREAT CREATOR SPIRIT SMUDGE BUNDLES are handmade, created &amp; blessed by Native American Cherokee Shaman Brother Clayton Black Hawk. Smudging yourself on a daily basis can be very helpful in keeping yourself balanced and maintaining a peaceful state of being.

In either case, the used bath water, enhanced by the essence of the bather, may become an ingredient in further spell work, ritually sprinkled, used to wipe away enemy tricks and witchcraft spells, or be added to floor wash.<br><br>Ritual floor-washing is likewise divided into two classes of work: washing to draw in good luck, and washing to remove evil. To attract good fortune, business clients, store customers, or a lover, one scrubs the front doorstep inward, to draw in what is wanted. When spiritually cleaning a home or business premises to rid it of evil conditions, one works from the top floor of the building down to the bottom floor and from the back of each floor to the front of each floor, ending at the front doorstep, which is usually given special attention and scrubbing. The used wash-water may be thrown into the front yard, toward the East, or, if preferred, the washing-out may continue down the house-path toward the road and conclude by throwing the water to East at the border of the property.<br><br>More complex hoodoo spells done to improve one's condition in life in various ways might comprise dressing an amulet, burning candles and incense, or fixing up a mojo bag to be carried on the person.

Many people believe that a Ritual Bath will put an end to adverse conditions and open the way for Luck, Love, Money, and Happiness to enter their lives. Those who use these Magickal Bathsalts in Spiritual Baths dissolve half the contents of a packet in a tub of water and pour the liquid over themselves as they recite with Intention, a wish, a prayer, or one of the Psalms. We also know folks who dissolve these Magickal Bathsalts in a pail of warm water for bathing or use a Magickal Floor Wash to rid the home of Negativities and to bring about their desires in Financial Matters, Luck, Romance, or Games of Chance.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF RITUAL BATHING AND CLEANSING</span><br><br>The use of herb baths, mineral bathsalts, and floor washes has been a part of hoodoo practice for a very long time. Generally speaking, they combine elements of African and European magical, religious, and witchcraft traditions and also a bit of Native American plant lore.<br><br>The oldest ritual baths and cleansings known to mankind are those involving pure water (typically running fresh water or sea water) and decoctions made from water to which has been added salt, minerals, herbs, roots, and tree barks.<br><br>Herbal baths are often used when sickness is present, and are pan-cultural in their distribution. The African belief in foot-track magic -- causing good or evil to another through their foot track -- additionally calls for regular ritual cleaning of not only the person but the doorstep and yard, in order to remove harmful materials such as Goofer Dust or War Water, which may be laid down in the path by an enemy.<br><br>Since the 20th century, mineral bathsalts, liquid washes, spritzers, and other modern bathing and cleaning supplies have been manufactured in convenient forms for use in magickal cleansing and purification rites. The basis for these modern hoodoo products is typically an anointing or dressing oil. Root doctors traditionally name their oils after the conditions they are believed to cause or to cure. Thus, by extension, Peaceful Home Bath and Floor Wash, like Peaceful Home Oil or Bathsalts, is said to bring about contentment and an end to resentment in the family, while Crown of Success Bathsalts, like Crown of Success Oil, is believed to enhance one's good fortune in school, career, business, and public life.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/floorwash.gif"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE ROLE OF BATHING AND CLEANING IN HOODOO SPELL-WORK</span><br><br>In hoodoo terminology, performing a ritual or spell is often called "doing a job." The simplest jobs may involve bathing or anointing oneself or cleaning the house in a prescribed way. In these cases, the entire job consists of bathing a set number of times or washing down the walls, floors, and door step of the home or place of business in a ritual manner. Generally, the disposal of used bath water or floor wash from such work consists of throwing it to the east at or before sunrise, accompanied by a short, formulaic recitation.<br><br>If a bath is intended to draw in good luck, it is common for the conjure to tell the bather to rub the body only in an upward direction after pouring the bath. If the bath is for the removal of evil conditions, the client may be told to bathe by rubbing in a downward direction only. In either case, the used bath water, enhanced by the essence of the bather, may become an ingredient in further spell work, ritually sprinkled, used to wipe away enemy tricks and witchcraft spells, or be added to floor wash.<br><br>Ritual floor-washing is likewise divided into two classes of work: washing to draw in good luck, and washing to remove evil. To attract good fortune, business clients, store customers, or a lover, one scrubs the front doorstep inward, to draw in what is wanted. When spiritually cleaning a home or business premises to rid it of evil conditions, one works from the top floor of the building down to the bottom floor and from the back of each floor to the front of each floor, ending at the front doorstep, which is usually given special attention and scrubbing. The used wash-water may be thrown into the front yard, toward the East, or, if preferred, the washing-out may continue down the house-path toward the road and conclude by throwing the water to East at the border of the property.<br><br>More complex hoodoo spells done to improve one's condition in life in various ways might comprise dressing an amulet, burning candles and incense, or fixing up a mojo bag to be carried on the person. Spell work directed against enemies may involve laying tricks or throwing down materials for the victim to step over. Very strong jobs of both these types may take on the characteristics of elaborate magical rituals -- and in many cases when such a complex job is undertaken, ritual bathing forms the prelude to doing the job and a second ritual bath or a ritual house-cleaning followed by a ritual bath is the concluding act which marks its close.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/pentacle-bar-long.jpg"><br><br>&gt;*&lt; Spiritual Cleansing &amp; Prosperity Magickal Floor Wash Set &gt;*&lt;<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/IMG_0860.jpg"><br><br>As Spiritual Cleansing Magickal Floor Wash is to remove Negativities, Bad Vibes, Ill Wishes &amp; Intentions, Evil Eye Influences, Bad Luck or Jinx of all forms from home, workplace, business premises or wherever you use it on.

He was apparently given the name Emrys (or Ambrosius) at his birth in Caer-Fyrddin (Carmarthen). He is known as Myrddin in Welsh taken from the place of his birth., only later He became known as Merlin.<br><br>Merlin possessed Great Visionary Powers, from his Visions, he made a Prophecy that Vortigern who once ruled the Great Britain would be slain and followed on the throne by Ambrosius Aurelianus, then Uther Pendragon, then a Greater Leader, King Arthur. His Prophecy came true. In one of his expedition tasked by Ambrosius, Merlin, along with Uther went to Ireland to procure the stones of the Chorea Gigantum, the Giant's Ring. Merlin, by the use of his Extraordinary Powers, brought the stones back to a site, just West of Amesbury, and re-erected them around the the site. We now call this place Â“StonehengeÂ”.<br><br>Merlin is also known as a Miracle Worker, an Ascended Master, Saint Germain. Saint Germain was a Master of the Ancient Wisdom and of the knowledge of the Matter Spheres, an Alchemist. He ruled by Light every area of life; his empire reached a height of beauty, symmetry and perfection unexceeded in the physical octave. Truly the heavenly patterns were out pictured in the crystal chalice of the earth. And elemental life served to maintain the purity of the Matter quadrants.<br><br>The people regarded their hierarch as the highest expression of God whom they desired to emulate, and great was their love for his presence. He was the embodiment of the archetype of universal Christhood for that dispensation--to whom they could look as the standard for their own emerging Godhood. His Power is again derived from God. Merlin is a Christ figure, whose task is "to teach men that they are incapable of distinguishing good from evil or appearance from reality without divine guidance, and that, therefore, they must discard their faulty human reason and submit to GodÂ’s willÂ…<br><br>People call Merlin Â“PowerfulÂ” because he was able to change his form at will. It is from his Â“Ascended FormÂ” that he brings the ultimate gift of freedom - The Violet Flame, The Alchemist Fire. Merlin, the Great Wizard resonate with Dragon Energies, Dragons are known as Draconis, in his Book of Magick, there are records and symbols of Dragon Magick. The Draconis Symbol was said to be channelled by Merlin, this symbol used in Magick is also being use in Healing Light works and as Amulet.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/bar.jpg"><br><br>~*~Great Wizard Merlin Series ~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/merlincrystalball.jpg"><br><br>&gt;*&lt; Merlin Power Amulet &gt;*&lt;<br><br>This amulet is finely crafted in 100% Lead Free Pewter as Great Wizard Merlin holding his Crystal Ball.

"Mer" means Light. "Ka" means Spirit. "Ba" means Body. Mer-Ka-Ba means the spirit/body surrounded by counter-rotating fields of light, (wheels within wheels), spirals of energy as in DNA, which transports spirit/body from one dimension to another.  The word Merkaba or Merkava - Hebrew 'ChariotÂ’ or general meaning "to ride an animal, in a chariot" - is used in the Bible (Ezekiel 1:4-26) to refer to the throne-chariot of God, the four-wheeled vehicle driven by four Cherubim, each of which has four wings and four faces (of a man, lion, ox, and eagle). Four means 'time' in alchemy.<br><br>In order to explain what the Merkaba is, we must first generally explain the flow of energy and energy fields that surround the human body. The first definition refers to the Prana or Chi - This is the Â“Universal Life forceÂ”. This unseen energy exists everywhere in the Universe in great quantities that flow through our Chakras entering from the top of our head. Prana is an Indian Sanskrit word meaning "turning wheel", due to the look of these complex energy flows. According to the early Egyptians there are thirteen chakras as they relate to different energy centers.<br><br>We have a Prana field that surrounds our body as a the Prana flow through us from the Universe. Then there is the field of the aura. The auric field is an egg shaped energy field that surrounds our body and change its color according to our thoughts, feelings and emotions. After the auric field we have hundreds of electromagnetic fields. These fields have precise geometrical shapes. Each one of them is made up of three identical fields with the same size and shape.<br><br>The Prana fields is the Star Tetrahedron, a three dimensional Star of David. By rotating two of the three Star Tetrahedron fields in opposite directions It will create a huge 17 meter energy field - our Light Body, the Merkaba.<br><br>The Sacred Mystery Schools of Lemuria, Atlantis and Egypt used Merkaba as keys to access the higher dimensions, which formed the basis of their spiritual beliefs. They understood in the mystery schools that one's Merkaba had to be activated in order for the physical body to turn into Light which would complete the Ascension process. During this time of rapid change with the powerful frequencies of energy that are now present on Mother Earth, it is clear that one should have the ability to fully activate one's Light Body in the proper manner.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/mask-tetraedri1.jpg"><br><br>The Merkaba's energy field is a force field of Light that surrounds your body and encompasses your outer bodies. Activating your Merkaba fields expands your consciousness until the physical body is transformed into Light. There are sacred geometric shapes of energy that already surround your body and they are around everything from galaxies to plants. They are activated into an energy Light field through the Love emotion and thought projection.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/icebar.jpg"><br><br>~*~ Merkaba Series ~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/merkabastar.jpg"><br><br>&gt;*&lt; Merkaba Star Tetrahedron Amulet&gt;*&lt;<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/merkaba-medium1.jpg"><br><br>This amulet is finely crafted in 100% Lead Free Pewter as three dimensional Merkaba. </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/merkaba-medium11.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/icebar.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ is proud to present you with Â“Merkaba Star Tetrahedron AmuletÂ”.

The cauldron-traditionally with three legs- represents bounty and blessings. In some Celtic Traditions, it is associated with otherworldly figures such as Bran the Blessed and the Goddess Cerridwen. Based on these myths, the cauldron has also come to represent the concept of reincarnation and the cycles of birth, death and rebirth. Many Witches believe in some form of reincarnation or the transmigration of souls.<br><br>The cauldron is an ancient tool of magick and ritual and is used for many different purposes, such as when being used to represent water and used for scrying.  It is sometimes used in association with elemental fire as well and small "bonfires" can be lit in them to burn spells or incense.  Jumping over the cauldron has replaced the "bonfire" leap in modern times and urban spaces.  It can, depending on intent and use, be placed in the Female West (as water) or Male South (with fire). Cauldrons range in size from the small altar models to the antique "floor" type. Many Witches have cauldrons in various sizes for different workings and purposes. Of course, it can also be used for magickal brewing and cooking<br><br>The cauldron is the tool of the West and is associated with Water.<br><br>The cauldron is feminine in nature and represents the Goddess, fertility and femininity. </span> </span><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Knotline.gif"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ Magickal Ritual Tools Series ~*~ </span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">~*~ Pentacle Cauldron~*~<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Products/PentacleMinicauldron.jpg"><br><br>Small sized, three legged pot-belly style cauldron with lid, cast iron with a silvery black finish &amp; Pentacle Design cast into the body on two sides.

It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"?
