A proprietary mixture of Graveyard Dirt, Sulphur Powder, Rattlesnake Skin, and powdered herbs, GOOFER DUST is alleged to Jinx an Enemy in Family, Money, Job, and Health Matters. Folks well-versed in such doings tell us that they have picked up a person's Footprint, mixed it with GOOFER DUST and stopped the mixture up in a bottle, which they have then hidden in the crotch of a tree where it could not be found. Others claim that they have sprinkled GOOFER DUST around an enemy's home, in the yard, or even in the bedroom, to cause Hard Luck and Trouble.Â” </span><br><br>Goofer Dust is a very old African-American hoodoo curio used to trouble, harm, or even kill an enemy. In particular, it can cause the victim's legs to swell up and medical doctors will not be able to effect a cure. Recipes for making it vary, but it is almost always a mixture of simple natural ingredients, usually including Graveyard Dirt, powdered sulphur (which can give it a yellowish colour) and salt. Subsidiary ingredients may include powdered snake heads or snake skin "sheds," red pepper, black pepper, powdered bones, powdered insects or snails, and greyish, powdery-surfaced herbs such as mullein and sage. In the past, some formulas for Goofer Dust included anvil dust, the fine black iron detritus found around a blacksmith's anvil. A modern substitute for this now-uncommon ingredient would be magnetic sand, which is also black in colour.<br><br>A continuum of shared and overlapping ingredients links Graveyard Dirt to Goofer Dust, and thence to Hot Foot Powder and Crossing Powder -- but of all of them, only Goofer Dust is said to contain both Graveyard Dirt and snake skin.<br><br>As Robert Farris Thomson indicates in his works on Congo folk-magic, the word goofer comes from the Kikongo word "kufwa," which means "to die." Among older hoodoo practitioners, this derivation is very clear, because there "goofer" is not only an adjective modifying "dust" but also a verb ( "He goofered that man" ) and a noun ( "She put a goofer on him" ). As late as the 1930s, goofering was a regional synonym for hoodooing, and in North Carolina at least, the meaning of the term was broadened beyond spells of damage, illness, and death to include love spells cast with dominating intent. Meanwhile, in New Orleans, the specificity of Goofer Dust's connection to graveyard dirt was lost and the term became a general name for any sachet powder used to cast a harmful spell.<br><br>A euphemistic word for goofering is "poisoning," which in this context does not refer to a physical poison but to a physical agent that, through magical means, brings about an "unnatural illness" or the death of the victim. Even more euphemistic is the special use of the verb "hurt," which in my youth was often defined as "to poison," with the tacit understanding that "to poison" really meant "to goofer." The more general verbs "fix" (meaning to prepare a spell) and "trick" (meaning to cast a spell) are also applied to goofering.<br>Goofer Dust spells -- like similar tricks involving Graveyard Dirt, Hot Foot Powder, and Crossing Powder -- are quite African in character, deriving from African foot-track magic, a form of sorcery in which one "hurts" or "poisons" a victim "through the feet." Undoing the jinx may involve ritual bathing, floor washing, or sweeping to remove the Goofer Dust. Sprinkling salt in the corners of the house is also an antidote.<br><br>Although in Memphis a locally popular method to use Goofer Dust is to put it an unwanted lover's mattress to "hurt" him, the most common way to employ it, as described in both the catalogue and the song lyric above, is to sprinkle it around the enemy's home where it will be stepped on and rise up through the foot to "poison" the legs. Alternatively, it can be placed in the victim's sock or shoe when he or she is not looking. If this is not possible, it can be mixed it with the enemy's footprint dirt and the resultant mixture corked up in a bottle to stop the victim in his tracks or bring on an unnatural illness, buried in a graveyard to kill him, or thrown into a crossroads to drive him out of town. While it is theoretically possible to sprinkle goofer dust into food that will be eaten by the victm, this is actually not a common way to deploy it because the ingredients -- which may include dirt, sulphur, and red pepper -- would be noticable to the palate. Occasionally Goofer Dust is placed inside a protective mojo bag or wound inside a jack ball as part of a coercive love spell, but these are fairly uncommon usages. Most of the time the intent is more sinister, and the application is external.<br><br>When a victim is goofered, a number of things can happen. The victim may start having bad luck, lose his or her job, suffer from sexual impotence or mental confusion, or develop a chronic disease such as tuberculosis, diabetes, angina, gout, or high blood pressure. Of all of these problems, the relationship between goofering and diabetes is the clearest and most direct: the symptoms of poisoning through the feet are identical with those of diabetic edema and diabetic neuropathy.<br><br>One of the first signs of leg-centered or "classic" goofering is a sharp pain in the feet or legs. This is followed by swelling and an inability to walk. A really severe case of poisoning will leave the victim crawling around on all fours and howling like a dog. Medical doctors may provide palliative relief, but they can't really help a person who has been goofered. Unless the victim is cured by a root doctor, if not death may result.<br><br>Many old-time root workers say that wearing Devil's Shoe String root twigs or a silver dime in the shoe or at the ankle will provide magical protection against any form of "unnatural poison" rising up through the feet. A silver dime may also be worn on each ankle as a warning device: if the coins turn black, someone has laid out Goofer Dust and you have stepped in it. Since formulas for goofer dust, Hot Foot Powder, and Crossing powder often contain sulphur, which turns silver black, this seemingly magical alarm system has a firm grounding in chemistry.</span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/pentacle-bar-long.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">If you tried to be nice &amp; it won't work, Its time to be NASTY!

They migrated widely, particularly to Europe, where they worked as farm laborers, metalworkers, scrapdealers, and horsetraders. They also made a living as entertainers, fortune tellers, and grifters. Persecuted by the Nazis, and discriminated against to this day, the Rom have a long tradition of magic and shamanism. As Leland points out, these practices have parallels with those of other traditional pagan cultures around the world.<br><br>Gypsies are an amazing people Â– the only group of people living in every corner of the earth without the benefits of power, money, armies, or ever fighting a war. Wherever you travel Â– to the plains of Hungary, the steppes of Siberia, the gates of Marakesh, the highlands of Guatemala, for the frozen tundra of Alaska Â– everywhere you'll find Gypsies. They are always on the move and have an ever abiding need for freedom and independence. Where did they come from? Some believe they are the last survivors of Atlantis. Others suggest that their ancestors are the people of the biblical town of Babel. To the gypsies it does not matter. They readily learn the language of their host country, but no government and no monarch has been able to break the Gypsy spirit Â– not with gifts of land and seed and not with brutal persecution. Gypsies have a deep and abiding respect for creation Â– for Mother Earth, and for life everywhere, in all its variety. Therefore, gather only those leaves and flowers or only those portions of a root, bark or fruit, that is really needed.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gypsy, Romany, Witchcraft &amp; Magick</span></span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/GYPSYWITCH.jpg"><br><br>AS their peculiar perfume is the chief association with spices, herbs &amp; flowers, so sorcery is allied in every memory to gypsies. There is something more strangely sweet and mysterious in the scent of cloves than in that of flowers, so the attribute of inherited Magick Power adds to the romance of these picturesque wanderers. Both the spices and the Romany come from the far East--the fatherland of divination and enchantment. Other than Fortune Telling, cartomancy, crystal ball &amp; tea leaves reading, Gypsies are wellknown for their prowess in Love Magick &amp; Charms.<br><br>As it was of old so it is to-day--<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ki shan i Romani--<br>Adoi san' i chov'hani.<br>Wherever gypsies go,<br>There the witches are, we know. </span></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ </span><span style="color: red;">"Love Magick Series"<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/pretty-rose-bar.gif"><br><br>~*~ "Miel Rosada Amor" LOVE WITCHES HONEY~*~<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Products/rosadaamiel.jpg"><br><br>THIS PERFECT MAGICKAL POTION IS TO ATTRACT LOVE TO YOURSELF, TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE ONE YOU WANT, TO MAKE FRIENDS, TO GET THE PHONE CALL YOU WANT AND TO MEET THAT SPECIAL PERSON, ETC.<br><br>ADD ONE TO TWO TSP.

It originated as a reference to a type of magic charm. The word traces its origins to Africa and entered English in the late 19th century or early 20th century through use by African-Americans. It reflects the belief, common in many cultures, that some people have the ability to influence others to their own advantage, by casting spells or hexes.<br><br>In African-American folk beliefs, especially in the rural U.S. South early in the 20th century, a mojo was a small bag worn by a person under the clothes (also known as a mojo hand ). Such bags were thought to have supernatural powers, such as protecting from evil, bringing good luck, etc. The mojo bag usually contained a mix of Magickal herbs, powders, sometimes a coin, and other objects thought to promote supernatural action or protection.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a "Mojo Bag"?

Thus they can be made for just about any purpose under the sun. They imply faith and serve as a link beween that in which you believe and that which you desire.<br><br>Mojo Bags are usually worn around the neck or pinned inside the undergarments so that they are in touch with your skin.
