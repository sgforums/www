Its your own freewill!<br><br>Your Appearance definitely make it loud untill your Presence is Greatly Felt. You better get your Facts right what is call a threat? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Your tolerance is none of my concern &amp; seriously neither your perspectives nor emotions that you had is of any concern of mine. Whoever your friends also none of my concern, I am not in a Nursery! Elaborate? How amusing? Perhaps you need to spend few more years in school before you can comprehend with anythings that are posted in here, seemingly you failed to understand the simple meaning behind my words &amp; distorted it to you own fantasy. Why should i tolerate it? Did I Threaten you Laurence82?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  I am truly amazed! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> As for Devil1976, Did you see his previous posts, What the HELL do you call that? Seriously if you are blind doesn't mean All are Blind. Satanist? I am so scared!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Bring it on, I DARE TO SAY! By the way i got to let you know, I personally Dislike Accusations of any kind, you got the right to reserve your views but at Times its better you keep your expert comments to yourself. Yeah i read your PMs &amp; now i seriously wonder why i bother to reply you in the 1st place! Whoever Witch is, does it concern you in any ways?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If not why bother to PMs me? Incoherent words &amp; actions?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> You truly amazed me!<br><br>I do not wish to comment more, just mind your own business.<br><br>As for Whatever shi+ you have with anyone is again none of my concern but your own doings. For the benefits of the Masses in here, I would like to clarify none of my words mention you in any ways untill your name is brought up by others. People got eyes to see why bother if your conscience is clear. I personally seriously doubt your integrity Now! Since you said so we should at least give you the benefit of doubt but whether you desrved it is up to individual again its none of my concern neither is it within my control.
