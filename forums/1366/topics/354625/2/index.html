                  Reading</span></p>
              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + P/P/F (10 +3
                  cards)<br> <br> Current Situation - 4 of Wands<br> Currently everything seems okie- in fact things may seem pretty
                  good and quite stable. However, I seem to feel like there's quite a
                  lot of issues in your mind and maybe in your life. There's also a
                  bit of... confusion- well, not really confusion, more like a
                  slipping out of control/unable to control kind of feeling. Might be
                  good to watch your pride, dun let it get your way. Be aware of all
                  that is happening around you, dun let a few smooth going days or
                  events blind you to your surroundings and to what is really going
                  on or how people is really thinking of you.</p>
              <p>Crossing Card - 3 of Pentacles<br> Although I do not deny that you may have put in some effort to get
                  what you have, there seem to be a lack of solid foundation that
                  makes things abit more difficult for you right now. You would need
                  to put in, and show more hard work, and skills, now to move ahead.
                  Having a foundation alone does not appear to be enough, need to be
                  traditional but creative. Try to make friends with seniors or
                  people with more experience, and it will help in your goals, if you
                  are unable to even respect them, you could find that things may get
                  more difficult.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thoughts/events crowning - 3 of cups<br> Celebration, maybe completion of project, or the ending of
                  something. Are you thinking of getting attached or starting a new
                  project? Although the timing seems right, must be careful that you
                  can deal so you dun get too overwhelmed, yah?! Someone appears to
                  catch your attention, or the new project appears promising. Anyway,
                  dun get too proud, and you must always be realistic. Try not to get
                  complacent or lazy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foundation - 3 of Wands<br> There seem to be pride for what you have achieved, of having
                  control and dominance. Also you seemed to have had a clear purpose
                  of what you want to attain, of having dreams that you are willing
                  to work and wait for. Although there seemed to have passion, and
                  energy, there also seemed to be opportunities or things being
                  handed to self on a platter. Might be much more satisfying to have
                  a goal to work for and to have to find ways to attain that goal.
                  Try to learn to have faith in yourself and your own abilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Past - 9 of Cups<br> Seems too complacent, almost to the point of being lazy. Appears to
                  be not much movement, being too comfortable. Things are smooth-
                  flowing, having what self needs and maybe even what self wanted,
                  happy and contented. However, maybe because of that, not really
                  cherishing what you do have or owned, and maybe even not knowing
                  for sure what you wanted or really belongs to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Future - Emperor (R)<br> Try to learn to be more respectful of other people and their ideas,
                  also might want to try to be more selfless (and not just
                  material-wise, in all aspects), to give and to receive. Don't be so
                  rigid on your thoughts and your wants, if it appears difficult, try
                  to find some way around and not force. Insistence would only tire
                  self out. Try to be careful, seems somewhat prone to injuries worr.
                  May feel like self is losing control at times. Make sure you know
                  what you are doing and why, dun end up being a puppet for others.
                  Try to find some methods to de-stress, future looks busy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Allies - Knight of Pentacles<br> Seems surrounded by people but feeling alone. Feels like you are
                  hiding things, and not easy to connect with, plenty of aquaintances
                  however true friends are few but close to heart. It may be good to
                  be generosity at times but make sure that it is not as a reward or
                  a reason for people to hang around you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Environment - Knight of Wands<br> Looks to be quite fast-paced and stressed, also looks to be alone
                  and even a little bit struggling/fighting. Must learn to watch your
                  temper and be patient. There are a lot of ways and means to achieve
                  your goal, the straightest/shortest path may not exactly be the
                  most direct or easiest to actually attaining what you want. It may
                  be nice to take a detour, and enjoy the scenery as you go along-
                  you might even up there faster than others!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope &amp; Fears - 8 of Cups (R)<br> Appears to be misunderstood, alone/lonely, maybe even neglected...?
                  Almost like walking away/giving up. May be feeling that you are not
                  being appreciated, and that people are not seeing or recognising ur
                  worth/work/effort, that you are not getting what you are entitled
                  to get. I feel that you need to learn to trust yourself, to have
                  faith in your abilities and depend on yourself. If you cannot even
                  see your own worth, it would be harder for others to appreciate or
                  want to understand you.</p>
              <p>Outcome - Knight of Swords<br> Outcome appears to be quite swift, a little forceful and decisive.
                  Although you may be in control, looks to be quite stressed. Must be
                  careful of people around you, try to make more friends and be
                  humble- not to the point of hypocritical of course. Try not to let
                  them get envious of you and your achievements as it would not be
                  beneficial to you. You would be contended but need to pay attention
                  to thigns happeneing around self. That being said, dun get too
                  paranoid- try to enjoy what u already own, and to notice what your
                  partner, or the people who are important to you, needs and do try
                  to connect with her/them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Past/Present/Future- Hanged Man / Knight of Cups (R) / 10 of
                  Wands<br> Completion of a past cycle. Entered a new stage of life. May feel
                  abit restless, lost or even some confusion. Know that is only a
                  transition, dun keep focusing on issues or try so hard to keep
                  everything in check. Future appears busy, stressed. The stressful
                  events are ones that you are willing to carry, have chosen to
                  carry. Busy but appears content and willing.</p>

                  the outcome card of the celtic cross.)</p>

              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + Issues (10 +3 cards)<br><br>Current Situation - Fool<br>Have been through some events that may have left self feeling tired and lost, maybe even not ready to face up to reality. There seem to be preparation for a new beginning or a new phase of life. However, I feel that it seems that you are keen, but too tired or even reluctant to move on. Use the time to take a good rest, gather up some resources and make a decision, so that you may travel faster and further. Try not to procrastinate or be too resistant to changes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Crossing Card - Lovers<br>It may be time to clear up your mind, find your directions and make a decision. The position of the Lovers card in this reading signifies the presence of a situation that requires you to commit to one choice. Even though the opportunites and paths may seem very attractive, there are still details that are not fully evident. Try not to be too emotional in your dealings and in your thinking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thoughts/events crowning - World<br>Seems that have been hoping for the completion or fulfillment of something. Also appears to have a possibility of travel or movement of sorts, and a sense of anticipation, of waiting for something. It is necessary to work for the completion of the project, procrastination will only delay the progress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foundation - 2 of Pentacles<br>Being in the situation may be in part due to greed, to having too much choices and wanting the best of both worlds- being unwilling to make a choice. It does seem though that there are much more details than shown, that one had not been told whole truth. The balance of logic and emotions are necessary to ensure a satisfactory decision regarding any matter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Past - Page of Wands<br>Used to be rather impulsive and rash. A lot of things and situation were not contemplated before attempting and not reflected after completion. Regrets regarding past actions/ decisions, may have offended some people due to pride or harsh words. At least, appeared to have energy and a sense of purpose/drive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Future - 7 of Cups<br>Must remain rational, try to get the full picture before committing self to anything. Do not get distracted by pretty faces or outer packaging. Things may not always be as they appeared to be. You should try to be mindful of illusions and watch out for tell-tale signs of how things really are. Do not be lured by promising outlook or profits, and do not get complacent about how things are. Know what you want and go for it- do not get distracted along the way. Have a clear idea of what really matters to self.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Allies - King of Pentacles (R)<br>Be mindful of the people that you normally hang out with, it may be useful to find some friends who truely shares your belives/ideas and will be supportive of you and happy for your successes. Try not to be over-indulgent, complacent or leave things to fate. If you want something, and are sure of it... Go for it! Work hard for what you want, and know that there is no need to care too much about the opinion of others. True friends are the ones that will encourage you along, give you advices if they feel is necessary but are also the ones that will respect your final decision and support you if you should unfortunately fail, those who doesn't- are not really true so there really isn't too much to mind or care about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Environment - 7 of Pentacles (R)<br>There appears to be a feeling of being under- appreciated. That you are not getting what you have reaped or what you truely deserved after the efforts and struggles that you may have been through. Things may appear to be slightly restrained or static at the moment, the situation is not all hopeless. Also, it seems to me that things may not be as clear-cut for you as they once were, slightly more confusing and messier. Although tired, don't be too tempted to rest for too long, procrastinate or to give up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope &amp; Fears - Queen of Pentacles (R)<br>There seem to be a scarcity mindset regarding the situation. There is a fear of losing, of lack, of not enough abundance, maybe even of not being understood. It may be good for you to cultivate some faith, find a religion or someone/something that you can trust and find solace in.</p>
              <p>Outcome - Justice<br>Reaching a conclusion. Finding a reason, or making a stand. Once you have decided, stick to your decision and strive on for your goals. Be careful with your words, think carefully before you speak. Try not to provoke people- either accidentally or otherwise. It is not beneficial to self or to your goals. Once you set your mind and apply your resources and drive to your goal, appears to be achieveable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Current Issues: 2 of Swords / Queen of Cups / 8 of Swords<br>A lot of things on ur mind. seems lost, confused. Like not sure where to turn and who to trust. emotional, unable to really think clearly. Under quite a bit of stressed/victimised/pin-pointed? Probable emotional issues.</p>
              <p>(Also no need to worry too much here, was drawn to help direct my focus to particular aspects/areas of your spread.)</p>

              <p>
              </p><p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + Issues (10+3 cards)</p>
              <p>Current Situation - 10 of Pentacles<br>The focus of this card is on financial (job-related) and family life. Things appears to be pretty quiet and kind of content for now. There is ample respect and a sense of things being in their places. Are you perhaps thinking of settling down?</p>
              <p>Crossing Card - Knight of Cups<br>Appears to be the involvment of a male. Perhaps some issues of inseurity and even doubt and uncertainty. Try to watch and regulate your emotions, but do not keep everything bottled up within you. If you feel tired, take a break and rest- do not keep forcing yourself. Try to find balance and seek release in a healthy way. try to find a new way to vent and release some of the emotions within you.</p>
              <p>Thoughts/ Events Crowning - Emperor<br>Seemingly trying too hard to maintain an image- like trying to idolise a person or an event. Not really allowing the true self to surface, and not seeing the true picture. It is okay to feel, to react, to be true to yourself and not have to put on a show all the time. If you have doubts or suspicions, there must have been something to inspire those feelings. If you feel cages, dominated or overly-controlled, then stand up for your self... Try not to just neglect, brush away or repress your feelings, they exists for a reason, and it is better to deal with than to dishonor your emotions by disregarding them.</p>
              <p>Foundation - 7 of Cups<br>Illusions. There are things that were kept hidden to you by people you trusted. You were not told the entire truth and have therefore not discovered the true nature about the person/situation. However, I also seem to sense that you are rather keen to accept what you see without question. Perhaps it may be more prudent to question the motives and the personality of the people around you. If you have negative feelings towards someone or something- dwell a little on it. Take your time and examine why you feel the way that you do. Not asking you to be paranoid or anything- just be a bit more cautious, that's all.</p>
              <p>Past - 2 of Pentacles (R)<br>There was a choice offered to you, came at a time when you thought you were lost/losing control and it gave you something to rely on. Beautiful memories, but also a little nostalgic or regret- I think. The central message I saw here was that through the event, it validated what your seniors may have adviced you, it made you a little wiser and a little stronger.</p>
              <p>Future - Wheel of Fortune<br>The wheel of fortune in this position speaks of expecting changes in your life. Revel in your life and enjoy the accomplishments you have achieved so far. Can also take the time to find a new hobby or engage in some new activities. Just remember that every action brings along its consequences, so think before you act. There appears to be caution in the cards that you might have have a higher tendency to be caught if you try to even bend the rules a little bit, so would strongly advice that you play by the rules in all situation, and skip even the white lies- at least for a little while. Things are not very settled yet, so try to find a balance within yourself to prepare for whatever may come in your path.</p>
              <p>Allies - King of Cups<br>You appear to have the support of people around you. That is a fantastic thing to have and the card suggest that they seem to genuinely care about your welfare. The thing is, whatever advice people you care about can give to you (and they do really think it is for the best), you should reflect more on it, but don't just blindly follow them. Advices from well-meaning friends could lead to a loss or sacrifice of some sort, even though that was never their intention. Also here is a caution for you to discover your individuality and independence, do not grow to be overly-reliant on the people around you.</p>
              <p>Environment - Tower (R)<br>Are you feeling lost or confused? Seems to have an unstable energy of sorts here, perhaps just feeling a little bit overwhelmed or maybe messy/disorganised. There is no sense of certainty, just quite a bit of movement and ... upheaveal of sorts. If you do find that you are unable to think straight or clearly, perhaps you can try to implement a new system of organising or shift some of your decor around a little... You know... Straighten things to straighten your mind? Then again, it could also be just the shifting energy from the wheel of fortune, and if so, indulge in your new hobby and wait it out.</p>
              <p>Hopes &amp; Fears - Moon<br>There is a need to see things as they truely are and not be deceived by the appearances. Also, if you have trouble falling asleep- perhaps can try natural means- do not just rely on pharmaceutical means. If you want something, then go all out and make it happen! It may or may not be evident to you, but you do have the support from people around you, there will be opportunities for you if you are willing to work for it! Again, do not use unhealthy way to seek release of any kind, or repress your emotions, try to find a healthy avenue of release.</p>
              <p>Outcome - 6 of Swords (R)<br>Seems to sense movement. Not so much a trip or a journey, but more of an escape/ avoiding something. Could be emotional, rather than physical, so you do need to find better ways to express yourself and communicate effectively. Need to learn to work through and face up to the issues that are troubling you, instead of compromising all the time. See the truth for what it really is, there is no point in deceiving yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Current Issues: 4 of Cups (R) / Temperance (R) / 10 of Cups<br>Family, home related issues. Passivity. Backing away. Loss of balance, not being true/truthful to self. Accomplishments. Contentment. Acceptance of sorts.</p>

              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + Issues (10+3 cards)</p>
              <p>Current Situation - 8 of Swords<br>Your situation right now seems pretty positive, not too much upheaveal or major disruptions of any kind- also does not seem to be expecting/anticipating much- if any, negativities. However, do sense uncertainty and a little bit of ambivalence/confusion on your part. Like not quite sure of your next step, being a little kind of defensive and a little isolated. Also seems to be concerned with what others think of you- a little too much. Would suggest that you not take their opinions too hard, readjust the focus onto your self and do what you think is right.</p>
              <p>Crossing Card - 3 of Cups<br>Try not to let your emotions influence or sway your judgement, and especially not if they concern the input from others. If you came to a decision, you must have an initial reason for it- and you should stand by what is right rather than what others think may be right. There are hints here that you may not be thinking very clearly, and that there are influences from another party.</p>
              <p>Thoughts/ Events Crowning - 10 of Pentacles<br>Quite stable, although may be a little frustrated by some... movements. Could be renovations to your living area- feels a little ...distracted because of that? Also appears to be involved with some sort of commitment- quite a long-term commitment actually, so you should think and be very sure if you wanna get involved in it! Thinking of settling or stabilizing, a little bit slowing down of movement and actions in this phase.</p>
              <p>Foundation - Knight of Cups<br>See the true value of what others present to you, opportunities offered and gifts of value may not be what they seemed. Try to anticipate what others would ask of you for the those things that they give to you. Seems to have a tendency to look before you leap, should slow down and think things through. Moving so fast would tire you down easier, sometimes, it could more advantages to take it slow and stop for a lot of breaks in between.</p>
              <p>Past - 6 of Swords<br>You've come a long way. It hadn't been totally easy for you, but you made it to where you are. Sometimes, having seen and experienced the things that you did, may leave you feeling a little jaded, but would be good to take a new perspective to things. Getting a new point of view or a new angle might help with what you are feeling/being in right now.</p>
              <p>Future - hierophant<br>Appears quite stable. Having a certain sense of control/power over things happening. Having a good sense of self. May even be looking at long term commitments at certain projects or even relationship. All is well and good here- just a note that if you are thinking of marriage or serious involvement in relationships- that's fine. But do not pursue that over your career. Not asking you to put career way over relationships- Just that you must not neglect your work and that it would be beneficial to you if you have a good career/opportunities. Only when you can be financially confident, that would free you to pursue and invest fully in other areas of your life. Also, if you have a religion, should turn towards your faith more. Can be a powerful supporting strength. If not, perhaps you could take time to find a religion that resonates with you? Something that you believe in and can offer you inner peace and solace when necessary.</p>
              <p>Allies - 3 of Pentacles<br>Need to work on this aspect. Recently, quite a bit of words being exchanged. Differing of opinions or attitudes. Maintaining a friendship- even just working together, becomes much harder if the things that are bothering you is being suppressed or minor irritants become major points of conflict. Take time to work out the issues, but stand by your believes- gently and firmly.Doesn't hurt to be humble, share your thoughts and even your resources. Keep a lid on your temper- don't be too quick to react with anger/critisim/sarcasm or irritation.</p>
              <p>Environment - Star<br>If you have been keeping late nights- don't. Not very good for you. Seems to sense little health issue here- probably just a cold or back/head-ache... Just seemed to have a little weakened immunity of sorts. Having a good rest and sensible diet-exercise wouldn't hurt. There appears to be a few opportunities around you right now, not immediately apparent, but if you look for them hard enough and in the right way, you'll start to see some appear. Maybe you could take a good look around and grasp some of the more worthy ones? Have and keep faith!</p>
              <p>Hopes &amp; Fears - 5 of Wands<br>Do not be afraid of loss/defeat. Success never comes easy, and experience is necessary to proceed. Wear your battle-scars with pride, you earned them and you grew through them. If undertaking an investment or a new project- make sure that the losses (if any that you may suffer) is "affordable". Play big, be ambitious, but do not play with your entire fortune. Keep a sensible enough head, make sure what you might lose is what you can afford to lose! Once that is certain, and you are sure of your path... Go straight ahead. Do not allow for negative thinking/feeling or anger get in your way. Learn basic self (emotion) and time management techniques, might be helpful... You'll never know.</p>
              <p>Outcome - 7 of Wands<br>What the success may bring to you, and what you already have- you have fought well for it. Success seems within your reach, but you must not become too proud or let down your guard. Even after attaining the goals, you must not stop or weaken down. There are still further milestones up the road, and you can still reach them. So do not become lazy or give up with just a little success, especially when you can have more- continue to work hard still, and remember- sometimes, it doesn't hurt to be a little humble. Pride can have a way of coloring and even adjusting the way you look at event/situation/opportunites around you.</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>Current Issues: 9 of Wands / 7 of Swords / Queen of Wands<br>Power, achievement. Probable back/head-ache or conflicting ambitions. Finding way/self. Deceit/trickery/theft. Not seeing the entire picture.</p>

              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + P/P/F (10+3 cards)</p>
              <p>Current Situation - 6 of Pentacles (R)<br>Seems to be somewhat unclear, confusion of sorts. A lack of stability, or an impending movement. Be wary of people around you, mind your words and actions around others. Must remember to eat properly and rest well- your physical health seems to be on the slightly weaker side, so must take care. Mostly, situation around you right now seems to revolve about people, and possibly even dispute/disharmony of sorts.</p>
              <p>Crossing Card - 4 of Swords<br>Seems to me that you are not getting enough quality rest. Although it is good to be driven and have a sense of discipline, it is not advisable to push too hard. Goals and needs do change, perhaps it is time to take another look at what you thought you wanted, and ascertain if it is still in congruence with your current path. Sleep is important to ground, refresh and replenish your energy, try to get enough of it- avoid heavy suppers or exciting books/movies to avoid getting nightmares.</p>
              <p>Thoughts/ Events Crowning - Empror (R)<br>This card seemed to imply that you have already lost track of your goals, or is not thinking very clearly at the moment. Take care to set aside some alone time, and re-center yourself. If you push on without clarity, an impending breakdown could be possible. Be careful not to get side-tracked onto unimportant matters, and do not get too concerned or involved with the issues of people around you, no matter how important they may be to you, it's not quite worth it at this moment.</p>
              <p>Foundation - 7 of Cups<br>There were information hidden delibrately or purposely distorted. Do not take people's word blindly. Do not make hasty decisions or conclusions, take your time and stretch it out. Because of the unseen information, a just decision is more difficult- especially when you have to decide in a hurry. Also, since you do have more experience at this moment in your life as compared to your past, perhaps it is time to re-examine your values and goals.</p>
              <p>Past - World<br>The world card signifies completion of sorts. It is time to congratulate yourself for going through one phase of your life and surviving. Give yourself credit for the hard work you put in to get where you are today. Then, prepare for a new start or phase of your life. There are currently choices that you will soon face and changes to be had. Until then, while you are still in the eye of the storm, re-assert your self so you will be more centered in facing whatever may come next.</p>
              <p>Future - 10 of Swords<br>Be careful at your place of work. Make sure you know who your friends and your foes truely are. Be certain that the people you trust are worthy of your trust. Remember not to take things at face value, and be careful of your words and your actions. If you have to make decisions, base them on what is currently happening and not on friendships or past favors from others.</p>
              <p>Allies - 6 of Cups (R)<br>While it is good to be mindful of past relationships and friendships, do not hang on for old times sake. Make sure the people around you are the people you truely and sincerely want around you, and try not to be too soft-hearted. Do not just fall for every sob story that you hear, and do not fall back into old relationships just because of the comfort factor. If you do not release what is unnecessary, newer and possibly more beneficial friend/relationships will not be able to stick- since you cannot graduate from the past lessons, new experiences would be withheld.</p>
              <p>Environment - 5 of Wands<br>Appears that the people around you are also weak physically. Since most people around you seems to be unwell, you must take extra precaution for your health. Also be mindful of your words and actions. Seems also to have some strife or arguments/politics around you at work- don't get involved accidentally. Be careful, watch your back so that you do not become an easy target or an unwitting prey.</p>
              <p>Hopes &amp; Fears - 5 of Swords<br>Here, the primary message I get is that you should move on. Do not keep hanging onto the past, it's unlikely to come back or be what it used to be. Do not be afraid, must be brave and face whatever may come. No matter how stuck you feel you are, or how hopeless, must have faith and actively look for another way out. For your next choice to resonate with your being, to be comfortable and happy, you need to first make sure what it is that you truely want.</p>
              <p>Outcome - 8 of Cups (R)<br>Choices to be made. Loneliness or misunderstanding. Might not be an easy path for a little while. Please do not despair and do not attempt to give up at any point in your life. Be brave and be strong, stick to what you want to achieve. When you get tired, find something to do or go somewhere for a break. Make sure you think through your choices, the path ahead would not likely be easy, especially since you are not 100% certain and committed as yet. Still, things have a way of working out. One thing to note though, nothing is set in stone at this moment, if you want to change your future, make sure you change your path now.</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>Past/Present/Future- Knight of Pentacles (R) / 2 of Wands / Queen of Cups (R)<br>Tremendous effort to get what you thought you wanted. Achievement not what it seemed. Currently, choices to be made. Possible strife and/or confusion. Decision in making now carries weight that influences future. Must be sure of self and what self wanted instead of for comfort or nostalgia sake.</p>
              <p>(No need to worry about this part too much, was drawn to clarify the outcome card of the celtic cross.)</p>

              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + Issues (10+3 cards)</p>
              <p>Current Situation - 7 of Wands<br>Seems to be struggling, maybe in the midst of a tiring situation or a difficult choice/decision. Whichever it is, must remember to take a break now and then, watch out for your health. Also, is likely experiencing some difficulty with communication, must watch what you say so that people don't get the wrong idea. If called to defend your believes/stand your ground, or perhaps perform public speaking/appearance/presentation of sorts, just do your preparations and build up some confidence before the event.</p>
              <p>Crossing Card - 6 of Swords<br>Crossing cards can stand for issues or obstacles currently in your way. The 6 of swords in this spread suggests to me that miscommunication is an issue for you at this moment. Also indicative would be the desire to escape and not have to face whatever is at hand. There is a need for clear expression of what self wants/desires, as well as a need to confront the issue truthfully. Maybe you could listen to the people around you a little more, it seems that people around you have good intentions and advices for you, but are unable to get their messages effectively across. One more thing-- If you are involved in any speculations/investments (especially stocks/shares), better to stop for the moment.</p>
              <p>Thoughts/ Events Crowning - 6 of Pentacles<br>Do not let past actions and past choices decide your path now or in the future. What's past is already done, no point re-living and blaming self or let future actions be influenced negatively by your past choices/experiences. If you are about the make a sacrifice or pay a price for something, do make sure that the price is worth it. In other words, make sure you know the true value and consequence of something before getting too deeply involved.</p>
              <p>Foundation - Tower<br>Foundation of the matter seemed to be filled with movements/changes/disruptions of sort. Also noted here is a possible lack of strong/solid sense of self. In other words, not enough strong and positive view of self- could be doubting your every choice, feeling sorry for yourself or thinking self is not deserving. If that is the case, you need to challenge that believe. It is only when you can stand up for who you are that others can see you as a person, and only that will guarantee respect from them. Only when you have a strong sense of self and goals, then will you be able to make the choices with the least regrets.</p>
              <p>Past - 4 of Wands<br>Have achieved success, some sort of recognition from the past. However, seemed that did not manage to cherish it until it was too late. Was too..... confident, taking things for granted that did not manage to see signs of danger in time. Likely that because of that issue, now is slightly more difficult for you because of the emotions/responsibilities/actions you place upon yourself. Do not always think back to how things were, because memories are flawed to a certain extent, and things were not always as happy as you remember them as right now. Sometimes, unpleasant things happened so that we can learn to appreciate the importance of what we had. Learn from experiences to live in the moment and to cherish what you have. To look ahead instead.</p>
              <p>Future - 5 of Wands<br>Do not be blinded by emotions. Especially do not be influenced by anger. Doesn't matter whether or not your anger is righteous, but that the rash decisions/actions may become a source of regret in the future. Take little moments of breaks or secret indulgences to relieve the tension in an unpleasant situation. Things seems to be rather hectic, so must watch your health and your emotions, as well as to get enough rest and keep your calm composure. If you have a faith, would be a good idea to turn towards that for inner strength and comfort. Things appear to be happening at a fast pace- hard to control sometimes, but do the best that you can, and know always that you are very much loved and is being quietly supported even though it may not always be apparent.</p>
              <p>Allies - Knight of Wands<br>There is always help around you, if you choose to take them. In fact, better to let down pride or facades of independence and accept help from others once in a while. There are people that you can depend on, and do wish sometimes that you would really share your life with them, that they can help you too- although I'm not sure if that is being communicated across properly. Remember that if someone gets nasty, it's not always because of you or your actions- they could just be having a bad day. But, if someone gets angry at you, then it just shows that they actually care about you. Still, can be pretty unpleasant to get involved in arguments of any sorts, so talk nicely yah?! Know that there are support and love around you, and know that you are not alone.</p>
              <p>Environment - 5 of Cups<br>Do not be too disappointed or despaired by what you see around you at this moment. You are too involved in regretting and in your own thinking that you may not have the best point of view right now. No matter how mundane or even discouraging things seem, do not give up hope or give up looking/searching. If you have a faith, place your trust in that- need to strengthen faith, if not- maybe can think about finding a faith that resonates with you, can give you support and silent encourgement/strength to carry on as well as more acceptance and calm. The focus seemed so much to be on what had already happened that one cannot fully anticipate accurately what would be happening, or the opportunities that may be presented.</p>
              <p>Hopes &amp; Fears - 9 of Wands<br>Seems to be not getting enough quality rest. Must watch out for health, avoid 'heaty' food, try to avoid unnecessary stresses also. Also a call here towards action. If you want or hope for something, make sure you really want it. If you do, then work towards it, no point sitting around &amp; hoping or just doing the required actions half-heartedly. If you truely want something, then invest effort/time and work towards it. Have determination and do not give up, no matter how tiring and difficult it may appear to be.</p>
              <p>Outcome - 5 of Pentacles<br>Seems to indicate a loss/grief/giving up of some sort. An urge here that one must not be fatalistic- If you do not like how your future is looking right now, then change it! Must take postitive action to avoid the situation that you do not want happening. Some obstacles appear as a lesson or a test of faith-- if you have learned the certain lessons necessary, the obstacles can often have its impact very much cushioned or be eliminated altogether. If it be a test of faith, then having a strong faith would ensure a smoother path ahead. In other words, if you do not like what you see, first make sure you are looking at it correctly, and then, once certain-- Do something about it, go down fighting if you must and accept help from people around you when necessary (make use of available resources).</p>
              <p>Current Issues: Knight of Pentacles / Page of Wands / Devil<br>Faith/religion related issues. Communication issues. Financial issues, probable loss if in speculation/gambling. Overindulgence/addiction/weakness of sorts. Self-doubts/self-esteem. Creativity stuck.</p>
              <p>(No reverse card drawn in entire spread. No need to worry too much here, was drawn to help direct my focus to particular aspects/areas of your spread.)</p>
