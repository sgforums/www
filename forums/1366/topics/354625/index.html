              </span></p><p>Cassie Full Reading</p>
              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + P/P/F (10 +3 cards)<br><br>Current Situation - Hanged Man<br>Things appear to be at a standstill. Not too much movement or progression at this moment. There seemed to be a lack of clear and focused sense of purpose, but I do not seem to sense any frustration or confusion, it seems to be more of an acceptance of the way things are. Perhaps it might be a good idea to take a look at your personal believes, attitudes and values. No point fighting to resist changes, because nothing can remain the same forever. However, since you have a sense of what you think you want, don't hesitate so much. Make up your mind, have faith and confidence and stick to it!</p>
              <p>Crossing Card - Page of Pentacles<br>Focus on what you have/owned and not on what you lack. It might be prudent to concentrate more on yourself at the moment rather than on the burdens of those around you. Appears to be an offer of some sort of deal or partnership that you can consider. Be cautious and not overly-ambitious. Take your time to slowly think it over, and do not rush (no matter how tempting it may be). Appears to be workable if one is very sensible about it.</p>
              <p>Thoughts/events crowning - Lovers<br>Trust your intuition. If you have such a strong sense about it, go ahead! Might or might not notice that something seemed to be pushing or guiding you towards a certain choice, person or direction. This card showed choices, temptations and being unable to decide. However, I do sense (for lack of a better word) a guiding force involved, and if it tallies with your intuition, then don't hesitate anymore- the more you mull over it, the more uncertain you will be. Remember though, check out all the details, read the fine print (and don't forget the addendum). Gather concrete evidence to reassure any sense of unease. Just because my cards showed me that you seemed to be pretty intuitive and the outcome does seem quite positive at this moment- it does not mean you should jump into it well... blindly. Better to be careful yah?!</p>
              <p>Foundation - Judgement<br>Appeared to came through some changes. The general tone that I sense here is that- whatever it was- what's done had already been done. Don't dwell more on it. Guilt is not necessary, can expect a bit more changes. Might be a good idea to examine self- Do you really want what you thought you wanted? What are your true motives? Know yourself, it will help you be very strong in your faith and conviction. Take responsibility and take control- and when the opportunity arises, do not shy away from the test/challenge. You have the ability to direct your future.</p>
              <p>Past - King of Cups<br>Here I seemed to sense a bit of doubt and uncertainty. Just a guess here- is there a resurfacing of a past love? Anyway, the past card showed the presence of some influence from a man. It might also indicate feelings of a lack of security or being prone to over-indulgences in the past.</p>
              <p>Future - 4 of Wands<br>Appears to have opportunity, with possibility of movement or travel. Payoff from previous plans or some sort of achievement from your previous efforts. However, do continue to maintain a good foundation, order, discipline and stability in your work. Possibility of a partnership or committed relationship. If single, high possibility of getting attached. Also, would not rule out possibility of getting back together with an ex- if you so desire.</p>
              <p>Allies - 5 of Swords (R)<br>It appears to be the time for you to show your supportive side and be there for people around you. Do not purposely engage in deceit and be careful of the words coming out from you. Also, it may be beneficial to listen to some of the advices given by well-meaning people but for some... well- not all their advices were meant to be helpful. Do show respect and listen but use own discretion and don't just follow blindly. Be humble and be honest. It is not necessary to be always winning. Sometimes, it may be better to swallow your pride and let others be in the limelight all that they want.</p>
              <p>Environment - 8 of Cups<br>Perhaps it is time to take a break, go for a holiday and have a bit of rest and relaxation. This card depicts a scene of walking away. So possibility of feeling really tired and misunderstood. Like no one could really understand how and what you are feeling or who you are- for that matter. Probably in a situation that led you to feel stressed and feel like giving up. Take a breather and know that there are people around who truely cares for you. This card would also mean that you are aware and therefore voluntarily moving away from a relationship or situation or something that is no longer beneficial for you.</p>
              <p>Hope &amp; Fears - Ace of Cups (R)<br>It is important to know what you truely want, because there is an indication that you may get what you thought you wanted. Be careful what you wish for- you just might get it. Appears to hope for a "connection" with others- to have someone in tune and understand self- however also seemed to fear getting too close or feeling trapped. Try to speak to others with honesty, tact and sincerity, and you might find them responding in kind. Being open and expressing what you want can help others to understand you better and get closer without leaving you feeling trapped, invaded or crowded.</p>
              <p>Outcome - 2 of Cups<br>2 of Cups speaks of relationships/partnerships/collaboration and of balance. If in partnership with others, appears to be beneficial and fortunate. Romance- able to find someone willing to compromise and connect with self. Overall, a good outcome card and shows favorable outcome with the chance of deeper involvement in a project/business or relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Past/Present/Future- Moon / 9 of Cups / Star (R)<br>Past shows deception, insecurity. Things not being said or clarified leading to misunderstandings and misdeeds. Presently, things are pretty good and you can achieve what you want if you are willing to work for it. Shows contentment and fulfillment as well.

              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + Issues (10 +3 cards)<br><br>Current Situation - 6 Swords<br>You say that you are going through a period of bad luck currently... What I see is that while it may not exactly be smooth sailing right now, the situation would appear controlled. Protected. Protection is adequate but not thoroughly rooted- continue to keep it for now. Take a good look around, do not be misled or blinded. Not good to advance, better to stay and go with the flow. Do not attempt to struggle or make too much 'noise'. The situation is not and will not be permanent. Expect changes.</p>
              <p>Crossing Card - Judgement<br>This card is about awakening and changes. Do not be too quick to blame other people or events for the situation that you are in. Reflect on your actions and past deeds. Taking responsibility and acknowledge your role that led to the current situation would help you gain control and a new perspective that could improve the situation. Appears to have influence/karma from past, feminine energies involved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thoughts/events crowning - 7 of Swords<br>A price must be paid- one can not escape unscathed. However, does not appear to be too terrible. Watch out for the actions of others, try to notice what people are trying to hide from or around you. Guard your stuff carefully. Use your wits and cunning to trump your opponents but make sure you are aware of the abilities of your opponent- do not under-estimate. Appears to be some sort of a game or strategy somewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foundation - 2 of Wands (R)<br>I sense here a lack of security or stability of some sort. Trust was not given when and where it should have been, or could also have been holding back too much. The lack of balance within oneself, lost of directions. I'm guessing here that there were signs given prior to start of your troubles but not enough attention was paid to the signs- somehow this whole thing seemed preventable in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Past - 6 of Wands<br>Previously was pretty smooth, and even though may have had some delays but seemed to have no trouble getting what you wanted. However you appeared to have move too fast and made some hasty decisions along the way. Although it is good to have a strong drive/ desire/ ambition- it is necessary to sometimes slow down a little bit and think through all the consequences that may occur and so avoid hurting the people around you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Future - Hanged man<br>Future depends on you really. The movement and change will come once you gain a clearer perspective or direction. Currently is transition period, there really isn't too much I can read here. Just in case you are worried though- don't be. Coz the outcome of this situation is the Sun card- is hopeful! No matter which direction your future will take (depending on you here), at least take heart that your current situation is temporary, and that it can and will be resolved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Allies - 3 of Cups (R)<br>May be good to have friends around you, but maybe it might be prudent to reassess the people you are hanging out with. Maybe some events have left you feeling a little bit left out or disappointed, but try not to be too disheartened or lonely. Find out who it is around you that you can really trust and who are the passer-by in your life. Do not take everything to heart, and do try to connect deeper and open up to those that you know you can trust.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Environment - 9 of Wands<br>Currently appears to be quite a bit of stress. Should take care of yourself more and look after your health yah? Take a breather when necessary- do not keep pushing yourself to go on when all you want or need is a good rest. May not be very smooth but also does not appear to be too terrible, just that there seem to be some pressure building up and not quite enough support at this moment. Although, I would ask you to look around you as there are things/people that can help you. Not all the things that appears bad is really confirm bad for you- learn to judge and find the blessing in disguise. Look out for those redeeming qualities/ situation or opportunities, harness it skillfully and it'll help you out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope &amp; Fears - 3 of Pentacles (R)<br>Work/career wise not very smooth right now, a bit difficult to achieve your aims/goals at this moment. Need to constantly show that you are putting in a lot of work just to stay afloat. Feeling that in a lot of events, you have applied a lot of effort but with not enough results to show. Do not give up or give in to frustration, just keep on moving ahead, and wait for the situation to change. Of course, you will still have show that you are putting in the work and effort necessary to move ahead, for others to acknowledge or appreciate your worth.</p>
              <p>Outcome - Sun<br>The situation will be resolved. No matter how dark it may seem now, it is only temporary, but the future still depends on your choice of directions. Also may be indicative of travel. Anyway, have hope, have faith and wait for the situation to change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Issues- 4 of Cups / Hierophant / Emperor<br>Influence of an older man, someone with an established reputation, or with something to hide. Could also be the influence of a structured religion or one with history.Do not gift unworthy people with your trust, make sure you know the people around you. Do not blindly accept gifts or favors. Even though things may not be the smoothest, it is not an excuse to sit around and mope. There is still protection and help around you, so continue moving forward as you wait for the fate to change.</p>

              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + Focus (10 +3 cards)<br><br>Current Situation - King of Swords<br>Currently facing some sort of a decision. Feeling kind of stuck and kind of grim. There is not always a need to be so rigid in your decision, not always a need to feel so restricted and obligated. While it is responsible and admirable to stand by your initial choice or decision, if it leaves you feeling trapped and/or forced, maybe it is time to reassess the situation and see if your intitial decision is still valid and can whether that decision can continue to fulfill your needs. When you have a decision, stick to it- be clear about what you want and then act on it. Don't keep deliberating, or you might find that you seem to attract quite a bit of minor irritations and distractions that keeps interferring with your situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Crossing Card - 9 of Cups<br>I feel that there is a tendency here you are too receptive to words/advices from people around you. Even though in the past you may have been someone who holds firmly once a decision is set- what I see now is that things are not so clear-cut, and many people are trying to advice/help/care/tell you what to do etc... that there are quite a bit of influences around you, and that you are swayed- that even though you kind of recognise a path, you are not quite so sure. Also there seemed to be nostalgia or some sort of influences from the past that might be affecting you at the moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thoughts/events crowning - 8 of Swords<br>Feeling lost and somewhat bewildered. I sense here a little bit of confusion or like trying to hide something. Know that not all is hopeless and that you are the only one trapping yourself. Even though it may not exactly be the smoothest path for you at this instant, it is not as perilous as you might imagine. It is not very good to procrastinate or hide/run away because usually things that are not settled kinda have a way of blowing up in your face later. You do need to face the facts, be honest and make a move.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foundation - 3 of Cups<br>Joy and contentment- you were happy and fulfilled. It was a promising and smooth period in your life and you gained a lot from your past experiences. It provided you with the experiences you need to move forward, giving you the security, support or confidence that you needed. However it would seem to me that because of these experiences, that due to past over-indulgences and lack of ability to cherish your avaliable resources or the departure of the resource, has also in someways contributed to your current troubles. Be heartened that you have the support of people- family/friends around you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Past - King of Wand<br>You probably used to be rather rigid, impulsive or rash, likely to have been quick-tempered but well regarded by peers. Recently, there seemed to be a closure of sorts, signifying that you can move on to a newer stage, also appears to have a chance to release old patterns of behavior.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Future - Page of Wands (R)<br>There seem to be appearances of new beginnings or opportunities. It might be prudent to be more careful and thorough when checking out the new opportunities. Might feel like there is a lack or loss of control or a pressing sense of urgency looming over self. Still, should try to be calm and collected- do not make any hasty decisions. Also, do try to finish all the projects before starting new ones. That being said, must watch your health too- it's easier to fall sick under stress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Allies - 8 of Pentacles<br>It would seem that you have got quite a lot of support from people around you- friends seemed to be pretty loyal, supportive and encouraging. Continue to treat people with respect and apply your dedication to your work. I would also guess here that you are pretty good at what you do- so would ask you to focus your talents and I believe that you and your achievements can be recognised.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Environment - Knight of Wands (R)<br>Currently things seem a little bit messy. Also appears to be some delay of the completion. It seems that you are trying very hard to control the situation, but the harder you try- the more frustrating it becomes. Although having initiative is a good thing, too much may be interpreted as rash and unwarranted aggression. Finding your own balance and direction may help in adjusting how you feel currently and the environment that surrounds you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope &amp; Fears - High Priestess<br>Although I'm guessing here, I would suggest that you first try to resolve whatever it is that you are contemplating, with your own abilities rather than with external aids. Either that or it would seem to me that you have more or less predicted and you're aware of the trend of things, and may or may not have already prepared to deal with the situation.</p>
              <p>Outcome - 7 of Swords<br>I would strongly advice you to think through whatever it is that you want to do. Some things are meant to happen. That being said, I do see that you are equipped to deal with the situation with what you do have- but maybe you could use a gentler hand or a softer approach. Know that nothing truely fruitful can be achieved by aggression or force. Look out for hidden or obscure dealings, and guard your own properties or ideas. Try to use your wit and diplomacy in your dealings to achieve your aims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              
              <p>Focus: 10 of Wands (R) / 3 of Pentacles / Ace of Pentacles<br>Focus appears to be mainly on work/financial related issues. Stressed, burdened. Appears to be already aware when taking on the burden but feeling of losing control is present.<br>(Also no need to worry too much here, was drawn to help direct my focus to particular aspects/areas of your spread.)</p>

              <p>I would say, U have not lost your touch despite not doing tarots for a few years!!</p>
              <p>What u pointed out is right, I am currently facing career dilemma (tt being said, I'm in the same industry as Master-_-), I do haf expectations of myself and i know what I am capable of, but that being said, the market is not very generous right now.</p>
              <p>I woulda say your reading is pretty point on and indepth, and I would like to thank you very much for it. :D</p>

              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + P/P/F (10 +3 cards)<br><br>Current Situation - 4 of Wands<br>Currently everything seems okie- in fact things may seem pretty good and quite stable. However, I seem to feel like there's quite a lot of issues in your mind and maybe in your life. There's also a bit of... confusion- well, not really confusion, more like a slipping out of control/unable to control kind of feeling. Might be good to watch your pride, dun let it get your way. Be aware of all that is happening around you, dun let a few smooth going days or events blind you to your surroundings and to what is really going on or how people is really thinking of you.</p>
              <p>Crossing Card - 3 of Pentacles<br>Although I do not deny that you may have put in some effort to get what you have, there seem to be a lack of solid foundation that makes things abit more difficult for you right now. You would need to put in, and show more hard work, and skills, now to move ahead. Having a foundation alone does not appear to be enough, need to be traditional but creative. Try to make friends with seniors or people with more experience, and it will help in your goals, if you are unable to even respect them, you could find that things may get more difficult.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thoughts/events crowning - 3 of cups<br>Celebration, maybe completion of project, or the ending of something. Are you thinking of getting attached or starting a new project? Although the timing seems right, must be careful that you can deal so you dun get too overwhelmed, yah?! Someone appears to catch your attention, or the new project appears promising. Anyway, dun get too proud, and you must always be realistic. Try not to get complacent or lazy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foundation - 3 of Wands<br>There seem to be pride for what you have achieved, of having control and dominance. Also you seemed to have had a clear purpose of what you want to attain, of having dreams that you are willing to work and wait for. Although there seemed to have passion, and energy, there also seemed to be opportunities or things being handed to self on a platter. Might be much more satisfying to have a goal to work for and to have to find ways to attain that goal. Try to learn to have faith in yourself and your own abilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Past - 9 of Cups<br>Seems too complacent, almost to the point of being lazy. Appears to be not much movement, being too comfortable. Things are smooth- flowing, having what self needs and maybe even what self wanted, happy and contented. However, maybe because of that, not really cherishing what you do have or owned, and maybe even not knowing for sure what you wanted or really belongs to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Future - Emperor (R)<br>Try to learn to be more respectful of other people and their ideas, also might want to try to be more selfless (and not just material-wise, in all aspects), to give and to receive. Don't be so rigid on your thoughts and your wants, if it appears difficult, try to find some way around and not force. Insistence would only tire self out. Try to be careful, seems somewhat prone to injuries worr. May feel like self is losing control at times. Make sure you know what you are doing and why, dun end up being a puppet for others. Try to find some methods to de-stress, future looks busy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Allies - Knight of Pentacles<br>Seems surrounded by people but feeling alone. Feels like you are hiding things, and not easy to connect with, plenty of aquaintances however true friends are few but close to heart. It may be good to be generosity at times but make sure that it is not as a reward or a reason for people to hang around you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Environment - Knight of Wands<br>Looks to be quite fast-paced and stressed, also looks to be alone and even a little bit struggling/fighting. Must learn to watch your temper and be patient. There are a lot of ways and means to achieve your goal, the straightest/shortest path may not exactly be the most direct or easiest to actually attaining what you want. It may be nice to take a detour, and enjoy the scenery as you go along- you might even up there faster than others!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope &amp; Fears - 8 of Cups (R)<br>Appears to be misunderstood, alone/lonely, maybe even neglected...? Almost like walking away/giving up. May be feeling that you are not being appreciated, and that people are not seeing or recognising ur worth/work/effort, that you are not getting what you are entitled to get. I feel that you need to learn to trust yourself, to have faith in your abilities and depend on yourself. If you cannot even see your own worth, it would be harder for others to appreciate or want to understand you.</p>
              <p>Outcome - Knight of Swords<br>Outcome appears to be quite swift, a little forceful and decisive. Although you may be in control, looks to be quite stressed. Must be careful of people around you, try to make more friends and be humble- not to the point of hypocritical of course. Try not to let them get envious of you and your achievements as it would not be beneficial to you. You would be contended but need to pay attention to thigns happeneing around self. That being said, dun get too paranoid- try to enjoy what u already own, and to notice what your partner, or the people who are important to you, needs and do try to connect with her/them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Past/Present/Future- Hanged Man / Knight of Cups (R) / 10 of Wands<br>Completion of a past cycle. Entered a new stage of life. May feel abit restless, lost or even some confusion. Know that is only a transition, dun keep focusing on issues or try so hard to keep everything in check. Future appears busy, stressed. The stressful events are ones that you are willing to carry, have chosen to carry. Busy but appears content and willing.</p>
