              <p> </p>
              <p>Layout of reading: Basic General Celtic Cross + Issues (10+3 cards)</p>
              <p>Current Situation - 2 of Cups<br>There is a need to see others as they truely are and not as you want to see them (or the way they want you to see them). Recently also seemed to be feeling a little tired, perhaps even a little empty- like you are not truely understood by people. Extrememly likely that you have emotional/relationship matters that is constantly revolving around in your head. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">- i have to be wary of certain ppl. currently, i feel drained &amp; fustrated for being surrounded by ppl who are of burdens than help.</span></p>
              <p>Crossing Card - 9 of Wands<br>Seems to be waiting for something. Also present is the feeling of being overwhelmed, burderned, tired- although it would seem to me that is not of an obvious reason, or is due to something that you are not willing to share with everyone. Whatever it is, miscommunication seems to play a part in your situation. So mind your words, the way you speak and the way you listen/relate to others. Cannot control others but at least can control things on your part. Sometimes, giving in might not be altogether a bad thing...<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> - i m vry vry vry tired; too much commitments, too lil time.</span> <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Applies to abv comments. But am too private a person, so rather kip to myself.</span></p>
              <p>Thoughts/ Events Crowning - Ace of Sword<br>Focused, determined. Seems to be making some kind of decision, although from the position of this card, more likely that you have already reached some kind of resolution. You have an idea of what you want and how things should be. While you have a clarity that I can only admire, you need to be sure that it is truely what you want/need at this moment in time. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">- what izit dat u admire? sumone last did for me &amp; said i've got a very gd &amp; rare card combi. it was the sun/sword or crown or smtg liddat.</span></p>
              <p>Foundation - 6 of Cups<br>Do not get stuck with nostalgia. What's past is past, learn to let go and to forgive. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">I'd say that people around you tend to value you and your opinion, they are the types that would support you, help you pave your own way. Perhaps that is why compared to others, you are rather certain of yourself and of who you are- which is a good thing, in a way.</span> However, I'd still feel that you need to explore within yourself, find the quiet little voice that tells you what you need. The voice that is more often than not- intuitively correct. There is still room for more understanding and exploration within yourself. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">(spot on, in a way) </span></p>
              <p>Past - Justice<br>There was disharmony of sorts in your past. Persons involved are not open in communication, with either one or both parties not speaking/refusing to speak. There also apears to be harsh judgement on either one or both sides- not seeing the true situation, and not willing to compromise/find a mutually agreeable solution. This seems to be a good time to shift focus towards understanding and developing the self as a individual and complete person.<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> -</span><span style="color: #ff00ff;"> no, i refuse to communicate wif ah tiongs unless necessary.</span></p>
              <p>Future - Page of Wands<br>Having new goals and directions is a good thing. This card tells that there is opportunity for new growth. You have the chance to develop in new ways, and there is also a high possibility of a new partner in your life or romantic attention from others. The possibilities are all present, is only up to you to recognise and to seize the chance. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">- romantic attn - oways. new partner - dun tink so.</span></p>
              <p>Allies - Ace of Pentacle (R)<br>There is a need for better relationship with your friends. It is either that they are not very supportive (only there for the highlights in your life), or you have not encountered much hardships with them. Whichever way, I do not sense a very deep, understanding, strong and unconditional supportive kind of friendship in this situation. Friendship is reciprocal, treat others as you'd like to be treated. If you want an open and honest friend that will stand by you no matter what, first make sure you have correctly identified that the person is trustworthy and reliable, then make sure that you are open, honest and totally supportive towards them too. While giving is good, be careful that you are not over-indulgent or over-generous. Oh, if your friends propose money making opportunities, can consider- just make sure is all totally legal and you understand all legalities and explore all details involved before proceeding or committing, and it shouldn't be too much of a problem. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">- i lealli hv no time to concentrate on any other ppl.</span></p>
              <p>Environment - Wheel of Fortune (R)<br>Things seems a little messy right now. Especially your surroundings, perhaps work area or accomodation. Whichever it is, if you can take the time off- can do a little spring cleaning. Afterall, chinese new year is around the corner, the timing is about right. Gather your colleagues and get them to help clean up the work area too, or something. When your things are in order, you'd find it much easier to keep your thoughts clearer and in order, and slo to bring your life in order. Remember, change is inevitable. Accept, do not resist change. Afterall, you have to let go of the old to make space for the new things/experiences to enter. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">- yes yes yes, evrythg is in a mess!</span></p>
              <p>Hopes &amp; Fears - 4 of Pentacles<br>Live life as it is. Live in the moment, in the present. Let go of the past, no point holding on so tight. Also stop wondering about past choices and how things could/should have been. No need to worry about the future- just make the correct choices for now and live life out. If you have made a decision, and is sure that it is what you want and need, then don't second guess or doubt yourself. Also, whatever your emotions, try to watch your diet, don't indulge in starvation or binge-eating. Take more fruits and veggies, cut down on junk food and drink more water. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">- ystrdy vry stressed so went to buy choc.</span></p>
              <p>Outcome - Knight of Swords<br>Having an idea of sorts, maybe the decision, maybe a new plan. Whichever it is, you need to strive harder. There are challenges ahead that you can solve, but you have to be sure of your abilities and your commitment. Appears that you can succeed or solve whatever is coming your way- you just need to have courage and perserverance, and also a good judgement of the situation. Make sure you know what you are getting yourself into, and things should be pretty fine! <span style="color: #ff00ff;">- wt can i say except tt i hav a blessed life.</span></p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>Current Issues: 5 of Pentacles (R) / Queen of Pentacles / 5 of Wands<br>Extravagance. Money issues. Emptiness. Need to be in touch with self more. Need to focus clearer for matters on hand. Watch for strive/disharmony/overindulgence. - <span style="color: #ff00ff;">waste $$$. ppl like to cheat my money. i m exhausted. no time for self-pityin/exploration. bz, live each day as it cms. anti low class ppl ard me who waste my time.</span></p>
              <p>(No need to worry too much here, was drawn to help direct my focus to particular aspects/areas of your spread.)</p>

              <p><br>Hihi,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your feedback.<br>As for the above feedback...<br><br>-I admire your clarity, your sense certainty. Admiration of you knowing your path and for being so... resolute (for lack of a better word). <br>As for the rare card combination, then it must have been quite a blessed time in your life. <br>Tarot can "predict" your current situation and your life, but your choices does affect your ongoing luck/path. Still, luck does change, so always have to be prepared.</p>
              <p>-What is an "ah tiong"...?</p>
              <p>-Having a blessed life is not all about being born lucky. It is also about being true to your heart and making correct choices. Glad that you have a smooth path, but know that you still have to work for it, and your success is only because of you. Jia you oh~</p>
              <p>Oh, I still have a couple of questions, just wondering whether you would mind answering those...?</p>

              <p>Hi En' I finally got the time to read and analyze the Reading.</p>
              <p>ps. I took a hiatus to clear my mind but unfortunately I started work and mind never cleared up after that. Principles are always changing and evolving learning on a day to day basis.</p>
              <p><br>Current Situation<br>I'm graduating from school pretty soon and wondering about how I would be able to find a spouse in the future so I feel that the feeling of confusion is spot on. I was even thinking a few days back to a quote that I remember reading, 'We are a generation of apathetic individuals'. I also have feelings of slight depression, due to not wanting to graduate.<br><br>Crossing Card<br>I'm not sure what to make of this. I think the closest feeling I have of being bounded would probably be related to the fact that I'm the eldest son so I feel the need to perform well in the upcoming exams to be able to secure a good university placing.<br><br>Thoughts/Events Crowning<br>Perhaps one of the dreams/fantasies I would be having is a body like Ronaldo so.. hahaha! Another one that is more likely would be trying to achieve a perfect GPA so I guess it is accurate.<br><br>Foundation<br>Missed opportunity?! Where?! Oh no! I agree with the procrastinating part though and if I were more grateful I guess I would be feeling less depressed.<br><br>Past<br>Sometimes I do feel that I do not understand myself or are not being honest to myself, running away from problems which are mostly related to relationships and goals.<br><br>I stopped till here before trying to clear my mind.</p>
              <p>Future<br>I am going to graduate from poly but I don't see that as an achievement but rather an expectation. The people around me are excited though. I am currently involved in a major company project so I'm working to make progress on it.<br><br>Allies<br>I have always been an independant person but maybe lately I have been more humble and asked for the opinions of others. Sometimes I'm not sure of what I want like in the past so I have to think and mull over the matter a few days to sort it out straight.<br><br>Environment<br>I never had that feeling of someone watching over me but I'm sure I would feel grateful and loved if it did happen.<br><br>Hopes &amp; Fears<br>I do know my limits well and rarely try to stretch and push them. I end up being lazy sometimes and that isn't good. I always try to wawtch my diet and exercise and sleep but usually it isn't sufficient.<br><br>Outcome<br>I know what I want and am working hard towards it but it seems as though the effort is not paying off well. There was a woman for a brief period of time but I might have scared her off with my advances haha.</p>
