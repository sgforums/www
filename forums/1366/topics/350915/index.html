              <h2><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong></strong></span></h2>
              <h2><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>You are Strength</strong></span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Courage, strength, fortitude. Power not arrested in the act of judgement, but passing on to further action, sometimes obstinacy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This is a card of courage and energy. It represents both the Lion's hot, roaring energy, and the Maiden's steadfast will. The innocent Maiden is unafraid, undaunted, and indomitable. In some cards she opens the lion's mouth, in others she shuts it. Either way, she proves that inner strength is more powerful than raw physical strength. That forces can be controlled and used to score a victory is very close to the message of the Chariot, which might be why, in some decks, it is Justice that is card 8 instead of Strength. With strength you can control not only the situation, but yourself. It is a card about anger and impulse management, about creative answers, leadership and maintaining one's personal honor. It can also stand for a steadfast friend.</span></p>

              <h2><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>You are The Empress</strong></span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Beauty, happiness, pleasure, success, luxury, dissipation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Empress is associated with Venus, the feminine planet, so it represents, 
              beauty, charm, pleasure, luxury, and delight. You may be good at home 
              decorating, art or anything to do with making things beautiful.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Empress is a creator, be it
              creation of life, of romance, of art or business. While the Magician is
              the primal spark, the idea made real, and the High Priestess is the one
              who gives the idea a form, the Empress is the womb where it gestates
              and grows till it is ready to be born. This is why her symbol is Venus,
              goddess of beautiful things as well as love. Even so, the Empress is
              more Demeter, goddess of abundance, then sensual Venus. She is the
              giver of Earthly gifts, yet at the same time, she can, in anger
              withhold, as Demeter did when her daughter, Persephone, was kidnapped.
              In fury and grief, she kept the Earth barren till her child was
              returned to her.</span></p>

                                <h2><b>You are The Moon</b></h2>
                                <p>Hope, expectation, Bright promises.</p>
                                <p>The Moon is a card of magic and mystery - when prominent you know that nothing is as it seems, particularly when it concerns relationships. All logic is thrown out the window.</p>
                                <p>The Moon is all about visions and illusions, madness, genius and poetry. This is a card that has to do with sleep, and so with both dreams and nightmares. It is a scary card in that it warns that there might be hidden enemies, tricks and falsehoods. But it should also be remembered that this is a card of great creativity, of powerful magic, primal feelings and intuition. You may be going through a time of emotional and mental trial; if you have any past mental problems, you must be vigilant in taking your medication but avoid drugs or alcohol, as abuse of either will cause them irreparable damage. This time however, can also result in great creativity, psychic powers, visions and insight. You can and should trust your intuition.</p>

These are gods of pleasure and abandon, of wild behavior and unbridled desires. This is a card about ambitions; it is also synonymous with temptation and addiction. On the flip side, however, the card can be a warning to someone who is too restrained, someone who never allows themselves to get passionate or messy or wild - or ambitious. This, too, is a form of enslavement. As a person, the Devil can stand for a man of money or erotic power, aggressive, controlling, or just persuasive. This is not to say a bad man, but certainly a powerful man who is hard to resist. The important thing is to remember that any chain is freely worn. In most cases, you are enslaved only because you allow it.</span></p>

              <h2><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>You are The Devil</strong></span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Materiality. Material Force. Material temptation; sometimes obsession</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Devil is often a great card for business success; hard work and ambition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Perhaps the most misunderstood of all the major arcana, the Devil is not really "Satan" at all, but Pan the half-goat nature god and/or Dionysius. These are gods of pleasure and abandon, of wild behavior and unbridled desires. This is a card about ambitions; it is also synonymous with temptation and addiction. On the flip side, however, the card can be a warning to someone who is too restrained, someone who never allows themselves to get passionate or messy or wild - or ambitious. This, too, is a form of enslavement. As a person, the Devil can stand for a man of money or erotic power, aggressive, controlling, or just persuasive. This is not to say a bad man, but certainly a powerful man who is hard to resist. The important thing is to remember that any chain is freely worn. In most cases, you are enslaved only because you allow it.</span></p>

              <h2><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>You are The Emperor</strong></span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Stability, power, protection, realization; a great person.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Emperor is the great authority figure of the Tarot, so it represents 
              fathers, father-figures and employers. There is a lot of aggression and violence 
              too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Emperor naturally follows the Empress. Like an infant, he is filled with enthuiasm, energy, aggression. He is direct, guileless and all too often irresistible. Unfortunately, like a baby he can also be a tyrant. Impatient, demanding, controlling. In the best of circumstances, he signifies the leader that everyone wants to follow, sitting on a throne that indicates the solid foundation of an Empire he created, loves and rules with intelligence and enthusiasm. But that throne can also be a trap, a responsibility that has the Emperor feeling restless, bored and discontent.</span></p>

              <h2><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>You are The Tower</strong></span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Ambition, fighting, war, courage. Destruction, danger, fall, ruin.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Tower represents war, destruction, but also spiritual renewal. Plans are disrupted. Your views and ideas will change as a result.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Tower is a card about war, a war between the structures of lies and the lightning flash of truth. The Tower stands for "false concepts and institutions that we take for real." You have been shaken up; blinded by a shocking revelation. It sometimes takes that to see a truth that one refuses to see. Or to bring down beliefs that are so well constructed. What's most important to remember is that the tearing down of this structure, however painful, makes room for something new to be built.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Wheel of Fortune is all
              about big things, luck, change, fortune. Almost always good fortune.
              You are lucky in all things that you do and happy with the things that
              come to you. Be careful that success does not go to your head however.
              Sometimes luck can change.</span></p>
