And so we come to you with great illumination of Light.<br><br>It is that on this occasion we wish to speak to you of the children. It is that for many years of your earth time, your children have been arriving with the gifts as it was in the Beginning. These children inherently carry that which is the crystalline energies. Not only are these energetics crystalline in nature, they are also carrying the harmonics of the pyramids, those which are tetrahedronal in form. These pyramids carrying an entirety of the spectrum of light. The Sacred Spiral. This meaning a fullness of the spectrum of light and frequencies. A complete set of energies. Perfection in existence.<br><br>This combination of light energies is perfection Universal. These children are able to function as pure energy within their consciousness. These little Beings are coming with the abilities to see past the illusions. The abilities to travel within their consciousnesses throughout the dimensional realms. They are able to see past the illusions that are created within your third dimensional realities.<br><br>It is that these children are able to communicate telepathically, and are speaking to others in other dimensions as a normal event in the course of their play. It is that these children understand that which you do not. That reality is not limited to that which is what you see, hear, feel, taste and smell, but a much greater reality that is beyond your physical manifestations.<br><br>It is that these children are coming forth into this world as it is written that they must at this time. It is that they carry to you Rememberings of that which is, that which is truth, that which is the essence of Being in the reality of the One. It is that these beings who come to you in this way are emissaries o the Ancient Ways. They bring to you a reality that to you seems to be one which is new. It is that this reality is of the Beginning. It is that these children carry the vibration that brings into harmony your world and the One.<br><br>These children are being misunderstood, and even considered abnormal in their behaviors. It is not so. It is that they come remembering that which you have forgotten. They have no patience for everyday smallness as it exists in your reality. To these young Beings, reality is a much larger and more important picture. It is that these children are sensitive to the feelings, the essences of others. It is that they are able to see what is truth within and around all things, and these children are not accepting of untruths in their realities.<br><br>These children are highly intuitive. They see all that is, and perceive all at once. They do not think within their mental structuring in linear form, but rather holographically. This type of thinking brings high intelligence. Their perceptive abilities are utilizing once dormant areas of brain matter that is coming alive with the genetic changes that are occurring at this time.<br><br>Many of these beings are coming as starseeds to bring forward once again and carry the energies that must be utilized with the coming shift. It is that these children are forefront in the Knowings. And yet, as they exhibit their gifts, many of those responsible for these children are misunderstanding these behaviors as strange misalignments to the accepted reality.<br><br>These children are being taught against their inherent abilities to behave in ways that are foreign to them. They are resisting those untruths, and many of them are rebelling. They are becoming seen as problems in your societies as they fight the untruths that are given to them. It is that they are unable to see or interpret the logic or that which you consider important within your third dimensional structuring, as these children do not recognize structure in that which you perceive the normal ways. </span></strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;">It is that we ask you to become aware of these children, for it is they who bring you light, bring you Truth to your existences in ways that you are only beginning to become aware of.<br><br>It is that we ask you to nurture the gifts of these crystalline children, as they bring to you that which is an important part of your evolution toward becoming beings of light in your original form. Praise their difference.<br><br>Know that this is as it should be. They will bring you understandings as to the Ancient ways, those which you perceive as new ways, as those ways in which your world is operating at this time are of false truth, of disillusionment, of deception. These children come with the ability to teach you to operate as the One. It is that these children carry the ways of the future that will assist you in wholeness for a world of harmony, of peace, for within them is carried the vibration of all things. The One.<br><br>It is that within the human genetic structuring, changes are occurring. It is that with these changes, there are certain signalings that are taking place in the form of an electrical arc from one segment of the genetic structuring to another, once dormant sector. New yet old connections are being made. Some of you are experiencing this as Awakening to other realities.<br><br>Some are experiencing more subtle, physical changes, such as your digestive systems requiring different foods for optimum performance, others are experiencing lymphatic or adrenal malfunction. Yet others are experiencing lack of clarity and decisiveness as the energies expand and your mental selves are not keeping up. Others of you are experiencing pain within your physicalities that is not remedied with the usual forms of treatment and seemingly has no explanation for its occurrence. This all will equalize as you adapt to the changes.<br><br>As your awareness revitalizes the activity of your genetic make-up begins to operate more fully as it once did. It is within this structuring that your awakenings are coming in more fully, often as if your Awareness seems surreal. Perhaps you are seeing or hearing other realities that you had not before experienced. It is that this is a normal part of the process. We ask you to remember to breath and to remain open to that which you receive. Remember to ask for interpretation or guidance when necessary. There are always those of other dimensions who wait for your request who are there to serve you, to give you that which you need.<br><br>There are occurring different electrical patterns amongst the segmentation of the genetic structuring. With the re-patterning of these electrical signals, different combinations of the switching mechanisms within the double helix are occurring.<br><br>This is also leading to far more that the basic four of your genetic alphabet. It is that within these changes are becoming new chemical compounds of proteins and amino acids that are conducive to your reception and transmision of data in the Ancient ways, in a more highly refined transfer of energies. Smoothing out the fields, so to speak, so that the energies are moving in a smooth way, rather than the chaotic, interrupted way that your physical evolutionary process have caused.<br><br>You see, your genetic structure, that spiraling double length of DNA material is much more than simply a tool for your evolutionary physical process to remember from one generation to the next, it is much like a Universal communication satellite that has been dormant for thousands of millennia. It is also that which re-opens your gamma brain wave activity for access to Higher communication. Higher learning. Reconnection with those who will lead you home. It is that as you move closer to that which is the shift your energetic make-ups are preparing you for the changes that will occur.<br><br>Within these changes come the re-awakened abilities to perceive in energetic form, to communicate on many levels at once, not simply that of your mind or that of your intuitive selves, but farther. It is that with these genetic changes comes a refinement of your electromagnetic selves.<br><br>In such a way that you are transmitting in light form, as it was in the Beginning. And as you transmit in light form, you are communicating in the purest of ways. You are communicating on a Universal level. Past your words, past your motion, your emotion, beyond your thinking, as pure light beings. As intrinsic parts of the One. As you already are. Within this transmission and reception are the harmonics that travel electro magnetically along the corridors of the null zones between the particulates in the Universal Construct. As this energy travels past the particulates, the particulates rearrange their order.<br><br>Depending upon the state of light, the frequencies of the energies, the message is given form in its formlessness. It is here that all manifestation occurs, miracles are accomplished and healing becomes reality. It is here that alchemy is accomplished. It is that we can compare this to form and formlessness to your current existences.<br><br>As you are in form, you are weighty, dense, and grounded in your atmosphere. As you are in formlessness, operating from within your consciousness, you become capable of Light-ness. That which is your true selves. Light-ness is the ability to be anything anywhere anytime as you wish as you require, and as you operate in this way, with your consciousness, you are sending that which is you, your message to all levels of being without the weight of your physicalities.<br><br>And so it is also that you are receiving in the same way. Your essence is light. Your essence functions within the harmonics and light of the Universal process, moving outwardly above, below and to all directions, communicating all the way. Receiving all the way.<br><br>It is in this way you return to your Galactic Being-ness. As you become multi-dimensionally oriented, you will begin to understand that the Truth lies in all things, not in your mind. Not in your simple third dimensional perceptions or external stimulation, but much farther.<br><br>It is in this way that the children are coming fully operable into your world. It is in this way that many of you are learning to Become. It is in this way that some of you came as forerunners of today's children, carrying the Knowings and bringing forward the evolutionary changes one to the other until it has come as a matter of natural occurrence.<br><br>Many of you are prepared to guide them. You will see that those children of the crystalline form will recognize you if you are being of the light. They will lock their eyes with yours, and communicate to you that they have a knowing of you, even before they can speak. Listen to their wordless-ness. Tell them in this same telepathic form that you understand, that they are not alone, that you are aware of them, and give them fullness of Universal and unconditional love in that moment. They will remember.<br><br>And unto you we say that you are Beings Eternal. That you are of and within the Light. It is for you to choose that path which you wish to walk. To embrace that which is yourself, that being all things, the One. We remind you that comparison of yourselves one to another accomplishes nothing, for each of you is that of the other. Move forward toward the whole. You are the One you seek, Dear Ones. Fear not the coming times, for it is as it has always been. The only change has been your perceptions. Be in peace. Be only love. Be from within. as you are, so it is.<br><br>We return to light.<br>Namaste.<br><br>.for when the pure of heart meets with the pureness of being in all its innocence is born an existence of harmony with all things. </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.crystalinks.com/indigochildren.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Lesson of the Indigo Child </span><br><br>I first heard of the Indigo Children in the early 1980's. The Indigo Children were the New People, the Children of the Earth; those who would retrace the steps of Mankind to find what we had lost. They would live the philosophy of the Earth, balanced in Spirit, and they would purge Man of destructive thinking. The Elders spoke of the arrival of the Indigoes in hushed voices that underscored both their hope that the Indigo Children would bring peace and harmony in the Fifth World, and their fear that things had gone too far for Mankind to survive.<br><br>Like many professionals who work with children, I began to see a distinct pattern emerging as the Indigoes arrived in force and as I began working with them more frequently. Articles began appearing in psychology, social work, medical, psychiatric and education journals on the Indigo Children. Most of these articles discussed the increase in gifted children who were behavior problems at home and at school. Many of these children were also hyperactive. It became increasingly clear that the Indigoes were considered by professionals to be difficult children who did not respond well to many behavior management techniques or to most medications. Many alternative strategies were proposed to assist parents and professionals in "norming" or socializing these children, including experimental medication, behavior management programs, intensive psychotherapy and institutionalization.<br><br>At the same time, references to the Indigo Children began appearing in New Age articles and books, and these writers spoke enthusiastically about the skill and insight of the Indigo. These children were special in their ability to understand and work with energy on an instinctive level, they were intelligent and insightful, and they had confidence in both their knowledge and their skill. Many were psychic and many had extraordinary healing power. But these writers made no mention of the difficulties the Indigoes faced in daily living. I saw the Indigo Children struggling to maintain their spirit in a society that does not value spirituality, does not recognize knowledge or wisdom that is not taught, and which claims to value individuality but does not accept individual differences.<br><br>The first significant published work that opened the door to serious discussion of the Indigoes plight in relation to their unique skills and gifts was The Indigo Children: The New Kids Have Arrived by Jan Tober and Lee Carroll, published in 1999. In this work the Indigo Child is defined as "one who displays a new and unusual set of psychological attributes and shows a pattern of behavior generally undocumented before." Tober and Carroll caution: "(the) pattern has common unique factors that suggest that those who interact with them (parents, in particular) change their treatment and upbringing of them in order to achieve balance. To ignore these new patterns is to potentially create imbalance and frustration in the mind of this precious new life."<br><br>Indigo Children are notorious for their unwillingness to accept authority at face value or to follow instructions or routines that do not make sense to them. Our society demands that people, especially children, earn respect through demonstrated expertise or accomplishment. Position and authority is granted when respect is earned, but minorities (racial, age, gender or religious) continue to find that they are denied position and authority in the hierarchies for reasons that cannot be justified. Society demands that those granted position and authority be followed without discussion or question. This expectation is particularly difficult for the Indigo Child. Tober and Carroll describe them as coming into the world with a "feeling of royalty" and although many parents and professionals agree wholeheartedly in this assessment, I challenge this perception. I see the Indigo Child as an evolved spiritual being who is a "self-actualizing person" as described in the work of the well-respected psychologist, Abraham H. Maslow. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs model for human behavior proposes that human beings require a series of needs be met in order to develop to their full potential.<br><br>I believe that the Indigo Children are true egalitarians, they have a developed and healthy sense of their connectedness to the Universe and they understand their place within it. They will not allow this to be challenged. Those people who are still attempting to meet their own Esteem needs will view the Indigo as behaving in a superior and condescending way. Thus, the Indigo Child can appear to be arrogant when they are self-confident, defiant when they are self-regulated, condescending when they have no sense of inequality or inattentive when they are prevented from pursuing their potential.<br><br>The Indigo Children are currently struggling with societal norms; norms that are based upon a hierarchical structure that is contrary to the values that Pagans and Universal Beings value and respect. Maslow recognized that our social structures, like schools, routinely undermine self-actualizing people, especially in the areas of Social Needs with acceptance and Ego/Esteem Needs with respect. All of the research that I have read, and all the experiences that I have had in working with Indigo Children follow the advice that Maslow gave educators in 1968:<br><br>[We should teach people to be authentic; to be aware of their inner selves and to hear their inner-feeling voices.<br><br>We should teach people to transcend their own cultural conditioning, and become world citizens.<br><br>We should help people discover their vocation in life, their calling, fate or destiny. This is especially focused upon finding the right career and the right mate.<br><br>We should teach people that life is precious, that there is joy to be experienced in life, and if people are open to seeing the good and joyous in all kinds of situations, it makes life worth living.<br><br>We must accept the person and help him or her learn their inner nature. From real knowledge of aptitudes and limitations we can know what to build upon, what potentials are really there.<br><br>We must see that the person's basic needs are satisfied. That includes safety, belongingness and esteem needs.<br><br>We should refreshen consciousness, teaching the person to appreciate beauty and the other good things in nature and in living.<br><br>We should teach people that controls are good, and complete abandon is bad. It takes control to improve the quality of life in all areas.<br><br>We should teach people to transcend the trifling problems and grapple with the serious problems in life. These include the problems of injustice, of pain, suffering and death.<br><br>We must teach people to be good choosers. They must be given practice in making choices, first between one good and another; later between one god and another.<br><br>Maslow's advice will help any parent or professional in living or working with Indigo Children. More importantly, these should be the norms for our society. We must take this advice to heart and advocate for our society to change so that all people will be encouraged and supported to become World Citizens or Universal Beings. We can demand nothing less for our children and ourselves.<br><br></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;">Many spiritualists acknowledge the emergence of the Fifth World. Many theorize that the World and Mankind is evolving to a new level. Much of the Indigo Children literature speaks about the spiritual and biological impact that this evolution will have on the World, but there has not been much discussion about what the impact will be on the psychological functioning of individuals and the impact the change will have on our society.<br><br>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is an accurate reflection of the natural evolution of the human spirit and psyche. The First World required people to learn how to get their physical needs met, leading them to discover how to hunt, what plants were edible, and how to find shelter. The Second World required people to learn how to keep themselves safe, leading them to learn how to make and use weapons, how to build shelters that could be defended and withstand natural forces, and how to outwit predators and enemies. The Third World required people to learn how to meet their social needs, civilizations were born and rules and protocols for social interaction were developed. The Fourth World prompted people to meet their esteem needs, to learn about themselves in relation to the world, to question their place in it, and to explore and to learn everything they could. The Fifth World would prompt people to be self-actualizing, to be involved in a cause outside their own skin, to act on their potential and to seek moral and spiritual fulfillment.<br><br>For spiritualists the Indigo Children herald the coming of the Fifth World. For psychologists, educators and parents they herald the emergence of a new and unique set of behavioral problems that must be "solved". Both perceptions are valid. Both perceptions lead us to the same solution: the lesson that the Indigo Children are teaching us through the pain and anguish that they experience in schools, in communities, and in some homes is that our society needs to evolve along with our spirit</span></strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">What's an Indigo Child?<br><span style="font-style: italic;">by Wendy H. Chapman</span><br><br>Indigo Children are the current generation being born today and most of those who are 8 years old or younger. They are different. They have very unique characteristics that set them apart from previous generations of children. The name itself indicates the Life Color they carry in their auras and is indicative of the Third Eye Chakra, which represents intuition and psychic ability. These are the children who are often rebellious to authority, nonconformist, extremely emotionally and sometimes physically sensitive or fragile, highly talented or academically gifted and often metaphysically gifted as well, usually intuitive, very often labeled ADD, either very empathic and compassionate OR very cold and callous, and are wise beyond their years. Does this sound like yourself or your child?<br><br>Indigos have come into this world with difficult challenges to overcome. Their extreme levels of sensitivity are hard to understand and appreciate by parents who don't share this trait. Their giftedness is unusual in such high numbers. Their nonconformity to systems and to discipline will make it difficult to get through their childhood years and perhaps even their adult years. It is also what will help them accomplish big goals such as changing the educational system, for instance. Being an Indigo won't be easy for any of them, but it foretells a mission. The Indigo Children are the ones who have come to raise the vibration of our planet! These are the primary ones who will bring us the enlightenment to ascend.<br><br>There's a very good chance your child is an Indigo if he/she was born after 1992. About 85% or higher of children born in '92 or later, 90% born in '94 or after and 95% or more born now (some even say 99%) are Indigo Children! Does this mean you aren't one if you were born prior to 1992? No! I've heard reports that they started coming in the 80s, but that means coming in larger numbers. I believe there have been Indigos born in every year, but perhaps not in high enough percentages to notice their presence and see what makes them so unique. So can you be a 24 yr old Indigo or a 50 year old one? Yes! </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
