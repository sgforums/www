They do choose a general geographic region to live in, but move their nests frequently within their territory. They build their nests in remote areas, where they are secluded from outside disturbances.<br><br>Song Dragons are a dull grey color to their scales, but are graceful and quick in movement. The most striking attribute of the Song Dragon is it's voice. Having several sets of vocal chords, the Dragon's every word reverberates like a string symphony.<br><br>Song Dragons build their homes deep in seclusion, but in truth they are very social and friendly in nature. They will often be found polymorphed into human form and fraternizing with people in bars and public places.Song Dragons are the bards of dragonkind, they greatly value creative thinking and artistic talent. They live life to it's fullest, and are well known for going to extremes. They are also known for their good-hearted nature and kindness.<br><br>This Dragons favorite elements are: Jade, Music, and Happiness<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>same <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Often the dragon will trade it's "protection" in return a certain number of maidens derived to it's doorstep every year. It should be noted that a Red Dragon makes this trade not because it cannot acquire maidens by it's own power, rather simply because it enjoys this delivery service.<br>'<br>This Dragons favorite elements are: Brimstone, Fire, and Fear<br><br>Http://Dragonhame.Com<br></div>

They are nearly identical in appearance to reds. Aside from the brighter red scales and some minor facial differences, the only  appreciable difference is the black throat of the crimson dragon.'<br>At greater distances, crimson dragons appear identical to red dragons. Unlike most dragons, the scales of a crimson dragon change little in color throughout their lives. They stay a bright crimson red from birth to old age.'<br>While crimson dragons resemble red dragons in appearance, their temperament and outlook on life are quite different. While they still tend to hoard treasure, Crimson dragons take the side of good during conflicts between good and evil. A crimson dragon's worst enemy is the evil red dragon, who give them a bad reputation.  Combat between the two types are relatively common, and, assuming the combatants are of roughly the same age, these fights are usually quite evenly matched.<br>'<br>This Dragons favorite elements are: Roses, Emeralds, and Bravery<br></div>
