However, by now there are some things you should have mastered. Your progress in this area shows:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">You have been the type of child who charms the lollipops off people. You have been the type of child who is huggable and gets her cheeks pinched by old ladies with bright red lipstick.</span><br><br><strong>Now, regarding your emotional and personality development...</strong><br><br>You are a fairly trustworthy little girl, making your share of exploratory excursions into the world of the unknown and forbidden (the bathroom and under the kitchen sink).<br><br>Your folks could trust you in most cases, but <span style="color: blue;">when all of the chocolates have one bite taken out of them, it is a fair guess whose teethmarks have made those jagged impressions.</span><br><br><strong>Your Thoughtfulness</strong> characteristic really doesn't count for much in this phase of life. Most children often find themselves at the mercy of their whims and impulses. You are allowed to be cranky now. People will tolerate it much better than when you are a teen-ager. Then your whining and carrying on will seem more objectionable.<br><br>You are a gentle baby, one of those adorable little girls that learns to give kisses at an early age and knows how to "make nice." This helps you along socially now. Fifteen years or so from now, you are going to have to keep a closer tab on those hot lips, but for now anyone is fair game.<br><br>People will love you so much, they won't even mind when you leave them with all of those contagious childhood coughs and colds kids have a tendency to spread.<br><br>That wraps up your status for the very first years of life. I hope you like yourself. If not, you can always try to improve in the years to come.

            <div class='col-md body'>You have just passed through ADOLESCENCE.<br><br>Family life can be very rough during adolescence. Even though your family expects you to take charge of your life, no<br><br>one wants to let you have the freedom to do what you want.<br><br>Judging by your progress through life so far, your family life has been quite good, all things considered. Family<br><br>members can be pains, but no one seems to mind it when you overhaul your hair for three hours every morning in the<br><br>bathroom.<br><br>Physically you have been not very healthy.<br><br>Socially, this phase of life does present its share of problems. Most of these problems fall into the category of boys. Life<br><br>must have been pretty simple before they showed up. Your social adjustment has been remarkable.<br>Although you do not have a steady boyfriend at the present time, there's always the next life phase.<br><br>Now, regarding your emotional development...<br><br>You are a remarkably trustworthy young woman. This trait is bound to take you far, emotionally and vocationally. You<br><br>are developing into the type of adult that people can confide in. Unfortunately, the burden that comes along with this<br><br>characteristic is the tendency for people to tell you their problems. You become the strong shoulder that everyone cries<br><br>on.<br><br>A positive aspect of your adolescence is your ability to resist temptation and not give into your impulses. Since<br><br>adolescence is a time for testing limits, this can get some people into some pretty dangerous situations. However,<br><br>leading an excessively sheltered life can be boring.<br><br>You seem to be enjoying most of what you do. Even though you experience "the blues" every once in a while, it's nice<br><br>to see that you are not having a depressed, traumatized life.<br><br>Even though an occasional explosive outburst is common in most adolescents, you seem to have everything well under<br><br>control. You seem to be sensitive and gentle.<br><br>You certainly have a good head on your shoulders. You are not only book-smart, but you also have plenty of common<br><br>sense.<br><br>Now that your adolescence is almost over, it's time to be hurled out there into the abyss of the REAL WORLD.

            <div class='col-md body'>You have just passed through YOUNG ADULTHOOD.<br><br>This may have been a time in your life when family activities took a back seat to establishing some independence. In general, your family relationships are good.<br><br>Physically you have been not very healthy.<br>You have wisely chosen to stay away from drinking and drugs to a large extent.<br><br>In this phase of life some of the issues you have faced are: what crowd of people to associate with and what material items bring recognition from them.

You are not only book-smart, you also have plenty of common sense.<br><br>By this time, you may have been feeling a bit of pressure to achieve, get ahead, buy a house or possibly even (gasp!) settle down.
