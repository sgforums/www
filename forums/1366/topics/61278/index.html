Don't think any of the statements in my post indicate that the Bible promote goddess Worship! We should always perceive things with open heart &amp; mind!<br><br>At times your words you carry it with an air of Repulsion And while this is not an amiable trait, neither is it in accordance with the precepts and genius of Christianity. The leading element of the gospel is love Â— its origin is love Â— its spirit is love Â— its end is love. The blessed Saviour, while he was on earth, though he was a most faithful and earnest reprover of sin in every form, was yet a wonderful example of kindness, and forbearance, and charity. The apostles also evinced the same spirit, as well in their conduct as in their teachings. Indeed, the whole tendency of Christianity, in both its doctrines and precepts, is to lead us to form the most charitable judgments of our fellow men, that truth and reason will justify; and never to proclaim our surmises to the disadvantage of another, when we cannot be certain that they are well founded, and when, even if they are, no good can result from our publishing them. The great rule which Christ has given us for the regulation of our social conduct is, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even the same to them." No one wishes to be the object of perpetual censure and crimination. No one wishes to have his actions misrepresented, or his motives arraigned, by ungracious insinuations. No one wishes, after he has done the best that he is capable of doing, to be looked coldly upon, as if he were at least worthy of suspicion, if not an acknowledged malefactor. In indulging in this conduct towards another, then, you not only violate a principle which your own conscience must recognize as a rule of right, but you come in conflict with the fundamental principle of practical Christianity. You thus far disown the authority of the Master whom you profess to serve.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm. . . .Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! . . For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for ur explanation and apologies of any offences have been made. I am not promoting a legalistic christianity because God is love. The foundation of Christian salvation of love and grace, never condemnation.<br><br>In times like this when even Christian bookstores sell books like 'the missing gospels' and so on...u cant really blame me for putting a foot in situations like this. As far as we preached Christ being the love of God demonstrated and His immeasurable love for us, doctrinally  we need to be sound...but while doing so we should not offend the others. How to point out to someone who is 'wrong' and not offending that person? well...some are more open hearted to accept, others will hate ur religion even more.<br><br></div>
