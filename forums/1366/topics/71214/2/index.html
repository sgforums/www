Lighting candles are quite common practice of almost all Religion even in Buddhism...Hinduism...Christainity...Catholism...Evangelism etc... Well all religion teaches us to be good...I am very open to all religions! Seance...Speak in tongues are most evident in some forms of Christianity....like "Invoking the Holy Spirit"...even to the extent of "Laying Of Hands" in faith healing! Well i am not sure if all these is related in any ways to Witchcraft but i definately will not comment about it unless i experience it myself... Any unknown or mysterious events or things that occurs which people cannot find a reason behind it...they tend to label them as work of "Witchcraft"...its seem to be that way since Ancient times...probably this is because most are Mundane &amp; they are scared of unknown when they failed to understand or find any answers for it...they begin to doubt &amp; assume out of "Fear"...Thanks for sharing...Nice discussion...Have a wonderful day...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Be attentive to him and heed his voice." - Exodus 24.20</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">According to Gospel of Barnabas (Chapter 54)<br><br>'When these signs be passed, there shall be darkness over the world forty years, God alone being alive, to whom be honour and glory for ever. When the forty years be passed, God shall give life to his messenger, who shall rise again like the sun, but resplendent as a thouand suns. He shall sit, and shall not speak, for he shall be as it were beside himself. God shall raise again the four angels favoured of God, who shall seek the messenger of God, and, having found him, shall station themselves on the four sides of the place to keep watch upon him. Next shall God give life to all the angels, who shall come like bees circling round the messenger of God. Next shall God give life to all his prophets, who, following Adam, shall go every one to kiss the hand of the messenger of God, committing themselves to his protection. Next shall God give life to all the elect, who shall cry out: "O Mohammed, be mindful of us!" At whose cries pity shall awake in the messenger of God, and he shall consider what he ought to do, fearing for their salvation. Next shall God give life to every created thing, and they shall return to their former existence, but every one shall besides possess the power of speech. Next shall God give life to all the reprobates, at whose resurrection, by reason of their hideousness, all the creatures of God shall be afraid, and shall cry: "Let not thy mercy forsake us, O Lord our God." After this shall God cause Satan to be raised up, at whose aspect every creature shall be as dead, for fear of the horrid form of his appearance. May it please God,' said Jesus, 'that I behold not that monster on that day. The messenger of God alone shall not be affrighted by such shapes because he shall fear God only.<br><br>'Then the angel, at the sound of whose trumpet all shall be raised, shall sound his trumpet again, saying: "Come to the judgment, O creatures, for your Creator willeth to judge you." Then shall appear in the midst of heaven over the valley of Jehoshaphat a glittering throne, over which shall come a white cloud, whereupon the angels shall cry out: "Blessed be thou our God, who hast created us, and saved us from the fall of Satan." Then the messenger of God shall fear, for that he shall perceive that none hath loved God as he should. For he who would get in change a piece of gold must have sixty mites; wherefore, if he have but one mite he cannot change it. But if the messenger of God shall fear, what shall the ungodly do who are full of wickedness?'<br><br>According to Gospel of Barnabas (Chapter 55)<br><br>'The messenger of God shall go to collect all the prophets, to whom he shall speak, praying them to go with him to pray God for the faithful. And every one shall excuse himself for fear; nor, as God liveth, would I go there, knowing what I know. Then God, seeing this, shall remind his messenger how he created all things for love of him, and so his fear shall leave him, and he shall go nigh unto the throne with love and reverence, while the angels sing: "Blessed be thy holy name, O God, our God."<br><br>'And when he hath drawn nigh unto the throne, God shall open [his mind] unto his messenger, even as a friend unto a friend when for a long while they have not met. The first to speak shall be the messenger of God, who shall say: "I adore and love thee, O my God, and with all my heart and soul I give thee thanks for that thou didst vouchsafe to create me to be thy servant, and madest all for love of me, so that I might love thee for all things and in all things and above all things; therefore let all thy creatures praise thee, O my God." Then all things created by God shall say: "We give thee thanks, O Lord, and bless thy holy name." Verily I say unto you, the demons and reprobates with Satan shall then weep so that more water shall flow from the eyes of one of them than is in the river of Jordan. Yet shall they not see God.<br><br>'And God shall speak unto his messenger, saying: "Thou art welcome, O my faithful servant; therefore ask what thou wilt, for thou shalt obtain all." The messenger of God shall answer, "O Lord, I remember that when thou didst create me, thou saidst that thou hadst willed to make for love of me the world and paradise, and angels and men, that they might glorify thee by me thy servant. Therefore, Lord God, merciful and just. I pray thee that thou recollect thy promise made unto thy servant."<br><br>'And God shall make answer even as a friend who jesteth with a friend, and shall say: "Hast thou witnesses of this, my friend Mohammed?" And with reverence he shall say: "Yes, Lord." Then God shall answer: "Go, call them, O Gabriel." The angel Gabriel shall come to the messenger of God, and shall say: "Lord, who are thy witnesses?" The messenger of God shall answer: "They are Adam, Abraham, Ishmael, Moses, David, and Jesus son of Mary."<br><br>'Then shall the angel depart, and he shall call the aforesaid witnesses, who with fear shall go thither. And when they are present God shall say unto them: "Remember ye that which my messenger affirmeth?" They shall reply: "What thing, O Lord?" God shall say: "That I have made all things for love of him, so that all things might praise me by him." Then every one of them shall answer: "There are with us three witnesses better than we are, O Lord." And God shall reply: "Who are these three witnesses?" Then Moses shall say "The book that thou gavest to me is the first"; and David shall say: ''The book that thou ga vest to me is the second"; and he who speaketh to you shall say: "Lord, the whole world, deceived by Satan, said that I was thy son and thy fellow, but the book that thou gavest me said truly that I am thy servant; and that book confesseth that which thy messenger affirmeth." Then shall the messenger of God speak, and shall say: "Thus saith the book that thou gavest me, O Lord." And when the messenger of God hath said this, God shall speak, saying: "All that I have now done, I have done in order that every one should know how much I love thee." And when he hath thus spoken, God shall give unto his messenger a book, in which are written all the names of the elect of God. Wherefore every creature shall do reverence to God, saying: ''To thee alone, O God, be glory and honour, because thou hast given us to thy messenger."</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The LORD Almighty declares, `I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of him who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in his house and destroy it, both its timbers and its stones.'" Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, "Look up and see what this is that is appearing." I asked, "What is it?" He replied, "It is a measuring basket. " And he added, "This is the iniquity of the people throughout the land."<br><br>Zechariah 5:4-6<br><br>This Excerpt clearly proved the Existence of Angelic Wings..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>There are only 4 gospels in the New Testament of the Bible. Namely Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. So the fact you quote from the 'gospel' of barnabas does not back the teachings in anyway.<br><br>And, if i were to tell you the Bible stated clearly that on Judgement Day believers of Christ will judge angels will that make you think angels are superior to us human beings? True..they have powers and heavenly, but we do not exalt them as much as we must exalt God Himself. There previous verse i gave shows that angels like us are all servants of God.<br><br>Idolatry is not merely the worship, veneration of statues...to exalt and devote to anything in the place of God is idolatry in its plainest form.<br><br>Whatever I say is from the Bible, we do not want to discuss such using human logic and traditions. myths and legends are not God's word and have absolutely no authority.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Angels Are Not to be Worshipped<br><br>Here it is appropriate to state that humans do not command angels. Angels are God's beings and respond to God's commands. Neither are we to worship angels. Paul's letter to the Colossians was meant to correct the erroneous teachings of some of their teachers, including worship of angels: "Let no one disqualify you, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels...Colossians 2:18." We are to worship God only. Paul tells of the misery of men who worship the creature rather than the Creator Romans 2:24-25 . Angels were created to worship God, as we were, but that is as far as the similarity goes. One day, we, the Redeemed from sin through the sacrificial blood of Jesus, will rule with Christ in Heaven, and judge the angels.I Corinthians 6:3 , Romans 8:17<br><br><a href="http://www.virtualchurch.org/jk_angel.htm#TOC" rel="nofollow">MORE ABOUT ANGELS HERE</a></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Counterfeit Angels<br><br>Not all angels are of God. Jesus told his disciples that Satan has his angels, also, and God has prepared a place of punishment for them Matthew 25:41 . Paul tells us that the devil himself often appears as an angel of light deceiving those not grounded in God's Word II Corinthians 11:12-15 . There is a mighty battle between good and evil, between God and Satan for the souls of mankind. Scriptures tell of battles fought by warring angels , where satanic angels fight to keep God's work from being performed. We must be able to discern good from evil, right from wrong, satanic spirits from God's spirit. God's angels will never say, do or suggest anything that is contrary to God's Word. Examples of counterfeit angels are those formerly called "spiritual guides" by the #New Age movement, and "angels" described in accounts of people who have undergone near-death experiences. On the other hand, we can be assured that God sends his angels to protect us , and even if we never physically encounter an angel in our lifetime, it is certain that God, as the loving Father of those who believe in God's Son Jesus Christ, has dispatched angels to assist us in our journey through this life.</div>

The messenger of God shall answer: "They are Adam, Abraham, Ishmael, Moses, David, and Jesus son of Mary."<br><br>'Then shall the angel depart, and he shall call the aforesaid witnesses, who with fear shall go thither. And when they are present God shall say unto them: "Remember ye that which my messenger affirmeth?" They shall reply: "What thing, O Lord?" God shall say: "That I have made all things for love of him, so that all things might praise me by him." Then every one of them shall answer: "There are with us three witnesses better than we are, O Lord." And God shall reply: "Who are these three witnesses?" Then Moses shall say "The book that thou gavest to me is the first"; and David shall say: ''The book that thou ga vest to me is the second"; and he who speaketh to you shall say: "Lord, the whole world, deceived by Satan, said that I was thy son and thy fellow, but the book that thou gavest me said truly that I am thy servant; and that book confesseth that which thy messenger affirmeth." Then shall the messenger of God speak, and shall say: "Thus saith the book that thou gavest me, O Lord." And when the messenger of God hath said this, God shall speak, saying: "All that I have now done, I have done in order that every one should know how much I love thee." And when he hath thus spoken, God shall give unto his messenger a book, in which are written all the names of the elect of God. Wherefore every creature shall do reverence to God, saying: ''To thee alone, O God, be glory and honour, because thou hast given us to thy messenger."</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The LORD Almighty declares, `I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of him who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in his house and destroy it, both its timbers and its stones.'" Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, "Look up and see what this is that is appearing." I asked, "What is it?" He replied, "It is a measuring basket. " And he added, "This is the iniquity of the people throughout the land."<br><br>Zechariah 5:4-6<br><br>This Excerpt clearly proved the Existence of Angelic Wings..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>barnabas isn't a gospel.. its been researched into, and analysed. if u can get me a quote from the NIV which is widely used. then i'll believe u.<br><br>otherwise, this is witch craft.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>another thing... pls do get your facts right.. don't introduce cult teachings like the gospel of barnabas and package it into christianity, and give ppl the wrong impression and wrong teaching.<br><br>tnx</div>

I presented the Gospel of Barnabas just as another avenue for our discussion &amp; none of the words in my post indicate i am using it to back any Teachings of Christianity, Kindly don't misunderstand &amp; forced your thought into my intention! Not to Denial, Gospel of Barnabas is one of the Few Famous Sacred Text of the World! Neither you nor me has the Authority to comment about it, don't you think so? </strong></span><strong><br><br></strong><blockquote><strong>Whatever I say is from the Bible, we do not want to discuss such using human logic and traditions. myths and legends are not God's word and have absolutely no authority</strong></blockquote><strong><span style="color: blue;">I am sure what you say is from the Bible but however these are also what you chose to perceive &amp; derive from its teachings! Human Logic is so important if without it don't think you are able to reply my post in anyway...  Traditions, myths and legends has already proven to be of importance in human civilisation thats why it remains Generation after generation till this very Nuclear Age ! Don't tell me you never read Fairy tales all your life or the Little comics or bible short stories issued during Sunday Class... New Testaments are also written by "HUMAN" not through the hands of GOD who is formless..omnipresent! So do not assume &amp; misunderstand, again do not shut yourself up...perceive with Open Heart &amp; Mind...Do not commit Sins through words of mouth or biased thoughts! I believe in GOD too...Thanks for your views...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Again i want to redress &amp; stress that i have never package anything into Christianity, all the writings presented are written by Authority of that field mainly for information only! Not to Denial, "Witchcraft" do exists just its been misunderstood by people over the years thats why people tend to feel unrest &amp; fearful about it &amp; begin to label them as such a Term "Witchcraft"... which is very Debatable &amp; Biase!<br><br>What do you mean by "Cults"? One of the most famous such "Cults" you mean is probably the "Moonies" who background kinda linked to christianity by unverified claims by its leader Sun Myung Moon to have spoken with "Jesus" personally! However as Human we have our own individual cognition so we are able to judge what is right? What is wrong? Its clearly evident to the Masses thats "Moonies" is a cult because of astrocities of the Facts that are committed by its group!<br><br>Kindly don't label writings by others as cults teachings as i do not hope a general topic like this for informational &amp; discussion purposes will amount you to any claims by others on grounds of defamation, Libel &amp; Slander which you will be liable for it in the eyes of Law!
