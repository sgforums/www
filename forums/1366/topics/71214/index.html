Everyone is given at least two Guardian Angels, some people, such as Lightworkers have more.<br><br>Your Guardian Angels know everything you've said, done or thought since the day you were born.  They are non-judgmental and they look forward to helping you when requested.<br>[/quote]<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Getting in touch</strong></span><br><br>Communicating with your Guardian Angel is not difficult.  There's no magic formula, it doesn't matter if you've done "wrong" or you don't go to church regularly - they just have to be asked.  Angels are not allowed to interfere in our lives and will not offer help unless asked (except for danger of physical harm).<br><br>There are many ways to communicate with your Angels, no method is better than the other, it just depends on what you're comfortable with.  Contacting your guardian angels is the same as contacting other angels.  All you need to do is call them.<br><br>Many people choose to construct an alter, meditate, light candles, burn incense... there's as many ways to contact angels, as there are people.  It's all personal preference.  Even though these techniques may set the stage, make you more comfortable and make the Angels feel welcomed, this is not necessary.  All it needs to be is a thought "Angel, I need your help."  They always come.  If you open yourself up to their energy, you will feel their presence.<br><br>Once you feel your Angels, ask them questions.  Let your mind go blank and allow anything to flow, don't try to make it happen.  You may want to keep a journal and write down anything that comes to mind.  What comes to you may not make sense in the beginning, but as you review your journal, it will all fall into place.  Some people meditate, while others choose to communicate through dreams.  Some people actually hear the Angels talking to them, while others "feel" what the Angels are saying.  Experiment and find what works best for you.<br><br>You'll soon be able to identify your Angels by the way they "feel".  Each Angel has a different energy, just like humans.  You may be able to feel their size or color, you may be able to tell how they smell, or how they sound.  Again, no one way is better than the other, it's how the Angels choose to communicate with you and what's easiest for you to comprehend. With time you'll know which Angel is helping you and from there you'll know what your individual Angels "specialize" in.<br><br><span style="color: cc00ff;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>I believe in Angels...

            <div class='col-md body'>These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.  Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions.  He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow (Colossians 2:17-19)<br><br>Then the angel said to me, "Write: 'Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!' " And he added, "These are the true words of God."<br>10At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, "Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."<br>(Revelation 19:9-10)<br><br>It is a biblical teaching that God does commands His angels to protect us. (see Psalm 91:11) and angels are often mentioned both in the Old as well as in the New Testament of the Bible. However, we need to be cautious regarding the devotion, communication nor prayer/worship to angels simply because just as we are, angelic beings are NOT God, they are created.<br><br>Angels are spirit beings and were created by God. They have no physical bodies unlike human beings and they ministers to God and His people, carry out His command, proclaim His messages and execute  judgments as seen in the Bible. Other than Seraphims and Cherubims, the Bible do not mention that angels have any wings. In fact, authentic biblical description seems to tell us that angels may take the form of human beings so much so that people do not realise that they have encountered angels.<br><br>Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it. (Hebrews 13:2)<br><br>There are TWO categories of angels the Bible talks about: Holy angels and fallen angels. Holy angels are angels obeying God's command, worship and serve Him whereas Fallen angels are what commonly known as demons are the one third of angels that followed Lucifer in their rebellion against God, banished from heaven into this world and the cause of the unrest here on earth. Fallen angels do have tremendous powers and often found masquerading as angel of light and deceive many people into the path to destruction.<br><br>Do take note. The existence of angels is real but do understand fully their origins and what they do. Worship, devotion and contacting of angels are prohibited by the Bible.<br><br>Need any help, pray to God !<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet Neon Tetra,<br><br>According to Christian belief, everyone has two guardian angels.<br><br>According to the Jewish faith, each child has 11,000 guardian angels at birth.<br><br>The angel is a heavenly being, superior to humans, who serves as an attendant and messenger of God, or a guardian for someone on Earth.<br><br>"See, I am sending an angel before you, to guard you on the way and bring you to the place I have prepared. Be attentive to him and heed his voice." - Exodus 24.20</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">According to Gospel of Barnabas (Chapter 54)<br><br>'When these signs be passed, there shall be darkness over the world forty years, God alone being alive, to whom be honour and glory for ever. When the forty years be passed, God shall give life to his messenger, who shall rise again like the sun, but resplendent as a thouand suns. He shall sit, and shall not speak, for he shall be as it were beside himself. God shall raise again the four angels favoured of God, who shall seek the messenger of God, and, having found him, shall station themselves on the four sides of the place to keep watch upon him. Next shall God give life to all the angels, who shall come like bees circling round the messenger of God. Next shall God give life to all his prophets, who, following Adam, shall go every one to kiss the hand of the messenger of God, committing themselves to his protection. Next shall God give life to all the elect, who shall cry out: "O Mohammed, be mindful of us!" At whose cries pity shall awake in the messenger of God, and he shall consider what he ought to do, fearing for their salvation. Next shall God give life to every created thing, and they shall return to their former existence, but every one shall besides possess the power of speech. Next shall God give life to all the reprobates, at whose resurrection, by reason of their hideousness, all the creatures of God shall be afraid, and shall cry: "Let not thy mercy forsake us, O Lord our God." After this shall God cause Satan to be raised up, at whose aspect every creature shall be as dead, for fear of the horrid form of his appearance. May it please God,' said Jesus, 'that I behold not that monster on that day. The messenger of God alone shall not be affrighted by such shapes because he shall fear God only.<br><br>'Then the angel, at the sound of whose trumpet all shall be raised, shall sound his trumpet again, saying: "Come to the judgment, O creatures, for your Creator willeth to judge you." Then shall appear in the midst of heaven over the valley of Jehoshaphat a glittering throne, over which shall come a white cloud, whereupon the angels shall cry out: "Blessed be thou our God, who hast created us, and saved us from the fall of Satan." Then the messenger of God shall fear, for that he shall perceive that none hath loved God as he should. For he who would get in change a piece of gold must have sixty mites; wherefore, if he have but one mite he cannot change it. But if the messenger of God shall fear, what shall the ungodly do who are full of wickedness?'<br><br>According to Gospel of Barnabas (Chapter 55)<br><br>'The messenger of God shall go to collect all the prophets, to whom he shall speak, praying them to go with him to pray God for the faithful. And every one shall excuse himself for fear; nor, as God liveth, would I go there, knowing what I know. Then God, seeing this, shall remind his messenger how he created all things for love of him, and so his fear shall leave him, and he shall go nigh unto the throne with love and reverence, while the angels sing: "Blessed be thy holy name, O God, our God."<br><br>'And when he hath drawn nigh unto the throne, God shall open [his mind] unto his messenger, even as a friend unto a friend when for a long while they have not met. The first to speak shall be the messenger of God, who shall say: "I adore and love thee, O my God, and with all my heart and soul I give thee thanks for that thou didst vouchsafe to create me to be thy servant, and madest all for love of me, so that I might love thee for all things and in all things and above all things; therefore let all thy creatures praise thee, O my God." Then all things created by God shall say: "We give thee thanks, O Lord, and bless thy holy name." Verily I say unto you, the demons and reprobates with Satan shall then weep so that more water shall flow from the eyes of one of them than is in the river of Jordan. Yet shall they not see God.<br><br>'And God shall speak unto his messenger, saying: "Thou art welcome, O my faithful servant; therefore ask what thou wilt, for thou shalt obtain all." The messenger of God shall answer, "O Lord, I remember that when thou didst create me, thou saidst that thou hadst willed to make for love of me the world and paradise, and angels and men, that they might glorify thee by me thy servant. Therefore, Lord God, merciful and just. I pray thee that thou recollect thy promise made unto thy servant."<br><br>'And God shall make answer even as a friend who jesteth with a friend, and shall say: "Hast thou witnesses of this, my friend Mohammed?" And with reverence he shall say: "Yes, Lord." Then God shall answer: "Go, call them, O Gabriel." The angel Gabriel shall come to the messenger of God, and shall say: "Lord, who are thy witnesses?" The messenger of God shall answer: "They are Adam, Abraham, Ishmael, Moses, David, and Jesus son of Mary."<br><br>'Then shall the angel depart, and he shall call the aforesaid witnesses, who with fear shall go thither. And when they are present God shall say unto them: "Remember ye that which my messenger affirmeth?" They shall reply: "What thing, O Lord?" God shall say: "That I have made all things for love of him, so that all things might praise me by him." Then every one of them shall answer: "There are with us three witnesses better than we are, O Lord." And God shall reply: "Who are these three witnesses?" Then Moses shall say "The book that thou gavest to me is the first"; and David shall say: ''The book that thou ga vest to me is the second"; and he who speaketh to you shall say: "Lord, the whole world, deceived by Satan, said that I was thy son and thy fellow, but the book that thou gavest me said truly that I am thy servant; and that book confesseth that which thy messenger affirmeth." Then shall the messenger of God speak, and shall say: "Thus saith the book that thou gavest me, O Lord." And when the messenger of God hath said this, God shall speak, saying: "All that I have now done, I have done in order that every one should know how much I love thee." And when he hath thus spoken, God shall give unto his messenger a book, in which are written all the names of the elect of God. Wherefore every creature shall do reverence to God, saying: ''To thee alone, O God, be glory and honour, because thou hast given us to thy messenger."</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The LORD Almighty declares, `I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of him who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in his house and destroy it, both its timbers and its stones.'" Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, "Look up and see what this is that is appearing." I asked, "What is it?" He replied, "It is a measuring basket. " And he added, "This is the iniquity of the people throughout the land."<br><br>Zechariah 5:4-6<br><br>This Excerpt clearly proved the Existence of Angelic Wings..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
