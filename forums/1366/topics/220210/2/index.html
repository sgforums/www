And from what i have read in older books on folklore, in earlier decades, it was only the left hind foot of the rabbit that was considered lucky and the bearer had to rub it to activate the luck. In addition, some people back then believed that the rabbitÃ•s foot was a source of protective magic in addition to bringing good fortune.<br><br>Images of the lucky rabbit foot were most common in the era before World War Two. The foot charm depicted on a "Good Luck" postcard of the 1910s (tied with a red ribbon, much as raccoon penis bone charms are tied), and on several North American Good Luck Coins of the 1930s.<br><br>As for the foot itself, a circa-1940 mail order catalogue from the Standard O and B Supply Company, a Chicago-based distributor of African-American hoodoo material, offered undyed rabbit foot charms "made with a metal band and a link to attach on chain." The Johnson-Smith Novelty Company offered identical charms in its 1941 catalogue.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/bwrabbitfoot.gif"><br><br>The advertisement shown here goes these one better and promises a free vial of Van Van oil with each rabbit's foot; the formula is a Louisiana hoodoo favourite that "clears away that evil mess" and increases the strength of any good luck charm to which it is applied. Since none of the older catalogues or ads mention any colour when describing rabbit's foot charms, it can be assumed that the items were undyed and came only in natural tan or white.<br><br>Symbolic representations of the rabbit foot have become rare now, possibly due to the contemporary interest in "animal rights." But while Johnson-Smith no longer offers rabbit foot key chain charms for sale, traditional rabbit foot charms, both dyed and undyed, are still manufactured and remain part of the hoodoo stock in trade. Contemporary conjure bags in my collection that contain rabbit foot charms include a "Fast Luck" bag and a "Wishing Bag." The rabbit feet in these bags are natural in colour and not dyed.<br><br>Why is the rabbit foot lucky? Rabbits are swift and they reproduce prolifically, but the luck of the rabbit foot is monetary and sexual; as far as i know, it is not related to swiftness or fertility. There is considerable evidence that the lucky rabbit foot is a remnant of an African clan totem, an importation related somehow to Br'er Rabbit, the famous protagonist of an African trickster-god myth-cycle.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Knotline.gif"></span><br><span style="color: blue;">Authentic Rabbit Foot comes in a set complete with Instruction Scroll &amp; a vial of Van Van Oil for anointing in a beautiful box or chiffon bag. Individual charm is available too for addition in Mojo bag or other Magickal purposes. All enquiries are welcome.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Sometimes called the "merrythought" in the British Isles, the wishbone is a bone of fowl. It is the custom to save this bone intact and to dry it over the stove or by the fire (or, sometimes, to dry it for three days in the air, three being a fortuitous magickal number) until it is brittle.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Knotline.gif"></span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/WISHBONE.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">This AUTHENTIC LUCKY WISHBONE  is Charged &amp; Blessed by Mambo High Priestess, comes in a set complete with Instruction scroll in a beautiful box, cotton or chiffon bag.
