You have a hell of a lot of power, and are probably on the way to becoming a high priestess/priest, if you don't already run the STATE WIDE coven. You HATE when people diss your religion, and have no problem with dealing out a little wisely applied wrath to the enemies of you diety. People will never make fun of you (to you face anyway) because they know you have a Friend in a high place, and nobody likes to get smited. On the other hand, there is a good chance you are a pompose son (or daughter) or a bitch, and you annoy me just as much as the New-agers. You may be the chosen of the Gods, but it doesn't make you a good person. </span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

You might have power, but you are so afraid to use it that it doesn't really matter... and if you don't accept that the world harbors some evil, how will you ever help people whop have been hurt by that evil? Somehow, even though pictures and statues of Angels with big fluffy wings fight with drawings of faeries with small sparkly wings for ever inch of space you own, that 1) If Angels really looked like that practucally every sentnance the say in the Bible wouldn't begin with "FEAR NOT!" because the Angels you prefer wouldn't scare a half stunned friut fly, and 2) for there to be balance, there has to be an equal amount of evil.. with means demons- but you probably don't really get the balance thing either, so oh well. You are a good, if sickeningly innicent, person who tries the best they can to help others, and you own enough occult jewelry anhd books to set up your own shop. That's fine, but one day you will regret your trust in people as you lie bruised and broken in an ally, thinking "maybe I shouldn't have tried to show that mugger the error of his ways through gentle reproch and love" .

New Age to the extreme, you believe in the motto "the universe is a friendly place" and have a hard time using your magick (and you ALWAYS spell it with a K) for anything but passive good, and probablt are a vegaterian. You might have power, but you are so afraid to use it that it doesn't really matter... and if you don't accept that the world harbors some evil, how will you ever help people whop have been hurt by that evil? Somehow, even though pictures and statues of Angels with big fluffy wings fight with drawings of faeries with small sparkly wings for ever inch of space you own, that 1) If Angels really looked like that practucally every sentnance the say in the Bible wouldn't begin with "FEAR NOT!" because the Angels you prefer wouldn't scare a half stunned friut fly, and 2) for there to be balance, there has to be an equal amount of evil.. with means demons- but you probably don't really get the balance thing either, so oh well. You are a good, if sickeningly innicent, person who tries the best they can to help others, and you own enough occult jewelry anhd books to set up your own shop. That's fine, but one day you will regret your trust in people as you lie bruised and broken in an ally, thinking "maybe I shouldn't have tried to show that mugger the error of his ways through gentle reproch and love" .
