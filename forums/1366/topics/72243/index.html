            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.evergreenmtcoven.netfirms.com/evergr1.gif"><span style="color: indigo;"><br><br><strong>What is Wicca?<br><span style="font-style: italic;">by Amber K, High Priestess</span><br><br>Wicca (sometimes called Wicce, The Craft, or The Old Religion by its practitioners) is an ancient religion of love for life and nature.<br><br>In prehistoric times, people respected the great forces of Nature and celebrated the cycles of the seasons and the moon. They saw divinity in the sun and moon, in the Earth herself, and in all life. The creative energies of the universe were personified: feminine and masculine principles became Goddesses and Gods.<br>These were not semi-abstract, superhuman figures set apart from Nature: they were embodied in earth and sky, women and men, and even plants and animals.<br><br>This viewpoint is still central to present-day Wicca. To most Wiccans, everything in Nature - and all Goddesses and Gods - are true aspects of Diety. The aspects most often celebrated in the Craft, however, are the Triple Goddess of the Moon (Maiden, Mother and Crone) and the Horned God of the wilds. These have many names in various cultures.<br><br>Wicca had its organized beginnings in Paleolithic times, co-existed with other Pagan ( "country" ) religions in Europe, and had a profound influence on early Christianity. But in the medieval period, tremendous persecution was directed against the Nature religions by the Roman Church. Over a span of 300 years, millions of men and women and many children were hanged, drowned or burned as accused Witches. The Church indicted themfor black magic and Satan worship, though in fact these were never a part of the Old<br>Religion.<br><br>The Wiccan faith went underground, to be practiced in small, secret groups called "covens" For the most part, it stayed hidden until very recent times. Now scholars such as Margaret  Murray and Gerald Gardner have shed some light on the origins of the Craft, and new attitudes of religious freedom have allowed covens in some areas to risk becoming more open.<br><br>How do Wiccan folks practice their faith today? There is no central authority or doctrine,and individual covens vary a great deal. But most meet to celebrate on nights of the Full Moon, and at eight great festivals, or Sabbats thoughout the year.<br><br>Though some practice alone or with only their families, many Wiccans are organized into covens of three to thirteen members. Some are led by a High Priestess or Priest, many by a Priestess/<br>Priest team; others rotate or share leadership. Some covens are highly structured and hierarchical while others may be informal and egalitarian. Often extensive training is required before initiation, and coven membership is considered an important commitment.<br><br>There are many branches or "traditions" of Wicca in the United States and elsewhere, such as theGardnerian, Alexandrian, Welsh Traditional, Dianic, Faery, Seax-Wicca and others. All adhereto a code of ethics. None engage in the disreputable practices of some modern "cults", suchas isolating and brainwashing impressionable lonely young people. Genuine Wiccans welcome sisters and brothers, but not disciples, followers or victims.<br><br>Coven meetings include ritual, celebration and magick (the 'k' is to distinguish it from stage illusions.) Wiccan magick is not at all like the instant 'special effects' of cartoon shows or fantasy novels, nor medieval demonology; it operates in harmony with natural laws and is usually less spectacular - though effective. Various techniques are used to heal people and animals, seek guidance, or improve members' lives in specific ways. Positive goals are sought, cursing and evil spells' are repugnant to practitioners of the Old Religion.<br><br>Wiccans tend to be strong supporters of environmental protection, equal rights, global peace and religious freedom, and sometimes magick is used toward such goals.<br><br>Wiccan beliefs do not include Judeao-Christian concepts as original sin, vicarious atonement, divine judgement or bodily resurrection. Craft folk believe in a beneficient universe, the laws of<br>karma and reincarnation, and divinity inherent in every human being and all of Nature. Yet laughter and pleasure are part of their spiritual tradition, and they enjoy singing, dancing, feasting and love.<br><br>Wiccans tend to be individualists, and have no central holy book, prophet, or church authority. They draw inspiration and insight from science, and personal experience. Each practitioner keeps a personal book or journal in which s/he records magickal 'recipes', dreams, invocations, songs, poetry and so on.<br><br>To most of the Craft, every religion has its own valuable perspective on the nature of Deity and humanity's relationship to it; there is no One True Faith. Rather, religious diversity is necessary in a world of diverse societies and individuals. Because of this belief, Wiccan groups do not activelyrecruit or proselytize; there is an assumption that people who can benefit from the Wiccan way will 'find their way home' when the time is right.</strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

But a teen witch? PHEW!<br>That's a different story! Make sure you really know your reasons<br>for changing your religion. This IS a big deal, and it is NOT fake.<br>There ARE some challenges and obstacles that you will have to<br>overcome as a teen witch/wiccan. You really have to understand<br>why you want to take on this religion.<br><br>First of all, your age vs. your maturity. This seems to be a big conflict and throughout the wiccan society. I have to admit, we teens seem to think we can handle just about anything-when we pretty much can't. So, if you do. I feel that 11 and 12 seem way too young to start thinking about switching religions! Anyway, if you feel that your mature enough, and that you can handle it, then more power to ya. Thats just the first step.<br><br>Second, ask yourself different questions about how becoming a witch will affect your life. Ask questions like:<br>-"Am I ready for this?"<br><br>-"Am I ready for the research I have to do on this religion?"<br><br>-"Will my parents totally flip?"<br><br>-"Do I have enough confidence in myself/am I ready to<br>build this confidence?"<br><br>-"What will this change?"<br><br>-"Am I ready for the ignorance I might recieve?"<br>and many more.<br><br>Next, why do you want to become a wiccan? Make a list of reasons, and choose the ones that are most important. For example: Mine was to become a better person, to shape my life the way I like it, to become more independent, and to be in "touch with my innerself". If you have reasons like "I want to work spells" or "I want to change my appearence" then maybe you should rethink your thoughts a bit. Wicca is not to work manipulative spells on people. Its for yourself, and for you to become the best you can be.</strong></span><strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">I was a Teenage Witch once &amp; you bet i know how its feels &amp; i am glad i have manage to control it &amp; went through it without deviating my True path! Just one word of advice, do not Dabble with the unknown if you are not sure about it...Dabbling in a Spell or two doesn't make you a 'WITCH"...you are nothing but a Dabbler...Be Humble &amp; Prudent...It takes more than that to become a True "Witch"...Alot of responsibilities &amp; obstacles to overcome, need a really "strong" will &amp; clear mind...

People come to Wicca when and if they are ready/interested. Furthermore, you are not required to accept or do anything that you're not comfortable with.<br><br>2 ) No artificial code of morality...<br>Out of all of the creatures of this Earth, only humans are forced to live under unnatural moral codes. Wiccans believe simply: "An It Harm None, Do As Ye Will".<br><br>3 ) Progressive Reincarnation...<br>Wiccans believe we are here to learn and to progress, not suffer eternal damnation if we 'slip-up' in someone else's eyes.<br><br>4 ) No Discrimination...<br>There is no such thing as being the 'right' race, color, gender, sexual orientation, national or ethnic origin to be Wiccan; ALL are welcome!<br><br>5 ) No middle man (or woman)... Once you know all of the basics, you can be your own 'minister' or 'priest' you need never bow before (or rely upon) some religious dictator for spiritual guidance, you go straight to the source.<br><br>6 ) Be yourself...<br>By sharing a common interest with others in Wicca, you do not lose your identity as an individual. You are unique and can and should stay that way without becoming a blob in homogeneous mass.<br><br>7 ) No repression...<br>Wiccans are not forbidden from reading, learning, eating, drinking, or saying anything. You can actually even disagree with someone without being 'excommunicated'.<br><br>8 ) Contribution...<br>Yes but as a monetary token for energy exchange! But knowledge is to be shared. The craft has always , and will always, be an experimental religion. If it works, we use it. Then share it so that all in the Craft many benefit.<br><br>9 ) No rigid Dogma...<br>Wiccans DO NOT believe that their path is 'The One and Only Path'. The only 'True' path is the one that works best for you. All paths are valid as long as they Harm None.<br><br>10) Self-empowerment...<br>Wicca allows you to truly feel your own power, if you will, and a true sense of self. You are 'allowed' to be the best person that you wish to be with all of the love and support that you can possibly hope for. Wicca allows you to take your hopes, dreams, and most heart's desires and manifest them in this reality. All is possible. All is real.</span></strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>
