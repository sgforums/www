            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Today evening, i went home to get my charged Dragon Blood Incense which a client needs it urgently due to his recent spams of bad luck. I suggested its better for him to use it first to solve his problem temporary as it will cleanse his Aura of negativity. After meeting him, he invited me to view his house as he is interested in engaging my Space-clearing service partly because he feel he is affected by his residence. Upon reaching his place, i found out that its really full of negativities &amp; bad vibes that accumulated over the years, the place is haunted i told him, he said "Yes, few years back i engaged a guru to catch the spirit, was ok untill recently, alot of unlucky events kept happening!" Then i went for coffee with him, i asked him to consider whether he wants to do the Space-clearing service.  I went home soon after, reached home around 1 am.<br><br>I went into my room, i found a present which my ex-girlfriend gave to me on our 3rd month anniversary on the floor! I opened up the Giftbox, the present a Glass bell was broken into six pieces...I feel so sad! I really love the Bell very much as it was given to me with much love. We broke up &amp; the Bell is now broken too! I managed to glued it back but there is always the broken lines in it no longer will it make nice sound &amp; there is a always the blemished scars there! Maybe its meant to be that way since we parted... To me it just like a broken sweet memory which i don't even deserved to keep it with me. It seems like a bad omen to me! Anyway i wish her well &amp; only want her to be happy always, perhaps a "Sorry" &amp; "Goodbye" thats all i can say now ... Maybe its the house i viewed that caused this because nobody goes into my room at all &amp; i left it on my desk all these while...I really don't know...i just feel so Sad tonight...<br><br>Yours Truly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> ,<br>Oceanos<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Image09.jpg"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> ~ My Broken Bell ~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This glass thinge.. reminds me of the time when it was the beginning of the end of my relationship.<br>It was ... valentines' day. Supposedly he said that it was one of it's kind. Actually i thought it's bleeding ugly but i humoured him. I took it with me when i came here to Australia. Didn't know that it was broken... had it mended by someone. Fixed quite well as well.. Anyway that was the beginning of the end. A few years of dragging.. ups and downs.. He asked for it back. He didn't care about the other stuff that was with me. He said he wanted the monstrosity. Fine.. in my bad packing.. i just took everything, threw it in my suitcase. Listen, my grandma was in hospital, would i still wanna care about my luggage? Anyway i gave it back to him.. while he went on and on about whether it's possible to get back together (NO!).<br><br>Then later i found out that it was broken.. and he said i broke it on purpose. I'm like.. whatever sista. I don't understand this whole attachment to gifts and stuff. Maybe it's just not me... but i find that guys are more sentimental. Or maybe it's just me.. who is different.</div>
