We are living in the third dimension realm whereas ghosts &amp; spirits are from the fourth dimension realm. They will not disturb anyone unless they are disturbed, provoked, trying to communicate or relate a message from the other realms. If one's personal energy is strong, its unlikely for them to encounter such spirits, unless one's personal energy is weak, pretty down on luck then they will be likely to encounter spirits. By maintaining a positive energy such encounters will never happen. Carrying amulets &amp; charms also prevent such happenings.

Many fear that contact with darkness will drag them down to a low frequency and hold them captive. In fact, demons would need to vibrate more rapidly, would they not, if they were to be able to dominate or affect you in any way?<br><br>When a life scenario is dark and foreboding, and a Player in the Game feels "Controlled" or "Attacked," it is "HE" who is vibrating lower, grasping tightly to beliefs of "SEPARATION" and "DUALITY". It is his staunch adherence to these beliefs that holds Him at that vibration, not the "Demons." They have no power over him, except what he gives to them.<br><br>Therefore, when a "Form Ego", who views creation from this lower density, interacts energetically with Limitation Guides, his Separation mindset will interpret it as "Oppression" or "Possession" by Devils.  But if he were to view the situation from a HIGHER vibration, the same energy could easily be interpreted as "Guidance" from Angels. And into what are they guiding him? They are setting him up to face his fears, his suppressed desires, his shadows, and the disowned aspects of himself.<br><br>Truly, the only "Protection" that anyone requires, at any density, is the willingness to move out of "SEPARATION ILLUSION" and "RECONNECT", owning all that is happening as a freewill choice of his Expanded Self. He must come to understand that it is "ALL HIM" (including the warts, red eyes, and pointy tails)! And if he (or she) seems to be "Possessed," it is a condition that has been set up to teach a lesson, and (ultimately) bestow a gift.<br><br>It could be said that all players in 3 Dimensional Limitation are possessed. You are held here, stripped of your Multiversal powers, until such time as your Redeemer (Your Reconnected Consciousness) finally awakens and releases you. And that will only be allowed to happen when you have completed all the tasks that attracted you into physical form in the first place. And when that happens, you will be willing to deal with some of the "Hard Stuff" that goes along with uniting with All That Is. You must be willing to let go of the trick so that you can embrace the truth.<br><br>And what is it that we consider to be the trick? It is your belief that whatever is observed, within a specific space, at a specific time, is ALL THERE IS that exists in that space. It is a belief in Objective Reality and Separation instead of Multidimensional Reality and the Oneness of All That Is. Is it possible to dwell in Heaven, and never know Hell? We think not, for, without the One, how could you perceive (let alone appreciate) the Other?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>Actually...
