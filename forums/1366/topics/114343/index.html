In any case, if she wants to charm you, the other one must pose as a prey to be conquered. Indeed, you are inclined to consider love as a competitive sport which necessarily implies winners and losers.<br><br>Endowed with a passionate and expansive nature, you are more sensual than sentimental. But, even though you're subject to passions, these generally only last a short time.<br><br>Your curiosity and your need for freedom often lead you to short-term relations. If you're married, it can also be the same; but your sense of duty prevents you from showing off with your occasional mates and instructs you to act discreetly in all circumstances. The woman who loves you should not dramatize the pranks which you may indulge in: those are only short-lived love affairs without real significance if one did not give them too much importance.<br><br>You need to feel in accordance with your loved one and share ideas, projects, yearning for adventures and travels with her. You hate make-believes, lies and hypocrisy, and are incapable of pretending to feel what you don't. If you love no more, you simply go away, but your delicacy and kindness force you to do everything possible to avoid that the other one suffers too much.<br><br>Your merry nature and your unfailing optimism allow you to bear single status without frustration, even though it's not a deliberate choice. Furthermore, your exacerbated taste for independence does not make common life easy. Sometimes, you categorically refuse all tie which is too restraining. You then want to live day after day and to savor intensely the numerous pleasures that will present themselves to you. </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In love, your imagination and fantasy play a more important role than your senses. You have the art of playing with hearts and arouse desires. Absolute fidelity is not your strong point although you demand it emphatically from your partners. "All the pleasure of love resides in change" (MoliÃ¨re): that's what seems to be your motto!<br><br>You can be astonishingly base when your interests are at stake and do not hesitate to break up a relation which seems to present some kind of danger for you. On the other hand, if the climate of a union implies too great difficulties or too harsh conflicts, you don't hesitate to find your salvation in fleeing.<br><br>As you are sufficiently anxious and little assured sentimentally, your mate should not content herself only with loving you, but has to tell you repeatedly that she loves you. Charming, discovery, and amorous friendship are the fields where you excel and where you want your mate to do the same throughout your union.<br><br>Just as whatever is unknown or more or less forbidden, sexuality arouses your curiosity, and you find in eroticism a subject of distraction where you feel at ease. Physical love is an utterly agreeable game for you. You don't want to rush through it for you like foreplay as well as afterplay so much!<br><br>With your lightly masochistic tendency, you often like acting the misunderstood: this can draw devotions which you could not do without any more.<br><br>You belong undoubtedly to the category of merry single people. It would need much ingeniousness to succeed in putting a rope round your neck. Furthermore, you are clever at escaping the traps of fanatics of marriage as you want so much to enjoy your freedom!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the sentimental field, you are more cerebral than instinctive. Indeed, you value friendship more than you do love, and it's why an amorous friendship suits you much better than a love relation which is real and in conformity with tradition.<br><br>Nothing is worse for you than a humdrum life without surprises. You get bored very quickly, and it's why you readily adopt certain eccentric attitudes in order to prove to yourself and others that you don't let yourself stagnate in routine. Therefore, your faithfulness in love is rather shaky. By advocating love without constraints and the suppression of taboos, you are certainly likely to scare off some suitors!<br><br>Very charming, you are much sought after as a single man. Of course, you profit fully by this situation, for it allows you to preserve your precious freedom and at the same time not to suffer from loneliness. Indeed, you are most often afraid of engaging yourself, that is, of forgoing your dear independence and freedom of action. Thus you try to preserve your freedom as long as possible.<br><br>You do have one reasonable solution, though. It's a friendship and complicity marriage with an intelligent, funny and independent woman, with whom you'll share your couch, but without any obligations for either party and with perfect respect for mutual freedom. In any case, you'll always prefer free love to traditional marriage.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's much more by sensations than by words that love manifests itself in you. If you don't always know how to show your feelings, being sometimes too shy or taciturn to do so, you're nevertheless eager for tender, warm, and sensual affection.<br><br>When you love, you feel the visceral urge to melt with the other one and form a oneness with your loved one. Love is glorified by you; it can only be the outcome of all your ideas - abnegation, sacrifices, beauty, elevation, but also disillusionments.<br><br>With you, sentiments are rarely simple. Love, mysticism, extreme devotion or secret masochism - all this can exist and coexist. And very clever is the one who can manage to understand you without making you lose your charm, to support you without crushing you, to counsel you without hurting you, and to bring you all this ambience of understanding and complicity which you need.<br><br>If you are not always a perfect spouse, you are generally a delicious date owing to the tenderness and poetry which you know how to create. This romantic mark is one of your most attaching qualities, but also a trap when you do not find in your partner the man capable of responding to your aspirations.<br><br>You are always on the lookout for a partner capable of vibrating at your dreams, sharing your imaginations, and participating in all the marvelous which inhabits you. But you also want him to be more realistic than you are and capable of taking care of you - on condition, however, that he does not hamper you.<br><br>Living, day after day, with the chosen of your heart and making sure that your love doesn't take on a wrinkle, that's your most earnest desire. It's why you hate loneliness. You need so much to give and to receive tenderness!<br></div>

You don't want to let yourself be taken to any mirage, any dream. It's why you often find yourself deprived of beneficial fantasy and rather disarmed when you deal with the sentimental sphere.<br><br># You run the risk of having serious difficulties before securing a successful love life. On top of such difficulties are your recoiling reaction, and your will to take time to analyze a project, to weigh the pros and the cons of a proposal. Sometimes this recoil is so obvious that your partner gets discouraged and looks for someone else.<br><br># When feelings overwhelm you, there's often a sort of panic that invades you. Emotional outbursts appear somewhat suspect to you for you are excessively reserved. You're also greatly in awe of ridicule, and as a general rule it's only through a delicate, sincere approach that one can tame you.<br><br># Paradoxically, you can let yourself be charmed by more instinctive, more expansive beings. But then there can be established certain misunderstanding between the two partners, one being too serious and the other too unstable.<br><br># In order to have a successful sentimental life, you must learn not to let your career life bear exaggeratedly over your couple life. You must also accept a small part of fantasy and unforeseen events, which will help avoid monotony. For the great majority of bearers of your first name, an amorous union must be concluded on the base of mutual esteem and, consequently, can bloom in a discreet but profound and durable love.<br><br># As you are extremely cautious, you still prefer loneliness to an ill-assorted union. This first name supplies a large group of single people. One cannot see a matter of hazard here. On one hand, there's mistrust ; on the other hand, exactingness. You protect yourself against all intrusion, you distrust the excesses of passion. You're afraid to be violated, invaded, or to be asked outer demonstrations which you abhor. Your reservedness, your reticence certainly do not help communication, which you refuse with every fiber of your being.<br><br># Of course, you are not allergic to marriage as a matter of principle, but you wait to find an ideal partner before engaging yourself definitely. Nevertheless, at times, contrary to your ingrained habit, you may want to have a few short-lived adventures, deciding that your great love can wait.<br><br># Living in couple with you is not very entertaining, unless your partner possesses treasures of patience and understanding.<br><br><strong>Hmm, like not very good things...
