            <div class='col-md body'>The Tsunami came as a surprise to me not only because of the huge catastrophic effect but also because <span style="font-style: italic;">longchen</span>, who occasionally posts in sgforums, also owner of the forum below.. sent me a warning exactly 21 days before that happened saying that the consciousness of Gaia, or Mother Earth, has warned that "planet is undergoing physical changes", and "expect to see many natural disasters".

Actually its been in this phase even before the dawn of Millenium. Energies are shifting in All Planes of Existence with that brought about many un-anticipated Natural Disasters, Phenomenons &amp; Epidemics Globally. During the Harmonic Concordance period, Many who are sensitive, in the Fourth Dimension realms can feel the shifting of Energies around, some may even feel discomfort in their heart chakra due to the Deep Cleansing inititated by the alignments of Planets &amp; Stars into the formation of the "Star of David". Is this Divine Help to save humanity? Has our Civilisations' uncontrolled development Globally that upset the Nature &amp; Ecological System? Our Mother Earth is in need of Love &amp; healing too, maybe thats the reason why she is showing her wrath &amp; anger through the occurences of recent disasters.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

A house on the "Divider" closer to the bottom land with no windows, doors or any openings symbolised Entrapment &amp; Confined, no escape, lives will be loss, families will be broken up. The "River" divided symbolised Emotional Upheavals, a rift, blockage, a barrier, a great change that make a tremendous change in the Emotional Aspects of Humanity, a scar that can never be healed, from smooth flowing to current slow &amp; stagnant state. The "Bottom Land" symbolised Earth now after the great change which has become barren &amp; unstable that in need of healing &amp; restructuring in time to come before it can flourish, become fertile &amp; stable again.   </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;"><br><img src="http://www.closing-gaps.org/earth-bridge.jpg"> ~Image 1<br><br><img src="http://www.closing-gaps.org/earth-vision.jpg"> ~ Image 2</span></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">With regards to Image 2, I see great changes &amp; shifting of Elemental Energies taking place in phases, First is Earth, which already taken place in form of recent Land Disasters &amp; Tragedies, in what to come is see this change has shift on to Air, I am afriad there will be Air-borne Disaster taking place soon. I see a decline in Humanity, whereby More Lives will be claimed by Nature, culling of Humanity will take place. Is this a sign of impeding "Apocalypse" taking place? I certainly hope its not so, let us all radiate Unconditional Love to All Sentient Beings in this Plane, to Earth Mother Gaia, to the Divine as Compassionate "Love Energy" is all we need now in this Place, in this Time, in this Plane, Its the strongest Energy which maybe through it Humanity can be saved.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Blue-mind's comment is of no concern or interest to me.<br><br>True enough Jhanic Practice is a form that derived from buddhism, however to be able attain such conciousness certainly will open up certain latent abilities which may allow you to connect with Earth Mother Gaia. None of my words implied that connecting Conciousness of Gaia is linked to Buddhism in any ways. That is purely a suggestion &amp; of coz there is no obligation in any ways. Maybe you have misunderstood it there is not a need for citing anyone or jump into any conclusion about it, maybe mindfulness &amp; acceptance is the key.

            <div class='col-md body'>h5 n1 virus on e loose???Avian flu continues to spread throughout south-east Asia and remains deadly. An 8-year-old Cambodian girl has become its most recent victim. An investigation into her death last week found poultry in her village had been dying two weeks before she became ill. Of the 80 human cases since January last year, 50 have been fatal, and millions of birds have been destroyed. It's hit animals previously unaffected by the virus, which has led experts to fear it is evolving at a rapid pace. In October last year, more than 100 tigers in a Thai zoo were put down after they became infected with the virus from eating diseased poultry. The World Health Organisation says there's no direct evidence of human-to-human transmission of avian flu. But Thai authorities suspected one such case last September. It hasn't been conclusively proven that there was human transmission. In Vietnam, officials say a recent survey of birds in the country's south found a 70 per cent infection rate of avian flu in ducks and geese and 24 per cent in chickens. Other influenza strains remain a concern. Health authorities are battling to make sure a potentially deadly strain of flu virus is destroyed after it was revealed an American laboratory sent thousands of samples around the world in test kits.<br><br>Is that e air borne disease???</div>
