Very little is known about this early part of her life but her birth certificate can be viewed here. In a letter dated from 1982 to Janet and Stewart Farrar, Doreen gives us a glimpse into her parents life before she was born. (letter courtesy of Janet Farrar).<br>Finding herself growing up in the West of England, the young Doreen acquired the local accent that she never lost. The West country (as it is known in Britain) is an area noted for its rural beauty and strong attachment to the land. Even today it is not unusual to find folk dances at midsummer, fertility stones and healing wells that have been used continuously for centuries. It is in these surroundings that the young Doreen grew up.<br>As a young girl, she began to play a solitary game to amuse herself - running up and down the street riding a broomstick. Why she did this at such a young age she never knew, but her parents feared she would become a witch - something they found quite disconcerting (her parents were very religious and were ardently opposed to witchcraft).<br></span></span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

At the tender age of thirteen, she heard that her mother was being subjected to persistent persecution and harassment in her work as a housekeeper. She confided in her daughter that a particular unpleasant woman had been picking on her. In response Doreen asked her mother to obtain a lock of hair belonging to the bullying colleague and intimated that she would work a charm to solve the problem once and for all. Whether Mrs. Dominy went along with this out of amusement, desperation or simple curiosity in not actually known but she did bring back a few strands of hair belonging to her persecutor.<br><span class="small">Using black-ended pins and a few traditional herbs, Doreen made a figurine of the woman in question and wound the strands of hair around the doll. She then cast a spell to protect her mother from further interference. Shortly afterwards, the woman who was causing so much trouble to Mrs. Dominy, was herself harassed - by a blackbird! The creature began tapping on the window every time she entered a room and followed her around the house, pecking on the glass. The woman was absolutely terrified as the stalking blackbird continued to pester her for some time. Doreen maintained that the bullying of her mother abruptly ceased.<br><br>It must be said that Doreen was in fact brought up as a Christian and sent to a convent school where she walked out at the age of fifteen and refused to return.</span></span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

The marriage took place in South Wales on 31/1/1941 where the couple were living at the time; Doreen in Barry and Joanis in Cardiff. An interesting fact is that the nineteen-year-old Doreen is named as Rachael Dominy on the marriage certificate, information kindly supplied by long-standing friend of Doreen's, Patricia Crowther. It also appears that Joanis was unable to sign his name (illiteracy was not all that uncommon during the war)<br>Tragically, less than six months later, Joanis went missing, presumed dead. We are not sure how Doreen coped with this huge loss but she was not alone - there were families losing loved-ones every day during World War II. However we do know that, as the War progressed, Doreen continued to work as a secretary in Wales.<br><br>On 29/5/1944 Doreen wed Casimiro Valiente - the name which would stay with her for the rest of her life. They were married at St Pancras Registry Office, and now Doreen's name and nationality were amended by virtue of marriage.

She used this pseudonym because it was only the year before that witchcraft was still a criminal offence (the Witchcraft Act of 1735 was repealed in 1951). Dafo had initiated Gerald Gardner in the autumn of 1939 and was a key member of the original New Forest Coven.<br><br>On this occasion in 1952, Dafo introduced a raven-haired lady of thirty years to Gerald Gardner. So began Doreen's first footsteps along the path of Wicca. However it was one year later in 1953 that Doreen received the first degree initiation into the Craft, given (as tradition demanded) by a member of the opposite sex. Gardner conducted the initiation himself on Midsummer's Eve. He had just travelled from his witchcraft museum on the Isle of Man to attend the Druid Solstice gathering at Stonehenge where he was to loan the Ancient Druid Order his ritual sword. On this journey he dropped by the home of Dafo and initiated the young Doreen, whom he had met the previous summer.<br><br>Gardner used his Book of Shadows from the late forties up until 1953 when he initiated Doreen. He claimed the material was taken directly from the New Forest Coven and was the remnants of the Old Religion, which had been passed down through the ages. His astute student Ameth (the name given to Doreen) noticed that one passage read out by Gardner was taken from Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass.<br><br>On this point, Doreen took Gardner to task and he replied that the Wicca rites he had received were fragmentary and he had filled them in the best he could. He gave Doreen his Book of Shadows saying "Can you do any better?" She did, replacing much of the Crowley and Masonic material with her own verse. She reconstructed the documents into a logical, practical and workable system, leaving us with what we know today as "Wicca".<br><br><img src="http://www.doreenvaliente.com/main/images/doreen%20valiente%204.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Doreen Valiente's Book of Shadow</span><br><br>It was Gardner's penchant for interviews with the press that eventually led to Doreen severing contact with him for several years. In Doreen's book The Rebirth of Witchcraft, she explains that as the coven's High Priestess, she felt that by speaking to the press, Gardner was compromising the security of the group and the sincerity of his own teachings. A set of rules were introduced called the "Proposed Rules for the Craft" which would prevent any members of the Craft from speaking to journalists or writers without permission from the Elders.<br><br>Gardner was fully expected to follow these rules but retaliated with the claim that the Craft already had a set of traditional laws. He then sent the members of the coven "The Old Laws" - documents containing practical advice and theology. Doreen didn't believe these "Old Laws" were authentic and parted company with Gardner. However they did later restore their friendship but never to the same degree as before.<br></span></strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

One reason for this rather circumspect attitude was out of consideration for her mother who did not know her daughter was a practicing Witch.<br><br>In 1964 after the death of both her mother and Gerald Gardner in the same year, Doreen cast off her Gardnerian mantle and was initiated by Robert Cochrane into a traditional, hereditary branch of Witchcraft. The 1960's brought fresh public perceptions. The sexual revolution, contraception, peace movements and social upheaval led to old-fashioned ideals being swept away. Witchcraft was no exception.<br><br>Suddenly Witches, in particular Sybil Leek and Alex and Maxine Saunders, became media personalities and actively courted the publicity. The Old Guard of Wicca still refused to yield and come forward, shunning all contact with anyone outside the Craft.<br><br>Doreen was one of the few who managed to find a middle-ground; never denying paganism or fearing to speak out in its defense, yet still maintaining the traditional low-key approach to Wicca. The Cochrane initiation only strengthened this position and allowed Doreen to move away from internal politics which were beginning to emerge within Gardnerianism.<br><br>However, Doreen soon became disillusioned by Cochrane and noted his obsession with Â‘witch potionsÂ’ that nearly led to some unfortunate consequences. Cochrane later died at Midsummer, 1966.<br></span></strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

Her beloved husband Casimiro Valiente died in April 1972. Finding herself alone she began to, in her own words, "concentrate on writing books." Her books, An ABC of Witchcraft (1973), followed by Natural Magic (1975), established her as an authority on magic and Wicca.<br><br>An ABC of Witchcraft gave an alphabetical listing of concise occult information dealing with a host of differing subjects, from ancient mysticism such as the Kabbalah, to drug use by occultists.<br><br>Natural Magic, a much shorter work but none the less informative, took a different approach and empathized with the knowledge seeker. Basic questions and formative experiences are addressed here; which plants to introduce into the home for a certain astrological influence; which amulets and stones to wear which bring peace and tranquility; herbal remedies and numerology. Perhaps the style and material was designed to aid the Wiccan beginner but it also helped those already on the path by providing another reference book full of well researched facts.<br><br>The 1970Â’s saw other authors, researchers and pagans drawn to Doreen, to tap into her wealth of anecdotes, personal reminisces of leading Craft figures and large private library spanning every known occult theme. They also asked for help in editing their own written tracts. In this last role Doreen was indispensable and it is true to say that she corrected, proof read, edited and contributed to a great many classic Wiccan titles on the bookshelves today Â– all this free of charge!<br><br>It is clear that Doreen was corresponding more widely than ever, particularly with the new established pagan movements, Wiccan Churches and certain elements one might call 'Aquarian' or 'New Age'.<br><br><img src="http://www.doreenvaliente.com/main/images/rncooke.jpg">Ron "Cookie"<br><br>Finding herself in this unique role, Doreen challenged the attempt of the British Parliament to pass legislation against Witchcraft. In 1972, she lobbied the Member of Parliament concerned, Mr. Gwilym Roberts, in order to try and clarify the situation. Not much is known about Mr. GwilymÂ’s reaction but the end result was that the new laws were not passed.<br>Doreen took a keen interest during mid-seventies in the pagan past of Sussex, an English county steeped in Paganism. In fact, it was the last county to convert to Christianity in England and Doreen fell in love with the area. She also fell in love with Ron (Cookie) Cooke. She knew at once that she had known him in a previous life. Ron an ex-policeman, was also a member of the residents committee in the block of flats where they both lived.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></span></strong><br><br></div>

Russell's 1980 book, A History of Witchcraft. In his book, Russell implies that Gerald Gardner invented Old Dorothy (although Gardner claimed that Old Dorothy initiated him in 1939).<br><br>Although it was Doreen's painstaking and diligent research that finally unearthed the death certificate of Old Dorothy Clutterbuck in 1982, it must be noted that it was Virginia Russell who suggested that Doreen should look at the Indian Military Records. Many English families had connections with India during the Colonial period, and as luck would have it, so did the Clutterbuck's.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></span></strong><br><br></div>

Her grief was great and close friends noticed the sadness that came over her. Yet Doreen still made time for the Pagan community despite her bereavement. Her beloved partner, nicknamed Â‘DusioÂ’, had passed over to the Summerlands.<br><br>Her contribution in terms of personal guidance, research, writing, poetry, public speaking and ritual, must be viewed as part of a prolific wave that firmly established not only Wicca, but Aquarian values as a whole. It was this sheer volume of output that helped make Wicca the fastest growing religion in the Western world.<br><br>One issue that did concern Doreen was the ethical and educational standards of the Craft. As seekers increased, so too did charlatans and spurious teachings, imparting distorted or degenerate practices. It was something she detested and was firmly opposed to. When the Centre For Pagan Studies opened in 1995, offering a facility for learned research and a non commercial environment, Doreen welcomed the initiative and became the Patron. She gave her last talk there.<br><br>1999 was beset by increased physical illness, but at no time did her mental agility nor command of magic desert her. She continued to remain a very powerful, resolute individual until her final breath on this Earth.<br><br>In her last days, Doreen was moved to a nursing home. She was suffering from a multitude of conditions - cancer being one of them. Friends kept vigil by her bedside (some coming from as far afield as London) and kept her company in the last days. On the day of her death on 1st September 1999, John Belham-Payne remained with her - the man she had chosen to pass on her magical legacy.

But the youth-friendly image of Paganism may have something to do with it. There certainly there aren't too many cool teenage Christians on TV.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It's cool to be a Witch </span><br><br>Since the 1960s young people have become interested in magic and the spiritual world through popular books, television series and films.<br><br>Bewitched (1964-1972) showed one of the first representations of a Witch on television. Samantha was a quirky housewife with magical powers who was desperately trying to conform to the 1960s ideal and stop her 'witchiness' leaking out.<br><br>The 1980s and 1990s saw a huge rise in the popularity of magic and Witchcraft as it began to flood the mainstream media. Witchcraft became much more acceptable and the characters portrayed were much stronger and more open about their practices.<br><br>A US television drama, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, has probably been the most influential media representation of Witchcraft. One of the main characters, Willow, is an alternative to the sugary 'Barbie' - type role model. She is a Witch who dabbles in lesbianism, dresses in sexy clothes and casts spells.<br><br>Hollywood also picked up on the trend for the magical with films like Witches of Eastwick ( 1987 ), The Craft ( 1996 ) and Practical Magick ( 1998 ).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Learning more </span><br><br>Although the mass media shows Witchcraft as glamorous and exciting, teenagers who are serious about learning more use library books and the internet to research the subject.<br><br>Books like Kate West's The Real Witch's Handbook : A complete introduction to the Craft for both young and old alike, (Thorsons 2001), is a good starting point for real beginners who then go on to read the basic texts of Wicca and Paganism. This even includes a draft letter that a young person can send to his/her parents explaining why s/he has become Wiccan and what it is about.<br><br>They learn that Wicca involves more that just the practice of magic. It is a religion that involves the worship of the Goddess and God and the veneration of the Divine in nature.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why Paganism? </span><br><br>The attraction of Paganism is not only in the idea of casting love spells. The popularity of Paganism can also be attributed to the fact that it tackles issues that teenagers are interested in - in a way that other religions do not.<br><br>The supernatural is a good example of this. Massimo Introvigne (lecturer at Harvard University) suggests that programmes such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer illustrate the problems that organised religions are suffering from. He says that Buffy is telling us that 'Supernatural beings may be out there, but traditional theology is not regarded as useful for dealing with them'.<br><br>Paganism also places issues such as the environment, morality and gender at the top of its list of priorities. These are issues that teenagers can relate to. The Pagan Federation of Great Britain states in its three main principles a 'love for and kinship with Nature' a 'positive morality' and a 'recognition of the Divine which transcends gender'.<br><br>Author, Silver Ravenwolf thinks that the inclusion of women is a particularly important factor for the masses of teenage girls who turn to Paganism. She says 'women in particular don't like the idea of being second-class citizens in spirituality. Wicca has the male and female on the same footing'.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The dangers </span><br><br>Parents of teenagers who practice Witchcraft are often worried about what their children might be involved in, and who might be influencing them. Most of these fears can be easily dispelled. Most covens will not admit members under the age of eighteen, so most young Pagans either practice on their own in groups of other teenagers. Once parents realise their children are practicing a nature religion rather than getting involved in evil and the occult their fears are often put aside.<br><br>Teenagers searching for a new kind of spirituality may have stumbled across Paganism through the media, but they have found its messages relevant.<br><br>Paganism has come out of the religious left-field and succeeded in attracting the group that institutionalised religions have found so elusive.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

While it is a valid and legitimate spiritual path, self-initiation also poses a few unique challenges to those who would seek the Old Gods on their own.  If you are contemplating self-initiation and the building of your own version of spiritual practice based on the Wiccan model, here are some tips to help make the process go a bit more smoothly.<br><br>1.  You have every right to initiate yourself and to follow your own, unique path to the gods.  No one has a monopoly on wisdom, nor on the Mysteries.  Anyone who approaches the gods with sincerity, respect, and integrity can and will discover their own way to commune with these essential forces of nature.  It requires creativity, persistence, and determination--it is a challenging path to take.<br><br>2.  Clarify your intent.  Ask yourself "Why am I doing this?"  It is wise that you examine your motivations--pursuing such an intensive path as solitary Wicca is not something to do on a whim, nor is it a "fun" hobby.  It's work, and plenty of it.  You don't get to take advantage of someone else's previous efforts, except for what you can get out of books.  You have to build your own foundation, and establish a mythos and context within which to work.  You can just declare yourself a member of your own tradition, but what will it mean?<br><br>3.  Gather your resources.  You need to establish a set of ground rules--guidelines for what you want and what you plan to do.  This will require reading everything you can get.  Try to read a diversity of authors, and don't just read about Witchcraft--broaden your horizons as much as possible.<br><br>4.  If you find something you like, adapt it.  Don't just lift it out<br>of its context.  Once you have a basic framework within/upon which to work, rewrite everything to fit your emerging vision.  Don't be worried about perfection-you will re-write things many times as you develop and grow.  The more you learn, the more you'll be able to enhance, refine, and desire to modify your first attempts at ritual. When members of a tradition refer to basic things such as their oaths, the creed of their sect, whatever degree they may have been initiated into or whatever, these things all mean something within that tradition.  When you are self-initiated, it's all up to you what it all means to you--in as far as it applies to you and you alone. Develop your own unique versions of those elements of the Craft that you choose to adopt.  It's perfectly fine to toss out all the old stuff and start out on your own path.  If you do, there's a lot of baggage to deal with, and you might not want to toss the baby out with the bath water.  Take some time and reflect upon these things. Make no hasty decisions.  Seek to understand your impetus and motivation for removing or including the various bits and pieces of Craft material.  Personal creativity is a vital part of the Craft. There's not much room for dogma in an ec.</span></strong><br><br><strong><span class="small"><span style="color: violet;">* The above Article is taken &amp; presented without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong><br><br><span class="normal"></span></div>

"She had a green face, red eyes, really pointy nose, a pointy black hat and an owl." It was Halloween, and the kindergarten class was reading about monsters and witches.<br><br>Casey's mother Deborah called the teacher to complain. "I'm so sorry," said the teacher. "Is Casey scared? Is he having nightmares?" "No," said Deborah. "His father and I are witches, and we don't appreciate Casey being exposed to stereotypical images of crones on broomsticks."<br><br>While other kids attend Hebrew School or Easter Egg hunts, witch kids accompany their parents to pagan rituals. They dance around the Maypole on May Day. At Halloween, they attend the Spiral Dance. At the Summer Solstice, they help construct and burn a wicker man on the beach.<br><br>Most kids brought up in a pagan community take to the rites with zeal. "It's fun for them," said Anne Hill, who co-authored a book on raising children in a goddess tradition. It's cool to be a witch, said Casey, who even has his own witch name. Eleven-year-old Hazel assembled her own altar decorated with what her father called "power objects:" feathers, candles, bones.<br><br>Black magic? Nah. Pagan children apply their witchcraft to the mundane details of gradeschool life. "Casey's first spell was for the elephant at the zoo," Deborah told me. "The Asian elephant lost its mate, and Casey was very sad about it. When we got home, he made a circle of all his elephant toys, put a candle in the middle, and made a spell so that the elephant would get a new friend."<br><br>When fourteen-year-old Shannon got her first period, her parents and the rest of their coven celebrated a ritual in her honor, complete with presents. Another preteen wanted to know if there was a ritual for shaving the first hair that grew under her arms.<br><br>Do pagan children ever rebel and become, say, investment bankers or Mormons? Elissa was so embarassed by her parents that she told her friends she was a Christian. But she is a rare straight arrow. For most witch kids, equinox rituals and the sun god are their cultural heritage, like First Communion and the Virgin Mary are for Catholics.<br><br>In the Middle Ages, Deborah might have been burned at the stake. At the end of the millennium in California, she was invited to talk to Casey's class. Afterwards, the teacher heard a different parental complaint: "My child can't separate fantasy from reality -- he insists Casey's mom is a witch." </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Â© 1999 Anne Hill, Diane Baker, Starhawk.

"Tak' doo yon, Minnie Merran (the witch's name), he cried, "an bear doo da weight o' dis auld airm as lang as doo leeves."<br><br>The dog ran howling and limping out of the house, and when next the witch was seen, she who hitherto had walked upright and with the dignity of a Norna, leant upon a stick, and had a hump upon her back. She said she had fallen from a height, and was afraid her spine was broken. But folk called it "the mark o' auld Jockie's taings."</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: violet;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Internet without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>
