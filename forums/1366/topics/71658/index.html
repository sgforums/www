Many cultures worldwide have assigned practically the same qualities to this character. A woman could have been born a witch or she could have become one later in life.<br><br>Most commonly, she inherited her magic skills from her mother-witch. She could also inherit the traits after being born illegitimately or in case her mother had been breastfeeding the girl for more than two years.<br><br>One could acquire the "gift" of witchcraft by establishing a<br>connection with the devil himself with a purpose to learn secret<br>knowledge. Every witch had a special mark on her body. It could have been a birthmark or any other physical anomaly.<br><br>It was often thought that a witch"s main purpose was casting evil eye on people"s livestock. A witch would take away cow"s milk, pig's lard and chicken eggs. In case of a child"s sickness or death, people would blame witches. Such reaction concerned any sort of a disaster that happened to take place in their village.<br><br>In early medieval times, devil worshipping was relatively common. As a result, people felt fearful before witches, his servants. This fear triggered the Church to start a fight against evil. Those witch-hunts were conducted on legal grounds, which in turn triggered active development of legal writings on the subject matter. "Witch Hammer" written by one of the Shprenger"s monks is considered to be one of the most important manuscripts of that epoch.<br><br>This manuscript provides vivid accounts of lives of witches. For<br>instance, according to this work, witches are those who refuse to<br>believe in the Sacred Trinity and oppose everything that emanates<br>from God. They worship devil. Witches are initiated in a pile of<br>manure; she is "baptized" in boiling water.<br><br>Several million years ago, many women have fallen victims to this<br>nonsense. Such hysteria over witchcraft did not touch ancient Russia. However, it should be noted that a dozen witches and "fortune tellers" have been executed in 1411 in the Russian town of Pskov.<br><br>Nowadays, witchcraft a fully legal activity, but it also appears to<br>be rather profitable. Many grandmas, healers and fortune tellers<br>around the world are willing to help whoever is in need of their<br>services.<br><br>In Tanzania, for instance, they publish a newspaper which is fully<br>devoted to magic and witchcraft. This country is famous for its<br>beliefs in paranormal activities and magic and the newspaper is a<br>great success. In order to attract tourists and bring the country's<br>economy to prosperity, Romanian Dracula takes the stage.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </strong></div>

Basically you can be an inhereditary Witch which literally means your family line has witches or one of your Ancestor is a Witch therefore like "It runs in the Family", Bloodline witches are usually born with certain unique abilities which they inherited from their Witch parents! For some its like a Calling from the Divine, probably some may deemed it as an "Old Soul", in their previous Live they are practicioners who achieve certain attainment who are reborn to this World! They will awaken at certain phase of their life or after going through certain events, or simply they heard the Calling of their patron god or goddess! Again usually they also possess some abilities until they are awaken they may not be able to control it &amp; strange happenings may revolved their lives since young! Another will be mostly seekers who are interested in the Craft, so they chose a path for their individual practice! Yes, Anyone can try to be a witch however in certain Tradition it requires Initiation by a Witch! By doing a spell or two doesn't make you a witch, you can only be deem as a dabbler! Anyway to become one require serious pondering coz once you are on the Path there is no turning back! So Choose Wisely!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

If this is impossible, a garden or some chamber shall suffice, if it is readied with fumes or flowers.<br><br>Seek out wisdom in books, rare manuscripts and cryptic poems if you will, but seek it out also in simple stones and fragile herbs and in the cries of wild birds. Listen to the whisperings of the wind and the roar of water if you would discover magic, for it is here that the old secrets are preserved.<br><br>Books contain words; trees contain energies and wisdom books never dreamt of.<br><br>Ever remember that the Old Ways are constantly revealing themselves. Therefore be as the river willow that bends and sways with the wind. That which remains changeless shall outlive its spirit, but that which evolves and grows will shine for centuries.<br><br>There can be no monopoly on wisdom. Therefore share what you will of our ways with others who seek them, but hide the mystic lore from the eyes of those who would destroy, for to do otherwise increases their destruction.<br><br>Mock not the rituals or spells of another, for who can say yours are greater in power or wisdom?<br><br>Ensure that your actions are honorable, for all that you do shall return to you threefold, good or bane.<br><br>Be wary of one who would dominate you, who would control and manipulate your workings and reverences. True reverence for the Goddess and God occurs within. Look with suspicion on any who would twist worship from you for their own gain and glory, but welcome those priestesses and priests who are suffused with love.<br><br>Honor all living things, for we are of the bird, the fish, the bee. Destroy not life save it be to preserve your own.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">And this is the nature of our way.<br>-Scott Cunningham </span></span></strong></div>

It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.<br><br>When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak up against it, I am defined as a witch.<br>The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being everyone else's maid or when I act a little selfish.<br><br>I am proud to be a witch! It means I have the courage and strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone else's idea of what they think I "should" be.<br><br>I am outspoken, opinionated and determined.<br>By Goddess, I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that!<br><br>So, try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold within me. You won't succeed.<br><br>And if that makes me a witch, so be it. I embrace the title and am proud to bear it. I love this, I can call myself a witch now and not feel bad about it</span></span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>
