This is my own personal method which i derived myself.<br><br>2) Of coz insufficient, this is Complimentary Free General Forecast, its not a Detailed Forecast of Individual. I not only take main stars but stars which i feel a need to address, this is solely dependable on my Individual choice or preference definitely not within your control.<br><br>3) As i have said In term of Benevolent &amp; Malevolent Stars, there can be many combinations in every different zodiac signs. Stars may crossed or merged at different period like Annual, Monthly or Daily with regards to the Period Cycle of the Year. Perhaps you should go study the various combinations of Stars an Individual may have, there are plenty room for you to learn just pertaining to that. I did not implied in any ways that animal sign's analysis is not accurate, as this is a general analysis can't suit each individual perfectly but of coz they may have some of the happenings going on in their lives if they are born under that Zodiac sign. Definitely an Individual Analysis together with Full Name, Birthdate &amp; Time would provide more accurate insight details. The Stars &amp; Planets are constantly shifting, i do not think anyone can make 100% Accurate Prediction pertaining to Star Influence. Accuracy is always there more or less but never 100% Accuracy. Do you know some Stars &amp; Planets has already disappear from the Universe in this Millenium? The Source &amp; Doctrine of ZWDS is still unchanged over time so is Western Astrology &amp; Horoscopes. Some Stars &amp; Planets may be gone, do they still exert the same influence. Thus, is Astrology 100% Accurate?, the answer is a Simple " NO ". However the main traits &amp; characteristics more or less still valid.<br><br>You are most welcome for taking your time to read my post, this truly shown there are very keen people who been reading my postings which i do feel very appreciated about it.<br><br>About explaining on deriviation of my intepretation, i do not see or feel a need to, there is no obligation at all as its my own personal method. You are neither my student nor my client who paid for my services. What makes you think I am obligated to supply you with any informations pertaining to it? Is that a request or a command? Well if you are so naive to think that you can get answer simply by asking for it, read a few books, ask a few question in the net, if its so simple. However, I really admire your inquisitive nature &amp; effort. If so there will not be any classification or categorisation in Society, there will not be a need for any professional. If you are sick administer your own medication but if there is any detriments of mishaps, only yourself is answerable for it, non-vicarous to anyone else!<br><br>I am running a New Age Establishment not running some Charity School or Organisation. Even if i am running a Charity Establishment i also need funding for the overhead. Don't tell me you go to school for free or you work for free. If Everything is Free then no one will get salary for their job, You do your part as an employee in a company &amp; end of the day, the company pay you, this is obviously a fair exchange. At times when things are Free, it loses its meaning, don't you reckon that?<br><br>~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ was created to be an Establishment, Platform, Organisation and Point of focus for Magickal Work, Light Work &amp; Spiritual growth. As for the nature of my business, this my craft, that is Witchcraft &amp; this is what i do best! I am not a Fortune Teller, i only do Consultation, thats the difference.<br><br>As for all the free complimentary services, help/aid/answers i provide in here i do out of goodwill with no benefits at all, also no obligations at all. If there is a need for anyone to engage my services or buy my products, my pricelist is always available. I got overhead too, office premise &amp; warehouse to upkeep &amp; other miscelleanous expenses. My LOA in here is only a platform of awareness for all. I am running it at the expense of my free time which perhaps many of you in here do not understand. To some this is leisure or just to pass time, as for myself, i do not have much time for myself literally but i take extra effort to make here comfy for those who are interested in New Age, Metaphysics &amp; Magick to come in to share with others. I need everyone co-operation to make this place better.<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
