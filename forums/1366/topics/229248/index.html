The lunar cycle is about 29.5 days. In order to "catch up" with the solar calendar the Chinese insert an extra month once every few years (seven years out of a 19-year cycle). This is the same as adding an extra day on leap year. This is why, according to the solar calendar, the Chinese New Year falls on a different date each year.<br><br>Chinese New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are celebrated as a family affair, a time of reunion. The celebration was traditionally highlighted with a religious ceremony given in honor of Heaven and Earth, the gods of the household and the family ancestors depending on your Dialect Group, Cultures &amp; Beliefs.<br><br>The Offerings &amp; Prayers to the ancestors, the most vital of all the rituals, uniting the living members with those who had passed away. Departed relatives are remembered with great respect because they were responsible for laying the foundations for the fortune and glory of the family.<br><br>The presence of the ancestors is acknowledged on New Year's Eve with a dinner arranged for them at the family banquet table traditionally. The spirits of the ancestors, together with the living, celebrate the onset of the New Year as one great community. The communal feast called "surrounding the stove" or weilu. It symbolizes family unity and honors the past and present generations.<br><br>The past three years, Monkey 2004, Chicken 2005 and Dog 2006 are Metal cycles. Year of Fire Pig 2007 is the beginning year of the Water cycle. Therefore the coming three years are favorable to people whose lucky element is Water. 2007 is good for manifestation of Goals as success can be ensured with proper planning done previously, its time to take a step forward!<br><br>Chinese New Year starts on on February 18th this Year. 2007 is the Year of the Fire Pig. Usually the Chinese New Year Day falls between January 22 to February 10. Why does the Chinese New Year Day come so late in 2007? The reason for late Chinese New Year in 2007 is because year 2006 has an extra lunar month; a double 7th lunar month (Leap Month). This makes 2006 with two Chinese Valentine's Days (Yuan Xiao Jie), which is on the 7th lunar day of 7th lunar month. It also pushed down the date of Chinese Moon Festival into October 2006. All of this makes the Chinese New Year Day come on February 18, 2007.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">2007 The Year of the Pig</span></span></span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/firepig.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Pigs symbolise sincerity, purity, tolerance, and honor. They are careful and caring, obliging and chivalrous. Put your trust in him, he won't let you down and he will never try to. The Pigs simply want to do everything right, a perfectionist in their work.<br><br>Pigs are born to give, to yield and to serve, most people take advantage of this Pig nature. However Pigs not really easy to fool, they are just very obliging.  Pig people constantly sacrifice their own happiness and comfort for the sake of somebody else.<br><br>The Pig is a splendid companion. Pigs are loyal, faithful and giving - only as long as they approve of you. do not try to manipulate them or enforce your will on them. A Pig rarely asks for help and cannot graciously accept it.<br><br>The Pig doesn't say much - but when he does decide to speak, nothing can stop him. The Pig is intellectual - a character with a great thirst for knowledge.<br><br>Pigs can be snobbish at times but they are aesthetic. Pigs are born with an excellent nose for style in everything. The Pig often over-eats, but he eats with good taste.<br><br>In relationship, Pig people are sensitive, sweet but naive, caring &amp; romantic. But on the other hand, Pigs are also possessive, jealous and exclusive.<br><br>2007 is the Year of the Pig 'Ding Hai' Year : the Year of the Fire Pig thus this Year is govern by the Fire Element however its "Yin" Fire which is more favourable to woman than man. "Yin" Fire can be very destructive &amp; devastating if it too big. 2007 is also the 4th year in the Cycle Period 8 which enter into the Water Cycle. The year symbolises the element Fire sitting over Water. Both these elements are direct opposites and with their clashing relationship, cannot co-exist. This clash of elements will mean frequent conflicts, disputes, struggles and strive globally. Civil unrest &amp; Political changes are evident even before the start of 2007. However these can be rectify with Wood Element, by adding Wood to Fire, Water Will boil, instead of clashing they are in harmony together.  As Pig has both Water &amp; Wood Element depending on whichever is stronger in individual. Wood can act as the Mediator between Fire and Water. As long as Wood is there, Fire won't be extinguished. If your lucky Element is Fire, then you will be lucky all year long in 2007. However, the luck won't be that great, since Water is there and Fire won't become a big Fire.<br><br>The Year 2007 is an year of countless clashes, disputes, gossips and endless arguments.  There will be conflicts internally also, meaning disruption in family harmony and marital relationships. Separations may take place if relationship is not handled well. However this is also a good year for marriage and child bearing. Family disputes and juvenile delinquency would be aplenty &amp; serious if not taken care well. In fact, 2007 has the potential for any situations to gather great speed or burn out of control just like wild fire.<br><br>The Fire Pig Year also brings about many changes : changes at all levels &amp; all aspects.  The year also indicates heavy travelling : personally and in profession too due to influence of the Stars. Road &amp; Vehicle accidents aplenty also. Avoid the North West sector of your place directly or travelling in that direction, as the Grand Duke Jupiter (Tai Sui) position is there and it is not advisable to confront this war-like sharp energy there. Accidents are also likely to occur to objects, architectures or structures. There will be many Natural Disasters pertaining to Fire and Water, do take note!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">MONEY FAST COME FAST GO, TIME TO MANIFEST YOUR GOALS, TAKE A STEP FORWARD!!!</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Finance for the Year, i would say its Fast Come, Fast Go! Its advisable to start Small businesses if you have proper planning previously, success can be ensured &amp; it will prosper. Money will come in more easily and unexpectedly, but will go out easily too. In a way, This is a Year to savour the fruits of your labour too, you should take a step forward to manifest any long time goals &amp; plans!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

If your northeast sector of your premise is an important area such as bedroom or entrances, it is recommended that one hangs a metal windchimes or some other charms there to dissolve this bad energy.<br><br>Avoid sitting with back against exact West as you will be sitting against the unfavourable energy called Â“San ShaÂ” or Â“Three KillingsÂ” is a star of conflict and robbery. This is present in the northwest sector too. It is necessary to put a piece of red paper or something red in the northwest to minimize such a bad influence.<br><br>For those who are born under the Zodiac Signs: Pig, Snake, Tiger &amp; Monkey, there is a need for you to go pray &amp; make offerings to Grand Duke Jupiter (Tai Sui) for personal safety &amp; a smooth year. This is to avoid the occurence of Accidents &amp; Conflicts which will be aplenty due tho the clash.<br><br>This Year is unfavourable for Snake which is in "Xiang Chong" or direct clash against the Pig. Such clashes will usually bring about turbulence, movements, accident or adverse changes. So people born in the year of the Snake will anticipate more traveling , or movements such as changing jobs or moving house. The other animals signs facing unfavourable positions is the Pig, as when Pig encounters a Pig year will form Self Penalty or " Xiang Ke" relationship.  Such self penalties will usually bring irritation and frustrations, such as putting in a lot of effort without any concrete achievements.<br><br>As for Tiger &amp; Monkey, their clash is not as unfavourable as Pig &amp; Snake however they also need to take note &amp; be careful. For people who are born under the Zodiac signs that clash with the year, it is still ok to travel more, making changes such as moving house, or change job.<br><br>I would highly recommend those born under the Zodiac Signs: Pig, Snake, Tiger &amp; Monkey to carry with them a Pi Xiu to annul the Adverse Effects of Clash with Grand Duke Jupiter (Fan/Ching Tai Sui) as Pi Xiu is able to protect you from all harms &amp; evil, smoothen your path, removing obstacles, creating positive change, attracting wealth &amp; abundance. This Mythical Beast or "Ling Sou" Pi Xiu is one of the most powerful creature in the Major Mythical Beasts of Feng Shui &amp; Oriental Mystic School, they are very loyal to their owner too.<br><br>~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ is proud to present you with <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=229073" rel="nofollow">Zheng Yang Men : Heavenly Beast Pi Xiu</a> which i personally went down Beijing to select them, they are all Blessed &amp; Empowered (Kai Kuang) by Renown Master Chen Li Yang personally.

If they are use for Feng shui placement, must be careful on where you place them, make sure you seek professional consultation/advice, if not might bring about some adverse effects.<br><br>Placement on Pi Xiu depends on your purpose. Generally just place them in your bedroom facing window.<br><br>You interested in which kind of Pi Xiu? Zheng Yang Men : Heavenly Beast Pi Xiu or my own Pi Xiu? Those to carry or for Feng shui Placement kind. Their cost varies. Let me know ya...Thanks again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>
