            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OCEANOS:</div><div class="quote_body">Merry Meet cyberr1981,<br><br>1) Kindly read properly, what i meant by I am using a<br>combination of Various Traditions School of Thoughts<br>in my General Forecast for every year, its not just Zi<br>Wei Dou Shu is i am not only using ZWDS but i am also<br>using &amp; implementing Xuan Kong Fei Xing, Nine Star Ki<br>&amp; Five Elements in it. This is my own personal method<br>which i derived myself.</div></blockquote>I understand that itÂ’s your own method, but has it<br>been tested to be accurate? Especially when itÂ’s an<br>analysis by the animal signs (As a matter of fact,<br>readings just by animal sign is known to be vague).<br><br><blockquote><strong>2) Of coz insufficient, this is<br>Complimentary Free General Forecast, its not a<br>Detailed Forecast of Individual. I not only take main<br>stars but stars which i feel a need to address, this<br>is solely dependable on my Individual choice or<br>preference definitely not within your<br>control.</strong></blockquote>Let me try to understand this, your own method is<br>actually a matter of preference/individual choice? For<br>your info, astrology donÂ’t work in such a way like if<br>you donÂ’t like this star, donÂ’t take it into account.<br>Sorry to say that again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>As itÂ’s your personal choice, itÂ’s definitely not within<br>my control. I know that.<br><br><blockquote><strong>3) As i have said In term of Benevolent &amp;<br>Malevolent Stars, there can be many combinations in<br>every different zodiac signs. Stars may crossed or<br>merged at different period like Annual, Monthly or<br>Daily with regards to the Period Cycle of the Year.<br>Perhaps you should go study the various combinations<br>of Stars an Individual may have, there are plenty room<br>for you to learn just pertaining to that. I did not<br>implied in any ways that animal sign's analysis is not<br>accurate, as this is a general analysis can't suit<br>each individual perfectly but of coz they may have<br>some of the happenings going on in their lives if they<br>are born under that Zodiac sign. Definitely an<br>Individual Analysis together with Full Name, Birthdate<br>&amp; Time would provide more accurate insight<br>details.</strong></blockquote><br>I know that too. We have a common understanding that<br>readings by animal sign are inaccurate and negligible.<br><br>Thanks for your affirmation.<br><br><blockquote><strong>The Stars &amp; Planets are constantly shifting,<br>i do not think anyone can make 100% Accurate<br>Prediction pertaining to Star Influence. Accuracy is<br>always there more or less but never 100% Accuracy. Do<br>you know some Stars &amp; Planets has already disappear<br>from the Universe in this Millenium? The Source &amp;<br>Doctrine of ZWDS is still unchanged over time so is<br>Western Astrology &amp; Horoscopes. Some Stars &amp; Planets<br>may be gone, do they still exert the same influence.<br>Thus, is Astrology 100% Accurate?, the answer is a<br>Simple " NO ". However the main traits &amp;<br>characteristics more or less still valid.</strong></blockquote>For your info, the stars in ZWDS have no relations to<br>the actually heavenly bodies and planets. True that<br>some stars and planets are gone but it has nothing to<br>do with ZWDS.<br><br>You should know this, right?<br><br><blockquote><strong>You are most welcome for taking your time to<br>read my post, this truly shown there are very keen<br>people who been reading my postings which i do feel<br>very appreciated about it.</strong></blockquote>Hope you don't mind that I spotted some discrepanies from the original purple star astrology in your readings.<br><br><blockquote><strong>About explaining on deriviation of my<br>intepretation, i do not see or feel a need to, there<br>is no obligation at all as its my own personal method.<br>You are neither my student nor my client who paid for<br>my services. What makes you think I am obligated to<br>supply you with any informations pertaining to it? Is<br>that a request or a command?</strong></blockquote>Since you asked me, (which I thought I put it in plain<br>clear manner), it is not a request nor a command.<br>ItÂ’s an suggestion.<br><br>I merely noted <strong>Â’Â’it would be helpful for you to<br>show your workingsÂ’Â’</strong>, I just donÂ’t understand why<br>you got so worked up. But it's true that it would really be helpful for other people if you show your workings.<br><br>Afterall, you still have your choice. It's not like I'm forcing you or something.<br><br>Sure, you have your choice whether to show it or not,<br>but you could have used a nicer and more polite tone<br>to present your stand.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Well if you are so naive to think that you<br>can get answer simply by asking for it, read a few<br>books, ask a few question in the net, if its so<br>simple. However, I really admire your inquisitive<br>nature &amp; effort. If so there will not be any<br>classification or categorisation in Society, there<br>will not be a need for any professional. If you are<br>sick administer your own medication but if there is<br>any detriments of mishaps, only yourself is answerable<br>for it, non-vicarous to anyone else!</strong></blockquote>Do you think it's polite to call me ''naiveÂ’Â’?? By asking<br>questions and reading books, isnÂ’t it the way to<br>learn? Are you trying to say that reading books and<br>asking questions is ''naive''?<br><br>Sure, you may or may not be knowledgeable in this<br>field, but I think there is still room for<br>improvements as far as manners and etiquette are<br>concerned.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I am running a New Age Establishment not<br>running some Charity School or Organisation. Even if i<br>am running a Charity Establishment i also need funding<br>for the overhead. Don't tell me you go to school for<br>free or you work for free. If Everything is Free then<br>no one will get salary for their job, You do your part<br>as an employee in a company &amp; end of the day, the<br>company pay you, this is obviously a fair exchange.<br></strong></blockquote>You do not need to go to such extent. Everyone knows<br>that youÂ’re providing a free service out of good will<br>and I thank you again for your great kindness.<br><br>So, how much do you want me to pay you for you to<br>explain how you derive your interpretations?<br><br><blockquote><strong>At times when things are Free, it loses its<br>meaning, don't you reckon that?</strong></blockquote>No, I donÂ’t reckon that. When people give away food,<br>money and other necessity to charity (for free), these<br>are the things that are the most meaningful and serve<br>as evidence of the humane side of mankind.<br><br>Tell me, do you ever donate to charity?<br><br><blockquote><strong>I need everyone co-operation to make this<br>place better.</strong></blockquote>So far, everyoneÂ’s posts I read here is fine. I also<br>need your cooperation to treat people (who asks<br>question) nicely and answer them in a friendly manner.<br>Everyone knows nobody owes them anything. Afterall,<br>this forum is yours, as per mentioned by you.<br></div>

I do not run language school. Its not that i don't take in account of the star if i don't like it, it simply meant i pick whatever star that is present i want to emphasis on. Now i really feel sorry for you. Don't keep repeating ZWDS if that is all you know. I am sharing with you an Analogy/Perspective on Astrology on the Whole, not point mentioning just a flower in the Big Garden.<br><br>A suggestion? I see, obviously your suggestion is not taken by me. Worked up? Anyone with logical cognition can tell from your response &amp; reply, clearly its not me. I do not assume, neither twist &amp; turn with words. Perhaps communication is down. Since its my choice, no obligation at all, how come you keep repeating yourself. I am already very polite just you fail to reciprocate my kindness. Do you understand what is "Charity"? It literally mean "an activity or gift that benefits the public at large" or "a kindly and lenient attitude toward people"! Doing Charity come from the heart not through action or words, Do charity need not tell or ask people. If not it loses its meaning as well, no need to do, waste of time. I hope i am not doing Charity by being nice to you in responding to your inquisitive replies. No worries, this English Lesson is free as its very meaningful.<br><br>Since you do understand this Forum is mine then kindly adhere to my Rules &amp; Regulations. When you go visiting at other people's house, its always polite to be nice to the host &amp; family. You do not have the authority or rights to rant at other people's house with consideration to others in the house. If not you are over-extending your welcome, no one is obligated to entertain you. If the host keep a dog, the dog will not welcome unruly guest also. Even in event you are bitten by the dog, its obviously nothing to do with the owner. Its more likely to be your individual choice. I do not see or feel anything wrong with my moderator's reply, being my moderator, its his/her duty to maintain peace, serenity &amp; order in my premise, they have the utmost right to carry out any action they feel appropriate with regars to their Duties in here. Its more like you are being defensive towards other's neutral reply. So much for being big-hearted &amp; open-minded. I am truly experiencing it now. Its ok, i am magnanimous thats why i am letting your egocentric replies stay in here for other's reading pleasure. Thats all i got to say, there is no need for any replies.

You seem to be discussing just his points of views and also pushing your ideas but yours when he answered to, you just summarily dismiss the ideas.  LOA is a platform to share ideas right.  Where you insist on something you prefer, no longer just sharing but instead just talking about your ideas.<br><br>Yeah I may not be good at this sorts of analysis, but even some methods can be combined to get some or more details right.<br>If not then where you get 1+1=2.<br>Surely there are many combinations out there.<br><br>Yeah this may be an complimentary service on Oceanos's part and short information but as shown in posts by others, it is enough for them, if they need more information or details can always book appointment right.<br><br>On your part, you just asking more about the methods, to ask is okay but please be more tactful.  And be more open-minded as well.<br><br>Just a cent's worth of my views.<br><br>Tata... all enjoys your reading.</span></div>
