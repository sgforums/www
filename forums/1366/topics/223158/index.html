They can ward off evil, danger, theft and illnesses, they can help you get a job, a love or a kingdom. With so many representations in so many cultures how do you know what you have, how it works or if it's effective?<br><br>Amulets, Talismans &amp; Charms have been worn for protection or other purposes like luck, prosperity &amp; many more for thousands of years. Early peoples lived in a world where strange and frightening things occurred that defied explanation. Consequently, amulets were used to protect homes, families, and livestock.<br><br>Amulets, Talismans &amp; Charms were also used to protect people from the Â“evil eye.Â” The belief that a person or animal could harm another by staring at them with an evil eye dates back at least five thousand years, &amp; ancient clay tablets have been found that describe the damage that the evil eye can inflict. The Sumerian god Ea spent most of his time fighting the evil eye. Even today, in many parts of the world, the evil eye is considered a major threat, and various kinds of amulets are used to avert it.<br><br>Charms were originally spoken or sung. The word charm comes from the French charme, which means song. The blessing that a priest gives at the end of a service is an example of this sort of charm. But gradually, people came to the conclusion that spoken words were ephemeral, while a solid object was permanent. Objects that had special significance Â– such as a splinter that was believed to be from the cross of Jesus Â– replaced sung or spoken charms.<br><br>Almost anything can (&amp; has been) used as a charm. Buttons and coins are good examples. This is because these items are frequently lost, and found by others. Anything that you find can be used as a charm. Small objects that are given to you with good intentions also make good charms, because of the pleasant connotations they provide.<br><br>Lucky charms are normally carried on the person, but there are exceptions. Charms can be seen attached to the mirror, clutch, steering wheels or interiors of many cars. Some obviously prefer to have the charms where they can see it, rather than somewhere on their person.<br><br>The Witches' Ladder made of Knots Magick is very well-known &amp; effective charms because they are believed to catch/repel evil spirits, attract or ward whatever you want. Basically you can wear them or hang them anywhere at a designated place, bags, cars &amp; many more.<br><br>Talismans are intended to provide power, energy, and specific benefits they are often made at times that are believed to be spiritually or astrologically significant. They are frequently made from stone, metal, or parchment as these substances can easily be inscribed with words or pictures to add additional power. Many talismans come from predatory animals. A leopardÂ’s claw, sharkÂ’s tooth, or eagleÂ’s feather, for instance, are believed to endow the wearer with some of the qualities of the animal from which it came.<br><br>The most famous talisman is a six-pointed star, made from two overlapping triangles. The upward pointing triangle symbolizes fire, the sky, &amp; male energy. The downward pointing triangle symbolizes water, earth, &amp; female energy. The power of this talisman is such that mystic Arthur Edward Waite wrote: Â“Nothing was believed impossible for those who possessed it.Â” (A. E. Waite, The Occult Sciences [Secaucus, NJ: University Books, 1974], 111). As the Star of David, this talisman symbolizes both the Jewish religion &amp; the nation of Israel. It is also known as the Seal of Solomon because King Solomon is believed to have used it. However, it predates his time by hundreds of years.<br><br>Amulets, Talismans &amp; Charms were originally natural items &amp; curios, such as an animalÂ’s tooth or a semi-precious stone. Medals, Pendants, bells, keys, &amp; photographs can all be used as Amulets, Talismans &amp; Charms.<br><br>Take your time when choosing an Amulets, Talismans &amp; Charms. Think about your purpose in wanting one, &amp; how you will wear or carry it. Most importantly, the Power of the Maker, this is essential for the Amulets, Talismans &amp; Charms to be potent. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ is proud to present you with our own Amulets, Talismans &amp; Charms, consecrated, crafted, empowered &amp; blessed by various Magick, Voodoo, Hoodoo Workers, Healers &amp; Masters for its intended purposes.<br><br>On several occasions, Amulets, Talismans &amp; Charms seem to have found me when I needed them. Why not bring home the Power of Amulets, Talismans &amp; Charms?

"Mer" means Light. "Ka" means Spirit. "Ba" means Body. Mer-Ka-Ba means the spirit/body surrounded by counter-rotating fields of light, (wheels within wheels), spirals of energy as in DNA, which transports spirit/body from one dimension to another.  The word Merkaba or Merkava - Hebrew 'ChariotÂ’ or general meaning "to ride an animal, in a chariot" - is used in the Bible (Ezekiel 1:4-26) to refer to the throne-chariot of God, the four-wheeled vehicle driven by four Cherubim, each of which has four wings and four faces (of a man, lion, ox, and eagle). Four means 'time' in alchemy.<br><br>In order to explain what the Merkaba is, we must first generally explain the flow of energy and energy fields that surround the human body. The first definition refers to the Prana or Chi - This is the Â“Universal Life forceÂ”. This unseen energy exists everywhere in the Universe in great quantities that flow through our Chakras entering from the top of our head. Prana is an Indian Sanskrit word meaning "turning wheel", due to the look of these complex energy flows. According to the early Egyptians there are thirteen chakras as they relate to different energy centers.<br><br>We have a Prana field that surrounds our body as a the Prana flow through us from the Universe. Then there is the field of the aura. The auric field is an egg shaped energy field that surrounds our body and change its color according to our thoughts, feelings and emotions. After the auric field we have hundreds of electromagnetic fields. These fields have precise geometrical shapes. Each one of them is made up of three identical fields with the same size and shape.<br><br>The Prana fields is the Star Tetrahedron, a three dimensional Star of David. By rotating two of the three Star Tetrahedron fields in opposite directions It will create a huge 17 meter energy field - our Light Body, the Merkaba.<br><br>The Sacred Mystery Schools of Lemuria, Atlantis and Egypt used Merkaba as keys to access the higher dimensions, which formed the basis of their spiritual beliefs. They understood in the mystery schools that one's Merkaba had to be activated in order for the physical body to turn into Light which would complete the Ascension process. During this time of rapid change with the powerful frequencies of energy that are now present on Mother Earth, it is clear that one should have the ability to fully activate one's Light Body in the proper manner.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/mask-tetraedri1.jpg"><br><br>The Merkaba's energy field is a force field of Light that surrounds your body and encompasses your outer bodies. Activating your Merkaba fields expands your consciousness until the physical body is transformed into Light. There are sacred geometric shapes of energy that already surround your body and they are around everything from galaxies to plants. They are activated into an energy Light field through the Love emotion and thought projection.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/icebar.jpg"><br><br>~*~ Merkaba Series ~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/merkabastar.jpg"><br><br>&gt;*&lt; Merkaba Star Tetrahedron Amulet&gt;*&lt;<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/merkaba-medium1.jpg"><br><br>This amulet is finely crafted in 100% Lead Free Pewter as three dimensional Merkaba. </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/merkaba-medium11.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/icebar.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ is proud to present you with Â“Merkaba Star Tetrahedron AmuletÂ”.

He was apparently given the name Emrys (or Ambrosius) at his birth in Caer-Fyrddin (Carmarthen). He is known as Myrddin in Welsh taken from the place of his birth., only later He became known as Merlin.<br><br>Merlin possessed Great Visionary Powers, from his Visions, he made a Prophecy that Vortigern who once ruled the Great Britain would be slain and followed on the throne by Ambrosius Aurelianus, then Uther Pendragon, then a Greater Leader, King Arthur. His Prophecy came true. In one of his expedition tasked by Ambrosius, Merlin, along with Uther went to Ireland to procure the stones of the Chorea Gigantum, the Giant's Ring. Merlin, by the use of his Extraordinary Powers, brought the stones back to a site, just West of Amesbury, and re-erected them around the the site. We now call this place Â“StonehengeÂ”.<br><br>Merlin is also known as a Miracle Worker, an Ascended Master, Saint Germain. Saint Germain was a Master of the Ancient Wisdom and of the knowledge of the Matter Spheres, an Alchemist. He ruled by Light every area of life; his empire reached a height of beauty, symmetry and perfection unexceeded in the physical octave. Truly the heavenly patterns were out pictured in the crystal chalice of the earth. And elemental life served to maintain the purity of the Matter quadrants.<br><br>The people regarded their hierarch as the highest expression of God whom they desired to emulate, and great was their love for his presence. He was the embodiment of the archetype of universal Christhood for that dispensation--to whom they could look as the standard for their own emerging Godhood. His Power is again derived from God. Merlin is a Christ figure, whose task is "to teach men that they are incapable of distinguishing good from evil or appearance from reality without divine guidance, and that, therefore, they must discard their faulty human reason and submit to GodÂ’s willÂ…<br><br>People call Merlin Â“PowerfulÂ” because he was able to change his form at will. It is from his Â“Ascended FormÂ” that he brings the ultimate gift of freedom - The Violet Flame, The Alchemist Fire. Merlin, the Great Wizard resonate with Dragon Energies, Dragons are known as Draconis, in his Book of Magick, there are records and symbols of Dragon Magick. The Draconis Symbol was said to be channelled by Merlin, this symbol used in Magick is also being use in Healing Light works and as Amulet.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/bar.jpg"><br><br>~*~Great Wizard Merlin Series ~*~<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/merlincrystalball.jpg"><br><br>&gt;*&lt; Merlin Power Amulet &gt;*&lt;<br><br>This amulet is finely crafted in 100% Lead Free Pewter as Great Wizard Merlin holding his Crystal Ball.
