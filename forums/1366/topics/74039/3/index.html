They are shoe-makers by trade and are usually found out of doors in rural areas.  They are described as being no more than two feet tall.  It is said that if you can keep your gaze fixed on them long enough that they are compelled to lead you to their crock of gold.  Although they always manage to wrangle out of such compromising positions.  Even if you do succeed in gaining the crock of gold it usually turns to nothing more than dried up old leaves the following day.<br><br>Original Drawing by John D. Batten, colourised by Hilary Tully.<br><br>They are noted for their fondness for alcohol which is usually made from heather or gorse or other unusual herbs or cereals, the making of which is a lost art, to ordinary mortals.  They also have a great capacity to consume large amounts of ale and other intoxicating beverages.<br><br>The following is the account given by Lady Morgan of the Cluricaune or Leprechaun, in her novel of O'Dommell (Vol.11. p. 246.)<br><br>"It would he extremely difficult," says her lady ship;  "to class this supernatural agent, who holds a distinguished place in the Irish fairies."<br><br>His appearance, however, is supposed to be that of a shrivelled little old man, whose presence marks a spot where hidden treasures lie concealed, which were buried there in 'the troubles.'<br><br>He is therefore generally seen in lone and dismal places, out of the common haunts of man and though the night wanderer may endeavour to mark the place where he beheld the guardian of the treasures perched, yet when he returns in the morning with proper<br>implements to turn up the earth, the thistle, stone, or branch he had placed as a mark is so<br>multiplied, that it is no longer a distinction and the disappointments occasioned by the malignity of the little Leprechaun render him a very unpopular fairy: his name is never applied but as a term of contempt."<br><br>The Gaelic word PrÃ©achÃ¡n which forms part of the word Leprechaun means a Crow or a Rook; a noisy, chattering bird that caused distress to farmers.  PrÃ©achÃ¡n when used to describe a person signified an idle chatterer up to no good.  The earliest reference to leprechauns is in the tale 'The Death of Fergus Mac Leite' composed about 1100 ad. which refers to diminutive sea-beings, and this tale it was supposed gave Swift his inspiration for his novel 'Gulliver's Travels'.<br><br>In the Irish tales of the Leprechaun he is unanimously perceived as sly and malicious and definitely not to be trusted by a mortal.  The 'Hollywood' notion of the good-tempered innocuous 'wee-man' as portrayed in films such as 'Darby O' Gill and the Little People' is NOT how the Leprechaun is perceived traditionally.<br><br>Other related solitary fairies are the Cluricaune and the Fir Darrig who have similarities to the Leprechaun.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

They are small in stature and  usually appear as wizened old men.  They can do mischief, grant wishes and poke fun at humankind.  Often confused with the other solitary fairies known as Lepracauns or the Fear Dearg they prefer to be indoors and do not like to do any physical labour.  They like any kind of alcoholic beverage and can be found in the cellar's of rich men, helping themselves to whatever they fancy of wine and whiskey.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Appropriately, goblins are known as the thieves and villians of the fae realm. The term goblin can apply either to the ugliest members of the fae, or to certain sub-races.<br><br>Some reside in mines where they search for the earth's treasures (though not all goblins are adept at this pratice, Kobolds and Wichtlein mime the act by stricking pickaxes and hammers against the stones). Human miners take the resulting sounds as a sign of good luck, believing the present ore to be of high value. Other goblins choose human residences where their mischief includes the banging of pots and pans, rearranging furnitrue, removing the clothes from sleeping humans and knocking on doors and walls. Still others of the family prefer grottos, often residing in the same one for their entire life.<br><br>Those fae numbered among the goblin subraces, include: Scottish Trows, Scandinavian Trolls, English Spriggans, Welsh Knockers, Cornish Knockers, German Kobolds, the Irish Phooka and even Shakespeare's infamous Puck are all considered goblins. </span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </strong></div>

The exact nature of their undersea world is uncertain, though some believe it to be encased in giant air bubbles. Their true forms are those of faeries or humans, though they take the form of large seals when traveling the through the oceans. In particular: great seals and grey seals are said to take human forms. Older tales tell that selkies are only able to take on human forms on certain nights of the year, such as Midsummer's Eve or All Hallows.<br><br>Occasionally they encounter humankind, sometimes becoming their mates. A human male may take a selkie female as his wife if he finds her seal skin on the beach and hides it from her. In the end she always recovers the skin and returns to the sea, though she may return occasionally to watch over her human family from the safety of the waves.<br><br>A human woman may bear the child of a selkie male if she weeps seven tears or seven drops of blood in the nighttime sea. Such relationships are rarely lasting. Seven years hence, the selkie would return for his child, offering the mother a fee for nursing her own babe. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
