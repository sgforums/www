            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.firstmagic.com/pics/angelic-faery-small.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Among the distinguishing features of the Faery tradition is the use of a Faery Power which characterizes the lineage. It is an ecstatic, rather than a fertility, tradition. Strong emphasis is placed on sensual experience and awareness, including sexual mysticism, which is not limited to heterosexual expression. In this, as in the general spirit of spiritual exploration, there is more risk-taking encouraged than in other Wiccan traditions which may have specific laws limiting behavior, and there is a certain amorality historically associated with the Tradition. We see ourselves, when enchanted, as "fey"--not black, not white, outside social definitions, on the road to Faeryland, either mad or poetical. We are aware that much of reality is unseen, or at least has uncertain boundaries. As in all the Craft, there is a deep respect for the wisdom of Nature, a love of beauty, and an appreciation of bardic and mantic creativity. The Gods are not just constructs or psychological forces from the collective unconscious. The Gods are real, with a system of morality different from our own, and we have a responsibility to them.<br><br>The Faery Tradition, in common with initiatory lineages of the Craft which practice possession, is a mystery tradition of power, mystery, danger, ecstacy, and direct communication with divinity. This is in contrast to traditions which practice psychodrama or psychotherapy through ritual. The negative side of this style of working is that we have a lot of initiates who did not return unscathed from between the worlds. The tradition is not for everybody, and it is not amenable to mass attendance, like many Pagan paths.<br><br>There is a specific corpus of chants and liturgical material, much of it stemming from Victor Anderson and Gwydion Pendderwen, which provides a frame for many Circle-workings, and poetic creativity is highly valued. The magical practices of the Faery (or Feri, as Victor spells it) Tradition are heavily invocatory, to encourage possession, which relies mainly on psychic talent or sensitivity to occur. Rites are stylistically diverse, and may draw from many sources. There is an initiatory lineage, traceable to Victor or Cora Anderson or Gwydion Pendderwen. Victor tells of antecedents of the present tradition in the coven in which he was involved in the l920's and 30's in Oregon. Hallmarks of the tradition are possession of secret names, energy-working using pentacles and visualization of blue fire, a body of poetic and liturgical material, deities and archetypes specific to the Tradition, the doctrine of the Three Selves, a cingulum of a specific color, a "tribal" or "clan" feel to the coven, the use of the horned ( sometimes called "inverted" ) pentagram, and the honoring of a warrior ethic. For example, we are urged not to coddle weakness, support others in insincerities or self-deceptions, or to submit one's own Life force to anyone or anything, which leads to a fierce openness called the "Black Heart of Innocence." The Faery Tradition is gender-equal, and all sexual orientations seem able to find a niche. For many, there is a strong identification with the realms of Faery and with shape-shifting.<br><br>Although Victor is universally recognized as the founding teacher of the tradition, it is possible to identify influences which shaped the tradition before its present form evolved. There is a strong African diasporic influence, primarily Dahomean-Haitian, and the Three Selves theory is an outgrowth of Huna beliefs. Neither is Victor the only source for material presently within the tradition. Each initiate seems to draw the tradition in a new direction and uncover new ground.. Some practitioners, such as Gwydion and Eldri Littlewolf, went deeply into shamanic forms. Gwydion also worked extensively with Celtic religion, even learning Welsh early in his Wiccan training. Other influences (Arica, Tibetan meditation, and Ceremonial Magick) entered as Gabriel Caradoc began teaching. Victor, Gwydion, Caradoc, Brian Dragon and Paladin wrote darkly beautiful ritual poetry and liturgy. Gabriel's classes provided an excellent training in magical visualization and his students continue his teachings. Poet Francesca De Grandis and songwriter Sharon Knight have added their inspiration to the corpus of material. Starhawk has used concepts developed in the Faery Tradition in expressing her beliefs and practice, and has given the clearest explanations widely available of concepts such as the Three Selves or the Iron Pentacle. </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: olive;">~How To Create A Faery Garden~<br><br><img src="http://www.naplescreeksoaps.com/Garden%20Fairy.jpg"><br><br>To attract Faeries to your garden, you have to build a garden that is conducive to all life. Put up birdhouses, birdbaths, bird feeders and hummingbird feeders. Where the butterflies are, the Faeries will be. So plant lots of flowers and plants that are attractive to bees and butterflies. Place nuts out for the squirrels. Bring life to your garden and the Faeries will come.<br><br>Plants and flowers such as the Common yarrow, New York aster, Shasta daisy, Coreopsis, Western giant hyssop or horsemint, French lavender, Rosemary, Thyme, Fountain butterfly bush, Orange-eye butterfly bush, Summer lilac, Shrubby cinquefoil, Common garden petunia, Verbenas, Vervains, Pincushion flowers, Cosmos, and the Common Zinnia can attract the Faeries and butterflies to your garden.<br><br>You can also place little statues of Faeries, gnomes and elves in your garden. Anything that is colorful and reflects light is attractive to the gnomes and elves. Leave an area of your garden a bit wild, not too cultivated. Faeries will feel welcome if they have an area dedicated to them.<br><br>Be sure that you place water in your garden. A small fountain,<br>waterfall or fishpond would be nice. Faeries and water sprites love the splashy sound and the sight of a fountain. Water inspires soothing energy and a simple pool can add soothing ambiance to your garden. Add a few floating plants and goldfish in the pool, and place rocks around the garden. Float flower blossoms in the birdbath.</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: green;">~*~Types of Faeries~*~</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.posterplanet.net/images/faeries.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Water</strong> - It's the creative element of life and death. Undines are water creatures that sometimes make them selves known in dreams. Dreams of water reflect undine activity and urge more creativity in your life. There are 3 types of faeries that live in the water: faeries that live on the surface of the ocean. They look like fat, jolly, human babies. Faeries that live in the middle deeps who are tall 5-7 feet tall with a more human-like appearance they are thin but beautiful they have fierce,gypsy-like spirit even when the sea is calm. Faeries that live inthe great depths are large and unpleasent to look at. Work and maintain the astral body of humans Work to awaken and stimulate our feeling nature.<br><br><strong>Activities</strong> - They assist in unfolding heightened psychic feelings, as well as emotional ones They assist us in absorbing and assimilating life experiences, so that we can use them to the fullest They help us to see and feel the fullest ecstasy of the creative acts of life, be they sexual, artistic or the performance of a duty with the right emotion.The Undines are of creative element. Water spirits replenish our energy. They are healing. That's why it's so relaxing to sit by an ocean or lake. They can be devious, depending on the area. There are spirits of pools and wells - these take human form. They can appear beautiful, enticing and seductive. Water had been the most traveled route into the faerie realm. Water links us to more astral dimentions where these beings operate more actively. Setting a dish out to collect rain water can give you a glimpse into their realm when looking into it. Wherever there is a fresh water source you will find them. They are also assigned to us like the other elementals. Too little connection with our personal undine or others of the water realm can bring on psychological, emotional and even physical problems. We may not be as compassionate as we used to be. We may start to distrust our judgement and intuition. There will be a lack of sympathy and empathy. On the other hand, too much connection with the water elementals and nature spirits can make us overloaded with emotions and contradictory feelings. Water retention in the body is often a physical sign of this. You may find yourself emoting rather than doing.<br><br><strong>Types</strong> - Alven, Ashrays, Bean-Fionn, Bean-Sidhe, Black Angus, Black Annis, Boobrie, Bunyip, Bwaganod, Cailleac Bhuer, Corrigan, Dracs, Ellyllions, Fideal, Fin Folk, Fir Darrig, Fossegrim, Glaistig, Guardian of the Sword, Gwragedd Annwn, Irish Sea Water Guardians, Jenny Greenteeth, Kelpie.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Air</strong> - Air faeries are a large but mixed group. The air is their only natural element.<br><br><strong>Types of Air faeries</strong><br><strong>Slyphs</strong>- are intelligent , distinct class and varied origin.<br><strong>Clouds</strong>- they are part water part air,their size varies but basically they have large, bulky forms and cloud-like hair streaming behind them.<br><strong>Storms</strong>-they are small, 4 to 5 feet high , They seldome come down to earth level and are seen mainly in great troops high up in the sky. They have intelligenence of a high order and are close to the Sylphs in nature. They work under the direction of angels. They are superior to cloud fairies and direct them.<br>Air is the element of intellect and creativity. Air is the source of all life energy. It is essential to our existance. Their work is the sweet scent in the air. They can serve as temporary guardian angels and also help children who have just passed over. A sylph is assigned to each of us and aid us in our mental body and mental development. They help stimulate new knowledge and inspiration. Too much connection with air spirits or elementals can make for an overactive mind that must be controlled and guided. It can make one dabble. It can also make the nervous system highly active. Too little of a connection with creatures of this realm, may present itself with impaired perceptions and a lack of common sense. It can also cause a weak nervous system.<br><br><strong>Other types include</strong>: Anthropophagi, Bocan, Buggars, Chi Spirits, Dryads, Dybbuk, Erlkonig, Fachan, Folletti, Fylgiar, Gancanagh, Gans, Giants &amp; Ogres, Gittos, Glashtin, Gremlins, Guriuz, Hamadryadniks, Hyters, Jimaninos, Jinns, Lesidhe, Lob</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Fire</strong><br><strong>Types of fire faeries</strong><br>Small ones three inches to 2 feet high who have no human shape, being merely foggy outlines. Tiny ones are rather like candle flames, they belong to the elemental class and are not really fairies. Large types are from five feet to 14 feet tall; these may be called "salamanders."<br><br><strong>Salamanders.</strong><br>The biggest salamanders live in volanoes and are of an elongated, thin human shape, often dwindling away at the bottom. They have no real interaction with humans except thru their love for music, such as Wagner's "Fire Music" in the RING. The fire faeries or salamanders are not exactly feared by the rest of nature, but they are held in awe. They do not play a part in nature, but they are themselves much more intelligent than the average faeries. The Salamanders are everywhere. They are responsible for lightning, heat, and volcanoes. They can be power fully effective in healing work in assisting to detoxify the body, especially in critical situations. Their energies are difficult to control. Fire elements work to maintain our spiritual body. We also have a salamander assigned to us throughout life. It assists in maintaining the body temperature and works with the body's metabolism for greater health. A good relationship with our personal salamander will stimulate vitality and loyalty. Too little connection may reveal itself through lack of spiritedness. Too strong a relationship or any other of this realm may bring on a lack of self-control and overactivity. It could cause one to burn out. Of all the elementals, salamanders are the most difficult to understand, attune to and control.<br><br><strong>Other types include</strong>: Basilisk, Bright Borrower, Bwciod, Dinnshenchas, Domovoi, Drakes, Fox Fire Faery, Geancanach, Ghillie Dhu, Grant, Gruagach, Gwyllions, Limniades, Merry Moon Dancer, Oakmen, Phi-Suk, Red Cap, Salamanders, Saleerandees, Spunkies and Will of the Wisp.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong>Earth</strong> - Gnomes are little creatures of the earth. They can't fly and can be burned by fire and can also grow old like humans. But gnomes live alot longer than humans. They are needed to build plants, flowers and trees. It is their task to tint them, to make minerals and crystals and to maintain the Earth so that we have a place to live. One gnome is assigned to each of us to help our physical vehicles grow. Too little connection makes us "Space out" and too much connection can make one overly practical, cynical and skeptical.<br><br><strong>Activities</strong><br>Gnomes work to maintain the earth's structure,they grow plants, flowers and trees,they color the world and our lives and make minerals and crystals.<br><br><strong>Types</strong> - Attocroppe, Ballybogs, Barca the Snagger, Barley King, Bean Tighe, Bendith Y Mamau, Berry Man, Boggart, Bogie, Brownies, Brown Man of the Muirs, Bugul Noz, Buttery Sprites, Bwbachs, Bwca, Callicantzaroi, Chin-Chin Kobakama, Churn Milk Peg &amp; Melsh Dick, Clurichaun, Coblynau, Cucui, Domoviyr and Duendes. </span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
