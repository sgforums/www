For you the beauty is not enough. He/she must be smart and friendly. You are one who think in facts. You take your feelings in background everything is material. For you a good partner is seen on the good results he/she makes, his job etc. This shows you that she/he is a respectable person who has god qualities, and then you start to fall in love with her/him. You dont like people that are lying or playing. Your loved one will never cheat on you because he/she respects you and you choose your partner carefully.<br><br><img src="http://live.quizilla.com/user_images/C/coreina/1080315514_ilderaaaa6.jpg"></div></blockquote>mmmm good one think before you choose ... not only me too...

You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained. [/b]</blockquote>you find one ....</div>

You like it the way you are. To be unreachable, no need to show feelings. Hiding everything inside you. You are already used to it. You say yourself that you dont need anyone, that you stand on your own two feet or that you dont have time for these things. But in reality you are scared to get hurt.
