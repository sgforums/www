            <div class='col-md body'>I was observing my thoughts yesterday, when I came to this rather alternative way of seeing thingsÂ….<br>__________________________<br>When we interact with the world and others, are we really engaging the external environment or are we really just interacting with our thoughts and ourselves?<br><br>A scenario to illustrate:<br><br>Alex sees a fat man on the street. He thinks this guy is really fat; he must be living a very fortunate life. Whether the fat guy is really living a fortunate life, we will never know. But to Alex, it is true at the moment he conjures the Â‘judgementÂ’.<br><br>My opinion is that all vision, impressions are self-arising. The Â‘externalÂ’ is because it is. The external is really not directly related with the thoughts that arise. The thoughts that arise are self-aware interpretations of the Â‘externalÂ’. Therefore all judgments must originate from within oneself. When we dislike someone, do we really dislike the person or are we disliking the image of the person that arises in the mind.<br><br>Looking outwards to include other Â‘pointsÂ’ of self-awareness/consciousness, we see that all are just consciousnesses self-awaring of themselves! This is quite hard to explain and I am not sure whether I am getting it accurately. The individual points of self-awarenessÂ’s interpretation of the external are Â‘tintedÂ’ with the karmic patternings that were inherited. They (the consciousnesses) see through their own lenses of karmic conditioning.<br><br>When viewing a single object, three individuals will have 3 different views/interpretations. But none of the views is the TRUTH. They only reflect images of the TRUTH.<br><br>SoÂ… what allows Â‘points of awareness/consciousnessÂ’ within an environment or world to Â‘understandingÂ’ one another. It is Â‘cultural conditioningÂ’ and a fairly common/standardized set of system of beliefs that binds and creates the impression of interaction. We literally live in a huge belief system, confined within our thoughts and conditions!<br><br>Looking at another level above, we see that all self-awarenesses are different Â‘angleÂ’ of ONE source focusing on different directions.<br><br></div>
