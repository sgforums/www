            <div class='col-md body'>When we actually witness real magick first hand and know it is real it is something we never forget. Getting back to candle flames <span class="small">...look at this! BB Maiya</span><br>Candle magick can be fun and it's easy to do. Here is a list of how to interpret the candle flame. Try it during your next ritual.<br><br><strong>A Strong Flame:</strong> this indicates that power and energy are going into your<br>desire for manifestation. When a figure candle is used, a strong flame<br>generally means that the person represented is winning or angry or using<br>authority over another. When two figure candles are present, the higher and<br>stronger flame represents authority over the other.<br><br><strong>A Weak Flame:</strong> this can show that you are facing heavy opposition and must<br>redo the magick several times in order to overcome the power you are facing.<br>The weak flame can also indicate, on a figure candle, that the subject is<br>losing the battle. The weak flame that goes out means that you've missed<br>your target altogether, start over.<br><br><strong>A Jumping Flame: </strong>This is an attention getter. It can indicate raw emotions<br>along with explosions of energy.<br><br><strong>Direction of flame movement: </strong><br>NORTH: On a waxing moon, something physical is manifesting.<br>EAST: something mental is manifesting.<br>SOUTH: in love matters, you can expect a steamy love affair that doesn't<br>last too long.<br>WEST: emotional aspects. A good sign of success and love. This helps you divine things by candle flame and see which way a spell is going!<br><br><strong>WAX SYMBOLS</strong><br>After a candle has finished burning, check the melted wax for any signs of symbols that may have formed. You may, for example, find some affirmation that your spell was succesful.<br><br><strong>DANCING/FLICKERING FLAME</strong><br>A dancing or flickering flame may indicate that the spellcaster is not quite clear on his/her objectives. It may also mean that bad energy is present.<br><br><strong>VIOLENT ERUPTIONS</strong><br>For a candle to hiss, spit or throw off sparks is generally a bad sign. These violent acts may mean that there is bad energy around. (Personally I think the Spirits just wanted attention -Maiya!) Also, though, it may be the opposite. You may see these eruptions as bursts of strong energy being sent out instead.<br><br><strong>BAD LUCK</strong><br>A drip of wax down the side of a candle at a seance presages bad luck or death to the person nearest to that side. <strong>Take with a pinch of salt </strong> <span class="small"> as i do not believe this at all! </span><br>It is considered bad luck to fall asleep with a candle burning. <span class="small">OOOOOOOPPS</span><br>"If a candle falls and breaks in two, double trouble will come to you!"<br><br><strong>DREAMS</strong><br>To dream of a black candle is an omen of death or illness.<br>To dream of a white candle is an omen of true love.<br>If a young woman sees two white candles in a dream it is a sign that she will soon receive a proposal of marriage<br>A red candle that appears in a dream symbolizes passion and sexual desire.<br>To dream of five candles is an omen of love and marriage.<br>To dream of a candle in a holder is an omen of a happy and prosperous future.<br>To dream of a candleholder without a candle in it foretells sorrow and misfortune.<br><br><strong>GHOSTS AND EVIL SPIRITS</strong><br>A blue light from a candle is a sign that good spirits are nearby.<br>A tall straight flame on a candle during a seance is a sign that a spirit is present.<br>In Ireland, it is an old funeral custom to light 12 candles around a corpse to protect the soul of the deceased from evil forces, for it is believed that ghosts and demons cannot cross into a circle of lighted Candles.<br>Always light candles at moments of birth, marriage and death to ensure evil spirits are kept at bay during these crucial moments.<br>Light a brown candle on the eve of Candlemas for protection against evil spirits and ghosts.<br>Place a lighted candle inside a carved-out pumpkin on All Hallows Eve to keep evil spirits and demons away.<br><br><strong>GOOD LUCK </strong><br>In Sicily, a fisherman burns ornate candles to their patron saint to obtain blessings and protection.<br>A bay-berry scented candle burned all the way down will bring "good luck to the home and gold to the pocket".<br>Light a brown candle in each room of your house on Candlemas Eve to attract good luck and keep away bad spirits.<br><br><span class="small">THANKS MAIYA;<br>A SILKY FRIEND OF MINE...<br>BLESSED BE~<br>Author: Lady Tigress</span><br></div>

Let say in a setting whereby its enclosed with no air movement at all, While doing a Candle spell, the flame still go off even without any environmental interference, why so? Its not logical but in term of Magick, i can explain that is due to the intent of the Spell, it did'nt go through so the spell has failed &amp; its not meant to be. For this i can assure you no matter how many times you relight the Candle it will still go off. the only option is for the Caster to perform &amp; restart the spell again. In term of Magick, not everything can be explained in a logical manner. As i said previously you need not be a practicioner neither a believer but its best you perceive it with a open heart rather than undermining the Wisdom of Old Ways. They would not have existed till this very Era of Technology if they are not of Validity. Again i do not seek for you to concur with me or anyone in here, as every individual in this Realm of Existence are entitled to have their own perspective in life.
