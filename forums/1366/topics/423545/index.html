Although it is called the Great Duke Jupiter, it does not represent the actual planet Jupiter. Tai Sui is an intangible star which moves directly opposite of the planet Jupiter. When translated from Chinese, the Tai Sui is known as the Yearly God. "Tai Sui" is the most powerful "Earthly God". The story of "Tai Sui" is widely spread, there are few version. One claims that he's the god of moon and another he's the warrior god. But the actual account is the god of the year. The Chinese lunar calendar has 60 years in one cycle, its formed by the Heavenly stem and Earthly branch. Therefore there are 60 "Tai Sui" in the cycle, each one dominates one single year. This is the reason Tai Sui is called the god of the year, every event that occurs during the year is under his jurisdiction. People respect him highly, and fear to offend him because it would cause misfortunes and bad luck. To avoid offending the Tai Sui of the year, people pacify and enshrine the Tai Sui of the year.<br><br>Each year, there would be a new Yearly God on duty looking after all matters on earth.

These zodiac sign are said to suffer some form of bad fortune. The negative impact differs from people to people depending on individual birth data. These zodiac sign can be determined base on the earthly branch of the year as it corresponds with the 12 Chinese zodiac sign. It can classified under offend, clash or conflict formation with the "Tai Sui".<br><br>Its a common practice &amp; age old tradition that "Tai Sui" is worshipped between the 1st and 15th day of the 1st lunar month of the year. Many people have misconception that "Tai Sui" can only be worshipped during this period however its not really true. One can actually pray to Tai Sui any day throughout the year unless you offend, clash or conflict with "Tai Sui" which you have to make special prayer or offering to "Tai Sui" known as "Age Suppression" ( Ya Tai Sui ) or "Age Praying" (Pai Tai Sui), its got to be done within 1st to 15th day of the 1st lunar month of the year.
