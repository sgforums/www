            <div class='col-md body'>Testimonial here!<br>Bought a horseshoe for luck a few days ago cos  I felt I was abit down n out in that department. Just quited my job last week and there was no news watsoever from e countless resumes I send out. U know how bloody irritating that can be when u looking for a job all over e place n no reply? They always say stuff like : We will call u.... but they never do call. Like a bad date... these pple will NEVER call u back ...EVER!<br><br>Well.... I got e horseshoe on Monday and on Tuesday I got a call to go for an interview for a local bank. I went for e interview on Wednesday and there was like a couple of rounds to it. I was down with sore throat n i thought, Gone case lah..... like that how to get e job? When I went in, I was so excited that I could have swore that I screwed up a few times.... u know..... say things u not supposed to say...... when e interview finish I thought haix.... wasted another day going for interview.... better go home sleep. Than 2 hrs later , they called n asked me go for another rd of interview today. I thought... wanna waste time or not.... than I remembered wat Oceanos said about beliving in the horse shoe's power and just let it do e rest...so in e end...just go lor.....<br><br>Ha ha...turns out when I went down today, they were rather impressed with wat they saw. In e 4 or 5 pple in e room, I was e onli one that e manager actually offered me e job on e spot n asked me go HR to get e paperwork done.<br><br>Thanks Oceanos...u real life saver... in e end, I got e job I wanted... n e pay was much better than expected... next time must meet u treat u go makan.<br>Thanks !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HI i am here to share with y'all my experiences with the products I have used and the advice given to me by Oceanos himself.<br><br>1. <strong>Charisma Oil</strong><br><br>In June of 2007 i was having a lot of problems at work. Being in the middle of office politics is not a good place to be. And it continued on to get worse, to a point where it was unbearable. So upon Oceanos strong advice i purchased the chrism oil. the results were evident on my first day of its use. On the ride the work I got a lot of " second looks" and smiles from every direction.On arrival to work things started to change the people used to single me out were actually seeking me out for advice and help. The day passed i was greet by warm smiles and sweet voices coincidence i think not. The next i was actual greeted by breakfast which was unheard of just a few days ago. My work situation continued to smooth-en out. My jokes at the morning meetings were usually meet with cold stares but now the morning meeting are filled with laughter.<br><br>2.Attraction power<br><br>upon further advice i started using the attraction powder as an addition for a person who is usually ostracized at a company function,being pulled here and there plus people fighting for your attention was behelded by my eyes in amazement. Especially when its the same people who wanted nothing to do with me.<br><br>The power in the products speaks for itself<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! Just to share my experience here.<br><br>1. Tarot Reading<br>Middle of the year, there was some reshuffling at my workplace and changes which made me feel very uneasy and worried. I went to OCEANOS for a tarot reading. From the reading, he was able to give me a clearer picture as to what was going on at my workplace, how the team members are, and how i should "tackle" them.<br><br>I was glad that i seeked his advice and truly the situation stabilised and i didnt have any major hiccups at work, and still "lieing low" and didnt get into trouble. I will continue to do that, until i seek his advice again for the coming new year, when i will be making appointment to book his yearly tarot reading again.<br><br>I strongly recommend people to this special reading because OCEANOS will be able to give you insights (from the reading) as to what's coming up in the new year, and things that we need to beware or avoid.<br><br>His reading is definitely worth a try.... and it's worth paying for  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2. Mojo Bag<br>After obtaining the protection (plus healing effect) mojo bag from OCEANOS, i do feel myself more protected. (but of coz it doesnt mean i go around stabbing people la). I should say that, the hiccups turned out to be less damaging consequences that i would have expected. As for the self healing portion, i feel that i'm not so easily affected by people emotions/opinions anymore, as i used to be. Less "emo swings"... which is better for me, because i focus less on how people think about me, etc<br><br>3. Pi xiu (hope i spelt it correct)<br>It's an item which is supposed to bring prosperity/good luck/positivity to the owner. I've been wearing it almost everyday around my neck. The day when i confirmed my order with OCEANOS, i received notification from the company that i'm awarded XXX months of variable bonus which was a pleasant delight. Though i didnt have major windfall for the rest of the year (partly because i'm not a frequent customer of Singapore Pools), i was glad that Pi Xiu was able to help me go through difficult times of my career (as mentioned in point 1 above).<br><br>I can go on and on...but i would really like to thank OCEANOS for his friendship, help, advice, sincerity. And i must say you have really made a difference in my life and i thank you for it.<br><br>Wishing all good luck &amp; health and abundance.</div>

              <p>Hi all, sorry to drop this testimonial real late, but still better than never right?</p>
              <p>I
              ordered a Coyote bag and custom blend oil from Oceanos sometime back in
              Dec 2007. Price was kinda steep (not complaining) but I go ahead and
              try rather than sit my ass off and wait for something to happen. Was
              really excited when I first held it in my hand. I could feel the energy
              when I first "talk" to my mojo bag. Hehe ...It is really strong that I
              can feel the energy moving around me. As what Oceanos always said, have
              a clear mind and just use with positive faith. =)</p>
              <p>The bag
              was amazing. I got my attention from the opposite sex, and I find it
              also easier to talk to females as well..not that I am a attention
              seeker but these days it can be hard to turn them down for dates.
              Hahaha ....Friends around are exceptionally nice to me and I don't feel
              lonely aimless anymore. Overall I feel really confident! Not only that,
              I find that it is so much easier to talk to customer, convince them and
              also I got support from my boss. I feel lucky and blessed. </p>
              <p>I
              never regret getting one.. although there are doubts in the first
              place, all were cleared. Thank you once again Oceanos for your
              patience, your guidance and your advises. Although you did not give me
              permission to ring you 24/7(just joking), but it was really nice
              talking to you! *Wink* So Oceanos, do you think I can get some solid 
              discount for my next purchase? Hahaha ...</p>

              <p>Heh alright i shall leave a more detail testimonial.</p>
              <p>Got a horseshoe from bro oceanos sometime back on April 10th, i actually got this to enhance my luck and for more opportunity to come because i recently quit my previous job. So after 2 weeks of getting the horseshoe, i went for this job interview. As to what bro oceanos had told me, he can feel that this job i am applying for got a few ppl eyeing for it. But nontheless i go ahead for it. The interviewer had actually told me to wait for one week to get back to me after the interview, but to my surprise they called me the very next day that i had got the job, and the pay is definitely better than my previous job although abit lower than i expect...</p>
              <p>And another lucky thing is that the day i went for this job interview i had actually went to buy toto as i was passing by the 7-11. I wouldn't believe my luck, that very day i strike my first toto win! but it was a small amount though, but still it was a nice feeling to have strike.</p>
              <p>well hope the horseshoe can continue to give me luck!! cheers~</p>
