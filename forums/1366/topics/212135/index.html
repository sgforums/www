For instance, in Greek Atlas, Â‘AÂ’, meaning Â‘The one who could not withstandÂ’ and Â‘tlasÂ’ meaning Â‘The SkiesÂ’. Atlas was the mythical God, referred as the Â‘Pillar of HeavenÂ’ that is its support. When Atlas became overburdened with too much for him, the skies fell down, burying Atlantis.<br><br>The words Â‘AtlasÂ’ and Â‘AtlantisÂ’ originally come from Sanskrit, Â‘The Holy Language of IndiaÂ’. The Sanskrit name for their Hell is Â‘AtalaÂ’, meaning Â‘Deprived of PillarÂ’, Â‘BottomlessÂ’ or more preferably Â‘Sunken to BottomÂ’.<br><br>~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~  is a gateway to the Magickal Realm.

A Philosophy we uphold as we all are born of Divine Radiant Pure Light, Awakening begin with awareness of our purpose for being upon this earth, and proceed to act upon it in relation to the other beings and purposes encountered along our Path. It is a process of becoming cosmically aware; it is driven by need &amp; environing cosmic circumstance to develop love-wisdom and both these words are descriptive and expressive of the consciousness aspect. Love is response to contact and this - in the human being - means understanding, inclusiveness and identification. Wisdom connotes skill in action as the result of developed love &amp; the light of understanding; it is awareness of requirements &amp; ability to bring together into a fused relationship the need &amp; that which will meet it. Awareness of that relation to other beings and larger purposes renews the cycle of action. We act to enhance the harmony of our relationships with the many brings of the living Earth, and to pursues the purpose of spiritual growth.<br><br>~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ was created to be an Establishment, Platform, Organisation and Point of focus for Magickal Work, Light Work &amp; Spiritual growth.

            <div class='col-md body'>I bought a few products from Oceanos during the past 1 year:-<br><br>1.	Rabbit Foot :-  I won lucky draw and 4D within 1 month of wearing it!  The rabbit foot practically pays for itself!  Even attract people whom I am not close to, giving me Ang Bao and Presents! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>2.	Mojo Bag :-  Oceanos recommended me to buy this when I met him for the very first time (consultation).  But I was too occupied by something else to listen to him.  I regret not listening to him because now I think itÂ’s an extremely good investment and I should have gotten it EARLIER!  I just upgraded it recently for protection and I feel more protected than ever carrying it with me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>3.	Prosperity Money Drawing :-  I bought this for my parentsÂ’ business Â‘coz they were not doing well initially.  My 1st bottle trial:- my parentsÂ’ business really improved by at least 30%!  After I purchased the 2nd bottle, my parents manage to win lottery!  My parents who are skeptical about such new age stuffs are now prepared to buy the 3rd bottle and many more in future (I sponsor the previous 2 bottles in the past  :-P).<br><br>I also attended one of OceanosÂ’ workshops on introduction to magick and initiation.  It was a real eye/mind/sense Â– opening experience.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  I felt extremely blessed after the workshop.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me see...<br>I've chanced upon this haven around 4 months ago.. quite skeptical about such new age stuffs and things that couldnt be explained by sciences.<br><br>Here's my honest feedback:<br><br>a) Had two tarot consultations with OCEANOS. His reading were very accurate and until now (at times) i am still very amazed with the accuracy of his readings. Through the tarot sessions, i managed to find directions and answers to the questions in my life and i'm glad and thankful to know OCEANOS.<br><br>b) Recently got my mojo bag for protection and healing; regretted not heeding his advice to get one earlier. Partly because i felt it was pricey, come to think of it, it's a long term investment. The mojo was strong and very much alive.. vibrant. Thanks OCEANOS!!<br><br>c) Healing session: Just had one earlier when i met him. I never quite believe in the effects of healing because my chakras are always blocked and i could never focus and let go. After just now, i felt much better, having to release alot of the negativities and bad energies in me.<br><br>d) Love Gypsy honey: Bought a bottle and thought it was fun. I felt more "attractive" and increased self-confidence. I do feel that i get second glances from people when i used the honey. Not just to opposite gender but also people around me, colleagues/ friends; i feel that communication and rapport is better and find myself more approachable....<br><br>Would definitely continue to support OCEANOS, and his haven.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, thought it'd be nice to share with you abt the effects of the mojo i got a week ago.<br><br>The mojo bag is meant for healing, protection and joy.<br><br>I used to be very easily swayed by my inner thoughts and get quite moody, and it affects my day alot. I also get affected by other people's reaction and their attitudes/ behaviour towards me.<br><br>But after getting the mojo bag, i felt more peaceful, and less emotional fluctuation. Basically quite at peace with my thoughts, mind.<br><br>Also, i get over unpleasantness easier and "forgive-forget" faster which makes me feel "lighter".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: violet;">A Glorious and Starry Evening to all,<br>A testimonial submitted in regards to the Fire Phoniex Ritual,<br>I initially quitted my job in October due to some issues within the family and was unable to secure a job for about a month despite going for numerous interviews and sending out tons upon tons of resume. Oceanos was kind enough to let me know about the ritual and suggested that I can use it to help me manifest my hopes of getting a job. 2 days after the ritual ,I went for an interview feeling rejuvenated and confident. In fact, things keep happening for me. The interview was supposed to be conducted by 2 persons but within 2 minutes of me entering the room, the guy had to leave the room to answer a phone call and never came back while my interview was being carried out. Besides that, there was an abudance of opportunites that came my way. The last couple of days was packed with interviews...in fact ,I was supposed to have an interview on Saturday and Monday, but now there is no need to. Thanks Oceanos again for his help and guidance.</span></div>

I'm now waiting for my kit to 'appear' soon so that I can start to collect some interest from the banks!<br><br>Thanks Oceanos.<br><br>P/S: Now that i've done my feedback, will I get a VIP card for discounts?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just quitted my previous job on the 16th of january 2007 as i am overworked and underpaid there. I been sending out resumes since then but no luck, i hope to get a new job confirmation before the Lunar New Year so i seek some advices from Oceanos and booked a tarot session with him on the 4th of february 2007. The session with him was very comfortable and he is able to provide insightful details and advices pertaining to the queries i have not only just about my career. For my career, i asked him if it is possible for me to get a new job that i like with the salary i seek before the Lunar New Year. He told me i can only get a job in March. I asked him if it is possible to hasten it and create more opportunities so i may get a new job as fast as possible as i do have family commitments.<br><br>Oceanos recommended me to get a "Santeria Voodoo Orisha Ogun Spellkit", he said Orisha Ogun has the power to remove any obstacles, smoothen my path, create opportunities and employment for my career.<br><br>I decided to get the spellkit on the 5th of february, so i placed an order and collect the spellkit to be cast on the 6th of february. The Spellkit comes with all the items needed except the offerings to the Orisha Ogun. He instructed me to make some offerings of cherries, rum and meat to Ogun. There is a special Orisha Ogun candle that is Fixed by Voodoo Master in the spellkit. I am told to let it burn out, there will be a charm inside when all is burn out, its a gift from the Orisha. I am to wear or carry this charm with me daily and when i go for interviews. He told me i will get positive result on the 7th or 9th day after i cast the spell.<br><br>3rd day after i casted the spell, i got some appointments for job interviews. True enough on the 9th day, 15th of february, i got a call from a company i went interview that i got the job. I am very happy about it so i called Oceanos to share with him the good news. This job pay is much higher than my previous job and very close to the amount of salary i seek when i made my request to Orisha Ogun. I managed to get a new job confirmation three days  before Lunar New Year. To me that is a very good start for the year. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Oceanos instructed me to make another offering to Orisha Ogun to thank him.<br><br>Thank you Oceanos for all your help and guidance. Will definitely continue to support LOA products, services and events.<br><br>Joel Lee, 22nd February 2007</div>
