              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>My LOA in here is only a platform of awareness for all. I am running it at the expense of my free time together with my moderators which perhaps many of you in here do not understand. To some this is leisure or just to pass time, as for myself, i do not have much time for myself literally but i take extra effort to make here comfy for those who are interested in New Age, Metaphysics &amp; Magick to come in to share with others. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>As for all the free complimentary services, help/aid/answers i provide in here i do out of goodwill with no benefits at all, also no obligations at all. If there is a need for anyone to engage my services or buy my products, my pricelist is always available. I got overhead too, office premise &amp; warehouse to upkeep &amp; other miscelleanous expenses. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>It is always good to have healthy discussion once in awhile however i reserved the right to answer any of the questions posed upon my sole-discretion, there is no obligation at all unless it is a booked consultation appointment with me, engagement of my other services or workshops.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>I am neither interested in discussing nor teaching fundamental history &amp; system of any Spiritual practices. I will only reply to whichever i feel is appropriate &amp; beneficial for the interest of all in here.</strong></span>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Merry Meet Caitaokue,</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>I have already replied your questions on Mahatma in my previous post. Mahatma energy is of fine &amp; high frequency, it's energy flow is faster than "Usui Reiki". I will not answer further question on this as you are not my student. Mahatma Attunement is exclusive &amp; only solely available under my LOA.  </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Curses are not just a belief, it is a fact. Curses can be placed on any creatures, human, objects or spaces etc. There are many kinds of curses, not necessarily it is only targeted to specific individual energy. Some  strong potent curses can be placed on the whole family, it will pass on from generation to generation until there no survivor. when someone is born into a family or someone that is married into the family is also a work of Karmic ties, the link is there be it blood related or not. Depending on the nature of the curse, it will also affect them, be it husband to wife, grandfather to grandchildren. A Curse is not like a Hex or Spell as i explained previously. Please take time to read &amp; digest my replies before posing any question.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The Term "Javanese Magic" is very wide &amp; generic, it comprises of different practices, systems of magic including folk magic. Their origin is definitely different, as with all kinds of Spiritual practices, it is not meant to disclosed to outsiders. Firstly you got to understand Spiritual practices as such is not open to the masses, It is a traditional practice of secrecy.  Anyone that is initiated into a specific Spiritual tradition they are often expected to keep certain things secret. In many Western Mystical traditions the words "to ever keep secret and never reveal" forms part of their initiation vow &amp; law that preside it. </strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>As i stated previously, I do understand your interest &amp; inquisitive nature.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>It is always good to have healthy discussion once in awhile however i reserved the right to answer any of the questions posed upon my sole-discretion, there is no obligation at all unless it is a booked consultation appointment with me, engagement of my other services or workshops.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>I am not splashing cold water or whatsoever, there is no need for you to back off. Any healthy discussion would require an appropriate topic or subject. I will only reply to whichever i feel is appropriate &amp; beneficial for the interest of all in here, there is no obligation at all. The point of having a discussion is not only solely for your own interest if not it would defeat the whole purpose. My LOA in here is only a platform of awareness for all. I am running it at the expense of my free time which perhaps many of you in here do not understand. To some this is leisure,  just to pass time or have fun, as for myself, i do not have much time for myself literally but i take extra effort to make here comfy for those who are interested in New Age, Metaphysics &amp; Magick to come in to share with others. I need everyone co-operation to make this place better. It is also our duty to ensure the validity of whatever informations shared to our best knowlege, protect the interest of all users in this platform of awareness.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Merry Meet Caitaokue,</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Well everyone are welcome to my LOA as long as they come with perfect love, trust &amp; faith. None of my words or actions deter you or anyone from coming to my forum. My LOA has been around long enough to create awareness of coz creating greater awareness is positive. No worries, nobody is wasting anyone's time. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>As i stated my ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~  is a fully functioning Establishment, We strive to make it your Number One Stop Resource &amp; Platform for Metaphysical, Witchcraft, Pagan, Spell Crafts, Voodoo, Hoodoo, New Age supplies &amp; services. I do not provide free consultation but from time to time, there will some complimentary services provide by me or my moderators available in here.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>ANCIENT ART OF FACE READING ~ FREE MOLE ANALYSIS BY OCEANOS is currently available. This LOA Complimentary Service is provided by Oceanos as a gesture of goodwill for your support of ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~. </strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Everyone is free to seek my guidance or advice, if it is within my means i will try to help. However if it is related to my LOA Services or Products, charges applies.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">In Life when things are free sometimes there is no meaning &amp; neither will it be cherished<br><br>Its energy exchange not as in profit as what i do is Spiritual Works &amp; Guidance. I render energy to teach &amp; guide you, you give me monetary fee as exchange. In short, the main purpose of energy exchange fee is to cut the link between me &amp; my client/student so that after the Services it will not affect me or my client/Student as there is a fair exchange. If it is free, there is no fair exchange, its neither good for me or you as you will owe me something due to it &amp; there will be a link which can result in Karma debt. If Everything is Free then no one will get salary for their job, You do your part as an employee in a company &amp; end of the day, the company pay you, this is obviously a fair exchange.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Thanks again.</strong></span></p>
