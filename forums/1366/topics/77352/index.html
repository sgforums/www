You are absolutely the sweetest person anyone could know. Just for some reason you feel so alone and like people can't really appreciate who are and use your kindness as weakness. You are very deep and well versed with things. You love reading and spending time to yourself trying to figure out more about who you are and about the world around you.

You aren't about over doing it and being unnatural. Things just seem to come to you naturally. Whether it's friends relationships being cute ;-) anything is very easy to you. But some people think you are lazy where things come naturally easy to you. In reality you are a very hard worker. So there are those who are jealous of who you are but you don't let them bring you down. Since you aren't fake and know how to be yourself. Honesty and being true are the things that make your personality shine the most. Also you are the most real person anyone could know. In your down time you like just relaxing and enjoying your surroundings like maybe a nice trip to the beach to soak up some sun. =)</div>

You are a wild one parties parties and more parties. You are a regular social butterfly and have so many friends you couldn't even begin to name them all. You have a quick temper and if someone makes you mad you let them know. If someone doesn't like who you are you tell them off and just go back to being you or even stealing that person's man if they have one. Several are jealous of you but that only makes you be even more sexy. You strive to be the best and when you show up everybody has to know you are there and ready to have fun. You are also very care free but what makes you cute is the fact you are sweet when you want to be and like to try to be innocent. Your rules be sexy, straight up with people and have fun no matter what.</span></div>
