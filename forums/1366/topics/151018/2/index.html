It is an<br>earth sign, which is a grounded sign...which is wonderful for almost all<br>about. Earth signs are the most productive of all signs, when people<br>become very fixated on many work and project related facets of their<br>lives but it does not have an edge of workaholic to it, which is a<br>perfect balance.<br><br>This sign does well for all of us, no matter WHERE in the moon cycle it<br>falls. In the waxing moon, it helps us to get active and focused,<br>harnessing the energy of the moon as well as the sign for a double<br>whammy. During the waning moon, it helps us to stay steadfast in<br>cleaning up projects and such - rather than becoming listless as many of us do, during the waning moon.<br><br>MAGIC DURING THIS MOON: Grounding spells are wonderful during this moon. Use orange candles, especially geared towards career and success and pair it with patchouli. This is a good moon time to also do various earthy things...like look at seed books, do garden planning, or dig out weeds. Another good grounding ritual to consider is to smudge your home, garden and/or workshops - even your workspace (if you can).<br></span></strong></div>

The White Swan is also associated with the White Ghost or the White Phantom - Gwenhwyvar.   To the Celts, the Autumn Equinox is a time when the light will eventually give up its hold to the darkness, but for a brief moment all is in balance.  The light and the dark hold equal positions.

This time represents the powers of earth and resurrection. Grapes are said to be the tree of joy, exhilaration and wrath. The leaves can be boiled and stuffed like cabbage.In areas where grapes do not grow, the blackberry reigns.The ripened fruits of the blackberry are edible and quite tasty. The dried leaves can be made into tea which strengthens the female reproductive system, and the young shoots are edible and can be used in salads. Blackberry picking is now the last ritualistic seasonal collecting of wild plant food still practiced in industrialized Europe. The root produces an orange dye.<br><br><span class="large">Celtic Astrology</span><br><br>They are the instinctive organizers of life always ahead of the field when it comes to contingency plans, and it is a great mistake to underestimate them. For People born in the first two weeks: Their emotions and energies are more openly expressed. Their week points are related to the inherent imbalance of the sign, an inability to come to terms with certain aspects of their lives. Their positive traits are shown with their natural enthusiasm and support of partners. For people born during the last two weeks under the waning aspect of the full moon this imbalance is corrected at the time of the Autumnal Equinox and they have the ability to forgive with true compassion. They are, however, rather more difficult to comprehend and are prone to over-indulge their sensuous nature. Generally speaking, people born under this sign can help to create harmony and stability, but they can also become some-what parasitical or totally dependant on the good nature of others.</span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

Different Values.<br><br>Sagittarius - Poor, both will go different ways.<br><br>Capricorn - One of your best Signs.<br><br>Aquarius - Could be a kooky relationship.<br><br>Pisces - 50-50 chance<br><br>What You're Really Like -<br><br>Flying high with Mercury, you're above it all.<br>You're the epitome of aloofness. And though you<br>seem like you're a cold marble statue, there are<br>plenty of human feelings swirling around that<br>placid exterior. Your trouble is, your head rules<br>and not your heart. Torrid expressions of love<br>are not your style. You feel you're above it<br>all. And you can turn off many a propective mate<br>just because you come on this way. Yet once<br>someone gets to know you, they find that you're<br>fond of knocking yourself. You love to rip<br>yourself apart. Then you start analyzing whoever<br>else is around you. But it all comes to naught,<br>because you can't supply solutions to your own<br>problems. You've got an amazing retentive mind,<br>but can never make it up. Only when it comes to<br>perfection do you drive yourself without end.<br>And though you may wind up with 100%, down deep<br>you punch yourself because you didn't make it<br>101%. It's this rigid code that you also apply<br>to others and consequently very few people will<br>measure up.<br><br>Order is your word. And you can just reel off<br>fact after fact after fact on anything from who<br>went out with whom four months ago, to how much<br>nutmeg to use in some obscure recipe for cake.<br>The trouble is, much of your information is<br>amusingly trivial.<br><br>If you're the gal, you're the type with the<br>quiet elegant fashions; and the finest quality.<br>You also love cooking, but none of that instant<br>mix for you. And if you're the male, you'd rather<br>spend your time pulling apart a car than getting<br>pulled apart by phonies at a party.<br>Remember, from your vantage point way up there,<br>you can tell who's real and who's not.<br><br>Your Love Life -<br><br>No hearts and flowers scene for you, you're above<br>it. So the guy or gal you finally settle on will<br>have more of an intellectual appeal than emotional.<br>You'd rather sit around discussing a good book<br>than swoon over some romantic movie.<br>Though marriage has an even chance of coming to<br>you either early or late, it makes no real<br>difference to you. Your love of travel is also<br>a great factor in your love life. It could keep<br>you out of a permanent arrangement for many many years.<br>But when you finally do settle down, you'll throw<br>yourself wholeheartedly into your household. And<br>a well ordered household it'll be. Whoever gets<br>you will be a lucky individual; after all, a<br>home perfectly kept is the best of blessings.<br><br>Your Future -<br><br>On the wings of Mercury you can go anywhere. And<br>though success will come, very often it won't be<br>because you had anything to do with it.<br>Though jobs will be plentiful, they'll never be<br>your life; there's not enough money in the world<br>for you to be saddled with a 9 to 5 job.<br>Intellectualism is the key. Research or science<br>or education would be your better fields. These<br>offer you the chance to travel and the chance to<br>study.<br><br>Your critical nature makes you a natural for the<br>theater or the art circles, while your love of the<br>detail makes you a cinch for jobs dealings with<br>math (like engineering). Design will also be<br>quite stimulating and fashion is more than<br>appealing to you. You're probably wind up living<br>in the city because of the lure of the arts; but<br>weekends in the country are what you need to<br>refresh yourself and put you back in the spirit<br>of things.<br><br>You've got the wings Virgo and you can fly to any<br>height you want.</span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

You're anything but practical.<br>You may give the impression of being a softie, but<br>your sign holds sway over half of the signs in the<br>zodiac.

In fact, things usually turn out rather well<br>because you need to be with people. So you quickly<br>pull out of it.<br><br>But, when things don't go well; you're out for justice.<br>Revenge. Days, weeks, months, even years may go by,<br>but eventually you'll get even with whomever or<br>whatever upset your balance in the first place.<br>It's the same passion fir justice that leads you<br>to a penchant for neatness. Everything's got to be<br>ship-shape or you ship out (or ship for someone<br>else out).<br><br>And while you're busily seeing that everything is<br>clean, you're apt to forget many of the other<br>important tasks you've got. But it will never<br>interfere with your basic likability. You're<br>always the first to go along with the crowd, and<br>also one of its big morale boosters.<br>Yet when it comes to important decisions you<br>weigh all the evidence very carefully. After all,<br>justice isn't blind when you've got anything to<br>do with it. While not neccessarily a devotee of<br>the great outdoors, you enjoy nature. A long<br>walk in the park or woods, working in the garden,<br>a family picnic are the type of activity apt to<br>give you a great deal of pleasure.<br><br>Your Love Life -<br><br>You can't take the fights and quarrels that<br>usually accompany the average love affair. So<br>you more than often try to stay away from<br>getting tangled up in emotional relationships.<br>You'd love to be in love, but it's got to be<br>beautiful or else forget it. That's why you marry<br>later than most of your friends.<br><br>You're the type pf person always ready to give<br>your mate the benefit of the doubt. You're not<br>likely to quarrel over little things. This sense<br>of fair play gives you the potential to be a<br>better than average spouse. Marriage is likely<br>to be a very happy affair if you find a partner<br>who meets you halfway.<br><br>Your Future -<br><br>You're a procrastinator.

Especially for your home life.<br><br>What You're Really Like -<br><br>Being a child of Mars, you've inherited his traits.<br>You're throughly energetic and very high strung.<br>Anything can set you off at anytime.<br>This energy ignites all around you; and anything<br>can be yours. Action is your word and you've got<br>all the fire to set it in motion. But you're also<br>a water sign, and the water comes in handy in<br>putting out some of that fire when it gets too out<br>of hand. So you're in control all the time.<br>Without the water. you could burn yourself out.<br>For instance, chances are that you'll just keep<br>at a project until you finish it (even though the<br>world could be collasping around you, you won't<br>notice).<br><br>That's concentration for you!<br>It's the same determination that puts you on all<br>those committees and social activities. Your<br>trouble is that you come on like a Wellsian<br>Martian trying to rule the world.<br>Being so outgoing can be a tremendous asset, but<br>it can also scare people off. If they knew how<br>lonely you are, maybe they'd understand.<br>But you'll never let them know. Mars is a soldier,<br>and soldiers bear wounds bravely.<br>This also explains the fact that for all the<br>aquaintances you have, you don't have close<br>friends. Your compensation for this self-imposed<br>isolation is achieving your goals. A pat on the<br>back from your boss or a mark or commendation<br>from your teacher is all the consolation you<br>need.<br><br>You Martian boys will be highly athletic. Soldiers<br>have to be in tip-top condition; so when summer<br>comes your physique really shines.<br>Martian girls are in the whirl. You're the spark<br>in your crowd. You have quite a build and look<br>fantantastic in your bikinis. But dieting is the<br>necessary thing if you want to stay that way.<br>You're like the Irving Berlin song "After You<br>Get What You Want You Don't Want It, If They<br>Gave You The Moon, You'd Grow Tired Of it Soon".<br><br>Your Love Life -<br><br>Meeting Scorpio can mean trouble to some signs<br>because Scorpio rules half of the Zodiac. In fact,<br>if you're a Scorpio girl, you'll be the one to<br>make the first move and arrange all these romantic<br>little get togethers. But you can easily frighten<br>away a shy male. Scorpio males are the same way.<br>Girls melt before your flame. And many times you<br>even burn them up (that's a sure way of getting<br>your flame put out when you least expect it).<br>Yet when you finally meet the person for you, no<br>one else will shine in your eyes. You'll be<br>intensely loyal and never for a moment will<br>your mate have to doubt you.<br><br>Your Future -<br><br>You can go higher than the heavens if you just<br>don't get trapped by your own self-doubts. Riches,<br>fame - they're all yours if you can keep your<br>energy from burning you up before you get them.<br>You can make it big in the arts and sciences, but<br>because half of you is water and the other half<br>is fire it will take you a while before you hit<br>your peak of success. Let others fall by the<br>wayside, you'll be shooting straight for the top.<br>Forget the rut of a 9 to 5, you've got your sights<br>set on more than that.<br><br>Then, once you've got success, you're flying off<br>to the next challenge. You'll never sit still,<br>after all, fires always spread and consume all<br>around them. When you settle down you'll make<br>your home in the city because that's where the<br>bright lights are. Yet you'll try to have a place<br>by a lake or the ocean so you can satify your<br>latter half.<br><br>Remember Scorpio, let your energy burn, don't let<br>it rage, and keep it well under control, you want<br>to conquer the world, not make it a cinder.</span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>
