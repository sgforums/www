The honest one, the<br>wise one.<br><br>Especially helpful is your ruling planet Jupiter<br>(It means, money, money, money) Your fire helps<br>to keep you barreling along.<br><br>You're the smart one in your crowd, and you use<br>your brains to get what you want (but you've<br>always got that bow and arrow ready).<br><br>You're out to have the best time of your life<br>and people who bog you down, you shoot down.<br>You're always ready when adventure calls, and<br>there's probably nothing. You'd like nothing<br>better to do than to go exploring (for anything<br>from the newest, grooviest night spot to the<br>wilest, most remote hunting lands). You go where<br>the action is thickest and run into the thick<br>of that.<br><br>And you're lucky; everything turns you on. You<br>love parties because your energy lights the<br>crowd. Exotic foods? Great! Discovering a new<br>dish is like discovering a new continet.<br>Both Sagittarius males and females love way-out<br>clothes. You're the fashion plate. You can't<br>feel completely yourself unless you're dressed<br>to kill.<br><br>Most of all, you must have a philosophy to live<br>by. Your outlook is generally optimistic and you<br>detest hypocrisy.

Lust for life and expansion of the boundaries of pleasure are supported now. Love is about expanding limits here. We may give up some of the comfortable patterns of the past and risk relationship safety for new levels of experience. Love needs to grow now; it will not stand still.<br><br>Travel, learning and a taste for all that's foreign may be heightened. It's hard to stick to the old routine when the planet of pleasure hits the road. This desire for the new and exotic may reveal some weakness of judgment. Purchases are more likely made with joyful abandon rather than with an eye on long-term value. People, too, can be overrated, particularly if they offer the promise of adventure or enlightenment.<br><br>Among those born with Venus in Sagittarius are spiritual teachers Sai Baba, Paramhansa Yogananda, Alan Watts, Albert Schweitzer and Deepak Chopra. Rockers David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Tina Turner and Pete Townsend have Venus in Sag, as do both Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel.<br><br>Quite a number of writers were born with the planet of the arts in this literary sign. Art Buchwald, Lewis Carroll, Kurt Vonnegut and Mark Twain were some who wrote from a humorous perspective. Political figures with Venus in Sagittarius include Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher from England's Conservative Party, and Russians Boris Yeltsin, Joseph Stalin and Alexander Solzhenitsyn.<br><br>Finally, we must thank Venus in Sagittarius for her great sense of humor. Two contemporary examples of Venus in Sag's "almost anything goes" comedy are the free-spirited Whoopi Goldberg and Roseanne. Laughter lifts our spirits, opens the heart and shows us the limitless boundaries of joy symbolized by Venus in Sagittarius.<br><br>Venus<br>Venus is the planet of love, beauty, pleasure, relationships and attraction. It is associated with the signs of Taurus and Libra.<br><br>Venus describes what we like and what we need to be liked for. It is, therefore, a key to partnerships, particularly personal ones. A venusian person is pleasant, gracious and socially skilled. She has good taste and a strong desire for harmony.<br><br>Self-worth is also connected with Venus. To a certain extent, our value to other people will be reflected through Venus' sign and house placement in the natal chart.<br><br>Sagittarius<br>Sagittarius, ruled by Jupiter, hungers for experience, quests for knowledge and wrestles with idealism.<br><br>Exuberant, optimistic and fun loving, Sagittarians are gregarious and social by nature. They love good conversation. Unfortunately, when this gift of gab collides with their need to tell their whole truth, Sagittarians often say more than they have to. Yet, these communication blunders spark laughter more than argument. At the core, Sagittarius is the sign where we strive to integrate and synthesize our seemingly dual nature. Symbolized by the centaur, Sagittarius embodies the struggle to integrate the human condition-and all of its appetites-with the longing to experience our divine origins.  </span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>
