It heralds the end of Summer and nearing of the harvest. The origin of its name has become lost over time but among European and Middle Eastern mythology, Virgo has always been a symbol of fertility and a representation of the production of crops. Even in prehistoric times, this Zodiac Sign was perceived as both a mother and a virgin. According to some astrological sources, Virgo's original symbol was the Sphinx...mythological poser of riddles...and, indeed, those governed by Virgo are prone to question, turning inward in order to seek larger meanings about causes and purposes in life. Some sources maintain that Virgo began as The Great Mother, a Sumerian Corn Goddess, while in Egypt, she was Nidaba, Goddess of Grain, whose harvest begain when the Moon was in her constellation. In medieval times, Virgo was associated with the Virgin Mary. However, in most depictions, Virgo holds sheaves of wheat or an ear of corn, emphasizing her role as a Goddess of Fertility and Agriculture. Occasionally portrayed as bearing flowers, this image may be a reference to Mi, her Babylonian name, which means "cluster of flowers." Virgo natives seek complete realization of the mind, being logical, practical and methodical with an intellect which subrogates the instinct. This is an unassuming Sign, but one which rules hard-working individuals who are prepared to serve unflinchingly and give of their hearts. Those born under the Sign of Virgo should strive to expand their perspective beyond details...to see the larger order and underlying pattern of creation. Thus, those who accomplish this will know the goals worthy of service and learn how to temper intellect with reverence. </span><br><br><img src="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/virgoverse.jpg"><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/virgoglyph.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">The symbol...or glyph...of Virgo is said to be connected to the Immaculate Conception of the Messiah and marks out the letter "M" or the letters "MV" ( for "Maria Virgo" or "Virgin Mary" ). It is generally assumed to have originated from the star Spica found in the constellation of Virgo and is indicative of female virginity. In Vedic Astrology, this glyph is perceived as being comprised of three vertical lines and another which crosses and joins the uppermost portions. These three lines are said to be representative of the powers of nature acting within the media of time and space, symbolic of action, inertia and harmony. The additional line which crosses and joins is believed to create tension...the struggle of the Spirit in its natural evolution.<br><br>Also known as the Sign of the Craftsman or Critic, Virgo is Negative in polarity (as are Taurus, Cancer, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces). The general characteristics of Negative Signs lean toward introversion and prefer to draw upon personal resources rather than look for external stimuli. Such individuals are naturally more receptive, sensitive and nurturing than are the Zodiac Signs of Positive polarity (Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius). However, Negative Signs are also likely to be much more cautious, retiring and standoffish than their Positive counterparts with a tendency to keep personal feelings under tight control. Taurus is the most introverted of the Negative Signs (with Virgo a close second).<br><br>All Zodiac Signs governed by the Elements of Earth and Water are considered to be Feminine in nature. Thus, Virgo (ruled by earth) is considered Feminine (as are Taurus, Cancer, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces). Feminine Signs are traditionally conceived as being more receptive and less active than their Masculine counterparts which are ruled by the Elements of Fire and Air (the Zodiac Signs of Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius). Feminine Signs focus primarily on the emotional and material world with particular attention to sensitivity and depth of feeling. Feminine Signs are said to be noctural or night-oriented. Therefore, the term "feminine" should be viewed in the same light as the Yin (or dark) Polarity of the Tao.<br><br>Virgo is the natural ruler of the Sixth House of the Zodiac, commonly referred to as the "House of Service, Work and Health" and known in Vedic Astrology as the "Evil Fortune." It signfies the health and strength of individuals as they develop along the path to adulthood, including the personal respect and degree of care a person gives to their body. This House also governs individuals who fall under the care of others but are not relations or kin...servants and employees, for example. It deals with what happens when an individual is called upon to render service and care. It is also the House concerned with family pets and all domesticated animals...particularly the health and well-being of such creatures. The Sixth House is associated with work ethic and the measure of personal integrity as useful and productive citizens of the world. Within the Sixth House is found the rhythm of an individual's day...the side of a person that decides how he or she would like things to transpire over the coming twenty-four hours...the side which plans a personal schedule. In short, the Sixth House presides over the manner in which humankind functions and is governed by the Planet Mercury (also Planetary Ruler of the Third House).<br><br>The opposite sign to Virgo is Pisces. From Pisces, Virgo can learn to let go and swim with the current, freely utilizing the inherent fertile imagination. Thus, can Virgo natives learn to accept human imperfections.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits: modest, shy, meticulous, tidy, reliable, practical, diligent, analytical and intelligent<br><br>Negative Traits: fussy, hypercritical, harsh, conservative, overly-fastidious, overly-conventional, finicky, a perfectionist and a worrier<br><br>Likes: lists, hygiene, order, detail, precision, wholesomeness, health foods and perfection (even in minutiae)<br><br>Dislikes: squalor, uncertainty, health hazards, sloppy workers and anything deemed to be sordid</span> </span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

Individuals ruled by this Sign are the servants, custodians and perfecters of culture, in search of complete realization of the mind. They are logical, practical and methodical, possessing a strong sense of order and organization, coupled with a love of technological advances and anything associated with the state of the art. Virgo natives have a tendency to allow their intellect to subrogate their instincts, but they are theorists and masters of extrapolation and deduction. In short, those governed by this Sign of the Zodiac are nothing short of perfectionists. They want their environments, as well as their lives, to be neat and tidy. They excel in sorting the "wheat from the chaff" and delight in planning, sorting, classifying and storing. Usually very serious individuals, Virgo subjects are indefatigable workers with a strong sense of duty. Their need to serve and be useful is so strong, that they often suffer greatly when such is thwarted. This characteristic, together with the inherent capacity for critical insight, makes for adept healers. However, because Virgo individuals are frequently blessed with superb manual skills, they also make for fine technicians. Those governed by this Sign possess an innate refinement, but there is also a nervous sensitivity here. These are worriers who are prone to pronounced mood swings. Virgo natives may pose large questions but usually refuse to take large risks. Cautious and conservative, they prefer small-scale plans to grand strategies. Subjects of this Sign are rooted in the present and amenable to change only after meticulous forethought. In short, they will not willingly court disappointment.<br><br>Virgo natives search constantly for worthy goals to pursue. Self-perfecting individuals, who are punctual and reliable, those ruled by this Sign frequently reside alone, feeling that nobody could possibly wish to live with someone who is not yet perfect enough. In addition, they are often their own worst critics and aim for the highest standards. There is an innate sense here to quickly discern when something is amiss and there will be no rest for anyone until order has been restored. Virgo individuals tend to "nag" somewhat, but that is truly only an indication of the affection these natives have for the object of their "nagging." Basically shy and modest, those governed by this Sign are prone to hide their deep sensuality behind a rather cool and critical exterior. Nonetheless, these are friendly souls...albeit somewhat reserved and thoughtful...who can display flashes of gregariousness and are attractive to the opposite sex. Virgo is the sign of abundance, but its natives always appear to have to work hard to attain it. They are excellent organizers who like to keep lists, collect meticulous details and are often "faddy" regarding food. There is also a tendency to worry about health. Being superbly adaptable, Virgo natives can turn their hand to almost anything and may easily become skilled to masterly levels. However, the typical Virgo is likely to work incognito. Over and above any other Zodiac Sign, it is probably those who governed by Virgo who insist upon being treated with respect. They admire dignity and itellect, and the surest way to win the esteem and confidence of these individuals is to pay court to their intelligence. Blessed with a fine sense of honor, they will never betray a trust but are adept at discovering disagreeable facts and will not be averse to divulging them...particularly if there is a personal point to be gained. Once a Virgo native looses confidence in another, it is hard for that individual to regain it.<br><br>Although possessed with the ability to sum up a situation or person at a glance, Virgo subjects are likely to keep their own counsel. Those who are well-acquainted with Virgo natives will love them for their fairness, but to those who will never come close to knowing the Virgo subject, he or she will always remain an enigma...a man or woman of mystery. The basic outlook here is slanted toward practical considerations in every facet of daily life. Hidden beneath the quiet and modest surface, however, is a deep-seated desire for emotional expression of an intensely dramatic nature. Thus, Virgo individuals who participate in the Arts...particularly the theater...find immense happiness and release in this outlet for their inner selves. Capable of generous and unselfish friendships, those ruled by Virgo are apt to withdraw within themselves on occasions and leave others guessing. Some people may be frightened by the inherent Virgo tendency to fault-find, but these natives can also give praise and their judgment is usually highly valued. Virgo natives are generally mild-tempered souls, but can be fussy and fretful about minor irritations and may inwardly seethe over major ones.<br><br>Travel is inevitable for Virgo natives, given that Mercury is their "guiding star." Indeed, there are probably more Virgo subjects far from their native habitat than can be found in any other Sign. Thus, these individuals tend to do well in any career which takes them abroad and away from their homelands. Nevertheless, there will always remain a romantic love for the country of birth. On the surface at least, those governed by this Sign may well be perceived as the most calm and level-headed of the Zodiac as well as being the most likely to react quickly to danger. Most individuals ruled by Virgo are by nature acquisitve, gathering possessions and money, and saving hard for a rainy day. Impeccable, methodical, studious and quick to learn, Virgo natives should follow their star by being true to themselves in all things. To attain true happiness, they should never settle for second best.<br><br>At their most negative, Virgo natives can be pessimistic, depressed or even destructive. They are blessed with powerful creative drives, but such drives are often handicapped by the need to control and perfect. At worst, the inherent order-loving nature can make them cold, introverted, punctilious, moralistic, overly fastidious, compulsive about personal health and cleanliness, obsessed with organization and mired in petty details. The Virgo quality of perfectionism can sometimes turn to cold-blooded ruthlessness and, on occasion, those governed by this Sign, having an object in view, will stop at nothing to attain it. Virgo natives of the higher type usually possess a rare psychic power. They are also capable of seeing through pretense. If the intellectual and spiritual side of the Virgo nature can be fully cultivated, then its natives will become wonderfully charming, magnetic and powerful individuals who prefer to entertain their friends rather than be entertained.<br><br>One of the pitfalls faced by those who fall within the jurisdiction of this Sign is a tendency to rehearse for life rather than actually live it. The Virgo belief is one that dictates they will never be sufficiently prepared to take full advantage when an opportunity presents itself when, in fact, these natives actually do themselves a gross disservice by not realizing that their fine intellects, fully developed or not, are more than a match for most challenges. Perhaps the true challenge for Virgo subjects is to expand their perspective beyond mere details in order to fully appreciate the larger order and underlying pattern of creation. Thus, they will be able to marvel at the abundance and diversity of the world. Individuals who can accomplish this will undoubtedly recognize the goals worthy of service and can then serve with devotion. In so doing, they will temper intellect with reverence.<br><br>The secret fear of Virgo subjects is that they will be found wanting or that it will be discovered that they need someone. In general, however, this is an unassuming Sign which produces hard workers who can serve unflinchingly while giving of their hearts. </span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Virgo Child</span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/virgo17.jpg"><br><br>Courtesy of an abundance of nervous energy, the little Virgo is a child in constant motion. It is vital that such energy has something constructive to do, otherwise restlessness and boredom will soon set in. The most serious potential problem here is tension mixed with over-worry. It is important to note that even the tiniest child can benefit from learning some relaxation techniques and it will be accepted all the more readily if a game is made of the process. This is a very practical soul, one with a great deal of common sense and an acute critical ability, which will stand the young Virgo in good stead when it comes to much of his or her school work. However, if left unchecked, the small Virgo can easily lose the inherently fragile self-confidence when the inner voice begins to nag. By virtue of the fact that these children are ruled by Mercury, they are very communicative and love to talk. They will be lively in arguments and debates with a good head for details. The little Virgo is excellent at forward planning and may well surprise his or her parents with the maturity of some of the thought-out notions.<br><br>By nature generally neat and clean, Virgo children love books, reading and writing. The penmanship is usually clear and legible with school work being meticulously researched and presented. A very hard and willing little worker, this child often appears to be striving for the position of "teacher's pet," but nothing could be further from the truth...he or she simply loves to keep busy and fails to see the point of wasting time or idly sitting around. Other children may misinterpret the shyness of the little Virgo as diffidence or stand-offishness, thus it is important for any caregiver to encourage socialization as much as possible. Instinctively flexible, this little one quickly adapts to new people and new places, provided he or she is given the opportunity. Nonetheless, a place that he or she can call his or her "own" will be very important to this child from an early age. Somewhere to be quiet and store personal possessions apart from the rest of the household will need to be provided. Above all, other more boisterous siblings or family members should not be allowed to interfere with this little one's toys or hobbies.<br><br>Virgo children will not only want to know "why," but will also insist on being told "how." There is an insatiable thirst here for knowledge coupled with the capability of winning awards and grants leading to higher education. By nature, the Virgo child harbors a great love of method and order. However, given the inherent tendency here to be overly-inquisitive and frequently too meddlesome, great care should be taken to ensure that these little ones do not overhear discussion, gossip or comment on the evils of life and the faults of others. Within the family unit, these children will be devoted little souls and also very affectionate creatures...although they may not always get along well with "certain" members. As a general rule, this child has his or her own way in the home, but needs to be taught that an unkind criticism is often more painful and lasting in its effects than is a physical injury. Thus, the habit of unkindly judgment should be disciplined from an early age, otherwise the Virgo child is liable to become an exceedingly disagreeable and acrimonious adult.<br><br>The good and true things of life should be pointed out to the children of Virgo. They should be taught to believe that there is something of value in almost everything. If self-control is not learned, then these will be the most restless and active little busy-bodies of the entire Zodiac, forever getting into mischief. There is seldom, if ever, any requirement here to urge these children to keep at their tasks since they are rarely happy unless they are occupied and any inclination toward music should be strongly encouraged. These little ones are immensely quick to form likes and dislikes, which will be primarily manifested in the discrimination displayed in the selection of their food. In short, these little ones are tremendously notional. The digestive system of Virgo children should be carefully monitored...particularly as to stomach and bowel disorders. Indeed, many a Virgo child between the age of six and ten has experienced a narrow escape with regard to such ailments. The skin here is fine and sensitive, so coarse clothing should be totally avoided and their hair should never be combed or brushed with anything but the utmost care. In order for the Virgo child to flourish, he or she will need pure food, pure air, much kindness and the early acceptance of personal cleanliness and neatness.<br><br>Of course, as this little one grows, the personality will develop. With the maturity into adulthood, the young Virgo will exhibit plenty of energy and determination, together with a love of learning and the spending of much time in formulating plans. Virgo children are usually moderately lucky throughout life and have the tendency to marry when quite young.</span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Since Virgo is one of the three Earth Signs (together with Taurus and Capricorn), any child governed by this element needs to be taught while very young to overcome bouts of depression and feelings of inadequacy that he or she is bound to experience from time-to-time. Earth children should be encouraged to laugh things off during such circumstances, rather than taking everything to heart so seriously.

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/virgo1.gif"><img src="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/childparent.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Aries Parent/Virgo Child: These two individuals will have much to teach the other since each views life from a completely different perspective. The Aries parent will act immediately and think later, whereas the Virgo child will analyze, rationalize, debate, consider and only then, might put forward a tentative toe. This little one cannot be forced...to do so would leave him or her a shivering and nervous wreck. Thus, the parent here must have patience...a trait not particularly associated with the Sign of Aries in any sense of the word. The key is balance between patience and stagnation. If left without encouragement, the Virgo child can become caught in a dense fog of over-analysis that will cloud the vision and prevent any forward movement. Luckily, however, the Aries parent will refuse to allow such a situation to continue for very long.<br><br>Taurus Parent/Virgo Child: These two individuals are both home-lovers with a passion for nature and its beauty. While the child here can be somewhat shy and anxious, the Taurus parent possesses a quiet confidence and can instill such a sense of inner peace and contentment into the little Virgo, providing the child with courage to face to world with his or her gifts and talents. The industrious small Virgo will work as hard as his or her parent to ensure a safe and secure future with the least amount of disturbance and distress...a place where the simple pleasures and fruits of life can be enjoyed to their fullest.<br><br>Gemini Parent/Virgo Child: Although both of these individuals are mentally alert and active, the Virgo child tends to be more shy and reticent than his or her Gemini parent. Both share a love of rational analysis, but this little one is more likely to try and bestow practical application upon his or her ideas. The parent here will encourage the child to have more confidence in expressing personal opinions and is sure to admire the sharp mind and acerbic wit. This will be far from a dull household. There will be an abundance of comings and goings, with a plethora of debates and discussions to while away the hours.<br><br>Cancer Parent/Virgo Child: These are two cautious and introverted souls. A safe and secure domestic sanctuary will be vital to both in order to recharge batteries. Thus, there will be a mutual understanding here for the need to retreat. However, that having been said, the little Virgo is by no means a recluse. Being ruled by the Planet Mercury, this child enjoys conversation and social interaction, but also being a child of the Earth, he or she will require a solid foundation and steady environment in which to be nurtured. This is something that the Cancer parent can most definitely provide in abundance, giving the little Virgo strength and confidence to face the world.<br><br>Leo Parent/Virgo Child: Although sometimes overwhelming, a Leo parent can do a great deal to encourage the confidence of the more introverted members of the Zodiac and this combination is no exception. The little Virgo can be shy and nervous with a mind that is overactive and anxious. Given the correct environment, however, this worrying mind can be converted into an incisive and agile mental state which brings out the inherent gifts for rational analysis and fine detail associated with the Sign of Virgo. These talents may be perceived not only in terms of mental ability, but from a creative point of view as well as converting nervous fidgeters into capable craftspeople. With the help of some Leo sunshine and praise, the little Virgo could very well blossom nicely within this parent/child relationship.<br><br>Virgo Parent/Virgo Child: Being of like minds, the parent and child here will undoubtedly enjoy each other's company immensely. There will be plenty of lively debates between the Virgo parent and Virgo child and bonds will be forged over crosswords and mental puzzles. Since this Sign is infamous for its inclination toward being health conscious, the child will be nutrient-filled above all others. Both are sociable souls and there is likely to be constant activity about the house. Since Virgo is by nature a somewhat anxious and nervy Sign, the parent here should be careful not to reinforce such traits, which are already inherent in the child. In short, care must be taken by the Virgo adult not to pass along such a disposition to the susceptible Virgo child who already possesses a proclavity to be nervous and anxious. In general, however, the Virgo parent tends to bring out the best in the little Virgo and, being so similar in nature, domestic harmony should be easy to achieve and maintain.<br></span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Libra Parent/Virgo Child: The little Virgo, frequently fussy about small details, is basically a neat individual. The Libra parent might try to get the youngster to mix more with others, but he or she is a quiet child and not particularly adventurous. Thus, the parent here will probably be more concerned with future ideas and become annoyed by the tiny details that the little Virgo seems to be fixated upon. The Libra parent will not care if fingernails are a little dirty or overly-long, provided people take notice of what does look good. On the other hand, the Virgo child needs to have everything "just so" which can throw the Libra scales totally out of balance.<br><br>Scorpio Parent/Virgo Child: The Scorpio parent is a very devoted individual and the little Virgo will truly appreciate this. Practical and earthy, this child enjoys in aiding others and will always be a valuable helper around the home. Obsessive as the Scorpio adult can be regarding how things around the house are done, this parent will know that the little Virgo can be relied upon to do things in accordance with the Scorpio standard...but the parent here needs to be wary of making the Virgo child something of a slave. Because of this little one's willingness to work, he or she can be taken advantage of. Blessed with a no-nonsense approach to life which appeals to the Scorpio nature, both individuals in this relationship usually possess a shared view of perfectionism. It is not unusual for the bond between a Scorpio parent and Virgo child to be an intense one indeed.<br><br>Sagittarius Parent/Virgo Child: This combination consists of a pair of magnificent talkers. Indeed, the Sagittarius parent and Virgo child could probably chat together all day. When telling a story, the parent here will view the overall picture, but the little Virgo will want to know all the details. In "Hansel and Gretel," for example, this child will be intensely interested in exactly what type of food the witch fed to the children and how much weight they put on. To Sagittarius, these are irrelevant details and the parent here might become irritated when the story is being constantly interrupted in such a manner. The Virgo child is concerned with practical everyday detail and will depend upon the Sagittarius parent to introduce him or her to the exciting outside world. When planning an adventure or trip, the little Virgo can be relied upon to help with all the details of what will be required and the Sagittarius parent can rest assured that nothing will be left out or even left to chance.<br><br>Capricorn Parent/Leo Child: This parent/child combination should get along quite well since they are Earth Signs and will have a lot in common. Both value work and expect much from themselves on a personal level. The Virgo child can depend upon the Capricorn parent to provide the needed material security and, in return, will ensure that the parent is never disappointed in his or her achievements. From an early age, this child is eager to earn his or her own money and can be depended upon to work well in the service of others. The Virgo attention to detail will be a source of constant pride to the Capricorn parent and this child will admire the parent's ability to take charge of a situation and provide the necessary support for this little one to reach desired goals..<br><br>Aquarius Parent/Virgo Child: There is likely to be much bickering with this parent/child combination since they disagree on so many aspects. The Virgo child can be very fussy and the Aquarius parent cares little for what are personally considered to be petty details. However, there will not be any emotional issues here as neither the parent nor the child has a need for tight emotional bonding. The parent will like the way the little Virgo enjoys helping out and how he or she is able to aid in putting those far-out Aquarius dreams into reality. Nevertheless, in order to achieve this ideal, there will be many small practical details that have to be seen to first...and the parent here might find the child to be critical if the adult comes home with yet another new plan. Indeed, the Aquarius parent often perceives himself or herself to be participating in a role reversal with the Virgo child and may become frustrated at the little one's criticisms and apparent lack of foresight. It will be necessary for both parent and child here to learn how to open their minds a little more to the perspective of the other. This combination possesses the potential to achieve much and learn a lot about each other's world.<br><br>Pisces Parent/Virgo Child: Since these two Signs are opposites in the Zodiac, each can provide what the other lacks. There will be much cooperation here and this is a loving combination both in the home and out in the community. The Pisces parent can supply an abundance of empathy and kindness to the Virgo child. He or she will also make allowances for this little one's critical nature. Since Virgo is an Earth Sign, this child fails to truly understand the world of emotions and is usually totally unaware how hurtful critical remarks can be, simply noticing small details and overcome with the desire to point them out. The Pisces parent can help this little one by teaching him or her to "chill out" and "go with the flow." In return, the Virgo child can help the Pisces parent to be more forceful and teach the adult how to aid others without becoming a doormat. This is a good combination...provided the inherent differences between parent and child can be accepted by both parties.</span><br><br><img src="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/virgo2.gif"><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large">The Virgo female</span><br><br><img src="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/virgo9.jpg"><br><br>The Virgo female usually has a strongly developed maternal instinct and makes for a very devoted wife and mother. Counted among the best housekeepers, she is economical and delights in having her home and personal belongings tasteful as well as elegant. This is a woman who will be extremely precise...even to the point of fussiness. Clean and chaste in thought, most Virgo females display expressions of purity and virtue. There is normally a certain fascinating sweetness lingering in the eyes and about the mouth. Females governed by this Sign love those who are pure in mind and who possess characters which are just and true. Thus, they tend to dislike the baser instincts associated with the male population and are apt to find marriage something of a disappointment. Nonetheless, the magnetism of the Virgo woman is very marked and once she has gained an influence over another person, she will rule absolutely. Although the heart of this female will not go out to the world in general, she is likely to be very loving and affectionate toward those of whom she is fond. If one single word could describe the Virgo woman, it would probably be discriminating. She demands action rather than words and quickly seeks commitment in any relationship.<br>With a love of finery, dress, society and display, women who fall under the jurisdiction of Virgo will resort to any honorable means in order to gratify their desires in these areas. Likely to be a leader of fashion...if circumstances permit...she will always show excellent taste in the selection of wearing apparel. These women harbor much respect for the beautiful coupled with an outstanding perception of color, which often develops into artistic talent and may be displayed in their use of a needle, brush and pencil. Floral arrangements and home decoration are their particular specialities. This female is blessed with a quick and accurate eye which enables her to excel in any profession which utilizes such gifts. This woman is not one to be trifled with and she truly knows what she is all about. It would be a grave mistake to underestimate this female. She will set goals and overcome any odds to achieve them. The most enlightened Virgo woman is one who has developed both her intellectual and spiritual sides. Such a female is extremely powerful, magnetic and charming...one who could possibly sway an entire nation, if not the entire world.<br><br>Acccommodating and adjustable, this woman may basically be a shy individual, but such will not deter her from overcoming life's obstacles. If some flaw or imperfection is perceived in a relationship, then she will have no hesitation in breaking the bond. When annoyed, females who fall under the jurisdiction of this Sign can be shrewd and fussy and they are certainly nobody's fool. However, this woman can be won over with grace and taste rather than physical charms. The approach to life here is direct. Virgo women can be pessimistic and critical souls but somewhat earthy in their judgments. This is one of the few female types of the Zodiac who can be trusted in every way. Often possessing the reasoning powers customarily associated with males, the Virgo woman refuses to adopt a veneer of helpless feminine charm...although she is usually feminine in appearance. Severe in her moral judgments, this woman is frequently good at hiding such, presenting a smiling face to the world and always pleasant on the surface. By no means a spoil-sport, being tolerant and wise in many ways, the Virgo female does possess such high standards for herself that she often seethes with inner tension. In addition, this woman will probably have a tendency toward hypochondria. She is so centered on being perfect that she is inclined to imagine ailments and diseases whenver she feels the slightest bit out of sorts. In truth, however, the Virgo female rarely requires medicine at all and usually lives a long and useful life...frequently appearing much younger than she actually is.<br><br>Intellectual by nature and blessed with a gift of language...or even the powers of a retentative memory which helps her pass examinations...this female is something of an academic type which can be threatening to many ordinary males. Nonetheless, this is a woman who does possess sex-appeal and is often counted among the prettiest females of the Zodiac. She will also be lively and vivacious well into old age. The woman governed by Virgo will have a quick and alert mind but can be something of a snob. Regardless, she respects all the old-fashioned virtues and is one of most subtle and delicately cast women of the entire Zodiac. As a mother, she will be relatively indulgent, taking infinite pains to understand her children. As a wife, she will constantly strive for perfection in every way...backing her partner in each endeavor while making every effort to be self-effacing. </span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large">The Virgo male</span><br><br><img src="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/virgo11.jpg"><br><br>The Virgo male will likely be ambitious for wealth. Thoughtful, conservative and industrious, this man is not easily contented, being changeable by nature. For instance, he will change his residence quite often. There is a commercial instinct here, coupled with practical, methodical and discriminative characteristics. Males governed by this Sign are experts at finding fault with others. They love details of things and will be cautious about their own interests. Inherently speculative, the Virgo man is fond of science...particularly regarding medicine, food, diet and hygiene, etc. Men who fall under the jurisdiction of Virgo have the reputation of being cool, undemonstrative...or even frigid..in their attitude toward love. However, this is not necessarily always the case. Just as the calmest waters can be the deepest, so it frequently is with the Virgo male. These men need to express their deepest emotions in an almost self-sacrificial manner and this is why they will give so much of themselves to a cause which interests them, or a way of life that they feel is the only way. If that way of life should happen to be matrimony, then they will be completely dedicated to making the partnership a success.<br><br>The Virgo man can be a very withdrawn individual, especially with strangers. Indeed, he usually only appears warm and loving to those who know him and even then not always overly-sympathetic in romantic affairs. Needing a tranquil partner, this male requires a solid foundation for happiness and normally makes for a true partner, once he has found the right mate. Although they do possess a spiritual side, Virgo men are basically earthbound in moral outlook, which is to say that they do not float or drift being deeply-rooted in their fundamental beliefs. They tend to be totally unmoved by the more ariel or light-hearted spirits of the Zodiac. Refusing to be flattered by charm, overcome by show or overwhelmed by the "flashy," this male knows what he wants in both love and life...and will pursue same with much determination. There is a tendency here to be secretive about material possessions and the Virgo man may not necessarily tell his partner exactly how much money is in the bank. However, this is usally done with a view toward guaranteeing mutual welfare and he will be devoted to his family. Although orderly and methodical in thought, this male is frequently something of a sloppy dresser. He can be exceedingly demanding, needful that partners and acquaintances prove themselves to him time and time again. This is a soul that can be depended upon but he is nobody's fool. They keyword for males ruled by this Sign is integrity. Above all else, this man needs to feel that he is worthy. There is a quick mind here, together with practicality and honesty, but the Virgo male is basically shy when it comes to sharing emotions. It is important that others not expect this man to be outgoing and he will need help if he is to build confidence.<br><br>This is a far from happy-go-lucky character. In order to understand the Virgo man, a person must learn to read between the lines. Above all, this is an individual in need of a partner who has faith in him and can appreciate his depth of feelings and patience when it comes to achieving goals. It will be necessary to appeal to this male's intellect rather than his emotions. Customarily critical, he does not admire the weak and whimpering, instead harboring much admiration for strong people who can hold their own in any given situation. He will not waste a great deal of time with those who cannot command his respect. The Virgo male may be regarded as harsh and arbitrary, but this is only because he expects a great deal more from those around him than they may have been able to provide. The ability to change here is unlikely to materialize. Indeed, this is a somewhat "stuck" character, but the staid attitude may be well-hidden and can cause great confusion to those who strike up an acquaintance with this man.<br><br>Virgo men are prone to have practical hobbies...woodworking for instance...and can be magnificent do-it-yourself experts. Any tools of the trade will most certainly be kept neat and symetrically in place. In short, this is usually a shining nature, one which is generous in unmaterial things while remaining careful in every other respect. </span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: red;">* The above Excerpts are taken from the Original Source without any edits mainly for informational purposes only. ~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ will not be responsible for any of its contents, misuses or abuses using the information presented. </span></span></strong></div>

Romantic dalliances are possible throughout the month as you are attracting others to you, but donÂ’t take too many of your prospective partners seriously.

While some view this combination negatively--that old Â‘doom and gloomÂ’ suggestion--I feel that Saturn can help the flighty Mercurial mind focus and strengthen. New ideas (compliments of Mercury) can be considered, shaped, and formed when Saturn lends his serious and persevering nature to the mix. If youÂ’ve been thinking of making some personal changes - changes that may not make those around you very happy, this combination of planets can help you develop a realistic plan that will allow you to break free of any old inhibitions (self-imposed or imposed by others) that have been holding you back. Perhaps youÂ’ve been following in the footsteps of those who have gone before, an ancestor or parent, due to the expectations of others...or maybe you have been sticking to the tried and true.

The New Moon in Virgo in this serious, ritualistic mansion is the perfect time to focus on using ritual to let go of our inhibitions and overcome outside negative energy...whether that inhibition is negative self-criticism or unpleasant emotions, words, or actions from others, now is the time to find relief.
