              <p>Hello everyone, here is my testimonial. I should have written this a long long time ago the last time I told Oceanos… Sorry! Hm. I’ve used LOA products for over a period of about half a yr now, and I can only say that the results have been good. Just want to share with everyone my experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
              </span></strong></p><p><strong>TAROT CARD READING :</strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I first met Oceanos through an appointment of Tarot Card reading. I was very nervous and eager to put everything that went wrong in my relationship back into place. So without any idea of where to start and what to do, I went for the appointment. I had a whole list of questions prepared but Oceanos was very patient with me and answered each one of them. His reading was a very insightful one, and then I realized all the pieces fell into place, giving me a much clearer picture of the whole situation. I also came to know about things which I was previously not aware of, and allowed me to see things better from the other person’s point of view. I felt that Oceanos was very professional in what he does and he delivers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
              </span></strong></p><p><strong>LOVE SPELL FOR RECONCILIATION:</strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The solution he recommended was that I do a love spell, to pull back the lines of communication between my partner and I. I wasn’t very sure if all would work well, and when I believe it would work, I was impatient and wanted things to happen faster. It took me time to learn the importance of having faith and patience. After a few months, we started communicating again. Although it was only through messaging, I was really happy because I know my things are improving. During times when I was sad and worried, Oceanos was there to remind me to be patient and to believe and not let my negativity affect my spell. Then finally one day, he asked if I wanted to meet. It was really out of the blue and I hadn’t expected it at all. I remember rushing out of my house after applying the Love and Charisma Oil I got together with my first spellkit. Our first meeting went very well. We talked throughout the night and his behavior was soo different as compared to the last time I saw him. It was as if we were still together and has been together for a long time. Just almost everything he did and said took me by surprise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
              </span></strong></p><p><strong>LOVE ORISHA SPELL :</strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I went for a second reading and Oceanos suggested that I do another spell so that my partner and I can get back together. I agreed and chose the Love Orisha spell. However, throughout this period of time when I was waiting for my spell kit, I lost focus and let someone new enter my life. Oceanos had reminded me several times to remain focused but I didn’t listen. Thinking back, I really regret it. With two paths to choose, I chose to go with my original intention and hence, I did my spellwork. Several months have passed, my partner and I have been communicating and meeting on a more frequent basis (but also not really that frequent due to our busy schedules). We are now able to chat on the phone without argument so far (touch wood), and he would also message me from time to time to ask how my day was etc. What I didn’t expect was that, he would actually take the initiative to ask me out for meals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So right now, I’m still waiting and believing. I think I’m a very slow person. Slow in the sense that I usually can’t seem to grasp opportunities and take certain actions. And I cant seem to say the right things at the right time. Feel very irritated about myself. To those who’re confused about certain events in your lives, or are facing certain life crisis, I urge you all to consider booking an appointment for a reading. I’ve never gone for readings with other people before, so I cant comment or compare much. But in my opinion, Oceanos’s readings really provided me with much information and helped me a lot, and more importantly allowed me to take action to solve problems. I’ve seen the results that these spells have brought, and I feel that it’s worth it, all the money and effort I’ve invested. Along the way I really learnt a lot of things, and here, I want to say a BIG thank you to Oceanos for guiding me, reminding me, scolding me, and nagging at me. Hope your business will become bigger!

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Before you proceed , you should ask yourself is it what you really want, do you love her? Does she still love you? How important is this relationship to you? Thing you may feel important now, may not be so in time to come, sometimes it is just not meant to be, it might just be a fleeting cloud before "The One" appear. As with all my LOA Love Spells, they are not manipulative by nature therefore for Love Spell to work, the subject got to love you be it more or less, if they do not love you it will not work easily unless you chose Spell of Darker Means. Another important thing is whether you are financially able to proceed, do what is within your financial means, Real Authentic Spell Works or Spiritual Service require for fee for energy exchange. If it is not within your financial means, no point to do it, it is probably not meant to be. Such Spiritual Works &amp; Services are not easy to engage even if you are financially able or well off. End of the day Fate, Destiny &amp; Affinity play a part too.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Yup I agree with you. Haha. I've frequent-ed this forum for quite some time before I contacted Oceanos. And he didn't let me down, right from the start. Really gained alot I feel. Hope others will feel the same way too.</p>
