It work on Physical, Mental &amp; Etheric Levels. Definitely will have effects on Physical, Mental &amp; Etheric Selves.<br><br>About healing for Cancer patients, do you have anything to share other than saying its not possible. True enough, As healers we can try to heal them but they must have the intention &amp; desire to be healed. Theoretically eradicating Cancer through Energy Healing is not possible but with Faith, Miracles do happen. When i work with Cancer Patients, I can see the Cancer as a ball or some irregular shape bodies attaching to the Patients Etheric Bodies where the Cancer is formed. I will Removed them during Healing Session with me then they will be relieved of the Pains they suffering. However i noticed, these Bad Energy Bodies will come back &amp; attached to their Etheric Bodies after a while as in matters of weeks, days &amp; in some i even see they come back in mere few minutes. Why so? Its because the Cancer Patients call them back &amp; willingly let them be attached to themselves. Many Cancer Patients have Weak Will &amp; Faith, they think Cancer is End of the World for them, its incurable they can only wait for their End to come thats why they keep coming back. But after each Healing Session, they can see &amp; feel a Tangible Effect &amp; Positive changes in them. Miracles do happen &amp; there are evident cases where Cancer just disappear without a trace &amp; baffle the Medical World. Anything is Possible if we are Positive. Cancer is never the End of the World.<br><br>Everyday is a Learning Phase, we all learn to grow in strength with Experience of Life's Lessons. Willingness to Accept is the key. That would open Us to Boundless Wisdom. Learning is a never-ending process. Thanks for sharing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OCEANOS:<br></div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet White_Wolf_Thunder,<br><br>Healing is for Body, Mind &amp; Spirit. It work on Physical, Mental &amp; Etheric Levels. Definitely will have effects on Physical, Mental &amp; Etheric Selves.<br><br>About healing for Cancer patients, do you have anything to share other than saying its not possible. True enough, As healers we can try to heal them but they must have the intention &amp; desire to be healed. Theoretically eradicating Cancer through Energy Healing is not possible but with Faith, Miracles do happen. When i work with Cancer Patients, I can see the Cancer as a ball or some irregular shape bodies attaching to the Patients Etheric Bodies where the Cancer is formed. I will Removed them during Healing Session with me then they will be relieved of the Pains they suffering. However i noticed, these Bad Energy Bodies will come back &amp; attached to their Etheric Bodies after a while as in matters of weeks, days &amp; in some i even see they come back in mere few minutes. Why so? Its because the Cancer Patients call them back &amp; willingly let them be attached to themselves. Many Cancer Patients have Weak Will &amp; Faith, they think Cancer is End of the World for them, its incurable they can only wait for their End to come thats why they keep coming back. But after each Healing Session, they can see &amp; feel a Tangible Effect &amp; Positive changes in them. Miracles do happen &amp; there are evident cases where Cancer just disappear without a trace &amp; baffle the Medical World. Anything is Possible if we are Positive. Cancer is never the End of the World.<br><br>Everyday is a Learning Phase, we all learn to grow in strength with Experience of Life's Lessons. Willingness to Accept is the key. That would open Us to Boundless Wisdom. Learning is a never-ending process. Thanks for sharing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></div></blockquote>Thanks for sharing...<br><br>Enlightening indeed especially on healing with cancer patients.<br><br>I have only work with 1 cancer patient before. She is a good friend of mine, a healer too. She passed away peacefully a few years ago. She is a fighter to me, other than fighting with her own ailment, she helped many in need. When she was gone, i was very sad but i feel maybe her work on this plane is done, she is continuing her work in another realm. With Healing done on her by myself, other friends and herself, it sustain her physically too. Her departure was very sudden and she left peacefully. Cancer might be her karma but she accepted it with much love, willingness to accept make her strong, she is no different from anyone in her daily life just she is on medication and may feel tired easily but she never gave up helping those in need. She does alot of volunteer works. She is greatly missed by all around her. To those suffering from cancer, be strong, life is still beautiful and meaningful.<br><br>White_Wolf_Thunder<br><br></div>
