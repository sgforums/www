              <p><strong></strong><strong><span style="color: blue;">I been very busy with clients' appointments &amp; orders for the past few months since last year end till now. For my consultations, i am actually fully booked every working day, on &amp; off i do have some requests for urgent appointments which i have to schedule them at odd hours or afternoon slots inbetween my scheduled appointments. I tried to keep at least 1 day of my weekend free to have some personal time for myself &amp; family.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Today is also my brother's birthday however this year he is not in town, he is at Hong Kong currently. He actually asked me to get him a Limited Edition Louis Vuitton Bag as birthday present, i am still thinking about it as the price tag is abit steep. He could jolly well get it himself with such an indisposable income he has, he just want to take his chance to have monetary gain from me as it is his birthday...haha</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><strong><span style="color: blue;">For All LOA Services, Rate will be revised every few years, it's been many years since we last revised our services rate, we have decided to revise our rate in April 2009. With effect from April 1st 2009, All LOA Consultation Services by me will be revised to higher rate . For Urgent Appointment for express booking, additional charges is applicable. My rates are fixed, all appointments booked from April onwards will be at this rate. Even with the revised rate, my booking &amp; appointments are still the same, packed as usual, other than the quality of all our LOA Services, our rates are very reasonable. We have always tried to keep our rate as low as possibel however with the escalating operating overhead these days it is very difficult for us to maintain the same rate whereby all the cost has increase tremendously over the years. All our LOA Products pricing are revise yearly or as &amp; when there is an increase in product or shipping cost, for the past year or so, Shipping Cost has increased tremendously about 5 times with an increment of 30% - 40 % each time, We have no choice but to revise pricing of some of our products that has weight. We are glad alot of our existing long time clientele &amp; new  clientele are very understanding about it &amp; continue to show their support in our Services &amp; Products. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">This month is also the most busy period of the year as it is the accounting month for tax &amp; business renewal. Goodness E-filing makes such rountine chore easier. Looking back the past year, LOA has been doing ok although not as good as last time but still satisfactory. We are also looking for a new space for our New Workshop &amp; Center but haven't really found a new space yet. Hopefully we can find a suitable space soon.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">How time flies... Now already June, its going to be my LOA Anniversary again. This year we are not doing any Major Event but a small gathering. Nothing is confirmed as yet. This is our 6th Anniversary in here.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Untill now we have yet to find a new space. No luck so far, interested in one of the place but lease price too steep, i offered to buy it but owner not selling.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Been so busy &amp; hectic. Took a short rest past few days coz abit down under the weather. Very bad weather, even my moderator is sick. Must drink more water &amp; take Vitamin C.  </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">My clients' orders are so packed that i can only complete by end of June or early July. Lots of Special Customised Mojo Orders &amp; a couple of spellkits, i will probably upload some picture of these special mojo soon. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">A Client &amp; friend of mine got a Coyote Skin &amp; Fang Mojo from me before he flew back to UK, he is very happy with the results so far been experiencing alot of tangible effects, i am happy for him too. I am looking forward to meet him when he is back to SG for summer break.</span></strong></p>
