            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="color: blue;">10th October 2007 1:33AM<br><br>Raining away the whole afternoon, wonderful weather to snooze. Was thinking whether to attend a function in the evening if the rain not gonna stop. I got home early today at around early evening, finally rain stopped so i decide to go the function. Took a shower &amp; changed into fresh attire.<br><br>I was there early today at 7pm together with my good friend, Ken. We are attending the Caran D'Ache Limited Edition 1010 launching at Asian Civilisations Museum. The official launching time is about 7:30pm. I was hoping to catch up with some old friends but not many familliar faces tonight. Lots of expatriates as usual. There is cocktail reception, i just had a few reds &amp; chat with my friend while waiting for the launching to kick start. They served excellent finger food too, the scallop taste wonderful...<br><br>Caran d'Ache was founded in Geneva in 1924 and remains Switzerland's only manufacturer of pencils, fine arts products and writing instruments. Based in a country that is world famous for its watchmaking and jewellery, it is not surprising that the company has earned an international reputation for products of exceptional quality and beauty. These include luxury writing instruments, accessories and fine arts materials as well as a range of office supplies.<br><br>The name CARAN d'ACHE has an interesting history. The companys founder, Arnold Schweitzer, admired the work of a famous French caricaturist of the Belle Époque, Emmanuel Poiré (1859-1909). Poiré was born in Moscow, the grandson of an officer in Napoleon's Grande Armée. While his first work glorified the Napoleonic era, he went on to create "stories without words" and as a contributor to newspapers like "Lundi du Figaro", he is sometimes hailed as one of the fathers of the comic.<br><br>Poiré signed his work Caran d'Ache, a French transliteration of the Russian word for pencil - "karandash". A slightly modified replica of his signature became the company's logo for Fine Arts products.<br><br>Caran d'Ache Limited Edition 1010 which has been made to pay tribute to the Swiss watchmaking industry is the main Star of the night, i can't wait to see it. As usual after the grand speech, they will reveal &amp; lift the veil on this splendid Caran d'Ache Limited Edition 1010 pen. Highlight of this launching, the Caran d'Ache Limited Edition 1010 Gold Pen in showcase is numbered at 8, 8 is an auspicious number for asians. Very aesthetically with the main elements of Swiss Watchmaking reborn in the form of a brilliant writing instrument. I decided to take some pictures, fiddling my gucci messenger bag looking for my Canon Ixus, oh gosh can't find it, must have left it in another of my bag. No choice i just got to make do with my Dopod phone camera. After snapping a few pictures, my friend &amp; i decide to leave, its about 8:30pm. I wanted to go for dinner but my friend can't make it. So I went home. Another day has ended...<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">Oceanos Words Of Wisdom :<br><br>"There are a thousand thoughts lying within a man that he does not know till he takes up a pen to write." </span></strong><br></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="color: blue;">11th October 2007 1:40AM<br><br>Woke up late today. Feeling abit lethargic. Got a call from a long time client seeking some help with his current issue. I advised him to come for a consultation since this matter alot to him. Its been awhile since i last saw him.<br><br>In the afternoon, i went to Funan Centre to get my new laptop. Saw this nice "Mobile Edge" laptop bag at one of the bigger shop, i got the impulse to purchase it rightaway but on 2nd thought i do not need it. I already got a Bree Bag for my new laptop. Price is abit steep, its more than $200 for a vinyl bag. The SA is very helpful to come over to attend to me however not much of a help at all, i asked her if the bag is made of leather, she replied probably, not sure. Obviously its vinyl, I think she should have better product knowledge since she is doing sales... <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"><br><br>Feeling abit hungry decide to go do lunch with my friend, Lionel, i missed his Live interview on FM 98.7 last night due to the function i attended. Went to Rafflescity, we settled for Cafe Cartel since its not crowded at all as today is thursday. He told me the interview went smoothly, he even got to do freestyle rapping live. I am not much of a Hip Hop Music person at all but he is always very into Hip Hop music scene since i know him many years ago. Glad that he got in the FM 98.7 BEP NATIONAL RAP BATTLE CHAMPIONSHIPS, i wish him best of luck &amp; success in winning this contest. I have not decided whether to go Ministry Of Sound this saturday to watch his performance live at the 2nd round of the contest. Probably i will go show support if i am free that day. Let's see how it goes.<br><br>I reached home at around 6:30pm. After resting for awhile, Took a shower &amp; changed into sport attire. I got Yoga today. Yoga is very good for relaxation &amp; destressing. What i do is Hatha Yoga. With ha meaning "sun" and tha meaning "moon," hatha yoga is commonly translated as the yoga that brings union "of the pairs of opposites." The balancing of "Ying" &amp; "Yang". Sometimes Hatha Yoga is also translated as "Forceful Yoga" because it seems to require the most physical exercise &amp; stances of all Yoga types. However to me i feel the breathing technique is more important that the physical stances, the physical stances are just to facilitate the flow of the energy better. Without the correct breathing technique its useless even if you can do all the physical stances.<br><br>After my yoga, i went home. Another day has ended...<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">Oceanos Words Of Wisdom :<br><br>"Relaxation means releasing all concern and tension and letting the natural order of life flow through one's being" </span></strong></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="color: blue;">3rd December 2007 11:00AM<br><br>Its been quite awhile since my last entry. I been very busy with my appointments, other than New Year 2008 Tarot Full Reading, i got quite a few assignments, mojo bag orders as usual. Many placed orders for a special &amp; exclusive."Colmillo De Coyote" Mojo also known as "Coyote Eyetooth Mojo" available from my LOA for a Limited Time only, i do not have many of these &amp; once it is gone, i do not think it will be available again anytime soon.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Voodoo%20Products/coyotemojo03.jpg" alt=""><br><br>Many may ask what is so special &amp; exclusive about this Mojo? Well the Power of this Genuine Coyote Eyetooth "Mojo" is very strong, potent &amp; multi-purpose, Use it to leave an unfavourable situation or environment, Obtain Sexual Love Attraction from the opposite sex, Enhance your charisma, Free yourself of enemies, Create opportunity, Win games of chances, Protection against accident &amp; harm, Prevention from being arrested &amp; involved with any Legal issues.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Products/tulum.jpg" alt=""><br><br>This is a Powerful, Potent Mojo for prayers &amp; blessings, conjured &amp; consecrated at TULUM, THE SACRED PLACE OF THE MAYANS BY THE CHARMING TEACHER OF SPIRITS, ITS POWER IS SHAPED IN THE ARTICLES THAT CONSECRATED WITH THE SPIRIT OF COYOTE.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Voodoo%20Products/coyotemojo.jpg" alt=""><br><br>I have recommended some old clients &amp; a couple of new clients to use this Special Mojo. Very tangible results are seen within days. A new client who is in service line, came to me for a tarot consultation pertaining to his career which is stagnant &amp; seem to be going nowhere, i was able to give his accurate insightful details &amp; guidance on his career path, upon my advices he decided to get a "Coyote Eyetooth Mojo", he placed an order on the spot. His mojo i took a week to complete as it is customised to suit his needs with additional requests &amp; a Special Custom-blend Magickal Oil for Attraction, Charisma, Love &amp; Luck for his personal use &amp; anointing his mojo, his line of work need a lot of interactions &amp; require to have excellent interpersonal relationship with all. On the day of his collection of mojo, he can feel as if the mojo is alive when he hold it in his palm, he was quite shocked initially as he never had felt such a strong feeling over an object before... After i briefed him on how to use the mojo, he left happily.<br><br>A week later he texted me to thank me for my aid, there is a significant increase of number in his clientele &amp; he closed a very big deal which he did not expected just days after using the mojo. I am glad the Mojo serve him well &amp; i wish in all the best in whatever he do.<br><br>Christmas is just around the corner, the season of joy &amp; giving is here again. I got lots of presents to buy... how about you?<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">Oceanos Words Of Wisdom :<br><br>"In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.

Its the last month of the year usually i try to wrap up my work by the middle of the month, finish up all my outstanding orders, clients appointments so i can fly off for my holiday. This year my usual holiday plan has been cancelled, i originally planned to go Korea, my backup plan was to go Shanghai with my family also cancelled as my mom said its too cold. I like cold weather though...haha No holiday for me is still ok but instead i got more work.<br><br>Start of the month, an overseas client wanted to book appointment with me at his country which i declined as i can't leave due to the outstanding orders &amp; appointments in my schedule. Morever I already got clients' appointments at Kuala Lumpur on 13th &amp; 14th, need to attend a private function on the 15th there.<br><br>Before i leave for Kuala Lumpur, i got to arrange for my delivery guy to send out all the oustanding orders.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">Oceanos Words Of Wisdom :<br><br>" A good holiday is one spent among people carrying out actions for others to feel bliss." </span></strong></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">17th December 2007 3:00AM<br><br>I just got back from Kuala Lumpur, nothing much change since my last trip there, traffic busy as usual, jamming all around the clock at city area. This time round as its peak season &amp; last minute trip, i was not able to get a room at the hotel i want unless i get a Deluxe suite which i don't see a point as i will only be there for a few days. My uncle got a condominium so i went to stay with him, It is just opposite KL Supreme Court. It is the Sri Putramas Condominium, quite good location &amp; excellent view. Most importantly i can travel around easily.<br><br>I got a very important client appointment on the 14th which is part of the main reason that i am going KL aside from the functions &amp; other client appointments. I supposed to go to her place in the morning. This is the first time i am going to her place, usually clients will come to my hotel or meet up at some cafe for appointments. I have a hard time finding her place, appointment was scheduled at 10am, i only got there at 12 noon. My uncle who drove me there also can't find her place initially, which is at a prime district on the highland near KL Parliament House. There are too many small roads &amp; turnings there, a wrong turn you will end up somewhere else &amp; you will need to make a big round again. I actually feel abit bad for my uncle, he did'nt go to his office because of me. In the midst of all these, i spotted a big house with high walls that resemble a Castle which happen to be Dr Mahathir's old residence. My appointment went smoothly. She was very happy with the session &amp; the items she pre-ordered. Her place was about 3200 sq feet, with such a beautiful view overlooking KLCC but its a hassle to travel around if you don't drive.  After the appointment, she brought out 2 tubs of Haagen Dazs ice creams which coincidentally happen to be one of my favourite dessert. This client of mine is a very kind &amp; hospitable lady.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Miscellaneous/klcc.jpg"><br><br>Although this appointment ended abit late, i still want to go shopping since i am there. I decided to go KLCC. Lots of boutiques there even more Labels than Singapore Paragon. I wanted this Prada Vertical Hand Tote made of glossy silver dark two tone patented leather, i went to Prada at Paragon its sold out, so i thought since i am in KL might as well get it from KL Prada. However disappointment again, Prada at KLCC also do not have it anymore, the SA told me last piece was sold the day before. Maybe it not meant for me to buy it. Vertical Tote is perfect for easy travelling. Many labels including LV, Burberry, Gucci, YSL etc has similar designs in their men's collection.<br><br>Side topic, LV has its own Vertical Tote in exotic leather, croc leather, you would'nt see it at LV Singapore as it is under special order or limited production, The SA at LV Singapore told me it cost about 20 grands. Who would buy a 20 grands bag? I would'nt. Normal LV monogram or damier canvas in same design would cost about 5-6 grands still i would'nt buy...hahaha But again most items from LV seems to be forever as they are very lasting, mine lasted 8 years still serve me well.<br><br>Back to main topic, i did'nt see anything i like there. Raoul quite expensive over there compare to Singapore. Bonia seems to be very popular there, they have suitcases like LV, men's bags similar to Mulberry in design &amp; leather. I thought maybe can go for hair cut at the renowned Saw Hair Salon which is featured in magazines but got to wait which i do not have the time. I end up having a latte &amp; christmas chocolate log cake at Olio dome, the cake is heavenly.<br><br>The function on the 15th is wonderful too, took place at a Private Club Ballroom. I wore a maroon two toned long sleeved jeans with Zara Men's shawl &amp; mid length black woven leather boots. The entertainers that night can sing really well &amp; able to get all the guest's spirit high.<br><br>Majority of my time this trip is dedicated to my work, i did'nt have much time to shop, only went KLCC for few hours, another day to Sungei Wang for an hour, pass by the new shopping center Pavillion with no time to walk around. Basically a busy trip. I did take some pictures but its not that good as it is night time after rain.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">Oceanos Words Of Wisdom :<br><br>"The world is moving so fast these days perhaps being a little busy is never good enough to catch up the pace of life." </span></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">18th December 2007 2:00AM<br><br>This evening is my LOA Pre-Christmas Gathering at Window On The Park at Holiday Inn Hotel. This year not much people make it to this small gathering organised by Moonice.<br><br>That place is usually quiet, they provide sumptuous buffet spread featuring traditional local favourites and international dishes with chocolate fondue, wonderful desserts &amp; cakes. From time to time, i will meet my clients there.<br><br>As i just got back from KL, i did not make any reservation there. I thought there is not a need to but when i got there its almost fully booked. I was abit unhappy about it as other guests have already arrived, the manager managed to get us in however at separate tables. I am not very keen but got no choice, after awhile i am still unhappy with such an arrangement as the manage promised me to get us a table where all of us can sit together once there is an empty table, however maybe due to festive season, we were unable to shift to another bigger table. So i called the manager to let him know about my displeasure, he was very apologetic about it, i would say he handled the situation very well by offering me &amp; my guests complimentary red wines. Red wine not to my liking also but its a gesture of goodwill.<br><br>Window On The Park Pre-Christmas spread is quite nice, i like the mongolian mutton, Black pepper crayfish &amp; turkey in cranberry sauce. Their signature dessert Durian Pengat is heavenly. Christmas Log cake, pudding, stollen &amp; cookies are so so.<br><br>After dinner we have our gift-exchange at nearby fast food joint.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">Oceanos Words Of Wisdom :<br><br>"Goodwill is the one and only asset that competition cannot undersell or destroy." </span></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">23th December 2007 2:00AM<br><br>This evening I am going to a Pre-Christmas Gathering at Ivory Kitchen organised by my good friend &amp; Sister Lovieen. I have not seen her for months, she has been busy flying here &amp; there. A birthday present which i got for her was with me for months. Nothing grand just a small handbag from Aigner which i thought would look nice on her.<br><br>We arranged to meet at Raffles City Mall as earlier on she is there doing her yoga at Bikram. Its been awhile since i last went Raffles City Mall, alot of new stores, the groundfloor is basically filled with Vogue Labels boutiques. Most of the major labels are there some new some old, Mont Blanc ,Thomas Sabo, Bally, Aigner, Agnes. B, Coach &amp; Kate Spade etc. Raffles City Mall of today is very different from the past when it just started.<br><br>It was a rainy day, I wore my new Russo Wear double cuffed shirt with Raoul crystal cufflinks, Ben Sherman jean, Gucci Messenger which i seldom use &amp; Timberland dragon embossed leather sneaker. I wanted to wear my woven leather boots but its quite slippery on wet ground so safety first anyway sneaker more comfy. This Russo Wear double cuffed shirt is in camel color with colorful stripes on the collar &amp; cuffs, a rastafari touch.<br><br>I was there early so i waited awhile for her, she came with other 2 guests,  we proceeded to Clark Quay. Ivory Kitchen is above Gotham Penthouse, a fine dining restaurant with an executive private room and a contemporary lounge bar which fine Indian cuisine from the Coastal region of India comprising essentially of flavours from the Indian Coastal belt of Goa, Konkan, Malabar, Mangalore, Chettinad, Andhra Pradesh and Bengal. There are 13 of us there from different countries.<br><br>The Manager came to took our order with some recommendations. For Appetizers we had Garlicci Grilled Prawns, Murgh Tikka Mirza Hussain, Gosht Kakori Malai Kebab. 2 of the guests are vegetarians so they have Vegetable Mixed Grill. The prawns are nice, Chicken tikkas succulent, but the Malai Lamb kebab not so good. I ordered a Mango Lassi, i kinda like Lassi drink, very rich but heavy. For main course we had Lalla Mussa Dal, Masala fish, Vegetarian Biryani with the Staples dishes.<br><br>I met alot of wonderful people that night, had a wonderful chat with Miss Diane Lee, director of Bikram, she explained to me briefly on what is Bikram Yoga all about. It is very interesting compared to traditional yogas.<br><br>After dinner, we shifted to executive private room to have our dessert of Christmas log cake with tea &amp; coffee. I had a Masala Tea. I gave complimentary short readings to all the guests who wants it. One of the guest ask me if i can do reading on Christmas eve which i jokingly declined by saying "sure, double charge!" Usually i am off on Chrismas eve, i will only go for appointment if its urgent. I hope the guests are happy with my short complimentary readings. They asked me for my business card which i distributed to all of them. As &amp; when they got a need can always make an appointment with me.<br><br>It was a great evening that ended beautifully.

              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">24th February 2008 5:00AM<br><br>I just got back from a night out with friends, went clubbing at Ministry Of Sound, Its been a long time since i last went there. Crowded as usual but not as packed as St James, we got 2 tables at Members Area so it more comfy. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Tonight was an early celebration for a friend's birthday. If not i would'nt have gone there. Was contemplating not to go as i had a long day at office. But decide to go because the birthday boy was already all dressed up when i  drop by his workplace in town in the evening, can't find a reason to cancel...as i already agreed to go few weeks ago...haha Anyway at MOS i really enjoyed myself, i rarely club these day, old folk like me no stamina get tired easily. During my younger years i used to club like 3 nites a week. Met some old friends, got to know some new interesting friends that night. Especially this new friend who kept asking me to bottoms up all night long till the end, both of us did'nt get drunk but our friends who attempt to aid us by representing us to bottoms up got drunk. Very nice to know you all, hope to catch with you all again. Maybe not for a drink, perhaps have a meal together sometime.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">My Client appointments during weekends are usually fully-booked &amp; back to back. Finished my last appointment in the evening, rushed down to orchard to bring my 2 new sportcoats which a friend got for me from States for alteration, just wanted to make it more fitting, find the sleeve slightly long. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">After that, i went shop around, happen to see a few bags which i like at Bottega Veneta, all quite steeply priced, i always like messenger bags be it big or small. This time 3 of BV Messenger bags caught my eye, the flat brown woven nappa leather messenger, black woven nappa leather wedge messenger &amp; brown woven nappa leather flap messenger, steeply priced at $2300, $2900 &amp; $4400. I have second thoughts about getting them although i like all  3 mainly because of their pricing but BV is very exclusive these days in comparison with other designer labels. I might be going Hong Kong for a short trip in April for client appointment, if it is cheaper there i will get there if not when i come back i will just get one of the messenger from BV Boutique here. Actually in term of size &amp; pricing , BV surpass LV by quite abit. Similar size LV is cheaper than BV. Maybe its the trend or perhaps really is about quality. BV use top grade Nappa leather while most signature LV items are made of canvas. In term of style both are classy but BV more of minimalist, simple look.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Another busy day has ended...</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">3rd April 2008 11:00AM<br><br>Its been quite awhile since my last entry. This month of April is a very busy period for me, other my existing appointments &amp; assignments, My LOA is shifting out of her current premise by this month. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">I would say it's been my intention for my LOA to shift to New Premise by end of this year however somehow it manifested abit earlier than expected. A Buyer make an offer to me during February to buy our 2000 sq feet Freehold premise, the offer was quite reasonable which i did not take a long time to consider. As at that point of time i already went for alot of viewings for a new premise, i kinda interested in one of the place i viewed, immediately i make an offer &amp; deposit with a cheque, 1% of the property value. I thought  timing will match perfectly if i sold off my current premise &amp; buy a new place.  After i accepted the buyer's Offer, the owner of the new place i interested in getting rejected my offer, his asking price is quite ridiculous, above bank evaluation by alot. No banks can match such a value meaning i got to come out with more extra cash which i need to reconsider. My Sale Option for my premise has already exercised, i got to shift out by April. At this point of time, i know there will be a time lapse, before i get my new premise, i would need a warehousing facility for my stocks &amp; stuffs.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Since 25th March 2008,  We are having a promotion for ~*~LOA~*~ Authentic Lucky Horseshoes for a limited period till June 2008 while stock last.

Flew there on the 5th of July, flight took 4 hours &amp; 15 minutes. Stayed there for about a week at a relatively new hotel at Chongcing S Road. It is near Taipei Main Station &amp; Ximen Ding.</strong></span></strong><span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial;"> <strong>Most importantly i can travel around easily.<br><br>My clients' appointments were all scheduled on the 6th. All my consultations &amp; appointments went well despite slight communication barrier. Taiwanese english is more of americanised english while our english is british english so there is some differences in the command of language. My spoken mandarin is only passable to them. A few of Taiwan clients pre-booked appointments with me in May, some are old clients &amp; a couple of new clients who are seeing me for the first time, got to know my services through referral from my old clients. Confirmed their appointments' date on the 6th of July as i was able to schedule them on the same day. By the time i finished all my appointments it is already evening. Went for dinner at nearby Shopping Center Shinkong Mitsukoshi &amp; rest early for the night.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial;"><strong>On the 7th of July onwards, I am free to go sightseeing at Taipei city. What i notice about Taipei is there are more girls than guys. Rarely or almost none speak english on the street. Their Metro system there is very efficient compared our SMRT system despite their greater scale &amp; coverage. Frequency is high, seats not much all sparsely placed, astonishingly at any time of the day you will be able to get a seat, their train are not crowded at all. Taiwanese are very systematic &amp; friendly. I went to Taipei's Xi Men Ding (è¥¿é–€ç”º)</strong> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">also known as "Harajuku" of Taipei. With streets filled with fashion stores but mainly catered for the female market, there are some stores for the male however mostly are hip hop fashion trend. In the midst of these small stores there are big Departmental stores like Wannien, Wanguo, Cinemas &amp; restaurants. I wanted to dine at the famous Toilet Bowl restaurant however as i did not make a reservation, i got to wait for 2 hours so forget it, i have to give it a miss. Instead, i went to a Local Delight Eatery for a meal of Fried Pork Rib Rice, Fried Toufu &amp; Prawn Rolls. </span><br><br></strong><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/TAIPEI%20TRIP%202008/IMG_1840.jpg" alt=""> <strong></strong> <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/TAIPEI%20TRIP%202008/IMG_1833.jpg" alt=""> <br><br><strong>Weather at Taipei is rather hot, i wore 3/4 &amp; tee-shirt with my Bally Messenger bag &amp; canon ixus digicam to romp tthe streets of Taipei. Lots of stairs to climb, they are enviroment-friendly, mostly escalator for upriding only, the rest are stairs, some places doesn't even have escalator, very healthy lifestyle. Can be very tiring after awhile...haha I will share more about my trip later.

              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">26th August 2008 10:00PM<br><br>Today is my Birthday. Been celebrating my Birthday since last thursday till now. Went clubbing at Movida on saturday night, made a reservation for VIP sofa there, invited a few friends to party with me. We had a few bottles of Martell &amp; a bottle of Moet Chandon, some finger foods like party platter,  devil wings &amp; quesadilla. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Sunday morning, i received a Varlhona chocolate birthday cake from Da Paolo Gastronomia. Went orchard in the afternoon had lunch with my students at Crystal Jade. Raining day so decided to shop around Takashimaya mall before proceeding for coffee at Coffee Club. Meet other friends for late dinner</span></strong><strong><span style="color: blue;"> of sashimi, superbly fresh beyond my expectation from such a small eatery however when i got the bill i understand why from the price...haha We went chillout at Sanctuary IndoChine, i had my favourite Malibu Bay Breeze cocktail, my friends had Magarita Lime &amp; Moon river. Monday night i made a reservation for a table of 10 at a Seafood place to have dinner with my godfather &amp; friends. All dishes was preordered by one of my friend, no idea what he ordered untill that night. One of the dish he ordered is a very big lobster, very fresh too, a pleasant surprise...hehe I was planning to treat them for a simple dinner, its better than what i expected.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Today i wanted to have dinner with my family but my dad cannot make it as he got to attend a function. Mom was home early, she suggested cook dinner for me, so i &amp; her stay at home &amp; eat. She rarely cook as most of the time nobody is at home, we are all busy with our own stuffs. Another has ended. Tomorrow have to resume my work schedule after my birthday break.<br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span><br><br><span style="color: purple;">Oceanos Words Of Wisdom :<br><br>"The sharing of joy, whether physical, emotional, psychic, or intellectual, forms a bridge between the sharers which can be the basis for understanding much of what is not shared between them, and lessens the threat of their difference."</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">22nd October 2008 10:00PM<br><br>Rain rain everywhere &amp; almost every other day. Such weird climate, Mother Earth is showing her displeasure, sky is crying non-stop. I been very busy, having average of 4 appointments a day leave me little time for myself morever i still got quite abit of outstanding orders like mojo bags, spellkits, magickal oils, i also took 2 assignments for spellworks.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Quite alot of things happened for past 2 months, not in the best of my mood neither bad. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">I am contemplating of taking a break, maybe somewhere near to relax. November is just around the corner, time of the year where i will offer year reading service till March 2009. Money Spellkit is also available for pre-orders, those who has done &amp; benefitted from this spell, will once again need to renew it again for 2009. Aside from work, i am looking forward to attend Cortina Watch Grand Event that is only held once every 2 years which is end of this month. Still thinking what to wear, see how's my mood then. Halloween is also what i am looking forward to, Witches Sabbat to mark an ending &amp; a new beginning...hahaha</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">30th October 2008 1:00AM<br><br>This evening, i attended Jewellery Time 2008 by Cortina Watch. I reached Paragon at about 7:30pm, went to register my name on the guestlist at reception.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Blog/MODELS.jpg" alt=""></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">This Cortina Watch’s biennial Jewellery Time returns to Paragon Shopping Center at Orchard this October for an exhibition of limited edition bejeweled timepieces in the world of haute horlogerie.</span></strong><strong><span style="color: blue;">Guests find themselves immersed in a luxurious lounge setting, bedecked with dazzling crystal chandeliers. </span></strong><strong><span style="color: blue;">In addition to the breathtaking jewellery watches on show, there will be a premiere showcase of the world’s most coveted trophy watches, specially commissioned for and exclusive to Jewellery Time 2008. </span></strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Blog/VIPGUEST01-1.png" alt=""></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Celebrities Leon Lai and Michele Reis will walk the red carpet at the official opening of Jewellery Time 2008. Where the world’s finest time creations unite with jewellery artistry.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>16 of the world’s most prestigious brands will unveil their elite jewellery timepieces for both men and women. Highly coveted limited edition and specially commissioned signature masterpiece are true seductions for the watch connoisseurs. Take time for glamour and luxury at Jewellery Time 2008.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Cortina Watch has also commissioned a Limited Edition coffee table book titled 'The Legacy'– A Tale of Time &amp; Intrigue, which chronicles in pictures, a collection of the world’s most desirable jewellery creations and features some of Asia’s eminent entrepreneurs, high society and celebrated personalities.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong> I wore my Caramel Python Skin Leather Jacket with white shirt &amp; woven leather boots toting my new Damier Graphite Tadao to attend this event. Saw some familliar faces that night, a party with nice finger foods &amp; champagne. Lots of gorgeous timepieces, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels "Charms" collection is very interesting, a watch of exceptional elegance &amp; high taste that would look good on any ladies. Baume &amp; Mercier Reviera Collection look wonderful too, simple yet elegant Lengendary Line with both Classical &amp; Sporty Line, i love their dodecagonal face.  Leon Lai &amp; Michele Reis look wonderful despite their age. Leon Lai got lots of pinkish energy surrounding him while Michele pale in comparision. I feel that she is having some issues with her personal live. Well thats just my intuitive reading. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong> I left Paragon about 9:30pm meeting a good friend of mine for dinner, we decide to try out "Dai Ka Jie" at Heeren. Ordered their signature Roast duck, Fried Otak, Claypot Stingray &amp; Fish Maw soup. Ambience so so, only roast duck is nice, the rest of food too oily, Service wise not so good perhaps it is near closing hour however the waiter that serve us is still fine before i left gave him a little tip.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Another day has ended.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</strong></span></p>

              </strong></span></p><p><strong><strong><span style="color: blue;">21st March 2009 10:00PM<br><br>Today is the Big Day of my longtime Friend &amp; Client Lady Kirvin, she is getting married today. </span></strong></strong></p><strong>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">I remembered the first time i met her, she is a sad &amp; unhappy girl troubled by her broken relationship. She came for my consultation then at our previous LOA Centre &amp; Office. She sought me for help to salvage her broken relationship. I felt her sincerity &amp; needs so i decide to accept her assignment &amp; provide her with my Spiritual Services together with some of my products. Prior to embarking on Love Spell, i suggested she use my "Love &amp; Attraction" Magickal Incense &amp; "Gypsy Love Potion" to see some results for herself first. She got both products on the spot &amp; she use it immediately, from there she i able to see some tangible effects in her issue.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Days later, she decided to book my Love Spell Casting Service, i suggested to her a "Love &amp; Reconciliation" Spellkit  for her to cast herself together with a "Wanga Doll" which i have prepared for her needs, i also cast an enhancement spell for her spellkit &amp; "Wanga Doll" for her Spell to have strength. I chosed a specific date &amp; time for her to cast the spell with the best planetary influences, prior to that i have told her specifically for Love Spell to work the subject got to love you be it more or less, if there is no love it will not work. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">In less than a week after she done the spell, she is able to see very positive results. In just few months, they finally got back together again. I feel very happy for her too.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Last year end, she told me she is getting married this year.  Finally today i went to attend her wedding, She look so happy &amp; blissful in her wedding dress, she introduce me her husband which i met for the first time. Both of them look so happy, in my heart i also felt joy, i am glad that i am able to help her to seek her happiness &amp; finally walk down the aisle with the love of her life. I sincerely wish both of you a blissful &amp; everlasting Love. Congratulation.</span></strong></p>
