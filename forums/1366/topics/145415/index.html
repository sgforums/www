            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings forum owner OCEANOS, all moderators, and all members of this forum,<br><br>I have personally come across, tried out, and used this very good Psychic Reading / 'Fortune Telling' service, and I would like to recommend it (no I'm not the reader, and I don't get any commission for recommending it), so I hope that it will be ok with you, the forum owner and moderators.<br><br>Hilarion Reading :<br><a href="http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Hilarion" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Hilarion</a><br><br>The strength of this Reading, is that you get to ask the questions you want, and not have to sit back and listen to things about urself that you're not interested it.<br><br>A brief example of how good it is -  A friend of mine, Sean, always had recurring nightmares for many years, earlier in his childhood. In these nightmares, he was wearing medieval clothing, and chased by groups of men carrying torches and pitchforks through dark forests.<br><br>When he tried out the Hilarion Reading, he never even mentioned about these nightmares (in fact, he never even told anyone), but one of his questions, was, "Please describe some of my more significant past lives, and how the karma from these past lives relate to and manifest in the present lifetime".<br><br>Among the past lives described, Hilarion began describing a past life in medieval England (even gave the precise year of birth and name for that lifetime), in which he was a herbal healer, but superstitious villages soon accused him of witchcraft, and hunted him down. He was forced to flee from village to village, often fleeing into forests in the night.<br><br>Sean was quite shocked to hear this in his Reading, because he never told anyone about those dreams he had, and when he heard the description in his Reading, he realized that they were subconscious memories of that past life in medieval England.<br><br>One more good thing about this Reading, is that you don't have to be physically present. The Reader is in California, USA. But you can do the Reading right in the comfort of your own bedroom. That is to say, just submit your info via e-mail, and he'll schedule and do the Reading, and send you an audio CD of your Reading when its done.<br><br>How the Reading works :<br>At the beginning of the session, the Reader Jon begins to channel Hilarion. Using your date, time, location and full name at/of birth, (what is called the 'karmic data'), Hilarion will 'tune in' to your soul, and within a micro-second, Hilarion would have scanned through all your past lives, and gotten an overview of your entire karmic story. In addition, your guides &amp; helpers will be present and in commuincation/discussion with Hilarion, when addressing your questions.<br><br>Hilarion Reading :<br><a href="http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Hilarion" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Hilarion</a><br><br>Sincerely,<br>Kyo</div>
