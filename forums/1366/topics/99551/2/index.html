            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Sgforums/candlemagick.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: orange;">When we actually witness real magick first hand and know it is real it is something we never forget. Getting back to candle flames<br><br>Candle magick can be fun and it's easy to do. Here is a list of how to interpret the candle flame. Try it during your next ritual.<br><br><strong>A Strong Flame:</strong> this indicates that power and energy are going into your<br>desire for manifestation.<br><br>When a figure candle is used, a strong flame generally means that the person represented is winning or angry or using authority over another.<br><br>When two figure candles are present, the higher and stronger flame represents authority over the other.<br><br><strong>A Weak Flame:</strong> this can show that you are facing heavy opposition and must redo the magick several times in order to overcome the power you are facing.<br><br>The weak flame can also indicate, on a figure candle, that the subject is<br>losing the battle.<br><br>The weak flame that goes out means that you've missed<br>your target altogether, start over.<br><br><strong>A Jumping Flame: </strong>This is an attention getter. It can indicate raw emotions along with explosions of energy.<br><br><strong>Direction of flame movement: </strong><br><br>NORTH: On a waxing moon, something physical is manifesting.<br><br>EAST: something mental is manifesting.<br><br>SOUTH: in love matters, you can expect a steamy love affair that doesn't<br>last too long.<br><br>WEST: emotional aspects. A good sign of success and love. This helps you divine things by candle flame and see which way a spell is going!<br><br><strong>WAX SYMBOLS</strong><br><br>After a candle has finished burning, check the melted wax for any signs of symbols that may have formed. You may, for example, find some affirmation that your spell was succesful.<br><br><strong>DANCING/FLICKERING FLAME</strong><br><br>A dancing or flickering flame may indicate that the spellcaster is not quite clear on his/her objectives. It may also mean that bad energy is present.<br><br><strong>VIOLENT ERUPTIONS</strong><br><br>For a candle to hiss, spit or throw off sparks is generally a bad sign. These violent acts may mean that there is bad energy around. (Personally I think the Spirits just wanted attention -Maiya!) Also, though, it may be the opposite. You may see these eruptions as bursts of strong energy being sent out instead.<br><br><strong>BAD LUCK</strong><br><br>A drip of wax down the side of a candle at a seance presages bad luck or death to the person nearest to that side. <strong>Take with a pinch of salt </strong> <span class="small"> as i do not believe this at all! </span><br><br>It is considered bad luck to fall asleep with a candle burning. <span class="small">OOOOOOOPPS</span><br><br>"If a candle falls and breaks in two, double trouble will come to you!"<br><br><strong>DREAMS</strong><br>To dream of a black candle is an omen of death or illness.<br><br>To dream of a white candle is an omen of true love.<br><br>If a young woman sees two white candles in a dream it is a sign that she will soon receive a proposal of marriage<br><br>A red candle that appears in a dream symbolizes passion and sexual desire.<br><br>To dream of five candles is an omen of love and marriage.<br><br>To dream of a candle in a holder is an omen of a happy and prosperous future.<br><br>To dream of a candleholder without a candle in it foretells sorrow and misfortune.<br><br><strong>GHOSTS AND EVIL SPIRITS</strong><br><br>A blue light from a candle is a sign that good spirits are nearby.<br><br>A tall straight flame on a candle during a seance is a sign that a spirit is present.<br><br>In Ireland, it is an old funeral custom to light 12 candles around a corpse to protect the soul of the deceased from evil forces, for it is believed that ghosts and demons cannot cross into a circle of lighted Candles.<br><br>Always light candles at moments of birth, marriage and death to ensure evil spirits are kept at bay during these crucial moments.<br><br>Light a brown candle on the eve of Candlemas for protection against evil spirits and ghosts.<br><br>Place a lighted candle inside a carved-out pumpkin on All Hallows Eve to keep evil spirits and demons away.<br><br><strong>GOOD LUCK </strong><br><br>In Sicily, a fisherman burns ornate candles to their patron saint to obtain blessings and protection.<br><br>A bay-berry scented candle burned all the way down will bring "good luck to the home and gold to the pocket".<br><br>Light a brown candle in each room of your house on Candlemas Eve to attract good luck and keep away bad spirits.<br><br><span class="small">Author: Lady Tigress</span></span><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="small">~ Special Thanks To En' for her sharing &amp; contribution ~</span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><strong>THE DRUM  </strong><br><br>The Drum is the heartbeat of the world Â– alive and sacred. The different drumbeats signify your feelings and emotions. Respect means to hold the Drum in high regard, and to honor the Drum. Respect means to think with one mind. Respect means being thankful and grateful for creation, and the gift of the Drum and all our spiritual objects.<br><br>All these sacred things should have an honored place in our hearts and should be respected and not abused. The Drum is not a toy. We use the Drum to summon the spirit and Grandfathers to assist us to good health and happiness. Respect means no one under the influence of alcohol or drugs is permitted at the Drum.<br><br>The most important duty of human beings is to have respect for our Drum. If we have great reverence for the Drum, the Drum in turn will heal and enhance the well-being of your mind, your body and your spirit. The Drum is used to entice you and connect you to good spirits. The Drum is a messenger elevating manÂ’s songs to the spirit world and to the Great Spirit. At the initiating of the Drum, the Drum is given a spiritual name, followed by a feast, prayers, songs and dance.<br><br>There are many forms and procedures to cleanse and protect the Drum. First of all, through tobacco offerings. I will explain a little about the tobacco. Of all plants none was more suitable than tobacco for inducing peace or transforming manÂ’s thoughts and prayers to the four directions, and lifting them to the Great Spirit. Tobacco was an incense, sweet to the taste and fragrant to smell. No other plant was endowed with such qualities. Through immolation, tobacco as a tangible, sensible substance represent the union between man and his God. Tobacco is a messenger just like the Drum. Tobacco is a link that connects you to knowledge, connects you to your Elders, connects you to your spirit in the four directions, and to the Great Spirit and to all elements of Creation. Then there is cedar for smudging, with its clean fragrant smell entices. Sage is for smudging; sage is used to heal the sick. Sweetgrass is used for mending the ill in mind.<br><br>The Elders. The term does not apply to the number of years someone has lived. The title is given to individuals who possess intelligence, knowledge and wisdom on the history, culture, language, beliefs and customs of their people. They are the educators, healers, advisors, consultants, spiritualists, herbalists, mediums and psychics, and some parallel the work of doctors and psychologists.<br><br>The Native people of North America believe in God whom they call the Great Spirit. Knowing that all gods are in a Spirit form, which is a universal rule of mankind, they feel the presence of the Great Spirit in every object, in every person and in every place, whether it be animate and inanimate.<br><br>~Cree Teaching.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: indigo;"><span class="large">The Witches' Triangle </span><br><br>The Witches Triangle is an ethical statement.  These ethics are what keep us grounded.  Some witches get too high on their broomsticks for their own good.  These ethics are to help prevent an over-inflated ego, and to aid in making your magickal workings more powerful.<br><br>Here they are:</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">* To Know<br><br>* To Will<br><br>* To Dare<br><br>&amp; most important<br><br>* To Keep Silent    </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Okay, okay, I can hear you now!!!  "A triangle only has three sides, why does the Witches' Triangle have four?  Well, let's look at a triangle.  Start at the top point.  The top point is "To Know".  Follow it down to the bottom left point, "To Will".  Now, over to "To Dare", and then back up to the top point, "To Keep Silent".  If you only had three, it would make the shape of an L.  Now, let's look at this further.  The two ethics on the top can be seen as the most important. If you don't "Know" what you're doing, your magick won't work.  The same goes for "To Keep Silent" ... to talk about your magickal workings is to diminish their energy.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">To Know:</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">When you are going to do any magickal working, learn all you can.  Learn about the herbs you use, not only what they are used for in magick, but also what they have been used for medicinally.  Whatever God or Goddess you call upon, research them!  Find out all you can about them, their origins, their children, parents, their correspondences.  Never use anything that you aren't familiar with. Strange symbols and languages are mysterious and beautiful, but they won't help you.  In fact, using things that you aren't sure what they are can actually make your spells backfire.  Also, just because someone says this "Intergalatical Qabbalistic Symbol of Babalyon" is used for money spells, don't just take their word for it.  Research it. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">To Will:</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Take the time to re-evaluate the situation.  Do you really want to do a magickal working for this situation?  Make sure that what you are doing is in accordance with your personal ethics.  There should be no uneasy feeling about what you're going to perform.  If you feel like this might not be the best way, pack up your athame, and call in sick.  This is your will.  Don't let anyone pressure you into any magickal working, because it will be you who will face the consequences of your actions. Which brings us to number 3. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">To Dare:</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">This can be the hardest.  Before doing any magickal working, sort out all your thoughts.  Are you willing to accept any and all karmic responsibility for your actions?  If your spell shatters, are you willing to clean up the mess?<br>If you are afraid someone is going to find out about this magickal working, then don't do it, because it means you have something to hide.  Magick isn't done behind closed doors where no one can see.  The God and Goddess see everything, and you will be judged accordingly. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">To Keep Silent:</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Now, be honest with yourself, would you do this spell if there was no one to give you credit?  Are you using magick to impress or frighten people?  This is a BIG karmic No-No!!   The Goddess hates this.<br><br>Remember that magick is used to aid in improving your life.  It doesn't involve anyone else.  But what about spells you do for others?  Do you have their permission?  Do not force or press your help on them.  If they do not want a spell done, don't do it.<br><br>Remember that a spell you do and never speak of, will be 10 times stronger than a spell you tell your friends, coven members, and that really cool aunt who's into crystals and their pet's past-lives. It takes away from the energy you have put into making it.</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forget parchment, this have the potential to be wa-ay more powerful.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><span style="color: red;">Making Your Own Herbal Paper</span><br><br>Materials<br>You will need several sheets of typing paper, a bowl, hot water, a<br>fork, two kitchen twoels, a metal screen, a wooden frame, a stapler, a<br>rolling pin, and two tablespoons of ground herbs of your choice.<br><br>Procedure<br>1. Tear several sheets of paper into pieces the size of a penny or<br>smaller.<br><br>2. Place the pieces in a bowl and cover with hot water.<br><br>3. Stir to make sure all of the paper is wet.<br><br>4. Let stand overnight.<br><br>5. The next day, tear the paper into pieces as small as possible and<br>then stir with a fork for several minutes. (You now have made pulp.) This<br>can also be done in a food processor if you don't mind adding the<br>mechanical energies, but like any magical tool, you are better off doing it<br>by hand. As you stir, add in the ground herbs. They need to be ground<br>or finely chopped so that they don't create flaws in the paper.<br>Experiment with various herbs, keeping in mind thier magical qualities. The<br>pulp should remain a thick mush in texture. If this is part of a spell<br>working, chant or focus on your purpose as you do this.<br><br>6. Prepare a metal screen (like those used in windows or screen doors)<br>by stapling screen to a wood picture frame. You can use a small window<br>screen if you like. The dimensions can vary, but it should be larger<br>than you want the finished paper.<br><br>7. Smooth out an even layer of pulp (approx. 1/8 inch thick) onto the<br>screen by hand.<br><br>8. Let the water drain for a couple of minutes.<br><br>9. Flip your screen over so that your paper pops out onto a clean<br>kitchen towel.<br><br>10. Cover the paper with another kitchen towel so that you have a<br>"sandwich" of paper between the two towels.<br><br>11. Use the rolling pin to press out more water and flatten the paper.<br><br>12. Carefully peel off the top towel. Turn the wet paper over onto<br>either a smooth counter top or on a piece of glass (you can use a window<br>for this) paper side down, and then carefully peel off the remaining<br>towel.<br><br>13. Let the paper dry overnight or longer.<br><br>14. If you want to smooth the paper for writing on, spray the dried<br>paper with a fine mist of water. Place a clean smooth rag over the damp<br>paper and iron it with a slightly warm iron until the paper is dry.<br><br>You can use your paper for gifts, for spell work, for stationery or<br>just for plain fun!

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Magickal Times</span></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE SEASONS </span><br><br>The powerful effects of the seasons can also, according to some Earth magicians, subtly affect magickal workings. Traditionally, these types of magick are performed during these seasons:<br><br>SPRING: A time for healing; purification spring cleaning is one survival of this); psychic awareness; paying bills; fertility; planting magickal gardens; &amp; ecological rituals. Air magick.<br><br>SUMMER: A time for love, marriage, friendship, beauty, protection, courage, magickal energy, physical energy, &amp; strength. Fire magick.<br><br>AUTUMN: A time for money, employment, new possessions (including cars &amp; homes). Water magick.<br><br>WINTER: A time for banishments of disease, habits &amp; addictions, seeking past lives. This is a time for introspection, meditation, reading, &amp; magickal exercises designed to renew the magician for the coming spring. Earth magick.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPECIAL TIMES </span><br><br>LIGHTNING STORMS: are periods of intense energy. All spells cast during storms will be empowered by them, and may prove to be more effective. Protection rituals are ideal at these times.<br><br>RAINSTORMS: are fine for purification, love, compassion, friendship, beauty rituals, &amp; releasing guilt &amp; jealousy.<br><br>SNOWSTORMS: are the time for gentle magick, purification, &amp; stilling emotions. Release unrequited love.<br><br>HEAVY WINDS: empower rites designed to break addictions, assist study, &amp; travel spells.<br><br>SEARING HOT DAY: charge rites of protection, courage, &amp; energy.<br><br>SOLAR &amp; LUNAR ECLIPSES: are dramatic moments both for their observers as well as for magicians. In the past, magicians were urged not to perform magick during eclipses. Today, many natural magicians use the suggestive power of an eclipse to fuel spells involving banishments, including the destruction of disease. These have been some timing suggestions. Let them be guides, not shackles!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE SUN </span><br><br>Some magicians may wait months for the sun to enter the proper sign of the Zodiac. This is fine for major workings but unrealistic for those who are working everyday magick. However, there are other solar cycles worth following... If you have the time. If not, don't wait.<br><br>SUNRISE: Day begins as light stretches out from the eastern horizon. This is an excellent time to perform rituals involving purification, business success, study, employment, breaking addictions of all kinds, travel, releasing guilt &amp; jealousy, healing diseases, &amp; the conscious mind.<br><br>NOON: The sun shines far above at full strength. This is fine for all sunrise ritual purposes, as well as those that involve magickal energy, physical energy &amp; strength, protection, money &amp; courage.<br><br>SUNSET: The sun slips below the western horizon, signaling the time for breaking addictions, weight-loss, banishing misery &amp; pain, transforming anguish &amp; negative habits.<br><br>NIGHT: The sun is out of sight This is the drowsy time for beauty, dreams, psychic dreams, psychic awareness, spirituality, sleep, sex, purification, love, friendships, peace, releasing stress, healing wounds.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE MOON </span><br><br>The moon waxes &amp; wanes each month, rising an hour or so later during each twenty-four hour period. When it is full, it rises as the sun sets. There are different types of spells traditionally performed at the phases of the moon. More complicated patterns exist, relating to the specific day of each lunar month, but these methods are rarely followed today. The Moon's phases &amp; the types of magick appropriate to them are:<br><br>WAXING MOON: (From New to Full) When the Moon is waxing it is a time for beginnings, health &amp; healing, psychic awareness, beauty, fertility &amp; all positive magickal workings.<br><br>FULL MOON: All positive magickal spells are performed beneath the potent glow of the Full Moon, including protection, love, healing, purification, psychic awareness, money &amp; travel.<br><br>WANING MOON: (From Full to New) This is the time for banishments of habits, addictions, disease &amp; negative thoughts. Jealousy, guilt, &amp; hurts are released under the waning Moon. Te old is swept away to make room for the new. </span></strong></div>
