            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: violet;"><span class="large">~*~ The Chakras ~*~</span><br><br><img src="http://mindbodyconnectionsite.com/grfx/chakras.jpg"><br><br><span class="normal">The Hindus and Buddhists have used chakras for thousands of years in meditation and yogic practice. The chakras are centers of light energy, rising from the root chakra at the base of the spine , which is a denser, warmer, hevier vibration, and more connected to earth; to the crown chakra at the top of the head, which is a lighter, finer, faster frequency, and more connected to the heavens. Each chakra has a particular color, sound, quality, body area or organ, animal, food, gemstone, and planet associated with it. The colors range from red to purple, just as in the light spectrum. Here is a simple description of the seven major chakras.<br><br>Red- survival, grounding, safety, security, cocyx bone, legs, knees, ankles, feet, skin, colon, bones.<br><br>Orange- sexuality, clairsentience, creative life force, pelvis, reproductive organs, lower back, bladder.<br><br>Yellow- Physical Willpower, motivation, vitality, instinct, digestion, stomach, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, spleen, middle spine, kidneys, adrenal glands, intestines.<br><br>Green- Love, compassion, emotional empathy, heart, thymus gland, breasts, lungs, upper back, shoulders, arms, hands.<br><br>Blue- Self expression, clairaudience, throat, thyroid gland, neck, jaw, teeth, ears, sinuses.<br><br>Purple- Vision, psychic sight, clairvoyance, telepathy, third eye, pineal and pituitary glands, eyes.<br><br>White- Spritual consciousness, direct knowing, crown of head, brain, scalp, hair.<br><br>(note: Some people exchange violet for white, but I learned the crown chakra as white, so that is what I will use.)<br><br>When the chakras are open and balanced in relation to each other, they allow the free flow of subtle energies throughout the body. They cannot be seen with the physical eyes, but their energies can be seen with the third eye.<br><br>The chakras rotate in the center of the physical body, opening to the outside world through both the front and back. Sometimes the rotation is clockwise, sometimes counterclockwise. It is best to allow your chakras to choose their own direction.<br><br>When a chakra is closed, shut down, or blocked in some way by a repressed emotion or memory, it can lead to physical symptoms. An obvious example to most people is that when we are afraid to express our feelings, sometimes our throat tightens up. The throat chakra is the center of self-expression and verbal creativity. When grief is enourmous and prolonged, the heart chakra tends to become so overwhelmed with this pain, that it can affect the physical heart and the intercoastal muscles in the chest.<br><br>When we deal with our emotions as they arise, rather than repress them down into our bodies, we can often prevent these physical symptoms. The more science learns about the interconnections between the body, emotions, and thoughts, the more it finds itself agreeing with many of the mystical traditions of the east and west.<br><br>The chakras give us a way to work with both prevention and treatment of disease by keeping them open and flowing with energy through meditation. Eventually, you will want to open the chakras with the appropriate color, but it is best to start small. Once you have become comfortable with your meditation, using color is the next step. In doing these meditations, you will also learn which chakras are open and which may be holding emotions and memories that you need to confront. Most people have two or three chakras that produce physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual symptoms.</span></span></strong><br><br><img src="http://goto.bilkent.edu.tr/gunes/Chakras/chakrasfigure3.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.geocities.com/magicalyourself/wicca.JPG"><br><br><strong><span class="large">~*~ Wiccan Traditions ~*~</span><br><br>There are many "traditions" in Wicca. Each individual seeks and follows what is right for them. Some are based on ancient ways, handed down from one generation to another. Others are "newer" meaning that although they may have been "incorported" in more modern times they too are valid and have a lot to offer. The greatest strength Wicca possesses is its individuality. The following list of traditions is incomplete.  There are as many traditions, possibly, as there are witches.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Alexandrian Wicca<br>Founded in England during the 1960's by Alexander Sanders, self-proclaimed "King of the Witches." An offshoot of Gardnerian, Alexandrian covens focus strongly upon training, emphasizing on areas more generally associated with ceremonial magic, such as Qabalah, Angelic Magic and Enochian. The typical Alexandrian coven has a hierarchical structure, and generally meets on weekly, or at least on Full Moons, New Moons and Sabbats. Rituals are usually done skyclad. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Amythystian Wicca<br>Founded in 1968 by Lady Amethyst. This tradition is rooted in the Order of the Garter, Order of the Royal Oak. It is a traditional group with lots of Hermetic beliefs. Dedicated to preserving old traditions. Teaches by example in daily life, at home and at work, as well as when among our own. Known through work and deeds. Adheres to a strict code of ethics as exemplified by The Rede. </span><br><br><span style="color: orange;">Aquarian Tabernacle Church<br>This is an American Tradition of Wicca based on English Traditional Wicca. It is devoted to the service of the Wiccan and Pagan community. Founded in 1979, the church is based in Washington state, USA, and is a fully tax exempt legal Wiccan church in the USA, Canada and Australia. </span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">British Traditional Wicca<br>The term "British Traditional" refers to a variety of traditions that originated in the British Isles and which have certain characteristics in common. Worship of the God and Goddess, covens are co-ed, and there is a degree system. </span><br><br><span style="color: black;">Celtic Wicca<br>This tradition actually includes a number of individual traditions which follow the Celtic pantheons and celtic holidays. Each path is unique and stands alone, or can be combined with another and still be part of the Celtic tradition. It is primarily derived from the ancient pre-Christian Celtic religions of Gaul and the British Isles. As it is practiced today, most of the Celtic paths are part of the Neo-Pagan revival, focusing on Nature and healing with group and individual rituals that honor the Ancient Shining Ones and the Earth. Most are very eclectic, and hold to the Celtic myths, divinities, magic and rituals. Celtic paths are some of the more popular traditions. Many Celtic traditions are still practiced today in many of the more remote British Isles </span><br><br><span style="color: green;">Ceremonial Wicca<br>Uses a great deal of Ceremonial Magick in practices. Mostly derived from the works of Aleister Crowley, who derived much of his work from Albertus Magnus. Rituals have a flavor of Egyptian magick, as well as Qabalistic rituals.</span><br><br><span style="color: olive;">Dianic Wicca<br>There are two distinct branches of Dianic Wicca: The first Dianic coven in the U.S. was formed in the late 1960's by Morgan McFarland and Mark Roberts. This branch gives primacy to the Goddess in its theology, but honors the Horned God as Her beloved Consort. Covens include both women and men.<br>The other branch, Feminist Dianic Witchcraft, focuses exclusively on the Goddess and consists of women only covens. These tend to be loosely structured and non-hierarchial, and simple, creative, experimental ritual. For both branches rituals are eclectic; some are derived from Gardnerian and Faery traditions, while others have been created anew</span>.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Eclectic Wicca<br>Refers to groups and individuals not following any one particular Tradition, but incorporating elements of several, according to the training, preferences and experiences of the practitioners. Deities from several pantheons may be invoked, sometimes even in the same ritual, particularly when a working is being created for a specific cause. This is the fastest growing branch of Wicca today. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Faerie Wicca - Faerie Witchcraft<br>This type of Wicca works with the fey in a fairly traditional Celtic Wicca frame. Faerie Witchcraft, on the other hand, is also a loose association of people who practice Faerie magick and work with the Faerie realm, but do not use a Wiccan format and are more shamanic in nature. </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Gardnerian Wicca<br>This is a closed initiatory Tradition which was founded in England in 1953 by Gerald Gardner and further developed by Doreen Valiente and others. Gardner was supposedly initiated into a coven of Witches in the New Forest region of England in 1939 by a High Priestess named Old Dorothy Clutterbuck. In 1949 he wrote High Magic's Aid, a novel about medieval Witchcraft in which quite a bit of the Craft as practiced by the coven was used. By 1951 the last of the English laws against Witchcraft were repealed and Gardner published Witchcraft Today, which set forth a version of rituals and traditions of the New Forest coven. Gardnerian Wicca borrows very heavily from Freemasonry, Tantric Hinduism and a touch of ceremonial magick. Gardnerian covens are always headed by a High Priestess and have three degrees of initiation closely paralleling the Masonic degrees. Worship is centered on the Goddess and the Horned God. Eight seasonal Sabbats are observed, and the Wiccan Rede is the guiding principle. </span></strong><br></div>

Covens are led by a High Priest and Priestess and may determine for themselves whether to work robed or skyclad. Rituals are open, and decisions are made democratically. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Shamanic Witchcraft<br>This term refers to practices associated with those of tribal shamans in traditional Pagan cultures throughout the world. A shaman combines the roles of healer, priest(ess), diviner, magician, teacher and spirit guide, utilizing altered states of consciousness to produce and control psychic phenomena and travel to and from the spirit realm. Followers of this path believe that historical Witchcraft was the shamanic practice of European Pagans; and Medieval Witches actually functioned more as village shamans than as priests and priestesses of the "Old Religion." Shamanic Witchcraft emphasizes serving the wider community through rituals, herbalism, spellcraft, healings, counseling, rites of passage, handfastings, Mystery initiations, etc. The distinguishing element of Shamanic Witchcraft is the knowledge and sacramental use of psychotropic plants to effect transitions between worlds. The theory and practice of Shamanic Witchcraft has permeated widely though out many other established Traditions. </span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Stregheria<br>Stregheria is the form of witchcraft native to Italy; there are several distinct traditions sharing common roots in various parts of Italy. Also called "La Vecchia Religione," (The Old Religion) Stregheria is a nature-based religion. It's followers worship the forces of Nature, personified by gods and goddesses. The witches of La Vecchia Religione are called Streghe (plural), with the title Strega (for a female) and Stregone (for a male). Stregheria is rooted in the folk religion of the Latins (the Romans being one Latin people) and the Etruscans. In the Aridian tradition, taught by Raven Grimassi in Ways of the Strega, the pantheon is different from the urban gods of the Romans, though some of those deities were shared with the Latins and the Etruscans. The most notable is Diana, whose worship was focused at a temple at Lake Nemi in the Alban Hills. There are also other traditions of Stregheria in Italy, who may worship the urban gods of the Romans. If anyone one thing sets the Streghe apart from other Wiccans is the Rede. Streghe do not follow the rede and believe in hexing, cursing and binding as taught to them by the Aradia, Queen of Witches. </span><br><br><span style="color: black;">Wiccan Shamanism<br>Founded by Selena Fox in the 1980's. It is ecumenical and multicultural in its focus. A combination of Wicca, humanistic psychology and a variety of shamanistic practices from around the world. Emphasis on healing. Uses traditional shamanistic techniques to change consciousness, such as drumming and ecstatic dancing</span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

The sabbats start of with Samhain, the wiccan "new year", and end with Mabon, or Winter Finding.  The sabbats are all related to the cycle of the seasons, and some view it in terms of the life of the god, who is born at yule, passes over on Samhain and is reborn the next yule.  Sabbats may be celebrated on the actual day, or the following weekend.<br><br>Samhain - October 31st<br><br>Samhain marks the coming of winter, and is the pagan New Year.  It is more commonly recognized, by non-Pagans, as Halloween.  This is a date that is often recognized as a time where the barriers between different planes of existence are at their thinnest.  Pagans generally use this as a time of reflection, in memory of departed loved ones.  This Sabbat also marks the symbolic death of the God, who awaits his re-birth with the coming of Yule.  It is now that we celebrate the turning of the wheel of the year.<br><br>Yule - Winter Solstice (occurs on or near the 21st of December on the Winter Solstice)<br><br>Yule is celebrated on the Winter Solstice.  It is on this day that the God is symbolically reborn.  This is the shortest day of the year, and the days continually get longer, after this day.  The sun was often recognized as the symbol of the God, in ancient religions.  Most Pagans believe in reincarnation.  This cycle of life and death for the God, are symbolic of the belief in life from death.<br><br>Imbolic - February 1st or 2nd (depending on tradition)<br><br>Imbolic is a celebration of fertility and purification.  It symbolizes awakening and inspiration.  The God is beginning to grow, and his strength (the Sun) is beginning to be noticeable.<br><br>Oestara - Spring Equinox (occurs on or near the 21st of March on the Vernal Equinox)<br><br>Oestara is the first day of true spring.  The day and night are equal in length.  Plants are budding strongly.  Some ancient Pagan traditions are still practiced on this day, such as coloring eggs (which are a symbol of fertility).<br><br>Beltane - April 30th, May 1, or May 5 depending on tradition<br><br>Beltane is commonly recognized as May Day, by non-Pagans.  It is a celebration of love and desire.  Many flowers and plants are often gathered, as decorations.  The flowers are symbolic of the Goddess.  "May Poles" were often erected (and sometimes still are), as symbols of the God.  Celebrates the union of the goddess and the god.<br><br>Midsummer - Summer Solstice (occurs on or near the 21st of June on the Summer Solstice)<br><br>Midsummer is the time of year at which nature is at it's peak strength.  This is a time when many Pagans feel it is best for rituals and spells.  Bonfires are often made, to symbolize and honor the God.<br><br>Lughnasadh (Lammas) - August 1st<br><br>Lughnasadh is observed during the beginning of harvest.  Pagans are thankful for the food with which they have been blessed.  Plants are withering, but they are also leaving seeds, a promise of their eventual re-birth.  The God is beginning to weaken and dim with age, as the days grow shorter.<br><br>Mabon or Winter Finding - Autumn Equinox (occurs on or near the 21st of September on the Autumnal Equinox)<br><br>Mabon, or Winter Finding is observed at the end of harvest.  The day and night are once again equal in length.  The God is quickly losing strength, and is preparing for his end.  Summer is over, and Winter is quickly approaching. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

We admitted to ourselves that we only had power over our lives and that we created our own realities.<br><br>2.) Being made in the image of the Lord &amp; Lady, we accepted the fact that we had the power within us to bring about changes in ourselves and our world.<br><br>3.) We made a decision to take responsibility for our lives and stop blaming others for our misfortunes.<br><br>4.) We made a fearless discovery within ourselves that we were the Beloved Children of the Lord and Lady, and that we are One with Them and the world in which we live.<br><br>5.) We admitted to The Lord &amp; Lady that we had not been living up to our Full Potential.<br><br>6.) We became open to the belief that Magick could be used to bring about changes in ourselves and our conditon.<br><br>7.) We invoked the Lord and Lady during a sacred ritual and asked Them to witness the Transformation in our lives that we were going to bring about as a result of being Wiccan.<br><br>8.) We took an Oath that we would do what we willed, so long as we did not harm anyone--- including ourselves.<br><br>9.) We came to realize that All Life is both Sacred and Interconnected, and the Earth is Our Great Mother, without whom we would cease to exist.<br><br>10.) We accepted the fact that as adherents of a Nature Religion, we should not seek to subdue nature, but rather become one with it.<br><br>11.) We realized that we are stewards of the Land and not Masters over it.<br><br>12.) We sought through Ritual, Meditation and Visualization, to know and understand the will of the Ancient Ones, so that we would be One with Them, not in opposition to Them.<br><br>13.) Having a personal relationship with the Lord and Lady, we opened ourselves to share the Knowlege and Wisdom that They had given us, yet allowing others to discover their own Truths as well. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
