Sometimes you dun wan someone else to help becos you dun think they cld ever understand.<br><br>And you wld be right too... cos no one can fully truly understand you but yourself.  Another problem is possibly refusing to admit something is wrong to the extent you need help.  Maybe its the stigma like Harry said.<br><br>Or maybe you believe or want to believe that you can overcome it yourself.  Sometimes its like that especially if you have a bit of pride.<br><br>My kinda mental issues are boring.

My cousin has mild depression 4 yrs ago and he kept it from us. When we found out (after 1 yr), he insisted that he kept it under control and it was ok.  His guardians chose to believe him 'coz they did not know very much about depression. This problem drags until now.  Last year, his condition grew so bad that it became early psychosis.  He became suspicous of everything/everyone and treat everyone badly. His condition grew bad that we had to send him to IMH.  The consultant of IMH told us if he was treated early, it might not turn into early psychosis.<br><br>Consulting a psychologist is not really something to be ashamed of. They are there to help you.  If money is the issue, ask your friend to go to a polyclinic and get a reference letter to a hospital that has Psychology department (Mount E or NUH...not sure Gleneagles have or not).  That way, your consultation charges will be minimized.<br></div>

Sometimes you dun wan someone else to help becos you dun think they cld ever understand.<br><br>And you wld be right too... cos no one can fully truly understand you but yourself.  Another problem is possibly refusing to admit something is wrong to the extent you need help.  Maybe its the stigma like Harry said.<br><br>Or maybe you believe or want to believe that you can overcome it yourself.  Sometimes its like that especially if you have a bit of pride.<br><br>My kinda mental issues are boring. The life not worth living and nothing/no one worth living for, and also the nothing worth doing type of moments get me sometimes.  Always do things that I dun really wanna do but end up doing anyway.<br><br>Suicide thoughts may enter but I know the moment hasnt come to end it yet.  Though in a twisted way, I wonder when.<br><br>So yah my issues will probably be waved off by people as naive and dumb or what lar.. Like I said I m quite comfortable with them now.</div></blockquote>thank you all for your wonderful response, i will stand by her and she is also very happy about the response that she has read from you guys.<br><br>i hope u are feeling better now KFDugong.</div>

My cousin has mild depression 4 yrs ago and he kept it from us. When we found out (after 1 yr), he insisted that he kept it under control and it was ok.  His guardians chose to believe him 'coz they did not know very much about depression. This problem drags until now.  Last year, his condition grew so bad that it became early psychosis.  He became suspicous of everything/everyone and treat everyone badly. His condition grew bad that we had to send him to IMH.  The consultant of IMH told us if he was treated early, it might not turn into early psychosis.<br><br>Consulting a psychologist is not really something to be ashamed of. They are there to help you.  If money is the issue, ask your friend to go to a polyclinic and get a reference letter to a hospital that has Psychology department (Mount E or NUH...not sure Gleneagles have or not).  That way, your consultation charges will be minimized.<br></div></blockquote><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet Sweetie,<br><br>Thanks for sharing this experience with us, I am sure it will ring a bell in those in need of it...
