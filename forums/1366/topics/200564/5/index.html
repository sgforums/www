The experimental group, composed of 25 participants, received meditation training from Jon Kabat-Zinn, who developed a mindfulness-based stress-reduction program at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.

"It was startling that such a short intervention could produce a change." Plans for more research on the impact of meditation are under way.
