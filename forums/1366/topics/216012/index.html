They are found around the bottom of a natural earth pyramid, several stories high. They are uncovered as the earth erodes from them, and are found growing on stems. Geologists say this pyramid in southwest Kansas, is at the heart of the United States.<br><br>What are they? Alive Stones?<br><br>Boji'sÂ® are something of an enigma. They've been seen by the experts, but they aren't sure just what they are - crystalline forms of iron? Pseudomorphs, (wherein organic or mineral substances are replaced with, in this case, metal)?At least one specimen seems to be a fossilized vertebra of some ancient animal, in which the bone had been replace with a form of pyrite.<br><br>A BojiÂ® is a 7.4 hardness. Unlike and other stone, they are held together by the energy within them. One geologist said that they reminded him of the human or animal body that is held together also by the energy of life within it. When that energy level leaves, the body decays and the chemical and mineral elements turn to dust.<br><br>BojiÂ® is a trademark name since 1972. It is a BojiÂ® only if it comes from BojiÂ®, Inc. From BojiÂ®, Inc. you are getting a living BojiÂ® with energy activated. We are not just selling a stone - we are sharing with mankind an energy to benefit the life energy dimension.<br><br>Whatever they are, BojiÂ® stones emit forceful, projective energies, with the resultant effects of calming, grounding and healing. One women said that holding a stone in her hand removed the pain from it.<br><br>They are certainly protective, in that they charge up our psychic defenses. As for their other uses, maybe we'll discover then together.<br><br>Energy: Projective<br>Planet: Mars<br>Elements: Fire, Akasha<br>Powers: Power, Protection, Healing, Balancing Energies</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/BojiStonesTitle.gif"></div>

This was not the discovery of their presence; others knew they were there but considered them to be worthless little black rocks. Rather, this was the beginning of the discovery of their essence and purpose. When Karen first saw the stones, she thought they were alive because she could feel the energy that had been locked within them since the birth of the planet-she could feel them wiggle like Mexican jumping beans! That was the basis of a mysterious feeling of connection with them, which never faltered during what became her mission to prove their worth.<br><br>Karen and Jerry Gillespie is the "Keeper of the BojiÂ®." Karen and Jerry operate BojiÂ®, Inc. out of their home and have trademarked the name. Their house is alive with BojiÂ® energy and there is a steady stream of people who come there to learn, to share, to listen and to buy. Because a psychic channel told Karen to "value the ones you have for no more will be created," the GillespieÂ’s handle each rock with the same loving care that Karen did as a child.<br><br>Boji'sÂ® are gathered, not mined. After a heavy rain, Karen goes out into the fields and hunts for BojiÂ® stones which are uncover by mother nature's cleansing.</strong><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/gr_DSCN1191.jpg"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Batch of BojiÂ® Stones are uncovered as the earth erodes </span></span></div>

No one knew where the name came from because I had been raised in close connection with animals and made mostly animal sounds at that age. However, people interpreted this as my inability to pronounce something correctly.<br><br>My grandfather took me to a mound of earth on his land that looked like a pyramid I saw these little black stones sitting on stems. I picked one up, held it, and felt it pulsate. I looked up at my grandfather and asked him if they were Boji'sÂ® You see, the stones were black and shiny like my pet crow's feathers, and they were surrounded by little mounds of earth that looked like nests. I thought they must have been eggs laid by my crow! That was the beginning of the name". </span></strong><br><br></div>

Karen decided that the center one was a chauvinistic and had a harem!  The crystallized center stones are found as large as 5 pounds at the most.  Females outnumber males in nature, males are usually heavier in weight, and males are "showier" than females in most species (for example, birds).  Therefore, prices are higher for "males" simply because there are less of them.<br><br>Each BojiÂ® has an electromagnetic energy with a negative and a positive side. For purposes of physical energy balancing or healing, normally two stones are paired, one of which is crystallized or "male", the other is which is smooth or "female".  The male stone is placed on the weak side of the body (either the side that is damaged, or the left side for right-handed people or vice versa).  However, two smooth or two rough stones can also be paired.  In this instance, the stone that is heavier should be placed on the weak side. Karen is now assembling twenty years of notes, knowledge and channeled information on the BojisÂ®.  A book containing more detailed information on all subjects touched upon this brochure, especially the specific use of BojisÂ® for physical balancing and the healing of a variety of physical conditions, will be forthcoming. </strong><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/femaleboji.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">~ Female Boji ~</span></span></div>

The rock we chose to become a BojiÂ® was rusting and rotting away.  (It was dying).  The rock needed special preparation to keep it alive. Through channeling, I was given wisdom from ancient Masters of Alchemy.  I use the secrets of esoteric science in preparing the rock to become a BojiÂ®.  Alter cleaning the rock it is fed for many days.  It is again washed, purified by astral light and then is activated by terrestrial essences.  Then and only then is it a BojiÂ®, a container of balanced energy and thamaturgic power.  This then is the birth of the BojiÂ®.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;">The following is from "Body, Mind and Spirit" Magazine, June 1989<br>The Amazing Boji </span></span><br><br>Boji Stones are the newest rage since crystals ranging in color from dark gray to black,  and on a rare occasion, beautiful rainbow colors.  These oval stones come in pairs, male and female.  Both are rough in texture and opaque.  The male stone has tiny angular projections while the female is smooth.  They are found among fossils and petrified bones near slate.  As the rain washes away the slate, Boji's emerge on stems looking like rock mushrooms.<br><br>Boji's are rumored to possess balancing powers and are excellent for healing.  Those who are sensitive to vibrations of stones note an immediate sensation of energy when the rocks are held.  It is claimed that the Boji's are held together by the energy within them which can be augmented by the loving attention of their owners, and if the stones are neglected they will gradually turn to dust.<br>We received a pair of Boji's to test and most of the office staff felt a strong energy from them.  One staff member successfully used them to relieve a headache.<br><br><span class="large">The following is one authors scientific view of the Boji Stone.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Other geologists think they are some form of meteorite!<br>By Michael Nisbet </span><br><br>As we transit into the new era of relative enlightenment, an interesting phenomena has become observable.  Individually we aspire and grow spiritually, thereby collectively, then our range of contacts in all realms expands correspondingly.  The interesting phenomena is that because of the accelerated growth that humanity is experiencing, "new" discoveries of minerals and crystals not seen before are surfacing on the market.  It is no coincidence that this is occurring.  These "new" discoveries are happening at an increasing rate and are exciting indeed!  I could list several stones here, but will limit discussion to the Boji stone.<br><br>The area is which they are found is an erosional area sculpted by climatic forces into a uniquely beautiful area referred to as the "badlands".  This area covers many square miles.<br><br>Eons ago, this area was submerged under an in-land sea, where countless marine organisms thrived.  As time marched on, this sea began to dwindle and evaporate as the land began to rise and the climate shifted drastically.<br><br>Consequently, the old sea floor was no longer covered by water and countless tons of sediment.  This floor was covered by marine organisms that had flourished and died.<br><br>Later, conditions were correct for fossilization of the shells and hard parts of various invertebrates, among them brachiopods.  These brachiopods, after fossilization, became concretions.  The iron sulfides in inherent in the decaying organisms attracted more sulfides in the environment until a rough disk or spherical shape or shell surrounded by original fossil.  Eons later, through more earth changes, the metamorphic process of heat and pressure altered these concretions to the point that the metallic including trace amounts of palladium were drawn in.<br><br>It is in the opinion of the author that this palladium present is responsible for the fact that the Boji Stones are effective healing stones.  Palladium is a rare metal, more scarce than gold, or even platinum, and vibrates at a very high frequency.  Rutgers University Geology Department did a study on Boji Stones and found that through kirilian photography, Boji stones were seen to have a very powerful electromagnetic energy field.  Many stones were seen to have four nodal points of energy extrusion.<br><br>I have worked with Boji stones for three years now, and have had an opportunity to objectively observe certain phenomena after some experimentation.  It was observed that the Boji stones tend to catalyze a balancing process.  For example, if an organic system such as the liver or the spleen were deficient or low in energy, the Boji stone could be held near that area and would tangibly stimulate it by channeling pranic energy.  This would continue until a state of equilibrium had been reached through repeated applications.  In addition, it has been observed that the Boji stones definitely affect a grounding energy.  Boji stones are also useful when a person is around a lot of crystal energies, such as a gem show, or around significant crystal collections.  The grounding afforded by the Boji stone prevents from crystal-burn out or over amplification.  If the person tends to be a space cadet, the Boji helps them to remain more earthbound.<br><br>I realize that my own perceptions and observations are subjective and necessarily limited.  Having listened to feedback from many persons I have supplied with Boji stones, it has universally been observed that the Boji's are effective in bringing about a state of harmony or balance and that they do tend to ground energies.  Further experimentation with Boji stones in the hands of many open minded and intuitive people will undoubtedly will reveal other attributes not yet discovered. </span></strong><br><br></div>
