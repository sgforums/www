All who have a session with me, i would be able to give a clearer, insight informations pertaining to their issues &amp; provide them with some resolutions within my means. Thanks for your compliment, well my rates are reasonable. Tarot Full Reading takes about an hour with maximum of 3 issues within the time frame, its a full package, usually the querant would have more than 1 issue to seek clarification. This is much more worth it rather than spending on Single Reading which is about 20 minutes, A single Reading would just be a little lower in cost however if you have another issue, i would have to charge accordingly. End of the day if you do 3 Single Readings, the total cost would be much higher than my Full Reading Consultation.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
