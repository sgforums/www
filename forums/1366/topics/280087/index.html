These people must let go of many negative mental patterns accumulated from past lives if they are to access the inherent power in this card. There are many who do and who have reached the very heights of recognition. This is also a card of sexual enjoyment. If this sensuous side is allowed to dominate, much time and energy is wasted that would otherwise elevate them to great accomplishment. The Nine of Clubs is here to end a major cycle in their soul's development, a completion that should see them giving their wealth of knowledge to the world. There are some debts to be paid, especially to those of the Queen of Hearts card and their own families, but once these debts are paid, they can proceed with their cosmic task of enlightening the world. Financially, they are always assisted by Diamond men and they do well in their own business if they don't let the pursuit of money spoil their spiritual values. They cannot be totally materialistic or mercenary even if they try. Some of their life challenges revolve around honesty and integrity. They are often involved with others who are not so high in these areas and this can pull them down. They are here to learn to focus their mental power and stick to a philosophy that will guide them through the ups and downs of life.</div>

They have a heavier load than most, indicated by their position in the Saturn line. But if they work hard, they will receive the blessing of being in the Jupiter column. Their Six of Diamonds Karma Card tells us that there is a karmic debt to pay on a financial or 'value' basis. Often they are associated with Six of Diamonds people, who are the collectors of these debts. The Three of Spade can represent indecision about work or health and the Three of Spade people should watch their health carefully. The more they worry about their health, often the worse their condition gets ,so they have a responsibility to watch their thoughts and feelings as they relate to health matters. With such a strong, creative urge, they can also spread themselves too thin and get stressed out at times. Having the Queen of Spades with the Ten of Diamonds in Jupiter gives them the opportunity for great business success through mastery of their inner values. This can be one of their best avenues for satisfaction in life. If they just get clear about what is most important to them in their life, everything they need and want will come to them. Being a three brings a huge amount of creativity and this can also bring the temptation to tell half-truths or stories to make their lives easier. This is especially true because of their Jack of Diamonds Karma Card. They can easily tell stories that are believed by others and never run out of marketable ideas. However, with the Jack of Clubs in their Saturn position, they will always meet with some disappointment or problems if they stray from strict honesty. Only the path of highest integrity and the willingness to put forth an honest work effort will bring them the success they want. Among them are some of the most successful artists in the world.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Queen of Hearts Person<br><br>The Mother Card<br><br>As the 'double Neptune' card, the Queen of Hearts has its share of idealism. All of these people possess a certain charm and magnetism that attracts others. They are the 'mothers of love' and share this love with all they come in contact with. They either get married and devote themselves to family or get involved in some professional career. They have more than average ability to be a success in many professions and especially good luck in professions where men predominate. These people are very sweet, attractive, sociable and loving. They can be very successful artists or performers and all have an appreciation for art and beauty. Many are aware of and make use of their abundance of psychic or musical ability. As long as their idealism is guided by truth, they can live the life of love and nurturing that is their birthright. This is the "Loving Mother" card. Their calling in life has to include sharing their love with others and the more, the better. When operating on the lower levels, they can be overly self-indulgent, lazy, frivolous, and into the 'good life'. This is a card of enjoyment of the sensual pursuits and experiences. There are many co-dependents, escapists, and alcoholics among the Queen of Hearts as well. Once they set their sights in line with their high ideals and are ready to renounce laziness and complacency, there is no limit to how high they can climb in their work and career.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;"> I AM The King of Hearts Person<br><br>The Father Card<br><br>Standing at the top of the suit of love, the King of Hearts recognizes that love is the highest power of all. These people make devoted parents, but not always the best spouses. Their devotion to their children and profession often displaces the love they would give their spouse. They do love everyone, forever, its true, but sometimes the wrong associations bring problems. They should be careful of mixing with people with lower motives and lifestyles in this regard. These people can be overbearing, as all Kings can, but this is only the case when they have been betrayed by those they hold closest to their hearts. From past lives, they bring with them the knowledge of mastery of their emotions and of their family life. Consider yourself blessed if they consider you to be one of their 'family'. The King of Hearts can excel in business, especially as a dealer or advisor in the finances of others. They have more success in association with others or in partnerships than alone. They have better than average luck in legal matters as well. It is not wise to argue with them. Their keen minds can always find a suitable response. There are inevitable losses of loved ones in their lives but they know the truth and can let go though they still feel the pain. Many of them are mentally gifted and sometimes psychic. Much knowledge just flows to them and they use this to rise up to the top in their careers.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Nine of Diamonds Person<br><br>The Card of Universal Values and The Giver's Card<br><br>Nine of Diamonds people are here to 'let go' and complete a major chapter in the evolution of their soul and personality. This entails a lot of giving to others and being willing to release both people and material things from their life when the time comes. If they have not heeded the call to give and let go of others, money, relationships, and love, their life can be filled with disappointment and remorse. Those on the positive side are philanthropic and generous, happy and productive. All have the opportunity to experience first hand, the heightened consciousness that comes from living a 'universal' life. Despite losses from time to time, these people can do very well in business, especially when it involves selling or other creative enterprises. They are great at promoting things they believe in. They are great talkers and communicators. Many become counselors, if not professionally, then at least with their friends and family. If they keep their values in proper perspective, they may even attain affluence. A disregard for the higher laws will inevitably result in misfortune and misery. They should be careful while driving and when taking any kind of risks and chances. They can be reckless or accident prone. They also have great minds and many are attracted to some professional work that allows them to use their intellectual abilities. One of the challenges of the Nine of Diamonds is to develop and use their charm and power to do some good work. Many of them are destined to make great contributions to the world, often by leading others to a higher form of knowledge or understanding.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  *hurries to save the world*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Seven of Diamonds Person<br><br>The Card of Spiritual Values<br><br>The Seven of Diamonds is one of those unique cards called a 'semi-fixed' card. As part of a special family of seven uniquely different cards, these people fall into a different category and have a special mark on their lives. They are very stubborn, but they are also extremely creative and some are destined to become millionaires in this life by accessing the high side of this spiritual money card. By suit, they are always connected with money. As a spiritual number, they must maintain a non-attached attitude about money or there will be continuous problems in this area. We find they are either worrying about it all the time or not worrying and having as much as they like. Regardless, many of their life lessons will come through this avenue. The other avenue is their close relationships. Family, lovers and friends are all very important to the Seven of Diamonds person. They have close ties, for better or worse, with their family and share in their trials. They have a high, spiritual love nature that often entails making personal sacrifices for their family and other close relationships. There is little they wouldn't do on behalf of their parents or family. This is one of the most spiritual cards in the deck and as such, their success comes from approaching life in ways other than traditional or materialistic. The most successful among them are the ones that live in the faith that all their needs will always be provided. They are usually restless, making frequent changes in either occupation or location. Their love life usually entails sacrifice and disappointment until they learn to let others go and be as they are. In their spiritual studies they find inner satisfaction and validation for their own intuition. Once on the spiritual path, everything in their life is put into proper perspective and they can excel in any chosen field.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Eight of Spades Person<br><br>The Power Through Work Card<br><br>As the 'Eight of Eights', the power card of power cards, the Eight of Spades has the heaviest burden and obligation to use his or her power for good. All of them are tempted to take this power and use it to escape from their fears and avoid facing themselves from time to time. They are here to work and make a contribution and ultimately this must take priority above their romantic life. These are the workers and the workaholics of the deck. Their power is expressed through action and the force of their indomitable will. It would seem natural that those with the greatest power at their disposal would be most likely to abuse it. Merely having the gift of such power could be the justification to use it any way we choose. One might think to oneÂ’s self, "If I am given such power, it must mean that I am to use it and that I am right". Nothing could be farther from the truth and the Eight of Spades, and all the other Eights for that matter, are the ones that suffer from the results of actions based on that misconception. Spades take us into the spiritual realms though most Spade people cannot remove their attention from material gain and mastery. Success is almost easy for them, as long as they are willing to work for it - many of these people are workaholics. They know that they possess great power. The test comes in how they choose to use it. They need to be admired and will work hard for it. They make good providers and will often try to marry those of means also. They can handle obstacles, which often serve as a measure of their true abilities. They have a profound healing power, and if directed, can transform the lives of those they meet. Part of their life challenge involves developing a more positive attitude about life amid the changes that life is sure to bring their way from time to time. Study of spiritual subjects always brings healing and more personal freedom.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Jack of Clubs Person<br><br>The Mentally Creative Card<br><br>Creative, dishonest, or a mixture of both? As we can imagine, those who are the most creative can also be the most dishonest and vice versa. Here is a card of mental and financial creativity and these people are no lazy bones. Their brilliant minds are far ahead of the common person and society. They are the people of the Aquarian Age, being neither entirely male nor female. They are progressive and on the cutting edge of the evolution of our society and world. As members of the royal family they dislike pettiness and tend to be somewhat impatient with the failings of others. They need respect and a position that allows their brilliant minds free reign to create and explore. They are never at a loss for ideas, some of which will bring them huge financial returns. On the negative side, the Jack of Clubs can be irresponsible and in some cases, dishonest. They can see things from so many levels that nothing is really 'wrong' - it is just another way of looking at things. And they can make up a story so fast that they can explain away practically anything. They don't get away with much in that regard though. Saturn's hand always reminds them of the boundaries that keep them balanced and fair. The trouble comes when they start believing their own stories, departing from reality a little too far and creating a lot of hardship before getting back on course. They are essentially good and giving people. Even though they are argumentative at times, they are loving and friendly to all they meet.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cheem leh mine is The Ten of Diamonds Person<br><br>The Blessed Card<br><br>This card sits in the very center of the Grand Spread of cards, protected on all sides by Jupiter's blessings. It is THE card of material opulence though few of them actually achieve this reality. However, all of them are protected financially and will always have a certain amount of good luck. To achieve their highest potential, they need to be involved in a business, preferably their own. They have the know how to manage and run a business of any size. Many of them inherit or marry into wealth. With so many blessings, you might expect them to be generous souls, but that is not always the case. Many of them simply direct these blessings to the acquisition of more money and some of them even become ruthless in this regard. Others, however, pay heed to their Queen of Clubs Karma Card, the card of intuition and service through knowledge, and devote their talents and resources to helping the world. All tens are in danger of becoming overly fixated on 'accumulation' of things related to their suit. For the Ten of Diamonds, this would manifest as a money fixation. Some Ten of Diamonds can be very selfish. With their creativity and intelligence, they are always successful in whatever they undertake. Usually this power is directed towards business and gain and there is no size of business or financial enterprise that they cannot handle. If they develop their spiritual awareness, their later years will be filled with expansion of their mind and soul instead of doubt and indecision. Many find an artistic avenue of expression in their later years, which brings many rewards.<br><br>Is this gud ornot ??</div>
