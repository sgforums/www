            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>What is Astral Projection?<br><br>Astral projection means projecting your awareness to the astral plane.<br><br>The astral plane is a world made of energy that can be shaped by thought and emotion. In the astral plane, a person can create objects and communicate with other beings, both humans and spirits.<br><br>Remote Viewing is a form of projection, just like astral projection. The difference is that it takes you to a physical location instead of an astral one.<br><br>What is an 'Out of the Body Experience'?<br><br>Out-of-body-experiences (OBEs) are those curious, and usually brief experiences in which a person's consciousness seems to depart from his or her body, enabling observation of the world from a point of view other than that of the physical body and by means other than those of the physical senses.<br><br>Thus, an out-of-the-body experience can initially be defined as 'an experience in which a person seems to perceive the world from a location outside his physical body'. In some cases experients claim that they 'saw' and 'heard' things (objects which were really there, events and conversations which really took place) which could not have seen or heard from the actual positions of their bodies.<br><br>Astral Projection vs. Out of Body Experiences<br><br>Astral projection and out of body experiences are not the same.<br><br>Leaving the body and astral projection are different forms of travel. The astral plane is one of many places a person can go when out of body or when projecting. Astral projection can happen while still in body and awake.<br><br>Astral projection requires feelings like daydreaming and being creative because they trigger psychic perceptions. You may feel at first that you are imagining what you see. That's ok. In time, you will change from imagining it to perceiving it accurately.<br><br>The level of danger is less than normal physical life. You might run into someone who will get angry with you for no apparent reason. However, as long as you don't go looking for trouble, such occurrences are unlikely. Even if someone doesn't like you, they're unlikely to do anything more than give you a minor headache.<br><br>Contrary to some common myths, you can not die from leaving your body or from projection. You can not be trapped out of your body. Demons will not take over your body while you're gone. If you get anxious or stressed, you'll just wake up naturally, like from a nighttime dream.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Anyone here practise lucid dreaming?<br><br><blockquote><br>Lucid dreaming means dreaming while knowing that you are dreaming. The term was coined by Frederik van Eeden  who used the word "lucid" in the sense of mental clarity. Lucidity usually begins in the midst of a dream when the dreamer realizes that the experience is not occurring in physical reality, but is a dream. Often this realization is triggered by the dreamer noticing some impossible or unlikely occurrence in the dream, such as flying or meeting the deceased. Sometimes people become lucid without noticing any particular clue in the dream; they just suddenly realize they are in a dream. A minority of lucid dreams (according to the research of LaBerge and colleagues, about 10 percent) are the result of returning to REM (dreaming) sleep directly from an awakening with unbroken reflective consciousness.<br><br>The basic definition of lucid dreaming requires nothing more than becoming aware that you are dreaming. However, the quality of lucidity can vary greatly. When lucidity is at a high level, you are aware that everything experienced in the dream is occurring in your mind, that there is no real danger, and that you are asleep in bed and will awaken shortly. With low-level lucidity you may be aware to a certain extent that you are dreaming, perhaps enough to fly or alter what you are doing, but not enough to realize that the people are dream representations, or that you can suffer no physical damage, or that you are actually in bed.<br><br></blockquote></div>

Astral projection can be an inborn ability or can be attained through certain practice. OBEs can occurred to anyone at any time, at times it happens after One had experienced some traumatising experiences or if One's personal energy is not grounded &amp; very light, OBEs can occurred suddenly without the subject of being awared of it &amp; not within control. There is definitely people in Singapore into Astral works &amp; have experience in Astral Projection but what makes you think they are obligated to supply you with any informations pertaining to it? Is that a request or a command? Well if you are so naive to think that you can get answer simply by asking for it, read a few books, ask a few question in the net, if its so simple, not everything can be found in the Net. I really admire your inquisitive nature &amp; effort.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  If so there will not be any classification or categorisation in Society, there will not be a need for any professional. If you are sick administer your own medication but if there is any detriments of mishaps, only yourself is answerable for it, non-vicarous to anyone else!<br><br>Heard of Bi-location, to be at 2 different places at the same time? The use of intent to project to chosen location. Its another form of Projection however its to another location in this earthly plane.<br><br>When we are born, all of us are of pure energy of the Original Life Blueprint, as times goes by as we grow, we become tainted &amp; clouded due to other factors like enviroment &amp; so on. Many of us do have the spiritual sight when we were young be it more or less but however Adults will always say its not true, they don't exist on &amp; on again, soon Logical cognition will take over &amp; totally eradicate the existence of these latent abilities or suppressing &amp; locked it deep within us untill we find the key to it, we will not be able to use these latent abilities again. By the time we reached puberty towards the phase of Adulthood, it is almost totally gone. That goes the same for Lucid Dreaming. Practicising is another issue, Mastering &amp; Controlling it is another, if its so simple. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Thanks for your reply, hope all these answer your queries!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Let me share this with you which happened in year 2000, during a Practical Empowerment Session with one of my lady student, due to her inability to control &amp; over-engrossment, she got trapped &amp; lost in the Astral Realm. The rest of my students are already conscious but she remain seated with her eyes closed, while her body &amp; hands swaying in movements executing out different kinds of Mudras. From there i know she is lost in the Astral realm &amp; i got to get her back to her physical self. I called her name to summon her spiritual self back &amp; i got hold of her spiritual self &amp; put it back into her physical body, then with a sigil i drawn with my index finger i pushed the sigil down from her crown chakra down to her base chakra to ground her energy. At this moment, she stopped all her movements. I ringed my Ritual Bell &amp; i called her name &amp; tell her to slowly open her eyes. I asked her if she is ok, she replied "Yes". She said halfway through my empowerment session in the meditative state suddenly she find herself in a beautiful place, she was walking around the place. I told her what happened to her a moment ago, she was seemingly shocked. What happen is that during the Meditative State of my empowerment, she unawarely accidentally Astral Projected out into a Portal that i opened due to the Energy i raised for the Empowerment &amp; she got lost in the Astral Realm. You see if she didn't get back in time, probably Doctor will deduced that she is in a comatose or some cerebral Disorder or malfunction. There is always a risk in whatever practice but the effect can be very individual.<br><br>Well I am afriad Singapore do not have such kind of websites of any validity.
