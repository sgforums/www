You are too strong willed at times, people tend to see that as sheer stubbornness. Once a decision is made, it will be followed through to the conclusion, right, wrong, or indifferent. You are very set in your ways and determined to handle things the way you are so certain that they should be handled. You are passive in your ways while dealing with your emotions, sometime you would rather wait for others to make the 1st move than to take any actions. At times you will miss the good opportunity that was already there at that moment.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong><br></div>

Whether in the home or in the work place, you are the predominant caretaker and family head. Conservative principles and convictions are deeply ingrained and define your character. At Time you may be overwhelming, overbearing and critical to those around you, Imposing one's views in an interfering or meddling way must be an issue of concern. Do not go cross the boundary of your own path and position, if not it will spell endless troubles for you. Not everyone will give in to your ways or willing to accept your criticisms. Being headstrong won't always work, Understanding the least limitations of yourself before you chose to go against any flow.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong><br></div>

Most of your concerns involve money and learning of the power that comes with its proper manipulation. You have a great need for close personal relationships to mitigate and somehow soften your nature. Being diictatorial can be taxing on all relationships that may ultimately lead to breakup. Emotional feelings are often suppressed or accompany by neagtive thoughts, resulting in isolation and loneliness.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>
