Which animal or bird has always fascinated you? (We are drawn to that which most resonates with us. Those animals which fascinate us have something to teach us.)<br><br>2. When you visit the zoo, which animal do you wish to visit the most or first?<br>(esp. children)<br><br>3. What animal(s) do you see most frequently when you are out in nature? Have you had encounters with animals in the wild? (The animals we encounter, in their city environments or in the wild, have significance for us. We can learn from them, even if only about survival within that environment.)<br><br>4. Of all the animals in the world, which are you most interested in now?  (Our<br>interests in animals change. Yes, we usually have one or two that are lifetime,<br>power animals, but others become prominent when there is something importance or specific to teach us.)<br><br>5. What animal most frightens you? (That which we fear the most is often<br>something we must learn to come to terms with. When we do that, it then becomes a power. Some shamans believe that fears will take the shape of  animals, and only when we confront them without fear do their powers/ medicine work for us instead of against us. Such an animal become a shadow totem.)<br><br>6. Have you ever been bitten or attacked by an animal? (Historically, if a<br>shaman survived an attack, it was believed that the animal was the shaman's<br>spirit totem and the attack was the totem's way of testing the shaman's ability<br>to handle the power.)<br><br>7. Do you have dreams with animals in them or are there animal dreams you have never forgotten? (This is especially important if the dreams are recurring or if at least the animal image in the dream is a recurring one. Children often dream of animals, &amp; attention should be given to these animals. They will often reflect specific spirit totems of the child.)<br></div>
