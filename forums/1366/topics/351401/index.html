For instance, in Greek Atlas, Â‘AÂ’, meaning Â‘The one who could not withstandÂ’ and Â‘tlasÂ’ meaning Â‘The SkiesÂ’. Atlas was the mythical God, referred as the Â‘Pillar of HeavenÂ’ that is its support. When Atlas became overburdened with too much for him, the skies fell down, burying Atlantis.<br><br>The words Â‘AtlasÂ’ and Â‘AtlantisÂ’ originally come from Sanskrit, Â‘The Holy Language of IndiaÂ’. The Sanskrit name for their Hell is Â‘AtalaÂ’, meaning Â‘Deprived of PillarÂ’, Â‘BottomlessÂ’ or more preferably Â‘Sunken to BottomÂ’.<br><br>~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ is a gateway to the Magickal Realm.

A Philosophy we uphold as we all are born of Divine Radiant Pure Light, Awakening begin with awareness of our purpose for being upon this earth, and proceed to act upon it in relation to the other beings and purposes encountered along our Path. It is a process of becoming cosmically aware; it is driven by need &amp; environing cosmic circumstance to develop love-wisdom and both these words are descriptive and expressive of the consciousness aspect. Love is response to contact and this - in the human being - means understanding, inclusiveness and identification. Wisdom connotes skill in action as the result of developed love &amp; the light of understanding; it is awareness of requirements &amp; ability to bring together into a fused relationship the need &amp; that which will meet it. Awareness of that relation to other beings and larger purposes renews the cycle of action. We act to enhance the harmony of our relationships with the many brings of the living Earth, and to pursues the purpose of spiritual growth.<br><br>~*~ LIGHT OF ATLANTIS ~*~ was created to be an Establishment, Platform, Organisation and Point of focus for Magickal Work, Light Work &amp; Spiritual growth.

              <p>I bought a few products from Oceanos during the past 1 year:-<br><br>1. Rabbit Foot :- I won lucky draw and 4D within 1 month of wearing it! The rabbit foot practically pays for itself! Even attract people whom I am not close to, giving me Ang Bao and Presents! <img title="Cool" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool"><br><br>2. Mojo Bag :- Oceanos recommended me to buy this when I met him for the very first time (consultation). But I was too occupied by something else to listen to him. I regret not listening to him because now I think itÂ’s an extremely good investment and I should have gotten it EARLIER! I just upgraded it recently for protection and I feel more protected than ever carrying it with me. <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"><br><br>3. Prosperity Money Drawing :- I bought this for my parentsÂ’ business Â‘coz they were not doing well initially. My 1st bottle trial:- my parentsÂ’ business really improved by at least 30%! After I purchased the 2nd bottle, my parents manage to win lottery! My parents who are skeptical about such new age stuffs are now prepared to buy the 3rd bottle and many more in future (I sponsor the previous 2 bottles in the past :-P).<br><br>I also attended one of OceanosÂ’ workshops on introduction to magick and initiation. It was a real eye/mind/sense Â– opening experience.<img title="Shocked" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked"> I felt extremely blessed after the workshop. <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"></p>

Alligator Mojo: My 3rd Mojo, even though it isn't OCEANOS bro product, but it is also not a bad mojo.<br><br>4. Cleansing &amp; Money drawing solutions: Got these for my mum for her shop. Business improved after she used them.<br><br>5. Tarot Consultation: Love the session with OCEANOS bro, the session really help me with the choices I should make.<br><br>I am not very good in expressing how magical OCEANOS bro product is, I will recommend to try it for yourself to feel the difference. <img title="Wink" src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"></strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Let me see...<br>I've chanced upon this haven around 4 months ago.. quite skeptical about such new age stuffs and things that couldnt be explained by sciences.<br><br>Here's my honest feedback:<br><br>a) Had two tarot consultations with OCEANOS. His reading were very accurate and until now (at times) i am still very amazed with the accuracy of his readings. Through the tarot sessions, i managed to find directions and answers to the questions in my life and i'm glad and thankful to know OCEANOS.<br><br>b) Recently got my mojo bag for protection and healing; regretted not heeding his advice to get one earlier. Partly because i felt it was pricey, come to think of it, it's a long term investment. The mojo was strong and very much alive.. vibrant. Thanks OCEANOS!!<br><br>c) Healing session: Just had one earlier when i met him. I never quite believe in the effects of healing because my chakras are always blocked and i could never focus and let go. After just now, i felt much better, having to release alot of the negativities and bad energies in me.<br><br>d) Love Gypsy honey: Bought a bottle and thought it was fun. I felt more "attractive" and increased self-confidence. I do feel that i get second glances from people when i used the honey. Not just to opposite gender but also people around me, colleagues/ friends; i feel that communication and rapport is better and find myself more approachable....<br><br>Would definitely continue to support OCEANOS, and his haven. <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"> <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"> <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Hmm, thought it'd be nice to share with you abt the effects of the mojo i got a week ago.<br><br>The mojo bag is meant for healing, protection and joy.<br><br>I used to be very easily swayed by my inner thoughts and get quite moody, and it affects my day alot. I also get affected by other people's reaction and their attitudes/ behaviour towards me.<br><br>But after getting the mojo bag, i felt more peaceful, and less emotional fluctuation. Basically quite at peace with my thoughts, mind.<br><br>Also, i get over unpleasantness easier and "forgive-forget" faster which makes me feel "lighter".<br><br><img title="Embarassed" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed"> <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"> <img title="Mr. Green" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green"> <img title="Razz" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz"> <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"></strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Hi everyone,<br><br></strong><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>I just used Oceanos Empowering Magickal Powder... the effect is really good.<br>I used it to cleanse my mojo bag - to remove some unwanted energies and negativities around me.<br><br>I could really feel the difference.<br>After my mojo bag was "tainted" with other pple's energies, i felt very uneasy and there is always this blockage around my chest area....<br><br>After cleansing the mojo bag with the kit provided by OCEANOS, i felt lighter and more at ease now. Could really see a difference after using the enpowering powder.<br><br>Thanks alot. <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"> <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></strong></span></span></p>
