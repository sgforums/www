And, coming after the Emperor, who is about control, it is a radical change in perspective. LOVE is a force that makes you choose and decide for reasons you often can't understand; it makes you surrender control to a higher power. And that is what this card is all about. Finding something or someone who is so much a part of yourself, so perfectly attuned to you and you to them, that you cannot, dare not resist. This card indicates that the you have or will come across a person, career, challenge or thing that you will fall in love with. You will know instinctively that you must have this, even if it means diverging from your chosen path. No matter the difficulties, without it you will never be complete.</strong></span><br><br></div>

However I chose my alternative reply which is close but slightly less and got this:<br><br><img src="http://www.flarn.com/~warlock/tarot/dragon/11.jpg"><br><strong>You are Justice</strong><br>Equity, rightness, probity, executive; triumph of the observing side in law.<br><br>Justice is about cold, objective balance through reason or natural force. You can't keep smoking and drinking without consequences to you health. It is the card that advises cutting out waste and insists that you make adjustments, do whatever is necessary to bring things back into balance, physically, emotionally, socially, spiritually. It is a card of balance and harmony; if there is imbalance, the correction may require recourse to the law.<br><br>Anyway my point is that for the "Strength" card it was mentioned that in certain decks, "Justice" is card 8 instead of "Strength"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> Woah</div>

Craft, cunning, depending on dignity.<br><br>Eleoquent and charismatic both verbally and in writing, you are clever, witty, inventive and persuasive.<br><br>The Magician is the male power of creation, creation by willpower and desire. In that ancient sense, it is the ability to make things so just by speaking them aloud. Reflecting this is the fact that the Magician is represented by Mercury. He represents the gift of tongues, a smooth talker, a salesman. Also clever with the slight of hand and a medicine man - either a real doctor or someone trying to sell you snake oil.<br><br></div>

You may be good at home decorating, art or anything to do with making things beautiful.<br><br>The Empress is a creator, be it creation of life, of romance, of art or business. While the Magician is the primal spark, the idea made real, and the High Priestess is the one who gives the idea a form, the Empress is the womb where it gestates and grows till it is ready to be born. This is why her symbol is Venus, goddess of beautiful things as well as love. Even so, the Empress is more Demeter, goddess of abundance, then sensual Venus. She is the giver of Earthly gifts, yet at the same time, she can, in anger withhold, as Demeter did when her daughter, Persephone, was kidnapped. In fury and grief, she kept the Earth barren till her child was returned to her.<br></div>
