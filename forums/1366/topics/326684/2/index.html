              <p><br>By questioning if you will let go means you are in doubt. How can anyone in doubt accomplish anything great. A positive mindset goes a long way. By asking when instead of the Will I....... your chances of success multiplies many folds.</p>

              <p><br>Your business venture will turn out to be very challenging. And yet, it will be very exciting. It is a good time to carry out discussions regarding business. Proving yourself seems to be very important to you right now. I'll say, your business will be ok. Not bery good, and not very bad .Because you will recieve a challenge, maybe an opponent or difficult times. But you will pull through eventually.</p>

              <p>Ok I understand now. There are changes in your relationship. Go with the flow and accept the changes. And you have to be patient. Meaning, to wait for a while. You feel very uncertaint currently. But you have to sacrifice something to gain something. Thats why you have to wait. You have to decide which is more important. And it is something only you can decide.</p>

              <p>You will find it tough, and need a lot of hard work and be fustrated a lot. But you will get what you want in the long term.</p>
              <p>For your love life, it seems that you will meet her around this year. Possibly quite soon. Or sooner than you expected. Cause for your love life, the sun card has appeared.</p>
