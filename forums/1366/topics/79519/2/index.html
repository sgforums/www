I believe MeowSusan has chose to "Forgive" &amp; "Forget" &amp; tried very hard if you have noticed in her previous threads in all Forums but are these things gonna stop! A wound has been cut &amp; bleeding profusely not on you but her! Do you think circumstances allowed her to remained silent &amp; be Blamed for Nothing she ever done, put yourself in her shoes! "Happiness" seem to be like a "Mirage" to her, seemingly "Near", yet so "Far", i believe all the good hearted kind soul in here hope she see the "Light" &amp; "Truth" so she can truly be "Safe" &amp; "Happy" but again &amp; again she's been hurt &amp; victimised...So is that what she deserve? for being a friend...a weak helpless woman perhaps...Is it Fair? I believe you meant well &amp; i am sure she &amp; all of us here appreciated your kind intention but again "WE" witnessed the ugliness in others that truly shown here so Are Human Nature Flawed? Personally i would say yes, How did a Beautiful Friendship turn out this way? "Its takes two hands to clap" &amp; "WE" witnessed the deterioration of a once "Beautiful Friendship" due to the Harms &amp; Hurts that One rendered to Another who has tried to be a "Silent Rose" for nothing she ever done!<br><br>To add on to these , one by one, friends around her also become "victims" of Other's Tool of Frustration &amp; being ridiculed in such a light, Do any of those you ever mention previously deserved such a predicament! I don't think so coz i always believe "Justice" &amp; "Truth" will prevail! "Facts" &amp; "Truth" is all "WE" need, is that too much to ask for...My full sympathy to all Victims who suffered becoz of all these "Lies" &amp; "Aspersion" by few of the Others who chose to do these to people around them &amp; whom they regard as "Friends"...So is this the "Truth", "WE" witness now, i am afriad so as it already happened...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
