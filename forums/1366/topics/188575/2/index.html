            <div class='col-md body'>Dear SoulFire21,<br><br>There are some institutes that offer to teach magic online, but you have to be careful about those. Some institutes do have magical ways to suck money out from us. I truely advise that you have to know who you learn from and evaluate the person on their skills and personality. The basic thing is that whether can you trust the person. Another thing that is important is to get a ring of supporters during practise. In case anything goes wrong, there are other practitioners there to support, rescue or whatever you call it. From my own experience, some very good masters do not ask for big $$$, but they are ultra strict in the selection of their students because some magic is life-risking, and the teachers have to be one of the protectors.<br><br>Back to the topic of where to learn magic. I guess you must be interested in learning magic so as to post this. May I ask how much effort are you willing to put in to learn magic in order to evaluate what advise to give? The reason for asking this is that there are many who enquire but do not really put in effort in practising and learning the art well. Some go for short cuts, some learn from all over the place. Not only they end up not learning but also cause harm to others and themselves...

Do let me know what is your expectations, how much effort....and I will furnish you with the relevant information.<br><br>Stay Happy and Healthy<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: violet;">A Glorious and Starry Night to Serafina,<br>Thanks for your wonderous insight into the matter.LOA is a place where people who have a passion for magick gather and it is indeed a privilage to have such an experienced and knowledgable person like yourself come in and share your experiences with us.I am sure everyone will benefit from your sharing so please do post more,ok?<br>Regarding your comments ,I do agree that there is truth in it.There are people out there who seems very knowlegable on certain occult and magickal aspects but when pratice is concerned,they have no substance. We really have to take time to find out more about a teacher before making a decision and I am sure we will know if the right one comes along.I am so glad you have bought up this point as alot of people jump in and end up getting hurt as not everyone is suited to learn the craft.<br>As for the comments regarding paying the masters. I agree some form of payment is necessary in accordance to the effort put in by the master and how much he/she will be able to help you advance in not only your spiritual path but everyday life as well .Again your emphasis on finding the right master is ever so helpful here as you can pay a million dollars to a weak master who might happen to be a dabbler himself/herself but don't expect to get your one million dollars worth as they themselves do not have what it takes as a poor master can only teach his student so much.<br>Yet again,I thank you for your feedback and hope you can post more and share your vast wisdom with us.<br>May the magick fill your heart,mind,soul and life forever.</span></div>

LOA welcomes all with positive intent especially those with a wealth of experiences to share. Life is indeed a journey of self discovery and is what we make of it. Magick is similar in this aspect as when our powers grow,so must our minds with it. Many I have seen fallen as their powers outgrew their abilities to think and rationalise. Power in the wrong hands can bring about the destructions of worlds and people. It is often by our own biased views that conflicts arised and wars begin. The human race has a long way to go before he is truly in harmony with himself and the world around him.<br><br>It is really great to hear you are using your abilities for the good of the common man. Tha act of bringing light to the world is a mission that LOA also shares. We are glad that you have choosen to make your presence felt by posting in the forums and prehaps in the near future,we can see you in some LOA event. An honor it will be if you are to grace us with your presence.<br><br>Indeed the issue of ignorance not being an issue is something everyone has to understand in not only magickal workings but eveyday life as well. We cannot for example kill someone and later claim that we do not know murder is wrong. Karma for one does not work that way. You are affected despite your ignorance. Thus,ignorance cannot be used as excuse for failure or doing wrong as the failure to be educated and informed in the first place is already a wrongdoing. Magick is not just some hocus pocus or about making spells work for you,it is a way of life, whereby one actively seeks out a fulfilling life and turn inwards to become someone who is at peace with himself/herself.<br><br>To top it off,a quote from Peter Parker aka Spiderman: With great powers come great responsibilities.<br><br>May the Magick fill your heart,mind,soul and life forever.</span></div>
