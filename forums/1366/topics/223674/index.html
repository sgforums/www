Many people believe that a Ritual Bath will put an end to adverse conditions and open the way for Luck, Love, Money, and Happiness to enter their lives. Those who use these Magickal Bathsalts in Spiritual Baths dissolve half the contents of a packet in a tub of water and pour the liquid over themselves as they recite with Intenetion, a wish, a prayer, or one of the Psalms.

Generally speaking, they combine elements of African and European magical, religious, and witchcraft traditions and also a bit of Native American plant lore.<br><br>The oldest ritual baths and cleansings known to mankind are those involving pure water (typically running fresh water or sea water) and decoctions made from water to which has been added salt, minerals, herbs, roots, and tree barks.<br><br>Herbal baths are often used when sickness is present, and are pan-cultural in their distribution. The African belief in foot-track magic -- causing good or evil to another through their foot track -- additionally calls for regular ritual cleaning of not only the person but the doorstep and yard, in order to remove harmful materials such as Goofer Dust or War Water, which may be laid down in the path by an enemy.<br><br>Since the 20th century, mineral bathsalts, liquid washes, spritzers, and other modern bathing and cleaning supplies have been manufactured in convenient forms for use in magickal cleansing and purification rites. The basis for these modern hoodoo products is typically an anointing or dressing oil. Root doctors traditionally name their oils after the conditions they are believed to cause or to cure. Thus, by extension, Peaceful Home Bath and Floor Wash, like Peaceful Home Oil or Bathsalts, is said to bring about contentment and an end to resentment in the family, while Crown of Success Bathsalts, like Crown of Success Oil, is believed to enhance one's good fortune in school, career, business, and public life.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/floorwash.gif"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE ROLE OF BATHING AND CLEANING IN HOODOO SPELL-WORK</span><br><br>In hoodoo terminology, performing a ritual or spell is often called "doing a job." The simplest jobs may involve bathing or anointing oneself or cleaning the house in a prescribed way. In these cases, the entire job consists of bathing a set number of times or washing down the walls, floors, and door step of the home or place of business in a ritual manner. Generally, the disposal of used bath water or floor wash from such work consists of throwing it to the east at or before sunrise, accompanied by a short, formulaic recitation.<br><br>If a bath is intended to draw in good luck, it is common for the conjure to tell the bather to rub the body only in an upward direction after pouring the bath. If the bath is for the removal of evil conditions, the client may be told to bathe by rubbing in a downward direction only. In either case, the used bath water, enhanced by the essence of the bather, may become an ingredient in further spell work, ritually sprinkled, used to wipe away enemy tricks and witchcraft spells, or be added to floor wash.<br><br>Ritual floor-washing is likewise divided into two classes of work: washing to draw in good luck, and washing to remove evil. To attract good fortune, business clients, store customers, or a lover, one scrubs the front doorstep inward, to draw in what is wanted. When spiritually cleaning a home or business premises to rid it of evil conditions, one works from the top floor of the building down to the bottom floor and from the back of each floor to the front of each floor, ending at the front doorstep, which is usually given special attention and scrubbing. The used wash-water may be thrown into the front yard, toward the East, or, if preferred, the washing-out may continue down the house-path toward the road and conclude by throwing the water to East at the border of the property.<br><br>More complex hoodoo spells done to improve one's condition in life in various ways might comprise dressing an amulet, burning candles and incense, or fixing up a mojo bag to be carried on the person. Spell work directed against enemies may involve laying tricks or throwing down materials for the victim to step over. Very strong jobs of both these types may take on the characteristics of elaborate magical rituals -- and in many cases when such a complex job is undertaken, ritual bathing forms the prelude to doing the job and a second ritual bath or a ritual house-cleaning followed by a ritual bath is the concluding act which marks its close. </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/pentacle-bar-long.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: green;">&gt;*&lt; Prosperity Magickal Bathsalts &gt;*&lt;<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/IMG_0761.jpg"><br><br>This Prosperity Magickal Bathsalts is to help One heal issues of Poverty consciousness &amp; bring in Prosperity consciousnesss.

Many people believe that a Ritual Bath will put an end to adverse conditions and open the way for Luck, Love, Money, and Happiness to enter their lives. Those who use these Magickal Bathsalts in Spiritual Baths dissolve half the contents of a packet in a tub of water and pour the liquid over themselves as they recite with Intention, a wish, a prayer, or one of the Psalms. We also know folks who dissolve these Magickal Bathsalts in a pail of warm water for bathing or use a Magickal Floor Wash to rid the home of Negativities and to bring about their desires in Financial Matters, Luck, Romance, or Games of Chance.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF RITUAL BATHING AND CLEANSING</span><br><br>The use of herb baths, mineral bathsalts, and floor washes has been a part of hoodoo practice for a very long time. Generally speaking, they combine elements of African and European magical, religious, and witchcraft traditions and also a bit of Native American plant lore.<br><br>The oldest ritual baths and cleansings known to mankind are those involving pure water (typically running fresh water or sea water) and decoctions made from water to which has been added salt, minerals, herbs, roots, and tree barks.<br><br>Herbal baths are often used when sickness is present, and are pan-cultural in their distribution. The African belief in foot-track magic -- causing good or evil to another through their foot track -- additionally calls for regular ritual cleaning of not only the person but the doorstep and yard, in order to remove harmful materials such as Goofer Dust or War Water, which may be laid down in the path by an enemy.<br><br>Since the 20th century, mineral bathsalts, liquid washes, spritzers, and other modern bathing and cleaning supplies have been manufactured in convenient forms for use in magickal cleansing and purification rites. The basis for these modern hoodoo products is typically an anointing or dressing oil. Root doctors traditionally name their oils after the conditions they are believed to cause or to cure. Thus, by extension, Peaceful Home Bath and Floor Wash, like Peaceful Home Oil or Bathsalts, is said to bring about contentment and an end to resentment in the family, while Crown of Success Bathsalts, like Crown of Success Oil, is believed to enhance one's good fortune in school, career, business, and public life.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/floorwash.gif"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE ROLE OF BATHING AND CLEANING IN HOODOO SPELL-WORK</span><br><br>In hoodoo terminology, performing a ritual or spell is often called "doing a job." The simplest jobs may involve bathing or anointing oneself or cleaning the house in a prescribed way. In these cases, the entire job consists of bathing a set number of times or washing down the walls, floors, and door step of the home or place of business in a ritual manner. Generally, the disposal of used bath water or floor wash from such work consists of throwing it to the east at or before sunrise, accompanied by a short, formulaic recitation.<br><br>If a bath is intended to draw in good luck, it is common for the conjure to tell the bather to rub the body only in an upward direction after pouring the bath. If the bath is for the removal of evil conditions, the client may be told to bathe by rubbing in a downward direction only. In either case, the used bath water, enhanced by the essence of the bather, may become an ingredient in further spell work, ritually sprinkled, used to wipe away enemy tricks and witchcraft spells, or be added to floor wash.<br><br>Ritual floor-washing is likewise divided into two classes of work: washing to draw in good luck, and washing to remove evil. To attract good fortune, business clients, store customers, or a lover, one scrubs the front doorstep inward, to draw in what is wanted. When spiritually cleaning a home or business premises to rid it of evil conditions, one works from the top floor of the building down to the bottom floor and from the back of each floor to the front of each floor, ending at the front doorstep, which is usually given special attention and scrubbing. The used wash-water may be thrown into the front yard, toward the East, or, if preferred, the washing-out may continue down the house-path toward the road and conclude by throwing the water to East at the border of the property.<br><br>More complex hoodoo spells done to improve one's condition in life in various ways might comprise dressing an amulet, burning candles and incense, or fixing up a mojo bag to be carried on the person. Spell work directed against enemies may involve laying tricks or throwing down materials for the victim to step over. Very strong jobs of both these types may take on the characteristics of elaborate magical rituals -- and in many cases when such a complex job is undertaken, ritual bathing forms the prelude to doing the job and a second ritual bath or a ritual house-cleaning followed by a ritual bath is the concluding act which marks its close.  </span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/pentacle-bar-long.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: purple;">&gt;*&lt; Spiritual Cleansing Magickal Floor Wash &gt;*&lt;<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/LIGHT_OF_ATLANTIS/PRODUCT/IMG_0851.jpg"><br><br>This Spiritual Cleansing Magickal Floor Wash is to remove Negativities, Bad Vibes, Ill Wishes &amp; Intentions, Evil Eye Influences, Bad Luck or Jinx of all forms from home, workplace, business premises or wherever you use it on.
