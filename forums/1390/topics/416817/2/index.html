              <p>I dont think so. Offenders who are send to RTC and Prison, <em><strong>dont get enlisted at all</strong></em>. Because they are probation for 1 to 2 years and they are sent to care center after their terms. </p>
              <p>If they do get call back by the SAF, then they are the better ones. But rarely, they are enlisted. </p>
              <p>I am absolutely clear about this because  my friend's after-care officer has directly instructed him to look for a job and continued his career and life. The ACO is the one who decide their final release, and they usually dont recommend his boys for NS. Anyway, if the boy dont want to do NS, he just need to nag to the ACO. LOL. hahaha. </p>

              <p>This is what I use to think also.</p>
              <p>But recent years (only these few years), due to a change in the prison system. The jailbirds are put on probation or after-care after their terms. Meaning they are not officially released. So they become overage when released from RTC/prison for NS hence they are not enlisted at all. It is something like that. These people are tagged and have to be back home by 8 pm everyday. ACO can extend this probation for misbehavior, so they cannot be enlisted for up to 1 year. If they go to after-care homes, they also have to return home by a certain time. </p>
              <p>Anyway, I dont bother because some1 has explained this to me and I wasnt listening.</p>

              Hello, that is irrelevant. sia.   
              
              So, I am right. Last year, 2009, I had a scenario. I called up Singapore After Care Association to look for assistance on job finding for my friend who was also liable for NS enlistment. The ACO replied impolitely to ask him to look for a job directly and forget about the enlistment. 
              
              Perhaps, it depends on scenarios or case-by-case. That friend of mine is jailed for assaulted robbery over $20k of handphone items. He attacked several persons and rob their belongings.

              <p><br>Hello, that is irrelevant. sia. So, I am right. Last year, 2009, I had a scenario. I called up Singapore After Care Association to look for assistance on job finding for my friend who was also liable for NS enlistment. The ACO replied impolitely to ask him to look for a job directly and forget about the enlistment. Perhaps, it depends on scenarios or case-by-case. That friend of mine is jailed for assaulted robbery over $20k of handphone items. He attacked several persons and rob their belongings.</p>
