              <p>I dont think so. Offenders who are send to RTC and Prison, <em><strong>dont get enlisted at all</strong></em>. Because they are probation for 1 to 2 years and they are sent to care center after their terms. </p>
              <p>If they do get call back by the SAF, then they are the better ones. But rarely, they are enlisted. </p>
              <p>I am absolutely clear about this because  my friend's after-care officer has directly instructed him to look for a job and continued his career and life. The ACO is the one who decide their final release, and they usually dont recommend his boys for NS. Anyway, if the boy dont want to do NS, he just need to nag to the ACO. LOL. hahaha. </p>
