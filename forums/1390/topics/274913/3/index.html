Overseas performances were considered before during my time in there, but it never really happened. Admin stuff, alot of red tape, plainly put, $ problems. Drill standards at that time were definitely good enough for overseas performances, its only that we decided to concentrate on local mounting of performances. But also, since we inherit main drill skills from Taiwan, and also adapt and change and invent new drills, its not good to "ban1 men2 nong4 fu3" in front of more professional foreign drill squads. Not that we are incapable, its to avoid the "publicity" that would be generated due to comparison.<br><br>2)Refer to 1), since i never encountered overseas performances, but in addition, the best performance is always saved for the home crowd. Who best to cheer for your performance than your friends family and buddies when you do a good job?<br><br>3)I would say this would be an extreme rare exception to the long history of SPDS. I would also would like to believe this August COG dint even happened.<br><br>4)I have to say there are a million and 1 reasons how such performances can screw up. Its through years of experimenting with minor tweaks and adjustments that we try to formulate a near perfect fool-proof procedure to ensure everything goes well in preparation for COG every month. Details are not required but even so, it doesnt take a genius to tell you that when something cocks up, everyone points at the fault, but if everything goes well, its business as usual next month again.<br><br>Shibaa, i wont want to flame you but, i would want to let you know that formations and stuff arent the usual things that you would think to be so easy. And for your info, formations are always ever-changing, and its pretty hard to explain things just on forums to outsiders. (Apologies if offended).<br>Dont you think that we would gladly want a same formation to use for 20+ years? Its common sense yeah, but viewers would think otherwise.<br><br>As for number of variations, its more than you can ever think of. I would say its seriously more than what people think there are.<br><br>Squad Members are normally chosen on a very rigid basis, but looking at how the "old company" before the revamp is now changed into a bare-boned one, i would say there is more than meets the eye behind the scenes.<br><br>But please refrain from attacking these chaps, even as seniors or as "lao jiaos", reprimand them yes for the poor performances, but look ahead and hope they learn from their mistakes.<br><br>I hope this is sufficient information to you, shibaa, and others on this forum about a little of whats happening.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway before i turn in, as melmoth posted:<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by melmoth:</div><div class="quote_body">they should srsly just disband SPDS la, no point already, cant even accomplish simple tasks.... if they wanna compromise the quality of the performers with the excuse of Manpower issue, then there is no point for SPDS to exist, SPDS was listed as one of the elite units in SAF alongside the commandos and naval divers.... what a shame...</div></blockquote>I would agree the current squad is not of an elite type, yet i wont want to see one performance destroy what many people has built it up into.<br>The unity between the squad, the friendship, the ability to band together in times of hardship and survive through turmoils is in fact comparable to that of what Red Berets and NDU go through, only that its of a different platform and aspect. The competitiveness seen during my time to mount the drill squad is something that you would only expect when people strive to achieve the best soldier of the year award.(Just an example)<br><br>However during my time, manpower was also an issue, but my friends and I endured through everything together. And i believe it is quite comparable when what used to be 2-3 platoons is only continued by only me and my buddies, a total of around 1 1/2 sections. Its how the people that unite together right under the SPDS banner that you would actually only realise how determined and strong a squad can be when doing things, even accomplishing the impossible. <strong>I really believe something else like a major overhaul of the tried and tested system for the squad choosing and training system is the main cause for this subpar performance.</strong> And inside knowledge is that, that is what happened.<br><br>Therefore, i wish, and hope the present squad would buck up, and do justice to the name of SPDS, and to the detractors out there, may you see SPDS in a different light once Sept COG comes.</div>

Not as if this is the first performance ever, i think is due to cos they never consult the experienced in the unit.</div>
