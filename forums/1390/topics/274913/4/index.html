Military Police does what a normal civilian Policeman would do in the streets, just that MPs only touch Military personnel, Policemen interfere with civilians. If it happens that those civilians caught are NSF or regulars, they are in turn sent to the Provost to be taken care of.<br><br>As for your second paragraph, refer to my previous post about divulging sensitive military information.

This accountability really is quite non existant in the SAF.People's careers are on the line and they really would rather push it to those who's careers arent....NSF.<br>Seriously with scholars and those who dont want their iron rice bowls broken the NSF is the easiest person to shove the blame to because  they will be gone in 2 years and there's no record of shit like this happening especially if all the NSF get's is some extras and confinements or punishments that arent recorded as a charge and hence no need for investigation.<br>All this might also be the reason why a certain 2LT wrote an email to mindef and CDF and all that hah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NuShii:</div><div class="quote_body">The recent Aug 07 COG video was taken down by force after a series of attempted threats to charge the uploader was rumoured. Apparently the performers who were involved in this unglamorous event were punished, even senior squad members were dragged into this fiasco, however the root of cause has not been addressed: the chief instructor who is supposedly a 1st SGT. Now that all visual evidence has been chucked under the rug, it is impossible to describe how badly that instructor had falter in his drills, as a matter of fact the other performers did better than him. Why is it that he was let off scot-free whilst the NSFs had to bear his crime? As a concerned civillian I have every right to know what is going in the upper management of the MPC, and why they are pushing the blame of this one performance-gone-wrong to the NSFs? Have they taken into account the glory of past performances? It tears me to know that the NSFs are being made scapegoats just so the blames can be accounted for.<br><br>No doubt this thread might cause more sufferings to the NSFs who are now currently serving their punishments, but just to let whoever is reading know that I am not an NSF so don't bother questioning them.</div></blockquote>If I the NSF MP n kena punishment, I will go tell my mother to talk to CO SAFMP to reason out the thing.</div>
