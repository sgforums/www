            <div class='col-md body'>The recent Aug 07 COG video was taken down by force after a series of attempted threats to charge the uploader was rumoured. Apparently the performers who were involved in this unglamorous event were punished, even senior squad members were dragged into this fiasco, however the root of cause has not been addressed: the chief instructor who is supposedly a 1st SGT. Now that all visual evidence has been chucked under the rug, it is impossible to describe how badly that instructor had falter in his drills, as a matter of fact the other performers did better than him. Why is it that he was let off scot-free whilst the NSFs had to bear his crime? As a concerned civillian I have every right to know what is going in the upper management of the MPC, and why they are pushing the blame of this one performance-gone-wrong to the NSFs? Have they taken into account the glory of past performances? It tears me to know that the NSFs are being made scapegoats just so the blames can be accounted for.<br><br>No doubt this thread might cause more sufferings to the NSFs who are now currently serving their punishments, but just to let whoever is reading know that I am not an NSF so don't bother questioning them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to let you know, COG is a public event. It is performed under the scrutiny of the general public, as an introductory display of military prowess. Generally if the performance was well executed, nationalism will be inculcated into the audience, a sense of pride and honour.<br><br>Similarly, if the performance flopped, as a member of the general public I have rights to know why it happened and the actions taken to improve the next performance. As a patriotic citizen, I cannot allow witnessing the falling standards of a state event and not do anything about it. Malaysia is probably laughing at us right now.<br><br>As to the rumored injustice happening in the camp, I am fully aware that I'm not in any stand to demand for the truths, however as a concerned citizen I have rights to ask, whether they would answer me is of another issue. As a parent would be anxious for his son, I am anxious for my fellow singaporeans now serving their punishments. Am I asking too much for simply wanting to know the truth?<br><br>If you are not concerned with what is happening, perhaps you are not concerned as a citizen of the republic of singapore</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys was just surfing the forums and I happened to see this thread and coincidentally I did watch the Change of Guards ceremony outside the Istana.<br><br>I noticed it was quite messy during the gun performance as it seemed that the members performing were very badly rehearsed and even forgot their steps(movements?).Towards the end they even seemed to give up performing and just stood there.I felt quite bad and ashamed at that point.<br><br>Now this is a national event and it is even recommended to tourists to watch(avalible on brochures at Changi Airport telling people about things to see in Singapore and also on Uniquely Singapore as Lazerlordz said) so what's up with the poor show?<br>And now they even force people to pull a legitimately shot video off youtube to cover it up?Come on I mean everyone there has seen that show already I even saw a few tourists there shaking their heads at it!Are they now gonna mindwipe people?What's up with that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the thing now is not so much on how cui it was, but the fact that the person who uploaded the video was threatened.... this is just wrong la. And i do not think even if you bring it up to those up on top it will help, just look at the way they are handling the situation, they punish the NSFs, let off the regular, and threaten to charge the poster of the video, you think they will respond with grace if you brought this matter up to them&gt;?</div>

NO! at least they did something for it, instead of ranting after any parade screwups about hw bad it was, shld charge who n who...<br>never do anything still can complain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have no idea why venny is acting in such a fashion, I don't think I've ever offended you, in fact I don't even know who you are. I definitely wasn't attempting on starting a flame or trying to be a rebel without a cause.<br><br>The only reason why I'm putting this on forums instead of a complaint letter or whatever you might suggest, is because I have no wish in causing more trouble for the NSFs. All I'm merely doing is have my idea made known in hopes that people who come across this thread may share their two cents worth. This is public forums, like what spdsboiboi86 has suggested to you, if you do not appreciate the contents of this thread, you are allowed to ignore it. But I think you're causing a racket and you're disturbing our sanctum for an objective discussion here.<br><br><blockquote>I wonder if it was a tourist who filmed this, and uploaded onto Youtube, what would the SAF or MPC do? </blockquote>Yes Lazerlordz, that is precisely why I have started this thread, because I think if the identity of the original uploader was made known to be a tourist, things might have turned out different. I would personally want a deeper understanding into this issue, so that no one would be punished for more than what they should have been, because I was told that faltering in such a state event has serious repercussions and consequences for the performers. Instead of getting them into further trouble, I sincerely hope this thread would give them encouragement for the next performance<br><br></div>
