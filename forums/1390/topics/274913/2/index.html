            <div class='col-md body'>Yes the 'threaten' part was a hearsay, thus I would like to know the real intent of removing the video too. It would be great if the uploader could share some info with us, that is if he browses this forum. I got word from some friends that the performers are being punished by doubling their routine job of which nature I think I'm not supposed to reveal, but I'm curious of one thing. In the SAF, if the commanders make you do your routine job more tediously than usual, it's a good cover up for more punishment right? I mean it's not recorded that you are being punished, instead you get twice as much work to do and you can't complain about it right? You can't say that the punishment is not justified because theoretically you aren't being punished?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just a fyi for non spds trained posters, the drill squad members are supposed to be very well versed in their trade, and past practices was that if you are not good enough, you get wacked jia lat jia lat until your drills become super zai then you get to perform, if not no show at all.<br><br>Why we were all so pissed and frustrated when we watch this video is cos the drills done in this particular COG is already the lowest level, any lower and you might as well be doing drills without a rifle. And if these are fundamental drills, how come can screw up until like that? If you watch other COGs right, you will notice there are tosses of rifles etc, when people falter on these, they get a pat on the back and encouragement because EVERYONE knows that these are really hard, tossing 6 kg shiet around is no joke.<br><br>ya saint we shouldn't condemn the entire unit, I believe all the screw up that happened is cos commanders like to point fingers.. that chief instructor prolly kena arrow to become chief instructor when he is cmi in spds<br><br>sad to say but last time my spds pass out parade we did drills that were more complexed than this COG and there was almost no screw up cos those who screw up cannot 'graduate' lol<br><br>venny now you know why we so pissed off?</div>

And if these are fundamental drills, how come can screw up until like that? If you watch other COGs right, you will notice there are tosses of rifles etc, when people falter on these, they get a pat on the back and encouragement because EVERYONE knows that these are really hard, tossing 6 kg shiet around is no joke.<br><br>ya saint we shouldn't condemn the entire unit, I believe all the screw up that happened is cos commanders like to point fingers.. that chief instructor prolly kena arrow to become chief instructor when he is cmi in spds<br><br>sad to say but last time my spds pass out parade we did drills that were more complexed than this COG and there was almost no screw up cos those who screw up cannot 'graduate' lol<br><br>venny now you know why we so pissed off?</div></blockquote>ur point can understand. But can u understand the situation now ?Last time when APC n ZPC diff coy we specialise , now LL every1 has to do everything . Simply put , MORE WORK=LESS DELICATION=LOW MORALE. Had few apc friends telling me the CSM then very nice n take care to apc one , now new management new shit, culture change . MOreover , already said the glorious days u guys had is to be able to mount 2x72men Contigents . BUt now to form 1x oso quite chor liao. Even those never kena parade 72m , LL have to da GD . U go figure out la . Ratio nv change . But manpower downsize more than half. It is not they never and do not want to put in effort but simply bo xim to do , no motivation . I reckon u know u guys do a parade can get offs , but now they r more stingy to give from what i heard . I hear liao oso sian for them.</div>
