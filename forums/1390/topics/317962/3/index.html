              <p>is IC2 much tougher than IC1 or generally still slack compared to other vocations?</p>

              <p>IC2 is "physically" more demanding because of the fact that you will be on foot most of the time. If you posted to infantry, you are expected to perform whatever a riflemen does besides your signal role too.You will have to lug around that bloody manpack radio on top of the usual combat load. Route march have to go,field camp have to go,they attack up the hill,you go along with them,they run,you run too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Watch that injury of yours especially if it is lower limb or spinal.</p>

              <p>and @ exonerate, Welcome to SI. dont complain abt the bunks and stuff bah, you will get used to it, Stagmont aint exactly a new camp bro. actually SI stand by bed also so slack so doesnt really matter leh.if im not wrong right, when u finish ur spec course in SI, the cadets will also finish right?</p>
