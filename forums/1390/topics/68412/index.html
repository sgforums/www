Then there were two ops bacinet, the first one it was one day work, one day off, one day(morning til afternoon) go back camp training. The 2nd one was pretty ridiculous, two days work, off one day, fourth day training( route marches and pt ) And things that happen in the route marches are really crap. Made each company( which consists of one shift, the other is doing duty ) carry two tentage, walk a distance, set up tentage competition, carry the set up tentage run around a tree.

RSM, SOF, voted best soldier in U.S. for some compeitition of commandos, was the previous RSM of ADF. Not bad har, I find it quite impressive, still got sniper and navyseal.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jacobs:</div><div class="quote_body">Ya, they are on, very very on. Supportive? My unit did 12 alert red in yr 2003 i think. Either we are on alert red or outfield, there was once the company on alert red was made to go outfield too. Imagine all the trouble of cleaning and replacement of spoil equipment. Then there were two ops bacinet, the first one it was one day work, one day off, one day(morning til afternoon) go back camp training. The 2nd one was pretty ridiculous, two days work, off one day, fourth day training( route marches and pt ) And things that happen in the route marches are really crap. Made each company( which consists of one shift, the other is doing duty ) carry two tentage, walk a distance, set up tentage competition, carry the set up tentage run around a tree. Crappy stuff, lotsa them.... wear admin, SBO, wear boots then carry jerry cans and sandbag in public, walk pasts tanah merah mrt all that. i can go on and on....</div></blockquote>So, which unit u from? Last time my unit also very on cos wanted to be best of the best ma..COs also will get promoted faster mah.</div>
