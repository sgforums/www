            <div class='col-md body'>Can our soldiers really kill?<br><br>I'll offer a two-part answer. The first, what is your immediate reaction when I say "citizen soldier". Keeping in mind that Singapore has one of the world's longest tenures of mobilizable personnel. We're not volunteers or a militia; neither are we professionals nor part of a permanent standing force throughout. But, &amp; I'm sure many of you shall find out, you &amp; your teenage buddies who are training together now will still be doing the same when you hit thirtysomething. That's over 10 years, man. Not everyone will like each other; age will set in sooner or later; guys will get posted in &amp; out. But the core bonding will be there. We may not be battle-tested, but if you read the memoirs of those who were, it's often the small-group brotherhood that shall help one survive. In decisive times, take care of the smaller things first, &amp; let the larger stuff worry itself.<br><br>On a less serious note, my other answer is to not to get too idealistically absorbed. If you've ever charged up Good Morning Hill at SAFTI, you'd known a million things is always happening at the same time! Factor in enemies bullets &amp;/or mortar shells, plus your own increasing fatigue -- of course it's natural to panic, or freeze up, or fire back blindly! But, before your nerve fails you for good (i.e. turn coward), instinct &amp; rote training shall come forth first. Not the other way around. Duty too (I almost say "obedience"), when you receive a command &amp; realize you must execute it to get things done.</div>

Military training has over the ages since WW2, been trying to take away this instinct by training methods that make it easier and easier for the soldier to kill.<br><br>If you ask me, our modern soceity with it's heavy amount of violence in the media and entertainment, along with our modern, realistic training methods, will mean that our soldiers will have far less issues with killing them the grunt in WW1 or WW2 had.<br><br>But what happens after the war, is another issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;with our modern, realistic training methods, will mean that our soldiers will have far less issues with killing them the grunt in WW1 or WW2 had.&lt;&lt;<br><br>More impersonal, yeah.<br><br>But since the thread starter focused more about close-quarter combat, I'm not sure modern technology has had a great effect here. The M1 Carbine they used is the predecessor's of today's M16. What's so high-tech? (The M1 Garand, according to google, lasted until the Korean Wear &amp; is a silent-precision drill rifle nowadays.)<br><br>Reflex &amp; rote training will take over in the real thing. We all have experienced it some in our NS. Remember the CTSS package (or whatever you call it nowadays) in the shooting range? Not sure if you guys do the full 300m rundown anymore. But its last part -- when you're panting like mad, &amp; the targets flip up 10m ahead, &amp; you thrust your rifle against your hip &amp; straighten the front arm &amp; then fire -- you learn to shut out everything &amp; execute automatically. Then you hear a command, &amp; it's the same: ease spring, squeeze trigger &amp; clear arms.<br><br>Ditto with bayonet fighting. All the infamous "see that tree, go touch it" appetizers have a designed purpose, to render you completely shagged out. After all, you're not going to fix bayonets a mile from the enemy in the real thing. Again, rote training (&amp; pent-up aggression) takes over, since it's too tiring to second-guess things. Who knows, this conditioned reaction may save you someday.<br><br>These kind of habit are ingrained from drill. It'll be the same thing inside a AMX-13, or firing a 155m howitzer, etc. &amp; they shall be applicable in wartime. To Singlish, it's "mo2 lian4", not "xun4 lian4."<br><br>On a sidenote, I found it curious that a WW2 example was used but, to take it at face value, I don't think the Yankees then were as "prepared" as today's troops, inc. the SAF. America had gone isolationist after WWI (indirectly allowing fascism &amp; Nazism to fester within the vacuum), &amp; their military forces drastically reduced by 1940. The troops they sent to WWII were conscripts, but with less training compared to now. That's why they're so heroic, despite all the setbacks, obstacles &amp; inexperience. The Australian counterparts who were sent to Singapore were defeated by the Japs, but who's to say they weren't gallant too? Baptism of fire, man.<br></div>

The American and Kuwaities thought the Iraqi tank unit wanted to surrender.....but when the Iraqi tanks came within point blank range...they turned their guns around and blasted the American and Kuwaiti positions.  A good number of Americans died in that ambush, eventhough they managed to eventually destroy the Iraqi tank units.<br>[I can't remember the name of the battle....you may need to read it up].<br><br>Therefore, no second thought about it, I will shoot the enemy dead, enemy wayang or no wayang. As long as the enemy fire his weapon, i have the legitimate right to kill the enemy.<br><br>Anyway, i know that when the time comes for me to be at the front facing the enemy, most likely i won't make it back alive...[unless the heavenly powers dictate that i can return safely after the war]. So before i go down ...i am gonna take some with me to hell!!!</div>
