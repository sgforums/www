If everyone in the office just packs up their stuff properly there wouldn't be a need for any duty clerk.  And having the duty clerk stay back (sometimes till late evening) until everyone else leaves the office is plain retarded.

I have no issue with that.<br><br>I'm talking about smaller scale duty like office duty clerk within your own office.  For eg.  S1 branch duty clerk.</div>
