              <p>Hi forum , so my 1st post regarding BMT/PTP was a few months ago , when i was a zero fighter and still struggling with 2.4k but now , miraculously , im able to maintain the ippt requirements for silver.</p>
              <p>Now the next big thing on my mind is Field Camp. I heard that's where individuals will be pushed over their limits. Ive heard different stories of how Sgt's f--- their recruits during field camp , of how extreme and boring and tiring it can get. Well , basically i haven't heard a single good or neutral response regarding field camp since day 1 of enlistment. Now Its approaching in 3 weeks and im extremely worried.</p>
              <p>My field camp and SITtest will be combined , which will be 6day5nights iirc. Anyone has any tips on how to overcome this mentally/physically ? Any good comments for field camp ?</p>
              <p>I am extremely and overly worried about field camp and i hope the forum can help lift off this burden anyway they can.</p>
              <p><br>PS : I have no buddy. Buddy OOT/OOC due to ankle injury</p>

              <p>Ah, field camp... For me, that was in 2003. I remembered on the day of the field camp, it was an exciting moment, it being an unknown thing for me. 7 days outfield, and when we came back, there's no better feeling than eating solid food and feet touching solid concrete ground!</p>
              <p>Basically once you are outfield, your sergeants will ask all of you to put on the cameo. Those creamy stuffs that paint your face green, brown and black. Haha, I can still recalled many recruits hesitating to put it on until one of the sergeants shouted at us. In the end, we heck it, we just put it on real fast. After that, it was actually quite hard to tell who is who.</p>
              <p>Then we are required to pluck out those long grasses and put it among our number 4 to blend in to the surroundings. If they can spot u, you fail.</p>
              <p>Food wise, mostly it will be combat rations although they do provide Maggie Mee. But for me, i never had the time nor chance to cook them. Most of the time, you will be hungry, and you are allowed to drink and eat, own time own target. When i say own time own target, you can even eat while your instructors are giving their briefings.</p>
              <p>Section mates wise, you will stay with them of course. And practicing those outfield battle technique and command. And you can even get to learn how to build your sleeping tent. Mind you, please be smart and choose a good spot.</p>
              <p>One of the hardest thing is digging the shell script, you might literally suffer from bruising and extreme back pain when doing it. Always think mind over body.</p>
              <p>The rest i leave it for you to find out. Its a one in a lifetime thing, outfield with your section mates only comes once in your lifetime. Enjoy it.</p>

              <p>Not to worry! 6 days is the <em>maximum</em> length of field camp, it does get shorter. You do get a bath.</p>
              <p>Physical exertions include route marches, field craft and (tactical) section movement. There is no time for tekan, because field camp runs on a very tight schedule and the instructors must let you have your sleep. Even less time for nonsense with your sit test built in. In fact, this is the only time you can get sloppy in BMT without punishment.</p>
              <p>Watch Every Signaporean Son and you'll be ashamed you were scared.</p>
              <p>I wonder why, too. I can't believe total time out field in 2.5 months of BMT is 6 days or less, and people are still scared. I'm only a few years out of NSF but I can hardly imagine what this is about. These guys don't learn anything about route marches, field craft and section movement outside of field camp. BMT's a joke.</p>

              <p>Hello forum ,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the replies regarding field camp.</p>
              <p>I honestly feel that going through field camp without excessive tekan would definitely be a positive experience. Its just that im getting bored and sick of all the types of tekan/punishments (everything out 1min , stand by universe 5min , everything in 3min , field pack half section level and lbv platoon level 1min , change into sbo n fall in 1min change back into admin fall in 1min , etc )  they have for us that im worried its gonna get much worse during field camp. I know it is nothing compared to what most of you might have experienced , but it has gotten extremely boring and annoying for me.</p>
              <p>The coy im from , the OC doesnt believe in push-ups as punishments , he loves to give annoying and boring punishments , to make u move fast. It isnt physically demanding , it just gets real boring and endless most of the time as there are always the slow ones. The only times we do pushups are only during strength training.</p>
              <p>Again , thanks for the replies. I will mentally prepare myself for field camp. I understand there will be the exciting periods , as well as the shag periods.  Im not worried about living/sleeping outfield or not being able to bathe multiple days. Im just worried they will destroy the "fun" with all the excessive tekan. I hope what alize has posted will happen to my field camp as well , i.e. very little tekan.</p>
              <p>With that , peace out sgforum :)<br><br>PS : I shouldnt say the Coy im from as 'we' might get in trouble.</p>

              <p>Hello forum ,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the replies regarding field camp.</p>
              <p>I honestly feel that going through field camp without excessive tekan would definitely be a positive experience. Its just that im getting bored and sick of all the types of tekan/punishments (everything out 1min , stand by universe 5min , everything in 3min , field pack half section level and lbv platoon level 1min , change into sbo n fall in 1min change back into admin fall in 1min , etc )  they have for us that im worried its gonna get much worse during field camp. I know it is nothing compared to what most of you might have experienced , but it has gotten extremely boring and annoying for me.</p>
              <p>The coy im from , the OC doesnt believe in push-ups as punishments , he loves to give annoying and boring punishments , to make u move fast. It isnt physically demanding , it just gets real boring and endless most of the time as there are always the slow ones. The only times we do pushups are only during strength training.</p>
              <p>Again , thanks for the replies. I will mentally prepare myself for field camp. I understand there will be the exciting periods , as well as the shag periods. Im not worried about living/sleeping outfield or not being able to bathe multiple days. Im just worried they will destroy the "fun" with all the excessive tekan. I hope what alize has posted will happen to my field camp as well , i.e. very little tekan.</p>
              <p>With that , peace out sgforum :)<br><br>PS : I shouldnt say the Coy im from as 'we' might get in trouble.</p>

              <p><br>is ok,,,,,boy scouts only took a bath once in 3 days or once in 7days.when i was young boy scout in secondary school we slept for 2 weeks in some jungle with 3~5 inch mud everwhere in some island.it was infested with scorpions,many worms,rats and snakes.at night feet had strange worms crawling up slippers n feet and mud on feet all the time.the whole place smelt n stank like rotted vegetation too.</p>
              <p>but all went on as usual.seas n swamps nearby had plenty of crocodiles as well.</p>
              <p>what i experienced as a secondary school kid for 2 weeks makes the army field camp for ns dudes look like the army is slacking off.</p>
              <p>hadf i been a general in spore army,i would have made an entire battalion camp out in the middle of a swamp for 1 week to see if they would be considered as real soldiers.those armies that cant take camping trips wont last long in any battle even with the very best strategy,generals,weapons and location.</p>

              <p>the event was something like this.</p>
              <p>1) in day light time, we practice water rationing, so like the whole day time, we can only have 1 water bottle of water, but when night falls you can drink whatever amount you want.</p>
              <p>2) for 2 days, is non-stop fire movement and every one takes turn to lead, thunder flashes, smoke grenade and blanks throw and fire till scared as in field still have rifle inspection.</p>
              <p>3) every morning still need to fall in for chin up practice, but in field is a killer as the bar is tie to the tree and we need to cahin up in Full battle order.. including whatever weapon you suppose to carry</p>
              <p>4) in night sleep time, still need to do guard duty and instructor will luanch an assualt and need to defend your camp</p>
              <p>5) last day starts at 7am, FBO need to topo 4 check point plus each check point was a mission to over run the enemy.. same only survive on 1 bottle of water... by the mission end at ard 7pm, the last run back, you be carry your FBO plus carry your buddy in FBO and run or jog back to pick up point which is ard 2km away...</p>

              <p>And there was another 3-day outfield SIT test two weeks later. So total 10 days + 3 days... go and think about it.</p>
