              <p>Having some difficulty whenever there is anything related to NS, even wearing a military uniform on. It lacks freedom due to regimentation and discipline.</p>
              <p>Don't know why I was constantly being bullied by peers. <br><em>Am I uncooperative in team work/ duty? </em></p>
              <p><strong><em>Can ask Chief Clerk/ Unit S1 Manpower Officer for a change in vocation? <br></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Should I ask MO for a referral to consult a SAF Psychiatrist to talk about adjustment to NS life? <br></em></strong></p>
              <p>Please, I hope for more constructive feedback. </p>

              <p><strong>NS have counselling hotlines for you to call if need arises.<br>The
                                                      counsellors are experienced professionals. </strong></p>
              <p>You can call them at the
                                                      following counselling hotlines:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>SAF : 1800-278 0022 (SAF Counselling Hotline)</strong></li>
              <li>SPF : 1800-255 1151 (Police Psychology Service Department)</li>
              <li>SCDF: 1800-286 6666 (SCDF Counselling Hotline)</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think you have been treated unfairly, you can bring up the 
                  case to your Commander. We will listen to your case. Do remember to 
                  bring along all facts and supporting documents.</p>
              <p>We will do our best to address your concerns. Servicemen 
                  are to seek redress through proper channels. Together, we can address 
                  your issue more expeditiously.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>================================================================</strong></em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and 
                          friends who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with 
                          others, the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and 
                      fellow recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, 
                      so talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also 
                      have some time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give 
                      you emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your 
                      officer to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal 
                      or family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer know—he 
                      may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline. This 
                      helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as imparts the 
                      rigours necessary to protect our nation and citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In 
                      fact, after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new 
                      reasons to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey 
                      orders from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of 
                      freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having 
                      difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and 
                      toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult combat, 
                      crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in a 
                      new territory, with new faces and new things to do.  But don’t let this 
                      get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets tough, 
                      the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some tips on what you can do to prepare yourself psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit </li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have been 
                      through NS. Ask them to share their stories.  The sharing will help you 
                      reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different people. </strong></p>
              <p>Because these 
                      people come from different backgrounds, they may not think like you do 
                      or react to situations like you would. Instead of trying to select your 
                      type of people, you should cherish the diversity. This is a chance for 
                      you to learn more about your fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb 
                      the different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing 
                      and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people around 
                      you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s cultural 
                      diversity.</p>
