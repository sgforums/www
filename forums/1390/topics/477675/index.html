              <p>Under the Enlistment Act, all male Singapore Citizens and
              Permanent Residents, unless exempted, are liable to register for
              National Service (NS). Following the completion of full-time NS,
              they will be required to serve up to 40 days of Operationally Ready
              National Service (ORNS) per year for the duration of their
              ORNS training cycle till the age of 50 years (for officers) or
              40 years (for other ranks).<br> <br> Male children who are granted PR status under their parents'
              sponsorship are liable for NS under the Enlistment Act. They are
              required to register for NS upon reaching 16½ years old and will be
              scheduled for enlistment at the earliest opportunity upon reaching
              18 years old. If they are pursuing full-time studies, deferment
              from full-time NS may be granted only if they meet the
              deferment conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Defence which
              can be found at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ns.sg/">www.ns.sg</a>. All NS-liable males aged 13 years old and
              above, are required to obtain an Exit Permit (EP) when travelling
              overseas for 3 months or more.</p>
              <p>NS-liable PRs are expected to serve NS. Renouncing or losing
              one's PR status without serving or completing full-time NS would
              have an adverse impact on any immediate or future applications to
              work or study in Singapore, or for Singapore citizenship or PR
              status.<br> <br> Males who are granted Singapore PR, and who were previously
              Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents, are liable to
              be called up for NS regardless of the type of PR status they have
              been granted. For further enquiries, please write to:<br> <br> Central Manpower Base<br> CMPB Podium<br> 3, Depot Road<br> Singapore 109680<br> Tel : 1800-3676767 (local)<br> 65-65676767 (overseas)<br> Email: <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:contact@ns.sg">contact@ns.sg</a></p>

              <h2>NS facts</h2>
              <p>National Service (NS) was introduced in 1967, shortly after
              Singapore’s independence, to defend our nation. Since then, 700 000
              sons of Singapore have served their NS.</p>
              <p>Every son is important to Singapore. NS will transform our boys
              into men, a path trodden by many sons of Singapore and more to
              come. Your son is no different. Your son’s potential will be put to
              test in a challenging environment that will strengthen his mental
              and physical abilities. Living together with peers from different
              ethnicity and backgrounds, he will also appreciate the importance
              of teamwork and unity.</p>
              <p>NS, is the responsibility of every male Singapore citizen and
              permanent resident (PR) when they reach the age of 18. This is
              compulsory, governed under the Enlistment Act.</p>
              <p>If your son is a male Singapore citizen or a PR, he is liable
              for NS when he reaches 16½ years old. He is to enlist at the first
              opportunity upon reaching 18 years old.</p>
              <p>Your son will serve in one of the 3 Uniformed Services:</p>

              </ol>
              <p>NS requires 2 years in active service as a Full-Time National
              Serviceman (NSF). After the 2 years of NS, your son will serve as
              an Operationally Ready National Serviceman (NSman) up to the age of
              40. Officers or those with special skills may serve until the age
              of 50.</p>

              <h2>Benefits of NS</h2>
              <p>NS isn’t just about serving the nation—NS benefits you as
              well.</p>
              <p>Firstly and obviously, your <strong>physical fitness will
              improve</strong>. You will be <strong>stronger and
              tougher</strong>. You may even <strong>look better</strong>!</p>
              <p>NS training doesn’t just toughen up your body; it
              <strong>toughens your mind too</strong>. You will become
              <strong>more confident and capable.</strong></p>
              <p>NS brings together people from all walks of life—different
              races, different religions, some rich, some poor, some educated,
              and some not so educated—you will also learn to live and work
              closely with those <strong>who are different from you</strong>.</p>
              <p>At the end of it all, you will notice changes in you. You will
              become <strong>more mature and independent</strong>—no longer the
              boy you once were.</p>
              <p><strong>You will become a man.</strong></p>

              <h2>Why NS?</h2>
              <p>NS was introduced in 1967, just 2 years after Singapore’s
              independence to ensure the peace and stability of our nation.</p>
              <strong>We are a 'little red dot'.</strong>
              <p>With a population of 4.4 million and a land of 699 square km,
              Singapore is amongst the 20 smallest countries in the world.
              Singapore is too small to change the world. Instead, we must adapt
              as the world changes around us.</p>
              <a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg"><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg" alt="Storming the hideout" width="288" height="216"></a>
              <h3>Importance of NS</h3>
              <p>We must be able to defend Singapore ourselves. No one else is
              responsible for our security and we cannot depend on others to come
              to our defence.</p>
              <p>Our defence is predicated on deterrence. That is why we invest
              heavily and consistently in building up a strong defence force to
              provide that deterrence.</p>
              <p>At the same time, we seek to be friends with as many countries
              as possible in the region and beyond. By having friends who can
              help us in our times of need, we enhance our security.</p>
              <h3>Need for NS</h3>
              <p>NS is our only viable option to building up a credible defence
              force to ensure our survival. A conscription force by law which
              obliges all eligible people to enlist would create a sizeable
              standing force ready to guarantee our security.</p>
              <p>The <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> maintains
              itself in a high state of operational readiness at all times so
              that it is able to react swiftly to any threat.</p>
              <p>To meet the defence challenges in the 21st century, the
              <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> is upgrading and
              transforming itself into a highly sophisticated, well-integrated
              fighting force.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg"><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg" alt="Third Generation SAF" width="288" height="216"></a></p>
              <p>The Third Generation <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> will be a network-centric
              organisation. Our forces will be interconnected, equipped with
              electronic information systems, and be able to fight cooperatively,
              and in an integrated manner, on land, in the air and on the
              sea.</p>
              <p>Within the nation itself, the <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> upholds the law and maintains
              order, keeping the streets safe for family and friends.</p>
              <p>And in case of any crisis or emergency, such as a major accident
              or a terrorist attack, the <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> will be there to rescue
              and save the lives of fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>All together, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr>, <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> and <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> play a key role in
              Singapore’s Total Defence—Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic
              Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence.</p>

              <h2><br></h2>
              <h2>Supporting your son</h2>
              <p>NS is a crucial phase in your son’s life. He will be moving from
              a cosy home environment to one that requires him to be independent,
              disciplined and fit.</p>
              <p>These are big changes for your son and you can do your part by
              supporting him during NS. The support and encouragement that you
              provide will help make his transition from a boy to man an easy and
              enjoyable one.</p>
              <p>Here are a few simple things you can do as a parent:</p>
              <dl><dt>Before NS</dt><dd><strong>Prepare</strong>: a sure way to help your son is to
              prepare him for NS life. This can be as simple as encouraging him
              be independent and fit. The earlier he learns these traits the
              better he will be able to cope with NS life. You can also encourage
              him to talk to friends or family members who have been through NS
              to learn from their NS experiences. So start early with this.</dd><dt>The first days</dt><dd><strong>Observe</strong>: The first few days or initial weeks
              of NS are the most crucial. This is the time where your son will
              most likely feel the impact of the change. Talking to him during
              this period will give him encouragement to take the change in his
              stride.</dd><dt>Regular weekends</dt><dd><strong>Converse</strong>: NS has much to offer in terms of
              rich experiences—new people, new practices, new words and new
              friends. Be a part of your son’s NS life by having a conversation
              about his NS experiences. This is a good opportunity for you to
              bond with your son.</dd></dl></div>

              <p>As DEFENCE policymakers here consider roping in more female
              volunteers, Singapore is looking at its European counterparts to
              learn how they get women to do their part for defence.<br> <br> Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen is leading a delegation on a visit to
              Finland and Switzerland to study their conscription system.<br> <br> On the team are senior Defence Ministry officials and members of
              the high-level Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS),
              including Minister of State for Defence Mohamad Maliki Osman and MP
              for Nee Soon GRC Lim Wee Kiak.<br> <br> On his visit to Finland which began on Wednesday, Dr Ng called on
              his counterpart, Mr Carl Haglund and other top-level defence
              officials, including the Commander of the Finnish Defence Forces
              General Ari Puheloinen.<br> <br> Mindef said in a statement yesterday that the delegation was
              briefed on Finland's defence policy and conscription system,
              including the Finnish voluntary military service for women.</p>
              <p>Since the volunteer scheme started in 1995, about 400 Finnish
              women are drafted each year. A 2012 survey showed more than 70 per
              cent of Finns support compulsory national service. During its visit
              to the Finnish Armoured Brigade, the delegation saw how soldiers
              were trained and was briefed on how the military matched their
              aptitudes and preferences to their vocations.<br> <br> The visit is part of efforts by the CSNS to canvass feedback on its
              area of concern. Proposals will be submitted to the Government
              early next year.<br> <br> Dr Ng said it was useful to learn from Finland's experience, as it,
              like Singapore, "guards its independence and sovereignty fiercely,
              having been colonised and occupied in its past". "Even after nearly
              a century, it has still kept its commitment to conscription for
              this primary purpose."</p>

              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen led a delegation comprising
              members from the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) on
              a visit to Finland from 16 to 17 October 2013 to study its
              conscription system. The delegation included Minister of State for
              Defence Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman and Chairman of the Government
              Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign Affairs Dr Lim Wee
              Kiak.</p>
              <p>During the visit, Dr Ng met with Finnish Minister of Defence
              Carl Haglund, State Secretary to the Minister of Defence Marcus
              Rantala, Permanent Secretary of Defence Lieutenant General Arto
              Räty, Commander of the Finnish Defence Forces General Ari
              Puheloinen, and Chairman of the Finnish Parliament's Defence
              Committee Jussi Niinistö. Dr Ng's visit underscores the friendly
              defence relations between Singapore and Finland.</p>
              <p>The delegation was briefed on Finland's security and defence
              policy, and its conscription system. The delegation noted that
              public support for conscription in Finland is high. In a survey
              conducted in 2012, more than 70% of the public supported the
              conscription system. The delegation also learnt more about the
              voluntary military service available to women since 1995. Each
              year, about 400 Finnish women are accepted as volunteer military
              conscripts.</p>
              <p>The delegation visited the Finnish Armoured Brigade in
              Parolannummi to learn more about basic, vocational and leadership
              training for military conscripts. The delegation was also briefed
              on how conscripts' aptitudes and preferences are taken into
              consideration for deployment. During the visit, the delegation had
              the opportunity to interact with conscripts and witnessed their
              rigorous training.</p>
              <p>At the end of the visit, Dr Ng highlighted that "even though
              Singapore's security and domestic landscape is different from
              Finland, it is useful to study the conscription system of Finland
              and learn from their experiences. Like Singapore, Finland guards
              its independence and sovereignty fiercely, having been colonised
              and occupied in its past. Even after nearly a century, it has still
              kept its commitment to conscription for this primary purpose. It
              has been a meaningful trip for the CSNS delegation as we consider
              how to build on the strong public support for National Service in
              Singapore by expanding opportunities for the broader community to
              contribute to national defence, and optimise the contributions of
              national servicemen."</p>
              <p>The visit is part of the CSNS' effort to study best practices in
              other countries as it examines measures to strengthen NS in
              Singapore. The delegation is currently in Switzerland studying its
              conscription system.</p>

              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen, who led a CSNS delegation to
              study conscription systems, was in Finland from 16 to 17 October
              2013 and in Switzerland from 17 to 18 October 2013. The delegation
              included Minister of State for Defence Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman
              and Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence
              and Foreign Affairs Dr Lim Wee Kiak.</p>
              <p>While in Switzerland, Dr Ng was hosted by and met President of
              the Swiss Confederation and Head of the Federal Department of
              Defence, Civil Protection and Sport Ueli Maurer. He also met Chief
              of the Swiss Armed Forces Lieutenant General (LG) André Blattmann
              and Commander of the Swiss Air Force LG Aldo Schellenberg. The
              visit underscores the friendly defence relations between Singapore
              and Switzerland.</p>
              <p>The delegation was briefed on the Swiss conscription system. It
              was noted that Switzerland has enjoyed peace for more than two
              hundred years and there continues to be strong public support for
              conscription. The delegation also learnt how the Swiss Armed Forces
              strengthens employers' support for conscription through various
              engagement activities, which allow the employers to better
              appreciate how military training develops the individual and brings
              value to their companies.</p>
              <p>The delegation visited Payerne Air Base and was briefed on how
              conscripts support the operations of the air base. The delegation
              also interacted with Swiss reservists on their annual refresher
              training and learnt how they maintained their military skills and
              technical competencies.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the end of the trip, Dr Ng said, "The Swiss take
              great pride in their conscription system which has maintained their
              neutrality and independence and receives strong support through the
              generations. The Swiss Armed Forces has an efficient conscript
              training system which takes into consideration conscripts'
              abilities, motivation and aptitude during the assignment of
              military vocations. Women can also volunteer for conscription. The
              CSNS will review the lessons learnt and consider ways to optimise
              the contributions of our servicemen."</p>
              The third phase of public consultation by the CSNS will involve
              discussion of proposals in more detail. Members of the public who

              <p>Back in 1967, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew's pitch to the
                  nation for conscription was: "It will take many years - perhaps
                  five, perhaps seven, perhaps 10 years - before we can get the whole
                  machine into gear. <strong>But in the end, every boy and girl here will
                  understand that what he or she has in Singapore, he or she must be
                  prepared to fight and defend. Otherwise, it will be lost."</strong></p>
              <strong> </strong>
              <p>It seems that the country's first defence minister, Dr Goh Keng
                  Swee, was prescient when, in asking Parliament to pass the National
                  Service Bill in 1967, he said: <strong>"Nothing creates loyalty and
                  national consciousness more speedily and more thoroughly than
                  participation in defence and membership of the armed forces."</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Though Singapore only gained her current version of armed forces
                  in 1967, the history of her defence started long before then. Under
                  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v01n02b_history.html">colonial rule that started in 1819</a>, Singapore
                  relied on British forces to protect her from all threats. A turning
                  point occurred in 1854 with the creation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v11n07_history.html">Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps (SVRC)</a>, a
                  volunteer organisation to maintain internal security.</p>
              <p>In 1888, the SVRC became the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v09n02_history.html">Singapore Volunteer Artillery (SVA)</a>, and its
                  success prompted formation of other volunteer corps.  In 1901,
                  these were all consolidated into the Singapore Volunteer Corps
                  (SVC). In 1922, the SVC was renamed the Straits Settlements
                  Volunteer Force (SSVF) to include volunteer forces from Malacca and
                  Penang.</p>
              <p>In December 1941, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n12_history.html">Japanese campaign into South East Asia</a> had
                  begun. The British commanders had thought that Singapore was an
                  "impregnable fortress", but troops stationed here were
                  inexperienced compared to the Japanese forces.. On 10 Dec 1941,
                  disaster struck when two British battleships, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v08n12_history.html">Repulse and Prince of Wales</a>, were sunk by
                  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v10n12_history.html">Japanese planes</a>. On 8 February, the Japanese
                  crossed the narrow Straits of Johore into Kranji and Sarimbun,
                  beginning their invasion of Singapore. For the next seven days, the
                  British put up stiff resistance but were no match for the Japanese.
                  Volunteer forces also fought alongside regular forces in the
                  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n02_history.html">Battles of Bukit Timah and Pasir Panjang</a> to fend
                  off the Japanese. Despite all their efforts, on 15th February 1942,
                  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n02a_history.html">Singapore was surrendered</a>.</p>
              <p>During the Japanese occupation, the Straits Settlements
                  Volunteer Force (SSVF) and local forces were indispensable to the
                  war effort. SSVF corpswoman <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v07n10_history.html">Elizabeth Choy</a> was detained and interrogated by
                  the Kempeitai alongside other locals following the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v03n10_history.html">Double Tenth Massacre</a>. Men and women such as
                  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n06_history.html">Lim Bo Seng</a> joined special operations forces,
                  gathered intelligence and fought where they could. The Chinese in
                  Singapore's volunteer armies were targeted during the Sook Ching
                  Massacre, or sent with other prisoners of war to build the Death
                  Railway.</p>
              <p>In May 1945, the war in Europe ended with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html">Germany's surrender</a>. Soon after, the bombing of
                  Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945 respectively
                  signalled the end of Japan's war efforts. On 15 August 1945, the
                  Japanese invaders in Singapore <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html">laid down their arms</a> and the Japanese occupation
                  was over.</p>
              <div>
              <p>The perceived failure of the British to defend Singapore against
                  the Japanese during WWII caused Singaporeans to desire greater
                  autonomy from the British and precipitated the formation of the
                  Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). The Straits Settlements Volunteer
                  Force (SSVF), which had been dissolved, was reinstated in 1949 as
                  the SVC to keep peace domestically.</p>
              <p>The year 1957 saw the establishment of the first battalion of
                  regular soldiers, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n11_history.html">First Singapore Infantry Regiment</a> (1 SIR).
                  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html">2 SIR</a> joined 1 SIR in 1962. Their first real
                  test came in 1963 in the form of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html">Konfrantasi</a>. 1 SIR, 2 SIR, the Singapore
                  Volunteer Corps (SVC) and the Vigilante Corps (VC) were all
                  deployed to protect strategically important sites. The VC found
                  incredible support from citizens, with 91.4% of eligible men
                  volunteering.</p>
              <p>On 9 August 1965, after more than 100 years of British colonial
                  rule and two tumultuous years under the Malaysian Federation,
                  Singapore was declared a sovereign and independent nation. It was a
                  time of great uncertainty as the leaders were faced with the
                  enormous task of charting the path of our national destiny.
                  Nevertheless, Singapore was determined to not only survive on its
                  own but to succeed.</p>
              <p>An urgent priority after independence was to build up
                  Singapore's own defence capability. Singapore then had only two
                  infantry battalions of 50 officers and some 1,000 men and two
                  ships. There was no airforce. Singapore's armed forces had to be
                  created virtually from scratch.</p>
              <p>In August 1965, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v07n11_history.html">Ministry of the Interior and Defence</a> (MID) was
                  established with Dr. Goh Keng Swee as its first Minister. The key
                  priority then was to build up the Army into a credible force as
                  soon as possible. With its small population and the need to channel
                  resources to economic development, it was decided that Singapore's
                  defence would be based on citizen armed forces. However, there was
                  no military tradition in Singapore. The bulk of the population had
                  traditionally held military service in low esteem. An intense
                  educational effort was required to overcome such attitudes.
                  Ministers, Members of Parliament, senior civil servants and
                  community leaders volunteered to serve in the People's Defence
                  Force. In this way, they set an example and drove home the message
                  that it was the responsibility of every citizen to defend their
                  nation.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v06n02_history.html">National Service</a> started two years later in
                  1967. The NS (Amendment) Bill, 1967 was first read in Parliament on
                  27 Feb 1967. After a spirited debate in Parliament, the Act was
                  finally passed on 14 Mar 1967.</p>
              <p>The passing of the NS (Amendment) Act in mid-Mar 1967 was a
                  turning point in the lives of Singaporean males. Between 28 Mar and
                  18 Apr 1967, registration began in earnest at the Central Manpower
                  Base (CMPB) and its district offices in Katong, Serangoon and Bukit
                  Panjang. Pink reminder cards were sent by post to the first batch
                  of citizens who were born between 1 Jan 1949 and 30 Jun 1949 - some
                  9,000 of them. This marked the beginning of the citizen army and
                  also the start of NS as a way of life for the male citizens of
                  Singapore.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v13n07_history.html">Republic of Singapore Navy</a> (RSN) began as the
                  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v10n01_history.html">Singapore Naval Volunteer Force</a> (SNVF) in 1966
                  with just three ships, RSS Panglima, RSS Bedok and RSS Singapura.
                  RSS Singapura, moored at Telok Ayer Basin, served as the SNVF's
                  first headquarters. Thus, the newly formed naval force had only two
                  seaworthy ships to form its sea defences.</p>
              <p>What the SNVF lacked in resources was made up for in
                  determination and hard work. Though a small force to begin with,
                  the SNVF underwent a period of rapid growth and development. It had
                  started off with former members of the Royal Malaysian Navy, who
                  were mobilised to form the nucleus of the fledgling force. The
                  following year saw the SNVF boost its numbers to 89 mobilised
                  personnel and 278 volunteer officers and men. Some were women from
                  the Singapore Women's Auxiliary Naval Service (or SWANS), which had
                  been formed in 1957. On 5 May 1967, the Singapore Naval White
                  Ensign was hoisted with pride, signalling that Singapore finally
                  had a navy to call its own. There was no looking back from then on,
                  as it embarked on a gradual upgrading of its equipment, personnel
                  and facilities. From the two ships in 1966, it subsequently grew
                  into a modern force, and officially was renamed the “Republic of
                  Singapore Navy” in April 1975.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n09_history.html">Republic of Singapore Air Force</a> also has very
                  modest beginnings. In 1968, the Singapore Air Defence Command
                  (SADC) was formed. It started with eight <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v08n05_history.html">Cessna 172-H</a> aircraft to train its pilots, and
                  by 1970 <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v12n12_history.html">Hawker Hunter</a> fighter aircraft had been added to
                  the fleet. When the British forces were withdrawn in 1971, Tengah,
                  Seletar, Sembawang and Changi airbases were entrusted to the SADC.
                  SADC became the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) in 1975.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of the Interior and Defence (MID) initially oversaw
                  both internal and external defence, but as the defence structure
                  grew and the work became more defined, it separated into two
                  specialised ministries. Thus, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and
                  the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mha.gov.sg">Ministry of Home
                  Affairs</a> (MHA) were formed in 1970.</p>
              <p>When the SAF first started in the 1960s, the most urgent focus
                  for what we now call the 1st Generation SAF was to provide for
                  Singapore's basic defence. The 2nd Generation SAF, from the early
                  80s to late 90s, saw the upgrading and modernising of our Army,
                  Navy and Air Force. Post-9/11, there was a shift in the security
                  landscape, which widened to include non-conventional threats such
                  as terrorism and piracy.</p>
              <p>Resource constraints and the emergence of advanced warfighting
                  technologies also drove the SAF to rethink our development
                  trajectory. To meet new security challenges effectively, the SAF
                  embarked on a 3rd Generation transformation journey in 2004 and
                  continues today to upgrade its capabilities into an advanced
                  networked force.</p>
              Today, the SAF is respected as a strong and professional armed
                  forces. The SAF has developed leading-edge capabilities, networked
                  together as an integrated fighting system.</div>

              <p>"<strong>Civil Defence</strong>" is about ensuring Singaporeans
              know what to do in times of an emergency. The Singapore Civil
              Defence Force (SCDF) supports this aspect of Total Defence.
              However, if Singapore encounters a nation-wide emergency (e.g.:
              terrorism act or war), the SCDF will not be able to cope with the
              demands of the situation. Hence, it is crucial to rope in
              Singaporeans to help their fellow Singaporeans. To facilitate this,
              the SCDF recruits and trains civil defence volunteers in first aid,
              rescue and evacuation procedures, and shelter management.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Economic Defence</strong>" is defined as maintaining
              the economy of the country and its ability to compete in the world,
              as well as environmental protection.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It also
              involves helping Singapore (and Singaporeans) stay relevant in the
              global economy and putting in place economic systems to ensure that
              the Singapore economy does not collapse in times of crisis.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Social Defence</strong>" is about keeping the social
              fabric strong and ensuring that Singaporeans live in harmony
              regardless of race or religion.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is
              especially important because Singapore is a multi-racial and
              multi-religious society.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Psychological Defence</strong>" is about loyalty,
              commitment to Singapore, and having the will power and resilience
              to overcome challenges.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is the
              component that would determine if Singaporeans will stay to fight
              or abandon the country when it is in trouble.</p>

              <div><span><strong>Protecting our way of life</strong><br> <br> Introduced in 1984, the concept of Total Defence (TD) was adapted
              from the experiences of countries like Switzerland and Sweden. As a
              young nation with a small population and a conscript armed forces,
              we needed to draw on the different strengths and abilities of our
              community to augment our defence capability.<br> <br> Conflicts between countries are no longer just military in nature.
              Potential aggressors and threats can appear in less obvious and
              non-conventional ways (e.g., destroying social cohesion by
              exploiting differences in race, language, religion, culture, social
              or economic class; weakening national resilience by using
              psychological warfare to play on the people’s fears and
              apprehensions; or waging economic warfare through economic
              boycotts, trade sanctions or acts of sabotage to bring down the
              economy). Total Defence provides the framework for a comprehensive
              and integrated response to deal with all kinds of threats and
              challenges. Whether it is a security threat such as global
              terrorism, or a national crisis like SARS, Total Defence brings
              together all relevant government agencies, private sector
              organisations and all Singaporeans in a coordinated effort to deal
              effectively with these threats and challenges. When Singaporeans
              take personal responsibility for and get involved in the defence of
              Singapore, they are playing their part to help keep Singapore safe
              and secure.<br> <br> Total Defence has five aspects - Military Defence, Civil Defence,
              Economic Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence. These
              five aspects represent the key sectors of society. They also help
              Singaporeans understand how they can be involved. When we take
              National Service seriously, volunteer in civil defence exercises,
              help build a strong economy, strengthen community ties with one
              another regardless of race and religion, and stay committed to
              defend the country, we are doing something in every sector of our
              society to strengthen Singapore's resilience as a
              nation.</span></div>

              Total Defence: Military, Civil, Economic, Social and Psychological
              Defence.<br> <br> The arrows point in the same upward direction. This signifies
              concerted effort towards a common objective of safeguarding the
              progress and future of Singapore.<br> <br> The logo's outline is significant because:<br> <br> It is, firstly, the outline of a hand, symbolising action and
              representing unity and completeness. Total Defence is deficient if
              any of the five "fingers" is missing.<br> <br> Secondly, the logo is in the shape of a house, and symbolises
              Singapore as our homeland. With Total Defence, the security of our
              homeland is therefore safeguarded.<br> <br> The tagline "It's personal. Play your part." in its handwritten
              format emphasises the personal nature of and involvement in Total
              Defence, reminding Singaporeans that they have a part to play in
              the defence of Singapore. The rounder edges of the logo give it a
              softer feel, reflecting the personal stake in Total Defence and
              encouraging Singaporeans to embrace Total Defence in their daily
              lives.<br> <br> The crescent and five stars, and the colours of red and white, are
              elements from the National Flag. They represent nationhood. Total
              Defence brings Singaporeans together as one people.<br> <br> Taken as a whole, the logo symbolises all Singaporeans doing what
              they can in Total Defence to ensure peace and security for the
              future.</span></div>

              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen led a delegation comprising
              members from the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) on
              a visit to Finland from 16 to 17 October 2013 to study its
              conscription system. The delegation included Minister of State for
              Defence Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman and Chairman of the Government
              Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign Affairs Dr Lim Wee
              Kiak.</p>
              <p>During the visit, Dr Ng met with Finnish Minister of Defence
              Carl Haglund, State Secretary to the Minister of Defence Marcus
              Rantala, Permanent Secretary of Defence Lieutenant General Arto
              Räty, Commander of the Finnish Defence Forces General Ari
              Puheloinen, and Chairman of the Finnish Parliament's Defence
              Committee Jussi Niinistö. Dr Ng's visit underscores the friendly
              defence relations between Singapore and Finland.</p>
              <p>The delegation was briefed on Finland's security and defence
              policy, and its conscription system. The delegation noted that
              public support for conscription in Finland is high. In a survey
              conducted in 2012, more than 70% of the public supported the
              conscription system. The delegation also learnt more about the
              voluntary military service available to women since 1995. Each
              year, about 400 Finnish women are accepted as volunteer military
              conscripts.</p>
              <p>The delegation visited the Finnish Armoured Brigade in
              Parolannummi to learn more about basic, vocational and leadership
              training for military conscripts. The delegation was also briefed
              on how conscripts' aptitudes and preferences are taken into
              consideration for deployment. During the visit, the delegation had
              the opportunity to interact with conscripts and witnessed their
              rigorous training.</p>
              <p>At the end of the visit, Dr Ng highlighted that "even though
              Singapore's security and domestic landscape is different from
              Finland, it is useful to study the conscription system of Finland
              and learn from their experiences. Like Singapore, Finland guards
              its independence and sovereignty fiercely, having been colonised
              and occupied in its past. Even after nearly a century, it has still
              kept its commitment to conscription for this primary purpose. It
              has been a meaningful trip for the CSNS delegation as we consider
              how to build on the strong public support for National Service in
              Singapore by expanding opportunities for the broader community to
              contribute to national defence, and optimise the contributions of
              national servicemen."</p>
              <p>The visit is part of the CSNS' effort to study best practices in
              other countries as it examines measures to strengthen NS in
              Singapore. The delegation is currently in Switzerland studying its
              conscription system.</p>

              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen, who led a CSNS delegation to
              study conscription systems, was in Finland from 16 to 17 October
              2013 and in Switzerland from 17 to 18 October 2013. The delegation
              included Minister of State for Defence Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman
              and Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence
              and Foreign Affairs Dr Lim Wee Kiak.</p>
              <p>While in Switzerland, Dr Ng was hosted by and met President of
              the Swiss Confederation and Head of the Federal Department of
              Defence, Civil Protection and Sport Ueli Maurer. He also met Chief
              of the Swiss Armed Forces Lieutenant General (LG) André Blattmann
              and Commander of the Swiss Air Force LG Aldo Schellenberg. The
              visit underscores the friendly defence relations between Singapore
              and Switzerland.</p>
              <p>The delegation was briefed on the Swiss conscription system. It
              was noted that Switzerland has enjoyed peace for more than two
              hundred years and there continues to be strong public support for
              conscription. The delegation also learnt how the Swiss Armed Forces
              strengthens employers' support for conscription through various
              engagement activities, which allow the employers to better
              appreciate how military training develops the individual and brings
              value to their companies.</p>
              <p>The delegation visited Payerne Air Base and was briefed on how
              conscripts support the operations of the air base. The delegation
              also interacted with Swiss reservists on their annual refresher
              training and learnt how they maintained their military skills and
              technical competencies.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the end of the trip, Dr Ng said, "The Swiss take
              great pride in their conscription system which has maintained their
              neutrality and independence and receives strong support through the
              generations. The Swiss Armed Forces has an efficient conscript
              training system which takes into consideration conscripts'
              abilities, motivation and aptitude during the assignment of
              military vocations. Women can also volunteer for conscription. The
              CSNS will review the lessons learnt and consider ways to optimise
              the contributions of our servicemen."</p>
              The third phase of public consultation by the CSNS will involve
              discussion of proposals in more detail. Members of the public who
              wish to participate can find out more at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.strengthenNS.sg">www.strengthenNS.sg</a>.</div>

              <p>After over 40 years, National Service is now woven tightly into
              the fabric of our nation. As we look to the future, to maintain if
              not strengthen this commitment to NS, we asked Singaporeans for
              their views and ideas.</p>
              <p>From May to August 2013, over 10,000 participants responded with
              their feedback and suggestions on NS to the website
              (www.strengthenNS.sg), through emails or attended focus group
              discussions. They came from different walks of life and included
              operationally-ready national servicemen, full-time national
              servicemen, regular servicemen, parents, women, grassroots
              volunteers, employers, students and members of the public.</p>
              <p>In this section, we sum up their conversations which affirm that
              NS is necessary and critical to Singapore’s security and
              prosperity. We want to thank all participants for the many lively
              discussions on their NS experience, the practical suggestions on
              what could be improved, and good ideas on what should be
              strengthened so that NS remains meaningful for the future
              generation.</p>
              <p>Four broad themes covering a range of insights and perspectives
              have emerged:</p>

              <div>
              <div>
              <p>“NS is a common language amongst Singaporeans. It fosters
              national identity and pride. Regardless of background or social
              group, it brings people together. It is a social glue.”</p>
              <p><br> “NS is one of the key reasons why Singaporeans enjoy peace and
              prosperity today. Forgetting this is dangerous and could undermine
              our future.”</p>
              <p><br> NS strengthens national identity and social cohesion. The shared
              experiences and friendships forged during NS have become an
              integral part of our personal ties that form communities and unite
              us as a people. Reinforcing the purpose of NS will inspire national
              servicemen to give of their best when performing their duties.
              There were also suggestions to encourage more people in the
              community, including women and new citizens to play a part in
              national defence.</p>
              <p><br> “Everyone must see the significance of NS and cultivate a natural
              inclination to preserve what we have as a nation.”</p>
              <p>“There are women and new citizens who may want to volunteer for
              national defence. This will enable them to better empathize with
              our NSmen and develop a stronger sense of national identity.”</p>

              <p>“NS was tough but it has made me more resilient, mature and
              responsible. The experience has taught me to cope with challenging
              situations and value teamwork.”</p>
              <p><br> “I would like to contribute more during NS. There could be avenues
              for us to express our preference of vocations, based on our skills
              and abilities.”</p>
              <p><br> NS builds up personal character and resilience. National servicemen
              value the opportunities for personal growth and the life skills
              developed during NS. Many would like to take on bigger roles in NS
              to contribute more to safeguard our defence and security. While NS
              is a national duty, more can be done to help national servicemen
              manage their other commitments to family, education and work.</p>
              <p><br> “I believe in the importance of NS. However, I feel that I may lag
              behind in studies and employment after serving NS.”</p>
              <p><br> “During in-camp training, while my wife has to work extra hard to
              look after our home and family, she understands that what I do
              keeps them safe.”</p>

              our country.”</p>
              <p><br> “There should be better societal perception of NS. I have witnessed
              in other countries how they respect their soldiers. It makes a
              difference.”</p>
              <p><br> While national servicemen carry out their duties without expecting
              something in return, greater community support and societal
              appreciation will motivate them to serve with honour and pride. We
              should consider more ways to recognise their contributions but not
              erode the significance of NS as a national duty.</p>
              <p><br> “NS is a duty that we perform proudly without expecting anything in
              return. I am confident that the next generation will serve with
              pride and conviction.”</p>
              <p><br> “The current recognition measures for NSmen are good, and more can
              be done in that direction to show appreciation for our
              service.”</p>

              <p><br> “I am heartened that the SAF has taken great effort to introduce
              safety measures to ensure that risks are minimised during
              training.”</p>
              <p><br> We can always find better ways to make NS more efficient and
              effective. We need to use technology that can multiply our efforts
              in view of Singapore’s scarce manpower resource. We must also
              ensure that national servicemen train safely in a realistic
              environment. Good leadership and effective communication are
              essential to keep national servicemen motivated and engaged. This
              will strengthen unit cohesion and resilience.</p>

              <p>“I remember that my commanders were inspiring and
              well-respected. They became like my big brothers and we worked well

              <h3><strong>National Service - a critical need, a solemn duty and a
              shared responsibility</strong></h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>National Service (NS) is the cornerstone of Singapore's defence.
              Our National Servicemen are the backbone of Singapore's defence.
               With our small population, NS is the only way for Singapore
              to maintain a strong and credible defence force to protect our
              independence and sovereignty.</p>
              <p>NS is a rite of passage, a national effort and a shared
              responsibility. The commitment of our National Servicemen to
              defence is not possible without the strong support from their
              families, friends and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/nsmatters/employers/support_for_employers.html"><strong>employers</strong></a>.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The NS Journey</strong></p>
              <p>Our National Servicemen serve in a variety of operational roles
              in the SAF, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore
              Civil Defence Force (SCDF).</p>
              <p>The NS journey comprises 2 years of full-time NS and 10 years of
              Operationally Ready NS (ORNS). This is the time needed to train our
              Servicemen so that they are proficient in military skills and are
              operationally ready, both as individuals and as part of a cohesive
              fighting unit.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Understanding our National Servicemen</strong></p>
              <p>As far as possible, we try to help our Servicemen balance their
              personal plans and persuits - in education, career and family, with
              their NS commitments, without compromising training and operational
              readiness.     </p>
              <p>For example, with improvements to technology and training
              methods, the SAF has been able to reduce the duration of full-time
              NS from 2 1/2 years to 2 years (2004) without sacrificing training
              standards.  Similarly, in 2006, we reduced the duration of
              Operationally Ready NS (ORNS) from 13 years to 10 years.</p>
              <p>For In-Camp Trainings (ICTs), while we cannot accede to every
              request for deferment, commanders do try to exercise flexibility to
              help NSmen meet their civilian obligations without sacrificing the
              training of the unit.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Going beyond the call of duty</strong></p>
              <p>Many National Servicemen have gone beyond the call of duty
              because of their strong belief and commitment to National Defence
              and their fellow National Servicemen.  For example, a number
              have volunteered under the Voluntary Extension of Service (VES)
              scheme to extend their full-time NS to serve their unit beyond the
              2 years.  Under the Reservist On Voluntary Extended Reserve
              Service (ROVERS) scheme, NSmen have volunteered for ICTs beyond
              their 10-year training cycle.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Recognising our National Servicemen</strong></p>
              <p>What our National Serviceman does is vital to the peace and
              prosperity we enjoy as Singaporeans. A price cannot be put to their
              contributions. </p>
              <p>But to show our appreciation, we have instituted several
              measures to let them know that we recognise the personal sacrifices
              they have made for all of us.</p>

              <p>From 12 July to 15 September 2013, the Institute of Policy 
                  Studies (IPS) conducted an independent study on Singaporeans' views on 
                  National Service commissioned by the Committee to Strengthen National 
                  Service (CSNS).</p>
              <p>Over 1,200 Singapore citizens from a variety of 
                  backgrounds, such as age, race, gender and employment, were surveyed. 
                  The full results of IPS' study on "Singaporeans' attitudes to NS" can be
                   found at the <a href="http://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/ips/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/NS-study-8-Oct-2013_web.pdf">IPS website</a>. The key survey findings are highlighted as follows:</p>
              <p>There is strong support for NS from Singaporeans with 98% of 
                  respondents acknowledging that NS is crucial for national defence, which
                   in turn secures Singapore's peace and prosperity. Singaporeans found NS
                   important for instilling discipline, values, as well as transforming 
                  boys to men. In addition, Singaporeans found that NS was important for 
                  nation building and fostering a unique Singaporean identity.</p>

                  taking into account their NS commitments, while 2 out of 5 NSmen
