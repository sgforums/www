              <p>well if such a thing is already making you depressed .... obviously, you do not have the mental fortitude to lead men into combat. It's a good thing that you didn't end up in any of the command schools. I suppose somehow it all works out in the SAF. </p>
              <p>hopefully, what remains of the two years would imbue some emotional maturity and mental strength in you.</p>

              <p>Trust me, if you are not hallucinating auditory voices and you are saying you are,it is as good as manlingering. And you know the consequences of that. <br><br>Please DO NOT insult mental patients by faking as one of them. Thanks.<br><br>Seriously, life as a man or spec in the unit have not much difference. You may see on the surface being a spec is better off, but you do not see the shit they get behind the scenes. I am very interested in how your parents think. Even being a regular 'farmer' commander doesnt make anyone more special.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day life still need to go on. If you need to see your MO or whoever go ahead. Two same person can enter the same unit and vocation and can come out with very different experiences. If you can't change your situation, then make the best out of it. I am sure, it would not be as worse as you fear to think it will be.</p>

              <p>No, seriously. Ask yourself: who gave you those expectations?
              Did your friends and parents tell you that you must be a commander?
              Did they tell you that you will be any less of a man if you don't
              get stripes or bars?</p>
              <p>This is not far off the truth especially your last statement.
              Not all parents are as relaxed with their children as you think.
              The burden on my heart is immense.</p>
              <p>while i think that your suggestin to talk to a commander (which
              would HAVE to be my bmtc commanders) is a useful one, i really do
              feel that talking to a psychiatrist or some specialist would be
              more helpful for me..</p>
              <p>i really cannot face this shit. heart is beating like crazy and
              i can still hear voices..</p>
              <p>if i genuinely can hear voices every few minutes, should i seek
              professional help or suck it up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>mr fudgester, with all due respect, are you an s1 officer/chief
              clerk and are you the one who edited the topic? can you explain the
              whole topic because it doesnt make sense. it would seem that you
              are implying the appeal process doesnt exist..</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No, I did not edit the topic; that was the work of one of my fellow moderators.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you something: did all your friends and parents seriously tell you that they would look down on you, ostracize you, and mock you for not going into a command position? </p>
              <p>You're telling me that your parents will no longer love you as their son because you can't have three stripes or one chocolate bar on your chest? I am willing to take a chance and say that you are simply blowing things out of proportion.  </p>
              <p>Even if they did.... whose life are you living, and whose expectations are you meeting? Theirs, or yours? Are you living your own life to the best of your expectations, or theirs? People can only dictate to you what you should do with your life if you allow them to do so.</p>
              <p>And honestly, even if what you say is all true, then how do you want to stand up to the rigours and responsibilities of being a commander if you can't stand up to others and just say no?</p>
              <p>You cannot change your circumstances in the SAF, but you can change your <em>approach</em> to those circumstances. By all means, approach a commander whom you trust, or call the SAF helpline and talk to a counsellor if it can make you feel better.</p>

              <p>This is just part of life, sometimes, you just don't get want you want, even you try to your best to change, keng, watever you do.</p>
              <p>And yes, SAF is one of those things in life, you can't do sh*t about it.  I like to think of SAF is one of those road blocks in life that "wake up your idea" that life is not smooth sailing.</p>
              <p>It teaches one to get the best outcome in a sh*tty situation that you can't change, who knows it might be a skill worth acquiring eh.</p>

              <p>I just started reading this topic as it got featured on the frontpage of SGForums.  I had not formed any opinion YET until I read your above post.  This is only my opinion and please understand that I'm not trying to flame you.</p>
              <p>Searching for the answer to your question above is probably as easy as going to mindef.gov.sg and then poking around for the info.  Or go to streetdirectory.com and do a search.  But, instead you chose to make a post here and wait for the answer to be fed to you.  Not sure I want someone who is indecisive and who does not take the initiative to be my section leader. </p>
              <p>Just my $0.02, and my apology if you feel offended.</p>

              <p>sect 2ic in a infantry sect also not bad. in war if your 3sg die, you will be leading the section.</p>
              <p>its not where you are posted to, its what you can make full use of what you got posted to that matters.</p>
              <p>think about it, you go mdc, fuck it up, when u ord and look back, you will think that you are a fuck up musician.</p>
              <p>and then think about if you go infantry coy, you get ippt gold, sect 2ic, popular among your platoon, when you ord get CFC, your CO personally praise you for the effort put in over the 2 years during ORD parade.</p>
