              <p>now i know that i posted a while back, saying join band lah, join mdc lah.</p>
              <p>Well now i've been posted to one of the SIR contingents as a rifleman, and almost my entire company has gone to sispec or ocs.</p>
              <p>the reason for this is i ticked no to command school - so you can feel free to criticise me for this, saying 'live with your choice lah'. fine. feel free to do so.</p>
              <p>now that ive been posted to rifleman (which i have done my research on) seeing all my friends (yes all) go scs as INF LDR is making me very very depressed.</p>
              <p>i feel that i have let my parents down, i feel that i have let my friends down by not being able to live up to either of their expectations.</p>
              <p>is there any way in hell to revocate to sispec? i feel if not i may have to see a psychiatrist. my heart is beating like crazy and i am feeling very anxious and nervous, and i feel very depressed and starting to hear voices like 'why did you tick no' and 'you let your parents down'. my father was an officer and now i cant face him and tell him that i didnt manage to go to command school.</p>
              <p>my medic friend tells me he sees a lot of people who try to down pes or chao keng once they get into their unit - and here i am faced with the same situation.</p>
              <p>please help.. what are my options?</p>

              <p>Talk about your feelings with a commander you can trust. Go get it all off your chest.</p>

              <p>This is not far off the truth especially your last statement. Not all parents are as relaxed with their children as you think. The burden on my heart is immense.</p>
              <p>while i think that your suggestin to talk to a commander (which would HAVE to be my bmtc commanders) is a useful one, i really do feel that talking to a psychiatrist or some specialist would be more helpful for me..</p>
              <p>i really cannot face this shit. heart is beating like crazy and i can still hear voices..</p>
              <p>if i genuinely can hear voices every few minutes, should i seek professional help or suck it up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>mr fudgester, with all due respect, are you an s1 officer/chief clerk and are you the one who edited the topic? can you explain the whole topic because it doesnt make sense. it would seem that you are implying the appeal process doesnt exist..</p>

              <p>i know i've ticked the wrong box, and it seems like a brick wall that no argument can penetrate. but i know i did my leadership during sit test as best as i could even though i told the officer i didnt want to go command school (because saf band was my dream) and i got silver for ippt, fail soc, marksman, did my iq test to the very best of my ability.</p>
              <p>i guess i didnt expect to go rifleman..</p>
              <p>and now i'm looking for a way out. the way out is laced with desperation now.. because this is the worst choice i have made in my life, and it SEEMS there is no way back to command school or revocation..</p>

              <p>Well i guess u ticked no it's becos u assumed u'll get into band and mdc for sure. Now got fark up, you are trying to escape. Btw even u tick the correct box what made u think that u sure goes to SISPEC or OCS for sure. Face it up like a man.......ask yourself why did u do during the test that let your PCs and OC decide that u did not even qualified for SISPEC and OCS or some other courses like medic, signaller etc etc in the 1st place...</p>

              <p>thank you terminator hitman.</p>
              <p>i think out of all the replies yours has been the most useful.</p>
              <p>really appreciate your input. and i will try and see what i can do from here.</p>
              <p>re: flamers esp the one above.</p>
              <p>stfu. this isnt a flame session. you are examples of the typical singaporean. selfish. name calling.  you arent helping anyone with your comments. what do you expect to gain?</p>
              <p>is it better to mope about one's situation or be resourceful and try and improve it?</p>
              <p>you answer that question yourself.</p>
