              <p>Are you trying to help him to go further downgrade/keng, or perhaps you should ask him to face the problem like a man. You expect people like this to defend the country? You have to admit, the TS is now depressed becos he did not get into  MDC and in the end also cannot go into SISPEC or OCS like most of his peers and ended up in as a man in the infantry, which he's kinda of afraid. We can advice him way to revocate but that does not mean he'll sure be revocated. So rather than giving him false hope, I would rather he faced it like those who got into rifleman as well to be fair to riflemen out there.</p>

              <p>Things like music/drama, band, SAFSA usually the coach will source for the men. So if TS did not get it, he did not get in. </p>
              <p>If he do music/drama, and have been preforming WELL on stage, do you think the coach will not know him? Even the "fans" knows him. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually being a riflemen, is not that bad, (it is bad as an armyboy compare to armyclerk) but he is fit so there is no choice. Being a riflemen, it is easier to downgrade as you are expendable anyway, unlike key appointment holder. And many of my friends who are riflemen in 3 guards and 1 SIR are doing well in the outside world now.</p>
              <p>Riflemen  are siong, but they also have much block leave and off. They are very siong, when siong, but they are also very slack, when slack. So overall, not that bad. </p>

              <p>Most likely he failed the audition or something. So rather then giving him false hope, I would him face the life of a rifleman. If not, he can go try going OOC, but what makes you think going OOC will let him revocate. Revocating is quite troublesome in SAF, this involve medical reason, if not everyone don't like the vocation go speak with the S1 or Chief Clerk then they'll be very bo eng.....</p>
