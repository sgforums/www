            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Another reason told to me for LTA X's lighter punishment was that it is in light of the work he has done for the battalion, I feel this is unacceptable for several reasons. Firstly in our country we do not mitigate punishments based on past achievements, Durai was not excused despite the amount of money he helped NKF raise, and a doctor would not be excused from molestation no matter how many lives he has helped save.</blockquote><blockquote>While some might say this is just a small matter, a story of a single bad officer, the fact that it was not dealt with more severely is indicative of a bigger problem. It shows the lack of quality control being practiced for the leaders of the SAF. The following quote was taken from the army's own intranet homepage:<br><br>"In the 3rd Generation SAF, the quality and commitment of our people will continue to be the most important determinant for advancement" - Member of Parliament Ms Indranee Rajah</blockquote><blockquote>While I may only be a 2nd lieutenant, I am a citizen of this country. And as a citizen I have the right to demand high standards from the leaders of the SAF While it is true that high standards are hard to come by and even harder to enforce, for such events to come to light and yet nothing be done about it is to say the very least, unacceptable and disappointing.</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>so cute..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Question...will our Celeb. Officer get banged for skipping the COC and going straight to the higher-ups only? Because as Gedaken mentioned and after reading the email twice, he mentioned that he gt a call from the LTA that he will be coming to relieve him, but why did he leave his post? Also, will he be given time for leaving before being relieved?<br><br>IMHO, if it were to add credibility to his case and show that he's an exemplary officer, he should have not left his post and stayed there all the way till the other guy arrives. And report the matter to the OC via both verbally, email and in print. Sometimes, do things have to protect backside...if OC cover swee swee for the LTA, and still buay song, go up to CO and repeat the procedure. This way, he would have built a case that is solid and iron-clad.</div>
