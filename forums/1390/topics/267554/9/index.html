            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by blitzonic:</div><div class="quote_body">Wow, what a hornet's next. My own comments:-<br><br>- So Li turned out to be a whistleblower after all, like Dharmendra Yadav said. That explains all the positive feedback at those blog sites. I'd recognized Yadav, from the 2nd link posted yesterday. He's a corporate lawyer for NTUC Income &amp; also writes articles for TODAY, Sintercom &amp; Think Centre. No way he would anyhow hantam bola.<br><br>- Disagree with the person who insinuated it's a "small matter." Fact is, a few hundred men already knew about it, since the CO assembled the whole SIG BN for a scolding. (Gossip or not, with Li's familial ties, it would've only been a matter of time for them to find out who the instigator was.) Compounding matters, Li was tactless enough to write to various other SAF commanders, further amplifying the matter but on different food chains. In other words, this wasn't a case of a LCP seeking redress from his Member of Parliament &amp; then the CO ordered a BN parade for a tekan session. Rather, this was a commissioned officer who, righteous or not, pulled off a Chee Soon Juan-style publicity stunt.<br><br>- I'm quite surprised Li got away with only a reprimand. Not so much disobeying the General Orders, which is a set of expedient regulations promulgated when needed anyway. Neither do I think he's chargeable for going AWOL (he actually wasn't on duty when there was no DO). Rather, I reckon he should've been put on trial for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">improper handover of duty </span> -- but even then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> cuz he'd already disrupted his NS &amp; hence no way to discipline him internally with extra duties. From what I know of others who ORDed with customary charges hanging over their heads, the punishment for Li would've been a fine (once he reported back).<br><br>- I'm more perturbed to learn that the other "supervisory officers" only got similar slaps on their wrists. There were mentions of duty personnel, but doesn't the unit have a duty BOS too, i.e. a senior NCO equivalent assigned for those days? If he/they didn't do his/their jobs, where's the accountability?</div></blockquote>Makes perfect sense.<br><br>Looking at how this and some of the more recent SAF cases have been handled, one would really wonder who's in charge of the system - betting odds most strongly favour Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and the Three Stooges.</div>

Strictly speaking there's no such thing as manslaughter in the Singapore Penal Code - it's culpable homicide not amounting to murder.<br><br>Actually, I've just looked into it after making that offhand comment, and it's a bit weird.<br><br>Section 299 of the Penal Code (you can find it at http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/) defines culpable homicide as: "Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.".<br><br>On the other hand, an exception in Section 300 states: "Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident".<br><br>In the first case, you have to intend to cause death or injury leading to death for it to count as culpable homicide.  In the second case, if you didn't intend to cause death, it's not murder but it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> culpable homicide.<br><br>WTF?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>By the looks of it, if someone didn't want to charge you with culpable homicide, they'd look at section 299, but if they wanted to charge you with culpable homicide, they'd look at section 300.  Law's a severely f*cked up business.<br><br>The self-defence exceptions seem to be covered by:<br><br>"Compulsion by threats Â– If it is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence. The exception does not apply to murder and offences against the State punishable with death" and;<br><br>"Private defence Â– If it is done in the exercise of the right of private defence".<br><br>"Act done without criminal intent to prevent other harm Â– If, merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, it is done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property".<br><br>I don't know how much good these exceptions will do you if you get a bloodthirsty judge who doesn't want to be convinced that they apply.</div>

Unlike the common "ORD letters" that you read, this letter unfortunately cannot be as cheerful. I am using this last opportunity to issue a letter of complaint against the quality control of officers in the SAF, more specifically against LTA X. During my time as his subordinate, LTA X was AWOL on at least 2 counts, attempted bribery, and lied to his subordinates and his superior officer. The battalion HQ has effectively given no punishment, and has not even made these infractions known to the rest of the battalion.<br><br>Let me first give you some background. I am the ____ ____ platoon commander from __________. In order to maintain operational readiness my duties are performed at _____ camp where our ops bus and servers are instead of at stagmont camp where our battalion is. The company is structured like so<br><br>OC<br>|<br>Centre Head<br>|<br>PC<br><br>The duties are therefore shared between the PC's, PS', and the Centre Head. LTA X is the centre head of the __________.<br><br>LTA X, was originally supposed to be on duty at _____ Camp as the duty commander for the _______ on the 20th and 22nd of April, a Friday and Sunday respectively. I was on duty on the 21st of April that Saturday, to minimize the changing over, I contacted him and asked if he would like to swap duties for the Saturday and Sunday. To this he agreed, and thus he was to be on duty on the 20th and 21st of April.<br><br>On the Friday however, LTA X called to inform me that he was busy during the day, and if I could cover for him until the evening. To this I agreed to do so. At about 1600 hours, I received a call from LTA X, informing me that he was on the way and that I could leave first, thought this would result in a time where there would be no duty commander in camp, he informed me that this had already be cleared with our OC. I therefore left camp.<br><br>On Sunday the 22nd of April I arrived back in camp to take over duty from LTA X. After he had left camp the men informed me that he had not arrived in camp on Friday at all, and that he only arrived in camp at 1800 hours on Saturday the 21st of April. On Saturday they had tried to contact him to ask his whereabouts, to which he told them that he was in fact in _____ in ______ camp getting some work done. The men contacted their counterparts in ______ camp to verify this, however no one in______ camp had seen LTA X. 1 further confirmed with the ______ duty personnel on Saturday that none of them had seen LTA X, this was also with confirmed with that day's BDO.<br></div>
