Li's duty was on Sunday and his friend's duty was Friday and Saturday.  Li's friend Awol'ed on friday and came back Sat.  Li was just goodhearted to help cover his friend's ass on friday.<br><br>If you have done DO duties you will know that most officers are quite relax people and just ask their friends to stand-in for them when they are not around.  It's quite common and done off-the-record.  The correct way is to let the CO's PA know and change the RO for the day.<br><br>For those that still do not understand.  The name of the officer on duty on friday was Li's friend NOT Li.<br><br></div>
