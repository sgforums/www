The case involving Li Hongyi has served as a lightning rod for criticism on the internet of his familyÂ’s political power.<br><br>The defence ministry said on Friday it had issued the reprimand against Mr Li, 20, after his 2,000-word letter of complaint was posted on the internet and drew widespread attention.<br><br>Mr Li, a 2nd lieutenant, is the first-born son of Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister, and Ho Ching, head of Temasek Holdings, the state investment company, and grandson of Lee Kuan Yew, independent Singapore's first leader.<br><br>The letter provoked complaints on the internet about the Lee family's political dominance in Singapore.<br><br>Â“No ordinary OCT [officer cadet trainee] would dare to write such a letter addressed to all the big guns in the [defence] ministry,Â” read one posting on an internet political chatroom.<br><br>The internet has emerged as a forum for political criticism of the government in a country where the media is guided by the state.<br><br>Mr Li, who is doing his compulsory military service, sent the e-mail last month to Teo Chee Hean, the defence minister, senior military leaders and other army personnel complaining that a colleague had gone absent without leave on two occasions but that no action had been taken by his superiors.<br><br>The defence ministry said that Mr Li had gone outside the chain of command Â“by broadcasting his letter of complaint to many other servicemen Â– almost all of whom were neither directly under his command, nor in an official capacity where they could deal with the matters contained in his letter of complaintÂ”.<br><br>Much of the internet criticism commented on suggestions that Mr Li was apparently being groomed for a future leadership role after being awarded a government scholarship to study economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br><br>The Singapore military has served as a training ground for political leaders and executives in state companies. Mr LiÂ’s father was a brigadier general before entering politics. Temasek announced last week that a former head of the Singapore armed forces had been appointed to the newly created post of portfolio management managing director.<br><br>In his complaint letter, Mr Li said his colleagueÂ’s continued service in the military was an Â“embarrassmentÂ” and that the armed forces was Â“not a charity organisation and does not owe anyone a careerÂ”.<br><br>The defence ministry said that the officer accused by Mr Li had since been court martialled.<br><br></div></blockquote>wondered if e whole situation wld b e same if a young hot-blooded, self righteous 2lt who is not a white horse did it instead of him... i mean e news is even covered in financial times? haha well done 2lt li!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The people to pity in the case are the 2 superior officers whom our celeb. officer has complained to the about that officer going AWOL. Now tio condemned...henta kaki cepat henta already. Good Game...</blockquote>Huh? Those two are the morons who looked the other way when there was a serial AWOL officer in their unit. They're lucky to get only warning letters! Talk about the SAF taking care of its own...<br><br><blockquote>I think need to clarify something here, his punishment was "reprimand". This is different from the scolding that it normally means. A reprimand in military law terms is a defined punishment more serious than your normal extras. It is recorded and will affect military careers. </blockquote>Good point &amp;, to keep the reprimand in context, the consequence of Li's action (reporting misconduct) will override his intention (honorable or not) as well as the punishment itself. He can always claim this, whenever asked what happened.<br><br>*Muses* Tough to judge whistleblowing acts, something that can never be unambiguous -- partly why I think the Govt hesitates in enacting any "blanket" protection law. Opinions about them are often irreconcilable, depending on one's prejudice. The chatter here &amp; elsewhere reflect so: Li is either a selfless martyr (hero), or a selfish backstabber (no comeuppence).<br><br>The SAF better learn from this. Stressing COC is one thing but, with the Internet influence nowadays, external whistleblowing cannot be managed like before (a REC complaining to his Tekong OO, or a PTE to his constituency MP). The fallout over the Commando/Hu Enhuai case already bore witness.<br><br><blockquote>so wat? in e end he still got away wif a verbal warning only... i tink he deserved to b punished more...</blockquote>For contravening MINDEF General Orders, it's hard to say. Those regulations are restricted info, we dunno what the exact charge was, &amp; what its recommended punishment is.<br><br>Still think Li should've been indicted for improper handover of duty. (Maybe he was, but it wasn't reported. Can any lurkers from the SIG BN confirm?) Discussed this with my brother last nite over family dinner. Although a RSAF LTC, he's got experience as a camp commandant so I don't believe he was BS-ing me. Based on the email details, his view was that any AWOL charge wouldn't have stick on Li, &amp; which the SAF must've concurred post-investigations. Ditto any on the duty BOS or equivalent (if there was one), since there was different witnesses vouching that LTA X deceived them about being physically inside the camp.<br><br>He saw my point about improper handover, though, but didn't think Li's offense was court martial-able like LTA X's was. To him, a summary trial was adequate, as long as the presiding disciplinary officer is 2 ranks higher. Detention or demotion was too harsh, but one of the more minor penalties (fine, reprimand or extra duties) would've suffice.<br><br>But Li wasn't hauled up on any such charge. The SAF disciplined him for broadcasting his complaint to non-relevant personnel instead.<br><br><blockquote>would the PSC/Admin Service give 2 hoots? ....would MIT care about his military record? </blockquote>Note, all he said was "affect military careers". But to respond: Yes, the PSC shall care since Li's on their scholarship; I expect them to review his case unfavorably, but only to put him on probation or something. (Get real, people, a white horse like him still kena charged already.) No, outside entities like MIT won't care, or even know, if there was no media publicity. Only those in sensitive industries like aeroplane, maritime or security, etc. need to conduct such background checks; otherwise it's per what you declare on your resume (&amp; suffer any consequences accordingly).</div>
