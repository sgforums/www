These include discharge from service, detention in the SAF detention barracks, a reduction in rank, forfeiture of seniority, fines and reprimand.<br><br>Mindef issued the statement yesterday in response to media queries about the Internet chatter on 2nd Lt Li's e-mail.<br><br>Several sites were abuzz with details of the e-mail and comments on how the authorities would respond.<br><br>Col Lim stressed that the SAF takes a serious view of misconduct by any serviceman.<br><br>'To maintain organisational discipline, all SAF servicemen with complaints or grievances should take them up through proper channels for redress, to ensure due process and to protect confidential information.<br><br>'All complaints which are not anonymous are investigated and dealt with properly.'<br><br>2nd Lt Li, who is the third of PM Lee's four children, has received a Public Service Commission scholarship to study economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. </blockquote></div>
