Li was NOT on duty at all.  Li's duty was on Sunday and his friend's duty was Friday and Saturday.  Li's friend Awol'ed on friday and came back Sat.  Li was just goodhearted to help cover his friend's ass on friday.<br><br>If you have done DO duties you will know that most officers are quite relax people and just ask their friends to stand-in for them when they are not around.  It's quite common and done off-the-record.  The correct way is to let the CO's PA know and change the RO for the day.<br><br>For those that still do not understand.  The name of the officer on duty on friday was Li's friend NOT Li.<br><br></div></blockquote>As quoted from Li's email:<br><br>"On the Friday however, LTA X called to inform me that he was busy during the day, and <span style="color: blue;">if I could cover for him until the evening. To this I agreed to do so.</span> At about 1600 hours, I received a call from LTA X, informing me <span style="color: red;">that he was on the way and that I could leave first, thought this would result in a time where there would be no duty commander in camp</span>, <span style="color: darkred;">he informed me that this had already be cleared with our OC. I therefore left camp</span>."<br><br>He had agreed to stand in and take responsibility as the duty commander for that period of time.<br><br>How could he leave on the words of "I am on the way, you may go off now"? Since there would be no duty commander in the camp, who would be around to handle emergencies? Or have soldiers nowadays taken security for granted?<br><br>The point of whether it was his rostered duty or not does not matter. Fact was, if he had left, (which he did), there would be no duty commander till the "LTA arrived".<br><br>I assume you have done DO duties before. Hence, how can you say that Li "left on the orders of his superior" and justify it?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>On the Friday however, LTA X called to inform me that he was busy during the day, and if I could cover for him until the evening. To this I agreed to do so. <strong>At about 1600 hours, I received a call from LTA X, informing me that he was on the way and that I could leave first</strong>, thought this would result in a time where there would be no duty commander in camp, he informed me that this had already be cleared with our OC. I therefore left camp.</blockquote>1) Does 2LT Li's early departure constitute AWOL when in this case, he has been granted permission by his superior, LTA X to do so?<br><br>While under no circumstances he should leave his post until somebody took over from him. In this case, perhaps this should be regarded as a negligence of duty instead?<br><br>2) As a young 2LT, he does have plenty to learn about SAF. In this case, if he feels that the OC has not been doing his job, the next superior to seek is the CO at the next higher command rather than going straight to the top brass of Mindef. So for his charge and reprimand in circulating the email, it is perhaps the most appropriate action to be taken against him.<br><br><blockquote>I have been informed that LTA X was to be given 10 extra duties, though this may be considered an extremely light punishment there is a further problem. To date, which is to say, 2 months from the incidents, none of the duties have been published in the battalion RO, in addition, LTA X has not served any of the extra duties he was supposedly awarded. In addition, this system of leniency is not consistent throughout the battalion, or even the company. The following was published in the RO on 1 1th of June 2007:<br><br>SXXXXXXXX CPL _____ ________ Non-compliance with a lawful duty or order. stoppage of Leave for 7 days<br><br>This was the punishment for CPL ______ for leaving camp an hour before he was supposed to. This was published less than a week after his infringement. If you were to calculate the time AWOL alone, LTA X was missing for a minimum of over 20 hours. This does not take into the account the fact that he repeated the crime less than a week after being reprimanded the first time. This does not take into account the lying to his superior officer. This does not take into account the fact that he is an officer, and thus should be even more liable than corporal.</blockquote>I salute him in his courage to stand up for something which he feels that it is not right. An officer who has committed the same offence as with a WOSE, the punishment should at bare minimum be similar but definitely not lighter and it should be carried out with immediate effect.</div>

You just went on secondary data (i.e. TODAY) instead of primary data (i.e. Li's email) and then wrung your hands, jogged on tiptoe on the spot and kept chanting "Slander". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Okay, I'll drop all sarcasm.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, what a hornet's next. My own comments:-<br><br>- So Li turned out to be a whistleblower after all, like Dharmendra Yadav said. That explains all the positive feedback at those blog sites. I'd recognized Yadav, from the 2nd link posted yesterday. He's a corporate lawyer for NTUC Income &amp; also writes articles for TODAY, Sintercom &amp; Think Centre. No way he would anyhow hantam bola.<br><br>- Disagree with the person who insinuated it's a "small matter." Fact is, a few hundred men already knew about it, since the CO assembled the whole SIG BN for a scolding. (Gossip or not, with Li's familial ties, it would've only been a matter of time for them to find out who the instigator was.) Compounding matters, Li was tactless enough to write to various other SAF commanders, further amplifying the matter but on different food chains. In other words, this wasn't a case of a LCP seeking redress from his Member of Parliament &amp; then the CO ordered a BN parade for a tekan session. Rather, this was a commissioned officer who, righteous or not, pulled off a Chee Soon Juan-style publicity stunt.<br><br>- I'm quite surprised Li got away with only a reprimand. Not so much disobeying the General Orders, which is a set of expedient regulations promulgated when needed anyway. Neither do I think he's chargeable for going AWOL (he actually wasn't on duty when there was no DO). Rather, I reckon he should've been put on trial for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">improper handover of duty </span> -- but even then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> cuz he'd already disrupted his NS &amp; hence no way to discipline him internally with extra duties. From what I know of others who ORDed with customary charges hanging over their heads, the punishment for Li would've been a fine (once he reported back).<br><br>- I'm more perturbed to learn that the other "supervisory officers" only got similar slaps on their wrists. There were mentions of duty personnel, but doesn't the unit have a duty BOS too, i.e. a senior NCO equivalent assigned for those days? If he/they didn't do his/their jobs, where's the accountability?</div>

Kanena so hiong ah!<br><br>Lawrence say he scared kena MSD call him go aircon room lim kopi, so he delete all the unit name and people name. ****er always so kia see.<br><br>I read the lancheow email, wah lao eh! So long ah! Must be scholar NSF write one, write until so long the email. Is like story book like that! I take so long to read because the ******* Lawrence put so many blank here blank there, and the PM son use a lot of ****ing big word, make me take 2 hour to read finish. But after reading the long mother story email, it look like the LTA X quite the kwai lan, keep siam the DO duty, call people cover him, AWOL, nabei what kind of ****ed up regular is this officer?<br><br>(Actually, how come the LTA name is call X? I never hear before people got this kind of name X? He think he is some tua kee pop star issit? Call himself X)<br><br>This LTA X also stupid one. Want to tua also don't tua the son of the Dragon Prince Prime Minister lah. Never use his ******* brain. Now Hong Kan by Hong Yi liao lor!<br><br>If I am a sign-on officer and I am together same unit as the prime minister son, I not only wun slack, I will be more on the ball than the chief of army ok? I will aim to be ****ing Best Sword of honour medal winner officer of the Whole Singapore! Wait he open his mouth at the dinner table tell his PM father I am a cho bo lan officer how?<br><br>I agree with PM son say the officer standard is ******* standard. Drop a lot from my time liao. You ask me, what is a good officer?<br><br>A good officer is the kind who know how to take cover and don't kena caught! Hahahahaha!!!!<br><br>This LTA not only dunno how to take cover, he try to eat snake IN FRONT OF THE PM SON! Stupid until cannot stupid liao!<br><br>The OC of the LTA and the PM son is another ****ed up regular ocifer.<br><br>I tell you, regular always protect regular backside one. That is why in the army got so many ****ed up officer, and lazy, no -use NCO who after hide inside the army so long, eat sleep talk idle, when they come out to normal working world cannot get any job.<br><br>The PM son already tell you, oi! this LTA is a mother ****er. You never punish him because want to protect his regular backside. Now see lah! Sure the OC also will kena poke backside liao. Charge until ka chng peet! See how far his army career go now.

Means you small fish must complain to your small fish OC first, then your small fish OC tell his small fish CO, then your CO tell his wife, and go to sleep.<br><br>If you or me send this kind of email, and send to so many ****er, we sure kena charge until our lampah drop.
